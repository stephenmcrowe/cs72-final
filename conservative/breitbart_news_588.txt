Reebok, an apparel brand owned by Adidas, ended its business partnership with CrossFit following the fitness company’s CEO mocking a declaration of “racism” as “a public health issue.” The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, an organization located at the University of Washington and funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, tweeted on Saturday that “racism is a public health issue.” Greg Glassman, CrossFit’s CEO, responded via Twitter, “It’s FLOYD-19.” It's FLOYD-19. — Greg Glassman (@CrossFitCEO) June 6, 2020  After Glassman’s tweet, Business Insider sought a response from Reebok. Business Insider described the tweet as “controversial,” “tone-deaf,” “racist,” and “insensitive.” Business Insider obtained a response from Reebok via a statement: “Recently, we have been in discussions regarding a new agreement, however, in light of recent events, we have made the decision to end our partnership with CrossFit HQ. We will fulfill our remaining contractual obligations in 2020. We owe this to the CrossFit Games competitors, fans and the community.” Reebok aligned itself with the Black Lives Matter campaign. Its website currently has an animated banner with the following message: Without the Black community, Reebok would not exist. America would not exist. We are not asking you to buy our shoes. We are asking you to walk in someone else’s. To Stand in solidarity. To find our common ground of HUMANITY. In May of 2019, CrossFit criticized Facebook’s arbitrary censorship practices. The company declared it would “no longer support or use Facebook’s services until further notice.” The company also stopped using Facebook-owned Instagram and WhatsApp platforms. CrossFit is an exercise and fitness brand that licenses its trademark to partnered gyms. The company’s business model also sells training certifications and sponsors the CrossFit Games, an annual athletic fitness competition. It was estimated to have a $4 billion valuation by Forbes in 2017. Follow Robert Kraychik on Twitter @rkraychik.

An activist at the Black Lives Matter protest in London on June 7th was filmed and pictured attempted to set fire to the flags which adorn the Cenotaph, the United Kingdom’s national war memorial. The Cenotaph — “empty tomb” — was dedicated the memory of “The Glorious Dead” in the wake of the First World War, and is the focus of ceremonies honouring the fallen from throughout the British Isles and the former British Empire, of all colours, at several points during the year, Its vandalisation with “BLM” graffiti on June 6th — the anniversary of the D-Day landings — while many veterans remained unable to attend memorial ceremonies due the coronavirus lockdown, caused considerable public upset, and this escalation of the efforts to desecrate it are likely to inflame feeling still further.

Mea culpa: I spent a lot of time on these here digital pages defending Dr. Anthony Fauci. Brother, was I wrong. Fauci is a stone-cold liar. And if he’s not a stone-cold liar, his only defense is that he is a fraud. Either way, shame on him … and me. For months Fauci has been everywhere, all over TV, urging Americans to lock themselves down, to abandon their jobs, their sick and dying family members, the small businesses they spent their lives getting off the ground; he urged us to drive our economy into the dirt, pull children who desperately need structure out of school, forgo once-in-a-lifetime graduations and graduation parties, cancel weddings and vacations… Fauci’s message was clear, militant, terrifying, and relentless: If you don’t do these things, if you don’t sacrifice these things, if you don’t give up your liberty and prosperity, you are no better than a serial killer. The coronavirus is a unique and deadly killer, a particularly infectious and fatal disease unlike anything we’ve seen in more than a century. And because Fauci became America’s trusted scientific (and moral) authority, because he assured us he spoke only as a scientist and infectious disease expert, because he assured us he would always tell us like it is, and do so at any cost because public health was his only priority, look at what happened… A woman was arrested for reopening the business that fed her family. Christians were persecuted for attending church in the safety of automobiles. Teens were held up to national ridicule for behaving like teens in Florida and the Ozarks. Countless Americans suffered untold anguish after hospital visits were forbidden and funerals canceled. Everyday Americans were relentlessly demonized for daring to speak out or even question the Holy Writ of Fauci… And God help those who came out to protest the lockdowns, because bitter, power-hungry tyrants such as Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI) and the hate-filled media that empower her, waved the Holy Writ of Fauci to justify smearing these Americans as racists and punishing them with lockdown extensions. Heh, heh, heh… Take that, Deplorables! All this was allowed, all the inhumanity, all the flagrant violations of our Constitutional rights, all these Kafka-esque rules that protected Big Businesses like Walmart and further empowered massive corporations like Amazon, while small business withered and died. Democrat New York Mayor Bill de Blasio was finally allowed to openly practice his antisemitism… All this was excused and even made virtuous by the Holy Writ of Fauci and the Cult of Personality he allowed to build up around his heroic fidelity to facts, science, and public health. Well, we now know Fauci is either a fraud or liar. We know this because for ten whole days Fauci said nothing as the Perfect Infection Storm hit America, as massive violations of social distancing and lockdowns took place all across the country (including the Ground Zero of new York City). There it was, everywhere… Fauci’s nightmare scenario come to vivid life: crowd after massive gathering after mob after parade… Protesters and rioters shouting, shoulder to shoulder — and Fauci said nothing… And when he did finally speak out, it was to squeak on some local radio station. Worse still, Fauci said nothing as the very same sanctimonious health care workers and “experts” who used the emotional blackmail of “We’re at work for you, stay home for us” came out in full-throated support of leaving home and gathering in massive crowds. So, which is it… Is Fauci a fraud or liar? Was all his talk about concern for public health, his duty to tell it like it is no matter the personal or political fallout, just a big lie? Is he a fraud who still believes these mass gatherings are a nightmare scenario, but is unwilling to use his massive public platform to say so out loud because shaming protesters who hold the “approved” views among America’s hideous elite would risk Fauci feeling the disapproval of those elites? Or is he a liar, does he in fact know the coronavirus is nowhere near as deadly as he played it up to be? Is he a liar who mislead us into agreeing to destroy our amazing economy in order to undermine the Bad Orange Man’s re-election? Either way, Fauci’s a sociopath. Either he’s a sociopath who furthered his political ambitions and abused his authority and public trust to talk hundreds of millions of Americans into shattering their own lives and mental wellbeing when there was no real danger, or he’s a sociopath who chooses the good opinion of elites over raising the alarm to save the lives of thousands and thousands of protesters, and the countless millions those thousands will infect. What kind of man raises the alarm about the fact the black population is disproportionately killed by this virus and then remains silent as the black population gathers en masse, and remains silent as his fellow healthcare workers openly encourage the mass gathering of black America? I’m almost as disgusted with myself for trusting Fauci as I am with him. Never again will I trust the “experts.” Fuck them. Fuck them all forever. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

The statue of wartime prime minister Sir Winston Churchill in Parliament Square has been vandalised again, with fresh graffiti branding him a “racist”. Footage shot earlier in the day shows a small band of patriots ringing the statue to protect it, surrounded by a small but growing mob baying “Churchill was a racist!” at them while police officers milled around nearby. They must have been forced to abandon their efforts at some point, however, with video published near the time of this article’s publication showing the statue festooned with protest placards, the name ‘CHURCHILL’ scored out in black spray-paint, and the words ‘Was a Racist’ scrawled underneath it. Sunday’s vandalisation is somewhat ironic, as on Saturday — when the Churchill statue was also vandalised, along with the statue of Abraham Lincoln and the Cenotaph — far-leftists were using the D-Day anniversary as an opportunity to claim Churchill and the Allied forces who stormed the shores of Normandy as “the original antifa”. Vandalising Churchill monuments in London is unlikely to be the way your political cause makes progress in #Britain. pic.twitter.com/2Cl78THtlX — Kyle Orton (@KyleWOrton) June 7, 2020  “These revolting people have Churchill to thank for being in a free country able to protest,” remarked Brexit Party chairman and entrepreneur Richard Tice on the anti-Churchill demonstrators. “Where are [Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Home Secretary Priti Patel, and Mayor Sadiq Khan] in condemning these thugs,” he demanded. Prime Minister Johnson has yet to make any remark on the violence at the ongoing Black Lives Matter protests, which saw a number of police officers injured outside his official Downing Street residence off Whitehall on Saturday, despite the fact that they fly in the face of the anti-coronavirus measures he has imposed on the wider country for months now. “Do we have a leader?” asked Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage in response to the silence. “[Boris Johnson] is supposed to be a Churchill fan, but he says and does nothing,” he observed. “He is not half the man.” These revolting people have Churchill to thank for being in a free country able to protest.

Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” former Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said transmission of coronavirus is likely to have occurred at the nationwide protests over the killing of George Floyd. Partial transcript as follows: BRENNAN: Dr. Fauci said in an interview on Friday said that these protests are a perfect setup for the spread of the virus. So even though these protesters are young and wearing masks, you believe this will ignite more of an outbreak? GOTTLIEB: Well, look, we’re certainly going to see transmission coming out of these gatherings. There’s no question about that. The prevalence in the United States of infection right now is about one in two hundred people so you can estimate how many people probably have the infection in these gatherings. I think the- the- the idea of reducing the risk from these protests is a shared responsibility. There’s steps that the protesters can take and you see many of them wearing masks in these protests and understanding the risks. There’s also things authorities can do, I think, to reduce the risks in terms of how they de-escalate these situations. The best science we have on this question comes from a recent study that came out of Germany, where there are large gatherings in Germany in a small region there, and they looked at what the spread was coming out those gatherings. Now, mind you, these were festive gatherings, but there were large outdoor gatherings nonetheless. And the science showed that there was about a two and a half times increase in the rate of transmission as a result of bringing people together in large gatherings. So we have some scientific basis to understand that these- these kinds of settings do create risk. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

White House trade advisor Peter Navarro said on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures” that he would like to see protest signs that say “China lied American died,” of coronavirus. He also acknowledged on Sunday that looters and rioters were “bad hombres” and “a pack of animals.” Navarro said, “Let’s be clear what the Chinese Communist Party is doing right now behind this crisis that they forced on the world, they’re sinking ships in the South China Sea, invading India, trying to steal our vaccines. I know I will be criticized for what I’m about to say. I would like to see one sign out there that says China lied, Americans died. The bigger context here as we struggle to get back to full economic strength is that China has a plan to take us over and take the world over. That’s not hyperbole. All you need to do is look at what they’re doing, what the reaction is. Let’s remember what they did. They spawned that virus. They hid the virus. They sent it on airplanes around the world, to seed America and the rest of the world. Now we’ve got 100,000 Americans dead, and we’ve got 40 million Americans on the unemployment line, trillions of dollars of economic wealth destroyed.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

The Lancet — one of the world’s oldest, best known, and most respected medical journals — has formally retracted a paper which claimed that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is ineffective and potentially dangerous in the treatment of Chinese coronavirus. The paper — ‘Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without a macrolide for treatment of COVID-19: a multinational registry analysis’ — received widespread publicity across the mainstream media because it was the biggest and most damning study about HCQ. Supposedly based on the records of 96,032 patients in 671 hospitals, the study claimed that coronavirus patients who took HCQ were more likely to die than those who took nothing. It was so damning that the World Health Organization (WHO) immediately halted all its trials of HCQ. France banned its use altogether in treatments for Covid-19. But arguably the main reason the study got so much publicity was because HCQ has been championed by President Donald Trump. Trump has admitted to taking HCQ himself as a prophylactic against the Chinese coronavirus. So here was a perfect opportunity for his many critics in the mainstream media to make him look ignorant and foolish. This story by the BBC was fairly typical, headlined ‘Trump drug hydroxychloroquine raises death risk in Covid patients, study says’. It began: The drug U.S. President Donald Trump said he was taking to ward off Covid-19 actually increases the risk of patients with the disease dying from it, a study in the Lancet has found. In other words, the MSM was in no doubt where the real significance of the Lancet study lay: it represented a humiliation for Trump. Trump’s ideological enemies were quite unable to hide their glee. Senator Ed Markey (D-Mass.) tweeted that “the science is clear and the president, as usual is dangerously wrong”. The science is clear and the president, as usual, is dangerously wrong. https://t.co/kUfJ1b6YnB — Ed Markey (@EdMarkey) May 22, 2020  This antipathy towards Trump was very much shared by the Lancet, which, for 25 years, has been edited by a hard-left activist Richard Horton. As Rebecca Weisser notes in a piece for Spectator Australia, Horton has a long track record of championing fashionable leftist causes: Horton’s causes célèbres include publishing an inflated Iraq War death toll, a letter on Gaza from pro-Hamas doctors and calling for physicians to join Extinction Rebellion. Horton and the Lancet are also, it goes almost without saying, fanatical proponents of the man-made global warming narrative. Last month, the Lancet published an editorial urging Americans to “put a president in the White House…who will understand that public health should not be guided by partisan politics.” This month, however, it has been exposed as having engaged in what look very much like “partisan politics” itself. The way the Lancet has suddenly taken a paper of “such consequence” only to discard it “like a used tissue” has been described as ‘one of the most consequential retractions in modern history’. Oddly it was the left-wing Guardian that blew the whistle. A writer for its Australian edition, Melissa Davey, rang round Australian hospitals and found that the real Australian data did not tally with the claims made in the study. This raised serious questions about the credibility of Surgisphere, the hitherto unknown analytics company which had produced the study. As the Guardian reported: Why was a once-respected medical journal prepared to run a study from so dubious a source having apparently submitted it to so little scrutiny? As Toby Young, among others, argues at Lockdown Sceptics, the decision appears as if it had more to do with political activism than with disinterested science. The question is, why did the “independent” fact-checkers fail to spot this bit of fake news when they’ve been so quick to jump on anything purporting to show HCQ is effective? Could it be that they’re not actually independent at all, but Establishment lackeys determined to discredit anything that suggests COVID-19 isn’t the deadly pathogen it’s made out to be by governments around the world, particularly if it emanates from the White House? With suspiciously convenient timing, within 24 hours of the Lancet retraction, yet another study — from the University of Oxford, part of the so-called Recovery Trial — allegedly debunking hydroxychloroquine was publicised in the mainstream media. In the Telegraph, the story was reported under the headline ‘Researchers halt trial into hydroxychloroquine after they found it was “useless” against coronavirus’. Immediately underneath, an anti-Trump standfirst: ‘This could be the end of the road for a drug touted as a ‘game-changer’ by U.S. president Donald Trump’. Well it could. Except, almost immediately, doubts were being raised about the reliability of this trial too, especially with regard to the dosage of HCQ used. I found the study. Looks like the study's #HCQ doses were also very high, typical for anti-HCQ studies designed and conducted to reach their predetermined biased conclusions. No surprise, the Gates Foundation helped fund the study… https://t.co/mH1cxX0lTz — TBT (@TbTtruthbetold) June 5, 2020  Of course it’s quite possible that the many doctors (such as France’s Didier Raoult) who claim to have used HCQ successfully as a treatment for Covid-19 — often in conjunction with zinc — may yet be confounded by a definitive study. But it’s equally possible that Trump — and those doctors — may yet be vindicated.

A 44-year-old Costa Rican migrant caused thousands of euros of damage after rioting in a Rome hospital and trying to steal a pistol from a hospital security guard. The incident took place at around 6 p.m. after the man, who has lived in the Italian capital for several years, was brought to the hospital by an ambulance. After arriving in the emergency room he began punching a glass door and then broke the window with a fire extinguisher. After destroying the glass window, the man attacked medical machines and then tried to seize a pistol from a security guard but was unsuccessful, Il Giornale reports. The security guard then went outside and fired a gunshot in the air in an effort to intimidate the man but the 44-year-old continued his rampage. The man was eventually subdued by local Carabinieri officers who arrived on the scene and deployed pepper spray. The Costa Rican migrant is set to be charged with vandalism, attempted robbery and an aggravated threat to a public official.

According to Dr Alberto Zangrillo, the head of intensive care at the San Raffaele hospital in Milan, Italy has beaten the coronavirus entirely. Referencing a recent study, Professor Zangrillo claimed that “in reality, from the clinical point of view, the virus no longer exists.” The comments were met with scepticism from some officials such as Franco Locatelli, the head of Italy’s supreme health council, however, who commented: “I can only express great surprise and absolute puzzlement over the statements made by Professor Zangrillo.” “Just look at the number of new cases confirmed every day for evidence of the persistent circulation of the virus in Italy,” he added.

The shutdowns related to the coronavirus pandemic hurt Hispanic and African American employees more than white employees, according to the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics data, released in last Friday’s jobs report. The report‘s data table show that while white employment fell by 12.7% since February, Hispanic employment fell by 18.5% and black employment fell by 16.3%. (All three groups saw job gains in the positive May report, though the black unemployment rate rose slightly because there were disproportionately more black workers entering the workforce.) The reason for the racial differences in job losses is likely due to the concentration of different groups in different industries. Hispanics, for example, represent 17.6% of the total working population. But they represent 27.1% of the employees in the restaurant industry, which was largely shuttered due to the lockdowns. They also represent 37.6% of the employees in the car washing industry, which was also hit hard as people ceased travel for all but essential reasons. Similarly, black Americans represent 12.3% of the total working population, but 29.0% of employees in barber shops, which were closed down, and 22.1% of the car rental industry, which all but stopped. They also represent  21.9% of the employees of the animal slaughtering industry, which was impacted by coronavirus. Few of these industries allow remote working. Democrats and journalists tended to be more enthusiastic about shutting down the economy, with the White House Press Corps repeatedly urging President Donald Trump to criticize Republican-led states, such as Florida, that had not imposed draconian stay-at-home orders. Los Angeles City Controller Ron Galperin recently noted: “Job losses have particularly impacted people of color, and a recent national survey by the USC Dornsife Center for Economic and Social Research found that African Americans and Latinos were more likely to have lost their jobs than whites.” The USC Dornsife survey, released in April, reported: “People of color, especially African Americans, are more likely to have lost their jobs since mid-March. Nationally, 15% of whites said they had lost their jobs, whereas 18% of Latino and 21% of African Americans reported job losses.” Joel B.

Senior Chinese Communist Party officials released a lengthy report Sunday on the nation’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, claiming a rigorous and lengthy investigation shows China provided information to the world in a timely and transparent manner at all times. China “wasted no time” in sharing information such as the genome sequence for the new virus with the World Health Organization as well as relevant countries and regional organizations, according to the report as seen by the state-run Global Times. Further, the report outlines China “did not delay or cover up anything” and stands as a moral exemplar for the world to follow in future pandemic responses, given its “decisive victory” over the virus. National Health Commission Chairman Ma Xiaowei announced the astonishing exoneration. He claimed there were many unknowns in the early stage of the outbreak and it took time to gather evidence and define the characteristics of the new virus, claims that run countrary to countless allegations China obfuscated from the moment the virus was first discovered in the city of Wuhan last November. China Lied, People Died: Five Eyes Report Details CCP Coronavirus Cover-up https://t.co/sHLCxA7ZRt — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 2, 2020  “The Chinese government did not delay or cover up anything,” Ma Xiaowei said. “Instead, we have immediately reported virus data and relevant information about the epidemic to the international community and made an important contribution to the prevention and control of the epidemic around the world.” The report, which ran 66 pages in the English version, saluted China’s success in reducing the daily increase in new cases to single digits within about two months and the “decisive victory … in the battle to defend Hubei Province and its capital city of Wuhan” in about three months. China was forced to conduct the investigation after an Associated Press report found the genetic map of the virus was held back for more than a week in January, delaying its identification in a third country and the sharing of information needed to develop tests, drugs and a vaccine. The World Health Organization (W.H.O.) echoed Beijing by claiming there was “no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.” Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in #Wuhan, #China🇳. pic.twitter.com/Fnl5P877VG — World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) January 14, 2020  Meanwhile, the highly contagious disease spiraled out of control inside the Communist country.

A senior member of Australia’s parliament has taken protesters to task for massing on city streets across the country, saying their defiance of public health rules endangered the lives of others by being “reckless” and “irresponsible” at a time of a pandemic. Senator Mathias Cormann, finance minister in the conservative coalition government,  said those who took to the streets in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Hobart and other regional centers over the weekend risked a second outbreak of the Chinese coronavirus. “I think it is incredibly selfish,” Cormann told local outlet Sky News. “It’s incredibly self-indulgent.” <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> Australia has had 7,255 cases of the coronavirus and 102 deaths, avoiding the higher tolls seen elsewhere because of border closures and strict social distancing since March. Small outbreaks, however, still emerge. The national Black Lives Matter protests in Australia, called in support of those in America protesting the death of George Floyd,  came despite calls by authorities for people to stay at home and obey social-distancing rules that allow only for small groups to gather. Cormann later told reporters many Australians had lost their jobs, the economy had suffered and people had been unable to attend funerals of loved ones in order to stop the virus. “But we are going to have a mass gathering of tens of thousands of people in complete breach of the rules that apply to everyone else, it is absolutely reckless and irresponsible,” he said.

He said he hoped the rallies would not lead to a new wave of infections, SBS News reports. “We don’t know whether people will be infected,” Hunt told ABC radio on Sunday. “But if there is someone who is infectious in the midst of a crowd like that, that can have a catastrophic impact.”

During an interview with the Fox Business Network on Friday, White House Economic Adviser Kevin Hassett stated that there will “definitely” be a phase four stimulus package and Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia told the Fox News Channel’s “Cavuto Live” on Saturday that “it’s probably not the case that we’ve seen the last bill” to deal with the economic challenges resulting from the coronavirus. During the interview with Hassett, host Charles Payne asked, [relevant exchange begins around 1:45] “Will there be another stimulus package?” Hassett responded, “Yeah, there definitely will be. But one of the things that the president has instructed the team to do is to watch the numbers carefully, get as many real-time numbers as we can and have a menu of options for him that’s conditional on how the economy’s doing.” He continued that, depending on what the job numbers look like, “I could imagine it would be a much different phase four bill than if we had a whole bunch of months like April. And so, the president is doing exactly the right thing, which is, he built a bridge that basically lasts until about the end of July. And so, we’re going to use that time to monitor the economy and think about what the best policies are. But I’m sure there will be a phase four deal. Because there are things like liability protection and so on that really have to happen.” Scalia said that he would advise that the government watch “carefully, over the next few weeks, and then assess what more, if anything, needs to be done.” (h/t Forbes) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

On Friday’s “PBS NewsHour,” New York Times columnist David Brooks stated that the United States is in the midst of a “climactic shift.” Brooks began by saying Ferguson, terrorism, and the 2016 election started opening up riffs in American society, then the coronavirus pandemic and George Floyd’s killing exposed those divides further. He continued, “And then you get this generational turnover. You’ve had a generation of people under 35 who’ve seen the financial crisis, who’ve seen a bit of the war in Iraq maybe, but who’ve seen nothing on global warming. And so, this is a generation that is fed up. And, frankly, a lot of people in the African American community are fed up. The word I keep hearing is exhausted.” Brooks concluded, “And so, I do think, when you calculate the depth of the ravines that are being exposed, with the generational change, with a sense of America finally turning to race as maybe the central storyline in our history — or our story right now, these are just big, epic shifts. And I do think it’s like one of those big shifts that happen periodically in American history, ’68 or 1890 or 1830. And I think we’re in the middle of something…I think it’s not just a moment. It’s a climactic shift.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

On Saturday, protesters told Frey he was no longer welcome to demonstrate against Floyd’s death after he refused to commit to defunding Minneapolis’s police department. Last week, Frey urged demonstrators to practice social distancing and wear masks to reduce coronavirus transmission following protests and riots. Frey, who wore a mask for his Twitter profile photo, framed Floyd’s death in racial terms. Video of my full remarks from earlier this morning. "Being Black in America should not be a death sentence.

Thousands of protesters took to the streets of New York City on Saturday in the wake of George Floyd’s death, where they marched under a sign that made it clear that facial coverings should be used during the coronavirus pandemic. The protest, which was captured on video by Breitbart News in Lower Manhattan, lasted several hours and featured hundreds who had no facial coverings and largely ignored social distancing guidelines that have been put in place by state and local governments. Protesters marched down the street under a sign that read, “Outside with No Mask? Fuhgeddaboutit” and chanted “No justice, no peace” as they moved forward. The sign mimicked a New York accent pronumciation of “forget about it” and was part of a Public Service Announcement that stated that facial masks should be worn while traveling outside of your home. The same protest that occurred on Saturday featured protesters who replaced the chant “No justice, no peace” with “F**k Donald Trump, F**k Donald Trump.” Others in attendance chose to use the opportunity to promote voter registration, urging those who were New York citizens and not registered to vote to do so.

On Friday’s “MSNBC Live,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) stated that if we had improved testing, “we could open up a lot more quickly” and that he is “so proud of these young kids in the streets.” Schumer also expressed concern that protesters were putting themselves and others at risk from coronavirus, and said that “The answer here is testing.” Schumer said that travel, entertainment, and retail industries are hurting the hardest, “and if we don’t get massive testing, which is the real answer here. If people had instantaneous tests and knew, when they entered a place, that everyone was tested and the people who were inside didn’t have COVID, we could open up a lot more quickly. That’s in our bill, too.” Later, Schumer stated that he is “so proud of these young kids in the streets. … Trump would like people to think all the demonstrators are violent rioters. That’s a tiny number, and they of course should be punished. No one wants the violence. But the vast majority are people looking for change, to deal with the gaping sore that’s been on the American body politic since our founding, and that is racial injustice, racism. And I am very hopeful that people across the country are seeing that and we can get some real, strong action.” Host Stephanie Ruhle then asked Schumer, “But how concerned are you about their health? It was just a week ago, we were looking at all the people who disregarded social distancing rules Memorial Day weekend, and we worried that they were going to put themselves and so many others at a health risk. Do you not have that concern now?” Schumer responded, “Yeah, well, sure. The answer here is testing. The Trump administration has been an abject failure in getting adequate tests. If we had adequate tests, people who knew they had COVID would stay in. Everyone else could go about their business protesting if they so wished, going to stores, going to work.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

More than 1,200 health professionals have signed a letter saying that they approve of protests against racism during the Chinese virus pandemic, because it is “vital to the national public health.” The health professionals added, however, that protesting lockdown orders is still dangerous, and is also “rooted in white nationalism.” According to the letter, “White supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to COVID-19.” A group of healthcare and medical professionals wrote an open letter expressing their support for protests against racism in the wake of the death of George Floyd — despite the pandemic that so many health officials have been warning the public about — adding that such protests against racism should not be shut down due to coronavirus fears, reports CNN. “As public health advocates, we do not condemn these gatherings as risky for COVID-19 transmission,” wrote the health professionals in their letter. “We support them as vital to the national public health and to the threatened health specifically of Black people in the United States.” “We can show that support by facilitating safest protesting practices without detracting from demonstrators’ ability to gather and demand change,” they continue. The letter goes on to state that their support for protests against racism during the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic should not “be confused” for them also having support for protests against lockdowns in response to the Chinese virus. “This should not be confused with a permissive stance on all gatherings, particularly protests against stay-home orders,” state the health professionals, who go on to bizarrely claim that such protests are also “rooted in white nationalism.” “Those actions not only oppose public health interventions, but are also rooted in white nationalism and run contrary to respect for Black lives,” reads the letter. “White supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to COVID-19,” affirm the health professionals in their letter. “We created this letter in response to emerging narratives that seemed to malign demonstrations as risky for the public health because of Covid-19,” explain the authors — most of whom are from the University of Washington’s Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The letter was also signed by over 1,200 other health professionals who claim that they concur with the sentiments. “We believe that the way forward is not to suppress protests in the name of public health but to respond to protesters demands in the name of public health, thereby addressing multiple public health crises,” they further explain. The health professionals go on to advise that protesters engage in “social distancing” and “public masking” while they “call attention to the pervasive lethal force of white supremacy.” The letter also mentions that while the health professionals are in support of such protests, people should nonetheless “prepare for an increased number of infections in the days following a protest.” You can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo, and on Instagram.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) on Saturday announced that New York reached the lowest number of coronavirus hospitalizations and deaths since the start of the pandemic and stated on social media that they have “crushed” the curve, adding that New York City will be entering the first phase of reopening on Monday. “We did the impossible. On Monday NYC will open phase one. We didn’t just flatten the curve — we crushed it,” Cuomo stated: We did the impossible. On Monday NYC will open phase one. We didn’t just flatten the curve — we crushed it. #NYTough — Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) June 6, 2020  The Empire State reached a significant milestone on Saturday as the governor announced the lowest number of hospitalizations and deaths since the start of the pandemic weeks ago. Total hospitalizations on Friday slipped to 2,603 “from a record-high of 18,825 during the peak of the pandemic, and 35 people in New York passed away due to COVID-19, down from a record-high of 800 just eight weeks ago,” per the governor’s website. “Our metrics are all, today, very good. We are going to open the valve more than we originally anticipated because the metrics are so good,” Cuomo said on Saturday. “Compared to where we were, this is a big sigh of relief”:  As a result of the downward trend in coronavirus metrics, places of worship — including churches, synagogues, and mosques — will be able to reopen and operate at a 25 percent capacity during the state’s second phase of reopening. “Places of worship in the seven regions that have already entered phase two – the Capital Region, Central New York, the Finger Lakes, the Mohawk Valley, the North Country, the Southern Tier and Western New York – can reopen beginning tomorrow, June 7th,” according to the state’s website. “This is an acceleration for us because we are doing so well on the metrics, but people still have to stay smart,” Cuomo said. New York City, which was hit particularly hard by the virus, is “on track” to enter into the first phase of reopening Monday, June 8, as percent of positive coronavirus tests “has dropped from a high of 57 percent per day to two percent per day within the city.” New York State reported 381,019 positive cases and 30,066 deaths as of Saturday, the majority of which stem from New York City.

June 6 (UPI) — California Gov. Gavin Newsom has declared that TV and film productions may resume in the state on Friday. The industry has been largely shut down since mid-March due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed about 108,000 people in the United States to date. Productions will be “subject to approval by county public health officers within the jurisdictions of operations following their review of local epidemiological data including cases per 100,000 population, rate of test positivity, and local preparedness to support a health care surge, vulnerable populations, contact tracing and testing,” the California Department of Public Health said in a statement issued by the governor’s office Friday. It is unclear which TV shows and movies might go back to work on or around that date, however, since protocols still need to be approved, union agreements signed and protective measures put in place. Changes on set that are expected are coronavirus testing for casts and crews, regular temperature checks, improved hygiene and sanitation, and live audiences only when they wear masks and social distance.

Photographs show activists at the illegal Black Lives Matter protests in London have defaced the Cenotaph, which honours the fallen, on the 76th anniversary of D-Day. Sited on Whitehall near the Prime Minister’s official Downing Street residence, the Cenotaph — “empty tomb” — is Britain’s national war memorial, constructed and dedicated to the memory of “the glorious dead” in the First World War. It remains the focus of the country’s most significant acts of remembrance down to the present day, particularly on Armistice Day and Remembrance Sunday, and with June 6th being the 76th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy it would have, in normal times, likely been the focus of ceremonies honouring veterans of all colours across Britain and the former British Empire. Such ceremonies have been suspended virtually worldwide, however, as people are prevented from attending large memorials or even a typical funeral — but this did not stop Black Lives Matter supporters from staging a thousands-strong, closely-packed, and ultimately violent protest, ostensibly over George Floyd’s death on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean in Minneapolis.

Prior to defacing the Cenotaph, attendees at the Black Lives Matter protest — which both the Health Secretary and the Home Secretary urged people to stay away from, given it is unlawful and could lead to a resurgence of the coronavirus in Britain’s multicultural capital — had vandalised not just the statue of wartime leader Sir Winston Churchill in Parliament Square, but also the statue of Abraham Lincoln, the U.S. leader who was assassinated for leading the war to free America’s slaves in the 1800s.

Bars, gyms, day camps, schools, and campgrounds will be permitted to begin reopening the week of June 7 in counties that meet the California Department of Public Health criteria regarding coronavirus cases and hospitalizations, a department guidance released Friday detailed. The department’s statewide, industry-specific guidance allows sectors that have remained closed for weeks to reopen with certain modifications in place. The guidance provides broad instruction for professional sports, retail, schools, and shopping centers to resume operations. “The rules on schools and day camps will apply statewide. But only counties that have met certain thresholds on the number of cases, testing and preparedness will be allowed to start reopening the other sectors,” KPIX reported: 📢 #California has announced new guidance to help counties plan for the reopening of schools, childcare, and entertainment as well as new monitoring data to support local communities in a timely response to outbreaks: https://t.co/CbektJrGRb — CA Public Health (@CAPublicHealth) June 6, 2020  The state’s health department provides criteria for counties to proceed in reopening. Requirements include “stable hospitalizations of COVID individuals on a 7-day average of daily percent change of less than 5% OR no more than 20 COVID hospitalizations on any single day in the past 14 days” and “less than 25 new cases per 100,000 residents in the past 14 days OR less than 8% testing positive in the past 7 days.” The guidance also has requirements for testing capacity, contact tracing, and the potential for a hospital surge. The Golden State, which has a population of nearly 40 million, had 126,510 positive cases of the virus and 4,550 related deaths as of Saturday morning. A bulk of those cases and deaths stem from Los Angeles County.

The government of Equatorial Guinea joined Burundi in announcing the expulsion of the World Health Organization’s (W.H.O.) representatives there, citing a document that alleges they falsified the number of cases of the Chinese coronavirus. The Equatorial Guinea Foreign Ministry document, obtained by Agence France Presse (AFP), accused W.H.O. Representative Triphonie Nkurunziza of “falsifying” the country’s coronavirus figures after she claimed the country had been “severely affected” by the pandemic. “The government has asked her to go, we have received a document – she is accused of falsifying COVID-19 figures,” a source at the W.H.O. office told AFP. According to Dr. Nkurunziza, the Central African nation has recorded more than 1,000 coronavirus cases and 12 deaths nationwide, a relatively high figure given the population of just 1.4 million. “By population we estimate it to be one of the severely affected countries in terms of the number of cases,” the W.H.O.’s regional director for Africa Matshidiso Moeti told reporters this week. “The government has asked the W.H.O. to replace its representative Triphonie Nkurunziza in Equatorial Guinea,” she added. “We are currently working on doing that. I’d like to emphasize very much that we are committed to working with the government, particularly working to support the people.” Addressing the Senate late last week, the country’s Prime Minister Pascual Obama Asue said: “We don’t have a problem with the WHO, we have a problem with the WHO’s representative in Malabo.” Despite being declared persona non-grata, Nkurunziza currently remains in the capital of Malabo because there are no outbound flights. Led by President Teodoro Obiang since a 1979 military coup, Equatorial Guinea is one of Africa’s most authoritarian states with one of the region’s worst human rights records. In April 2016, Obiang declared himself the winner of the country’s presidential election with a staggering 93.7 percent in an election that the U.S. denounced as “neither free nor fair.” According to the State Department’s report on the country, major human rights violations include “torture; arbitrary detention by government agents; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; political prisoners; arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy; significant problems with independence of the judiciary; the worst forms of restrictions on free expression, press, and the internet, including violence, threats of violence, or unjustified arrests or prosecutions of journalists, censorship, site blocking, and the existence of criminal libel laws.” Equatorial Guinea follows fellow African nation Burundi in expelling W.H.O. representative Walter Kazadi Mulombo and several of his officials. Their removal was also dubious political circumstances after they raised concerns about holding mass political rallies in the run-up to last month’s presidential election. They were ordered to leave the country on Friday. Follow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.

Activists defaced and scaled Abraham Lincoln’s statue in Parliament Square, London, at a Black Lives Matter rally held in defiance of Britain’s anti-coronavirus regulations. Video from protest, estimated to be 15,000-strong at the time of publication, shows the Lincoln statue defaced with the graffiti reading “BLM” and naming George Floyd, Mike Brown, and other individuals said to have been killed wrongfully by the police. One side of Lincoln’s pedestal has also had a banner and several placards duct-taped to it, reading “RACISM IS A PANDEMIC TOO”, “SILENCE IS VIOLENCE”, “BLM”, and “ABOLISH THE POLICE”. Separate footage shows protesters physically scaling the statue to cheers from the closely-packed crowds, which assembled in defiance of Home Secretary Priti Patel and Health Secretary Matt Hancock warning that such gatherings were unlawful and could send coronavirus infections soaring again.

“Progressive” ideology always rests on a conviction that the current “regressive” system is comprehensively unjust and must be destroyed by exploiting its weaknesses.  The most famous proponent of such tactics in recent years has been the late Saul Alinksy, the intellectual godfather of the modern Democrat Party, but former Soviet journalist and KGB informant Yuri Bezmenov laid out an even more concise strategy for subversion in a 1984 interview. Alinksy’s seminal book specified 13 Rules for Radicals, but Bezmenov had only four “stages of ideological subversion,” and they will sound very familiar to anyone following the current wave of left-wing riots, or the politicized final stages of the coronavirus panic before it: Demoralization, Destabilization, Crisis, and Normalization.  Bezmenov defined ideological subversion, or “active measures” as the KGB preferred to call it, as a “slow brainwashing process” to “change the perception of reality of every American to such an extent that despite their abundance of information, no one is able to come to sensible conclusions in the interests of defending themselves, their families, their community, and their country.” Stage 1: Demoralization Bezmenov said the first stage, Demoralization, could take 15 to 20 years to complete because “this is the minimum number of years it takes to educate one generation of students.” “Marxist-Leninist ideology is being pumped into the soft heads of at least three generations without being challenged or counterbalanced by the basic values of Americanism, American patriotism,” he warned in 1984, judging that the demoralization process had been “basically completed” by that point. “Actually, it’s over-fulfilled, because demoralization now reaches such areas where previously, not even Comrade Andropov and all of his experts would even dream of such tremendous success,” he added, referring to former KGB head and Soviet leader Yuri Andropov. “Most of it is done by Americans to Americans, thanks to a lack of moral standards.” Bezmenov explained that demoralization is important because it robs the targeted population of its ability to process valid information. Even when demoralization targets are “showered with authentic proof” of contrary positions, they simply “refuse to believe it.” Demoralization is quite obvious among today’s young people, whose faith in their country has been systematically destroyed throughout their lives by the education and media establishment. To take a recent high-profile example, the New York Times’ fraudulent “1619 Project” argued that “American history” actually began with the arrival of black slaves in North America and the Revolutionary War was fought by the colonists to preserve slavery. Although comprehensively debunked by actual historians, and even the original author has admitted her core thesis was not true, the 1619 Project is now part of some school curricula.   Another word for demoralization is guilt. Americans are routinely compelled to feel guilty about their society and national history. Guilt is the most powerful force in left-wing politics and academia. People will not accept the radical expansion of punitive government power unless they feel guilty and deserving of punishment. Stage 2: Destabilization The second stage, Destabilization, is much faster, requiring only two to five years under KGB doctrine. In this stage, the fundamentals of the targeted population’s economy, political system, and culture would be attacked, while the demoralized population could not mount much of a defense.  Bezmenov in 1984 found it “absolutely fantastic” how much influence Marxist-Leninist ideas had developed in the American economy and military. In essence, a demoralized population becomes willing to believe the worst criticisms of its own society, while learning to see defenders of that society as their enemies, while avowed enemies become natural allies. The defenders are held to strict standards, while anything goes for the most strident critics.  Whatever Bezmenov saw in the destabilized American society of the early 1980s with respect to the Soviet Union, it’s easy to see how the American Left has destabilized entire segments of modern society after demoralizing them. They see enemies everywhere, while no pro-American authority can be trusted. It’s hard to imagine a better illustration of demoralization followed by destabilization than hordes of anti-capitalist activists texting each other on their iPhones. Not coincidentally, hostile foreign powers like Communist China and Iran are reaching out to destabilized American communities and offering themselves as guides and allies. Their sales pitches aren’t exactly smooth, but they definitely are making an effort. A destabilized population becomes obsessed with hypocrisy as the ultimate political sin. They believe the best ideas – individual liberty, sovereign rights, capitalism, even the rule of law – are presented insincerely by sinister powers who seek to exploit and manipulate them. The precious resource of goodwill disappears from society as everyone comes to believe their neighbors hate them and cannot be trusted. Demoralized people lose faith in their nation, history, and ideals; destabilized people lose faith in each other. Stage 3: Crisis Once a society has been destabilized, Bezmenov said the time would be ripe to create a Crisis, which he estimated would take six to eight weeks in the Eighties. With turbo Internet speed, the modern era can punch out a crisis much faster than that. A crisis has the obvious benefit of panicking demoralized, destabilized people into abandoning their legal protections and constitutional ideals. During the coronavirus panic, people who brought up those ideals were treated like lunatics. The pendulum swung the other way with blinding speed during the riots. In the span of one week, the right to peaceable assembly went from a crazed defiance of common-sense lockdown rules to an urgent matter that utterly transcended the deadly pandemic. Suddenly, angry political demonstration magically cured the coronavirus, or made the projected wave of sickness and death into a purely secondary concern. If you wanted to work at the store so you could feed your family in late March, you were selfishly trying to “kill my Grandma to pad your bank account.” If you wanted to burn the store down in early June to protest white supremacy, nobody mentioned their imperiled grandmothers. The more subtle benefit of a crisis is that it tends to de-legitimize aspects of the existing system that have already been softened up by the long process of demoralization and destabilization. Those who control the organs of public communication have the power to decide which aspects of the system are supposedly indicted by the crisis.  For example, the dominant media Left will go to great lengths to avoid painting the coronavirus as an indictment of the flabby, blinkered, bureaucratic Big Government that grew over the past few decades, and it will not discuss the failures of left-wing mayors and governors. On the contrary, the pandemic was used to attack the competence of Republican governors who turned out to be entirely correct in their actions, as in Florida and Georgia. During the riots, the media is completely uninterested in discussing the incompetence of left-wing officials who allowed violence to rage out of control with deadly consequences. Somehow the lesson of wanton violence that killed people and destroyed countless livelihoods became “let’s get rid of the police altogether.” The threat of a crisis is essential for terrorizing the middle class into accepting a political agenda that is actively hostile to its interests, which leads to the fourth stage of subversion: the offer to make the pain and fear go away by accepting political domination. Stage 4: Normalization “After a crisis, with a violent change of the power structure and economy, you have a so-called period of Normalization that may last indefinitely,” Bezmenov said, arriving at the fourth stage of subversion. “Normalization is a cynical expression borrowed from Soviet propaganda,” he explained. Interestingly, it also happens to be the core theme of the 2020 Democrat presidential campaign. “When the Soviet tanks moved into Czechoslovakia in 1968, Comrade Brezhnev said, ‘Now the situation in brotherly Czechoslovakia is ‘normalized.’ This is what will happen in the United States if you allow all the schmucks to bring the country to crisis, to promise people all kinds of goodies and a paradise on Earth, to destabilize your economy, to eliminate the principle of free-market competition, and to put a Big Brother government in Washington, D.C. with benevolent dictators like Walter Mondale, who will promise lots of things – never mind whether the promises are fulfillable or not,” Bezmenov cautioned. As things turned out, Walter Mondale never got his chance to be a benevolent dictator, and to some extent Bezmenov’s four-step model of subversion could be applied to almost any political campaign. They almost all begin with telling voters things are awful, crises have erupted, and normality can be restored only by voting for the challenger (or preserved only by voting for the incumbent). Bezmenov, however, was insistent that American left-wing professors and civil-rights leaders were deliberately running Andropov’s strategy with a conscious effort to achieve destabilization, the step that truly distinguishes ideological subversion from the usual promises to put a chicken in every pot. “They are instrumental in the process of subversion only to destabilize a nation,” he said of the academics and activists. “When their job is completed, they are not needed anymore. They know too much. Some of them, when they get disillusioned, when they see that Marxist-Leninists come to power, obviously they get offended. They think that they will come to power. That will never happen, of course. They will be lined up against the wall and shot.” The American version of this process probably would not end with the mass execution of inconvenient intellectuals, but there is a parallel in what would happen to the intellectual supporters of the current riots if the Democrats win in 2020. They would discover that the victorious Democrat Party is not at all interested in their systemic criticisms of public union employees, such as police officers. Many bones would be thrown to activist groups to purchase their loyalty – and, much more importantly, the loyalty of their leaders – but not the one concession they ostensibly care about the most: a system that makes it easier to discipline and fire government employees. This metaphorical lining up and shooting of intellectuals is already happening with Lockdown Forever enthusiasts, who only a few days ago were hammering out passionate arguments that American businesses must remain shuttered for weeks or months to come, and anyone who dared to question their dire warnings was a selfish monster willing to kill other people’s grandmothers to pad out their 401k accounts. In the blink of an eye, Lockdown Forever went from the vital engineers of a politically useful crisis to inconvenient obstacles for the new crisis, nationwide riots.  Most of the lockdown gurus sensed this shift in the political winds and quickly trimmed their sails, hammering out new screeds that claimed protesters are probably immune to the coronavirus somehow, or even more incredibly, that another outbreak would be a small price to pay for righteous political activism: Dozens of public health and disease experts have signed an open letter in support of the nationwide anti-racism protests. "White supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to COVID-19," they wrote.https://t.co/EewPNgDSu3 — NPR (@NPR) June 2, 2020  These are the same medical activists who were shrieking in March that the coronavirus could kill millions of Americans if lockdowns were not imposed immediately, and just a few weeks ago, left-wingers were obsessed with calculations that showed COVID-19 is exceptionally deadly to the black community. But suddenly the risk of millions of deaths, 70 percent of them purportedly likely to be black Americans, means nothing compared to the vital urgency of protesting against “white supremacy.”

The British government has made wearing masks mandatory on public transport as part of the country’s lockdown measures, with fines for violations. However, the move came after thousands of far-left protesters and rioters were free to break social distancing rules in London without punishment. Transport secretary Grant Shapps made the announcement on Thursday that from June 15th, wearing masks will be compulsory under “conditions of travel” for trains, buses, and other forms of public transport. Those not wearing them may be refused to board or even face fines. Mr Shapps said: “Alongside transport operators, this will be enforced by the British Transport Police if necessary, but I expect the vast majority of people won’t need to be forced into this.” The face-covering may be a store-bought or homemade mask or even a scarf. Young children and those with disabilities or who have difficulty breathing are exempt. The British Medical Association (BMA) and London’s left-wing mayor, Labour’s Sadiq Khan, have called for the requirement to be rolled out to restaurants, shops, pubs, and other enclosed public spaces. PICS: Antifa, Black Lives Matter Flood London Despite Lockdown, Police Do Little https://t.co/ySrdWGyW0R — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 31, 2020  The United Kingdom still maintains some of the strictest lockdown rules in the world. Britons facing additional requirements in order to simply be allowed on public transport comes as images in the media showed thousands of Black Lives Matter and Antifa protesters marching in close proximity through London, largely without masks, in almost total disregard for the rules other law-abiding citizens are expected to follow. The reaction of London’s Metropolitan Police was to “encourage” protesters to remember that “there are still restrictions in place to prevent its spread, which include not gathering outside in groups of more than six people”. Rather than demanding protesters obey the rules, however, many London police officers instead kneeled to Black Lives Matter protesters, including outside of the Prime Minister’s Downing Street residence. Wednesday’s demonstration then quickly descended into violence, with rioters assaulting and punching police officers yards from the prime minister’s official residence. Just days before, peaceful anti-lockdown protesters in London’s Hyde Park were arrested for “breach of Covid-19 regulations” with some fines being issued. Exclusive Video: Peaceful Anti-Lockdown Protestors Arrested at Demonstration in London https://t.co/NsbvSCHBdl — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 1, 2020  Whether or not being faced with the blatant hypocrisy will cause Britons to reject en masse the enforcement of mask-wearing remains to be seen. However, Breitbart London’s James Delingpole believes that the recent Black Lives Matter protests have “killed” lockdown. Writing on Friday, Delingpole observed: But how do all these strictures square with the events of the last few days, in which thousands of people, in Hyde Park and elsewhere, have been permitted to gather in huge crowds in support of Black Lives Matter in flagrant contravention of all social distancing rules? Well they don’t, obviously, and anyone with half a brain can see this. He pointed out the “official hypocrisy, double standards, and general stupidity” of the government’s lockdown position, saying: So, for example, as I discovered the other week, if you’re protesting against the lockdown the police will turn up mob-handed and threaten you with arrest for inadequate social distancing. But if you’re part of menacing mob claiming to be outraged by an incident that happened 4,000 miles away across the Atlantic in an entirely different legal jurisdiction, then as far as the authorities are concerned no action need be taken short of arresting people physically beating up police officers. “I think the Black Lives Matter protests — certainly the UK version — are dangerous, stupid and wrong for a number of reasons,” he concluded. “But I’m grateful to them for one thing: they’ve made it quite impossible for anyone with even half a brain to see the ongoing lockdown as anything other than a ridiculous joke.” Australian media in London confronted and chased by the mob live on-air yesterday.   UK media not interested in showing it. Remarkable.  pic.twitter.com/rSOT6W1Atb — Michael Heaver (@Michael_Heaver) June 4, 2020 

SAINT-LAURENT-SUR-MER, France (AP) – At least the dead will always be there. All too many have been, for 76 years since that fateful June 6th on France’s Normandy beaches, when Allied troops in 1944 turned the course of World War II and went on to defeat fascism in Europe in one of the most remarkable feats in military history. Forgotten they will never be. Revered, yes. But Saturday’s anniversary will be one of the loneliest remembrances ever, as the coronavirus pandemic is keeping almost everyone away — from government leaders to frail veterans who might not get another chance for a final farewell to their unlucky comrades. Rain and wind are also forecast, after weeks of warm, sunny weather. “I miss the others,” said Charles Shay, who as a U.S. Army medic was in the first wave of soldiers to wade ashore at Omaha Beach under relentless fire on D-Day. Shay, 95, lives in France close to the beach where he and so many others landed in 1944. He knows of no U.S. veterans making the trip overseas to observe D-Day this year. “I guess I will be alone here this year,” Shay said before he performed a Native American ritual to honour his comrades by spreading the smoke of burning white sage into the winds lashing the Normandy coast Friday. The eerie atmosphere touches the French as well as Americans. “The sadness is almost too much, because there is no one,” said local guide Adeline James. “Plus you have their stories. The history is sad and it’s even more overwhelming now between the weather, the [virus] situation and, and, and.” The locals in this north-western part of France have come out year after year to show their gratitude for the soldiers from the United States, Britain, Canada, and other countries who liberated them from Adolf Hitler’s Nazi forces. Despite the lack of international crowds, David Pottier still went out to raise American flags in the Calvados village of Mosles, population 356, which was liberated by Allied troops the day after the landing on five Normandy beachheads. In a forlorn scene, a gardener tended to the parched grass around the small monument for the war dead, while Pottier, the local mayor, was getting the French tricolour to flutter next to the Stars and Stripes. “We have to recognize that they came to die in a foreign land,” Pottier said. “We miss the GIs,” he said of the U.S. soldiers. This protest in London now has nothing to do with George Floyd.  It is anarchy in the face of weak leadership.  To desecrate The Cenotaph tells us these people hate our values, our culture and our country. Enough. pic.twitter.com/CtfKtg1Aqq — Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) June 3, 2020  The pandemic has wreaked havoc across the world, infecting 6.6 million people, killing over 391,000 and devastating economies. It poses a particular threat to the elderly — like the surviving D-Day veterans who are in their late nineties or older. It has also affected the younger generations who turn out every year to mark the occasion. Most have been barred from travelling to the windswept coasts of Normandy. Some 160,000 soldiers made the perilous crossing from England that day in atrocious conditions, storming dunes which they knew were heavily defended by German troops determined to hold their positions. Somehow, they succeeded. Yet they left a trail of thousands of casualties who have been mourned for generations since. Last year stood out, with U.S. President Donald Trump joining French President Emmanuel Macron at the American cemetery in Colleville-sur-Mer, on a bluff overlooking Omaha Beach. A smattering of veterans were honoured with the highest accolades. All across the beaches of Normandy tens of thousands came from across the globe to pay their respects to the dead and laud the surviving soldiers. The acrid smell of wartime-era jeep exhaust fumes and the rumble of old tanks filled the air as parades of vintages vehicles went from village to village. The tiny roads between the dunes, hedges and apple orchards were clogged for hours, if not days. Heading into the D-Day remembrance weekend this year, only the salty brine coming off the ocean on Omaha Beach hits the nostrils, the shrieks of seagulls pierce the ears and a sense of desolation hangs across the region’s country roads. “Last year this place was full with jeeps, trucks, people dressed up as soldiers,” said Eric Angely, who sat on a seawall wearing a World War II uniform after taking his restored U.S. Army jeep out for a ride. “This year, there is nothing. It’s just me now, my dog and my jeep,” the local Frenchman said. Three-quarters of a century and the horrific wartime slaughter of D-Day help put things in perspective. Someday, the COVID-19 pandemic, too, will pass, and people will turn out to remember both events that shook the world. “We don’t have a short memory around here,” Pottier said with a wistful smile. I don’t care what the cause, or how deep the anger, there is simply no excuse for denigrating the Cenotaph, a war memorial to mark the millions who died for the liberty that today’s generation take for granted  The Fallen’s lives matter, too 🙏🏻 pic.twitter.com/jZdCGvpKLc — Martin Daubney (@MartinDaubney) June 3, 2020  ___ Virginia Mayo contributed.

On Friday’s broadcast of CNN’s “AC360,” host Anderson Cooper said that protesters are “putting themselves at greater risk” from coronavirus because “That is how urgently people want real and lasting change” and remarked on the White House not arranging its chairs for a press conference for social distancing by saying, “So much for all those warnings by Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx and the Coronavirus Task Force.” Cooper said, “For 11 days now, we have been hearing the call for change in this country. It’s coming from the ground up, from people of all races and backgrounds and in the middle of a pandemic. Just think about that for a minute as you look at the live demonstrations on your screen. Not only are people risking their safety by speaking out and confronting police, which is something most people never do in their lives, they’re also putting themselves at greater risk from a virus that’s already killed 109,000 people in this country, a virus which is still here, still transmittable, still killing people all around the world. That is how urgently people want real and lasting change in the wake of George Floyd’s killing by police nearly two Mondays ago. It’s how badly they want an end to what has been a long-running and deadly injustice to African Americans in this country, and to redeem the country’s long-standing promise of equal justice under the law.” He later added that the chairs at the White House’s press conference earlier in the day were “deliberately not arranged for social distancing. Because, in the words of the deputy press secretary, it looks better. So much for all those warnings by Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx and the Coronavirus Task Force. The president has clearly decided the virus is not a winning topic for him anymore.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

Friday, during an interview that aired on Huntsville, AL radio’s WVNN, Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) discussed how his East Texas congressional district was handling the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, and what he foresaw as overcoming the impact could mean. During the discussion, Gohmert also referenced the Hong Kong flu (H3N2) pandemic of the late 1960s and how different his experience with that was compared to coronavirus. “[I] was just in high school, had just got in high school back during the Hong Kong flu, ’68, ’69,” he said. “I’ve been reading a lot about that, and I remember the talk about it. We lost 100,000 or so Americans back then to that virus. We didn’t have a vaccine for it, much like coronavirus didn’t have a vaccine. But, I don’t remember any business being shutdown.  I don’t remember anybody being told they had to wear a mask or anything.” The Texas Republican congressman explained that given the willingness of the country to accept requirements and restrictions put in place by governmental bodies to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus in current-day America seemed to show the country was much more “tolerant” of government power. “I know we’ve done more and improved more, but I think Americans now are much more tolerant of having big government tell them what they can and can’t do, especially the millennials are more accustomed to telling them what they can or can’t do,” Gohmert continued. “I see that as the difference between now and past pandemics. There will probably be a little resurgence — hopefully not much more than this one. A lot depends on us.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor

New York City, New York rioters arrested for crimes considered “low-level” will not face any charges after nights of rioting, looting, and setting fires. Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance says his office will not prosecute any rioters who were charged with crimes like unlawful assembly or disorderly conduct. The announcement means the overwhelming majority of hundreds of rioters in New York City will likely not face any criminal prosecution. Vance’s office said in a statement The prosecution of protestors charged with these low-level offenses undermines critical bonds between law enforcement and the communities we serve.Days after the killing of George Floyd, our nation and our city are at a crossroads in our continuing endeavor to confront racism and systemic injustice wherever it exists. Our office has a moral imperative to enact public policies which assure all New Yorkers that in our justice system and our society, black lives matter and police violence is a crime. We commend the thousands of our fellow New Yorkers who have peacefully assembled to demand these achievable aims, and our door is open to any New Yorker who wishes to be heard. Only rioters who were arrested and where there is evidence that they contributed to attacks on police officers, looting, or destruction of property will face criminal charges. Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s (D-NY) “bail reform” law — which eliminated bail for a number of nonviolent and violent crimes in New York state — is successfully freeing at least 400 rioters and looters from jail without ever having to pay bail. The bail reform law eliminated bail for suspects accused of second-degree manslaughter, aggravated vehicular assault, third-degree assault, promoting an obscene sexual performance by a child, criminally negligent homicide, aggravated vehicular homicide, and about 100 other crimes. In March, New York City Police Department (NYPD) officials said that in the first 58 days of the year, close to 500 suspects who would have been kept locked up in jail if not for the new bail reform laws had been rearrested for committing an additional 846 crimes. Nearly 300 of these crimes included murder, rape, robbery, felony assault, burglary, grand larceny, and grand larceny auto. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Jihadists in Indonesia are calling for violent attacks on Chinese-run businesses amid surging anti-Chinese sentiment in the Muslim-majority nation. In the midst of an economic recession caused by the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, foreign workers in Indonesia compete for dwindling local jobs with Indonesians. This has seeded resentment toward the Chinese, who make up the majority of Indonesia’s foreign workforce, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported on Thursday. Sofyan Tsauri, a former al-Qaeda terrorist who served five years in prison for helping to arm terror groups and now supports Indonesia’s counterterrorism efforts, said on Monday, “Some jihadis have called for the burning and robbing of Chinese shops.” He made the comment following his participation in a webinar on Monday by the Indonesian think tank Center for Radicalism and Deradicalization Studies, the SCMP reported. According to Sofyan, jihadis have called for attacks on Chinese businesses on social media platforms, including Facebook, for the past six months. The calls to action have been made by members of Indonesia’s Islamic State affiliate, Jemaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), members of al-Qaeda, and other jihadist groups operating in Indonesia. Sofyan said that jihadis were already preparing to launch a terror attack in Indonesia, implying that it was a question of when, not if, they strike. “[An attack] has to be anticipated and not be dismissed. There needs to be caution,” Sofyan warned, adding that regions of Indonesia where jihadis have been known to operate – such as the islands of “Sulawesi, Sumatra, and West Java”– should exercise vigilance. He explained that the ongoing Chinese coronavirus pandemic has caused serious vulnerabilities to crop up within Indonesia’s government and society, creating optimal conditions for the terrorists to strike. As examples, Sofyan cited the general distraction of the national government in dealing with the public health crisis and the swelling of anti-Chinese sentiment among Indonesians, itself a result of the pandemic-induced economic recession. According to the SCMP, in April, Indonesia’s Manpower and Transmigration Ministry said that 2.8 million people had lost their jobs as a direct result of the economic recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic, adding that an additional 70 million “informal workers” were “at risk” of unemployment. As of May, a total of 98,900 foreign workers were active in Indonesia’s workforce, less than 0.1 percent of Indonesia’s total workforce of 124 million, the SCMP reported. Of foreign workers, the Chinese accounted for the largest group – 35,781 workers– followed by the Japanese at 12,823, and South Koreans at 9,097. China invests heavily in Indonesia and is the nation’s second-largest foreign direct investor. In 2019, Chinese companies invested $4.7 billion in Indonesia. Though long-standing, Indonesian resentment toward Chinese foreign workers has increased significantly during the current recession. According to the report, many Indonesians have recently criticized the government for allegedly favoring Chinese workers over locals in allotting work contracts, prompting the government to respond. In early May, lawmakers in southwestern Indonesia’s Sulawesi province denied the planned arrival of 500 Chinese foreign workers contracted by Chinese metalworking companies in Indonesia hoping to employ them instead of locals. Although the Chinese companies had already managed to secure work permits for the group from Jakarta’s central government, the act was overridden by Indonesia’s Ministry of Manpower, which postponed the workers’ arrival, citing concerns that it would spread coronavirus. Mohd Adhe Bhakti, the executive director of Indonesia’s Center for Radicalism and Deradicalization Studies, warned that if the Indonesian government fails to stand firm in denying the entry of foreign workers, especially the Chinese, to the country, terrorist attacks in the near future are “highly possible.” Speaking to the SCMP, Bhakti pointed to an attack on Monday of a police station in South Kalimantan, in which a police officer was killed with a sword by a group of suspected pro-Islamic State terrorists. The incident occurred on Pancasila Day, a public holiday celebrating the birth of Indonesia’s secular, national ideology. Bhakti says that the attack’s occurrence on a national holiday was no coincidence, as terrorists prefer to stage attacks on dates of symbolic significance. He advised Indonesians to remain alert to future terror attacks on major holidays. In the past, jihadis have planned or carried out terror attacks during the Christmas holiday and on New Year’s Eve. Last Christmas, the Indonesian government deployed 200,000 police officers to guard against threats of violent attacks from jihadis during the Christian holiday.

In a unanimous 7-0 decision, the Michigan Supreme Court sided with 77-year-old barber Karl Manke over Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Friday. Whitmer and Attorney General Dana Nessel have been relentlessly pursuing Manke, attempting to force the closure of his shop during the coronavirus pandemic. Great Lakes News reported on Facebook late Friday that the Court ruled unanimously in favor of the Owosso barber — a stunning decision, given the narrow 4-3 ideological split in favor of conservatives.  According to Great Lakes News, Manke’s attorney, David Kallman, called it the “biggest, most lopsided victory of his career.” Whitmer and Nessel fined Manke and stripped him of his license after he repeatedly refused to close his business in defiance of Whitmer’s executive orders. A Michigan Court of Appeals upheld that Manke’s license suspension was valid, but the Supreme Court decision reversed that. Manke was defiant after the Appeals Court ruling and told WILX, “I’m still open, still working until they cut my hands off.” Breitbart News caught up with Manke during the recent “Operation Haircut” protest. He said the response during the protest and the support for his stand was “overwhelming,” and called himself “a Michigan small town barber that just wants to work.” “This is an oppressive move on this governor’s part,” Manke said, observing that it “reflects almost a police state.” “I refuse to stand down on this,” he said. “I wasn’t this rock star three weeks ago,” Manke told Breitbart News, but Whitmer made him one. He thanked God for the development. “I’m still standing up. I still have that courage,” Manke said. Manke’s full speech at the protest was aired on The Kyle Olson Show:  Kyle Olson is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Chinese authorities are concealing information surrounding yet another outbreak of the Chinese coronavirus in northeastern Harbin, according to local residents who spoke with the Epoch Times. Residents told the Times that they knew of at least five people who have died of the coronavirus whose cases authorities have not disclosed publicly. One interviewee under treatment added that, at one hospital, there are around 30 patients who are yet to make a full recovery and remain in isolation. The statements contradict Chinese officials, who claim that the last coronavirus patient was discharged on May 16 from the hospital where he was being treated. “We are very anxious, but the doctors said they have no solutions,” patient Zhang Lng was quoted as saying. “They didn’t give us any medicine, and are hoping our bodies recover by ourselves.” The virus began spreading in the central Chinese city of Wuhan last year and spread across the country before infecting people around the world. Having been the first country to face the pandemic, Chinese health officials declared in April that they had largely defeated the virus and could begin returning to life as normal. However, there have been multiple reports of allegedly minor outbreaks spreading across several Chinese provinces, including Heilongjiang, of which Harbin is the capital. Communist officials appear eager to cover these up, presumably to strengthen the narrative that China was one of just a handful of countries to successfully manage and eradicate the virus. Last month, the Chinese Communist Party’s senior medical advisor warned that the country could face a second wave outbreak of infections due to a lack of immunity among the broader population. “The majority of … Chinese at the moment are still susceptible to the Covid-19 infection, because of a lack of immunity,” Zhong Nanshan, the Communist Party’s most prominent medical mouthpiece during the outbreak, told CNN. “We are facing a big challenge. It’s not better than the foreign countries I think at the moment.” China is widely understood to have covered up key information about the virus before it threatened the world, a decision that likely cost thousands of lives and enormous damage to the global economy. A recently leaked report compiled by the Five Eyes intelligence alliance determined that the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) turned a blind eye as Chinese authorities went about “disappearing” whistle-blowing doctors, censored information about the outbreak, destroyed samples of the virus in laboratories, and refused to hand over samples to international experts, thus delaying ongoing efforts to develop a cure or a vaccine for the virus.

During an interview with WTOP on Friday, White House Coronavirus Task Force member Dr. Anthony Fauci stated that the recent protests are “a perfect setup for further spread” of coronavirus and told people “if you can avoid the demonstration, if you can, fine. If you can’t, make sure you wear a mask.” Fauci responded to a question on what goes through his mind when he sees crowds gathering and people being hit with tear gas and other things that cause them to cough on each other by stating, “What runs through my mind is what does every time I hear about or see the congregation of large crowds at a time and in an area — a geographic area where clearly there is active infection transmission. It’s a perfect setup for further spread of the virus in the sense of creating these blips, which might turn into some surges. So, I get very concerned, as my colleagues in public health, when they see these kinds of crowds. I mean, obviously, not only are they congregating physically close to each other. But often, when they start screaming and demonstrating, which is part of the process of demonstrating, I’m not criticizing that, but I’m saying what it’s going to be leading to is a likelihood that you might have situations where you would force the spread of infection, and that’s really of concern.” Fauci declined to say that such a scenario is “likely. … But there certainly is a risk. I would say that with confidence, that when you have the congregation of crowds, as we’ve been seeing now. I mean, I’m here in Washington, D.C., and you look at the TV, and you see what’s going on, particularly, and the situation in which there is a lot of confusion and some — a little bit of chaos, people running back and forth, taking their masks off, being close in proximity. That absolutely poses a risk that there might be spread of infection.” He added that people have the right to demonstrate, “but it’s a delicate balance. Because the reasons for demonstrating are valid, and yet, the demonstration itself puts one at an additional risk. So, the only thing we can do as public health officials is to keep warning people, be careful. If you are going to go out, please make sure you wear a mask, and you keep the mask on at all times. Because I’ve seen, on TV, as the demonstrations start to heat up, people might take their masks off when they’re starting to yell and scream and demonstrate. Keep your mask on. First of all, if you can avoid the demonstration, if you can, fine. If you can’t, make sure you wear a mask.” (h/t Business Insider) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

The Las Vegas strip began to breathe new life on Thursday as some casinos started to reopen after 78 days without gambling because of the Chinese coronavirus lockdown. In the wee hours of Thursday, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported: Nevada casinos reopened for gaming at 12:01 am. Thursday, ushering in guests eager to try their luck 78 days after resorts were closed because of the COVID-19 [disease caused by the coronavirus] pandemic. Certain amenities, including buffets and shows, remain closed. Not all properties will reopen Thursday, and those that do will follow a new set of health and safety protocols. Guests can expect to see lots of plexiglass, masks, and social distancing reminders.    The Las Vegas casinos that opened their doors did so as part of Nevada’s phase two reopening process, which began May 29. Yahoo Finance noted: Led by the reopening of casinos held by Wynn Resorts, Caesars Entertainment, MGM Resorts, and Las Vegas Sands, Thursday marked a return to operations at many of Sin City’s most frequented attractions. Even MGM’s famed Bellagio’s fountains were roaring again to the tune of Elvis’ Viva Las Vegas. But as the coronavirus pandemic threat continues, analysts are warning that a total return to normalcy for gaming stocks might not be as quick as hoped. Despite a slow trickle back to booking activity, Morningstar senior equity analyst Dan Wasiolek estimates it could take until 2023 before Las Vegas revenues return to pre-COVID-19 levels.

Amazon has reversed its refusal to publish an e-book from author and former New York Times reporter Alex Berenson, a prominent critic of the ongoing Chinese virus lockdowns. The e-commerce giant chose to approve Berenson’s book following coverage from Breitbart News, as well as backlash from figures on social media including Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk. In its email to Berenson, Amazon initially informed the author that it would not be publishing the book. “Due to the rapidly changing nature of information around the COVID-19 virus, we are referring customers to official sources for health information about the virus. Please consider removing references to COVID-19 for this book,” said Amazon. Berenson told Breitbart News that his book, Unreported Truths About COVID-19 And Lockdowns Part 1: Introductions and Death Counts and Estimates, was merely “an introduction and a discussion of death coding, death counts, and who is really dying from COVID, as well as a worst-case estimate of deaths with no mitigation efforts.” “I briefly considered censorship but assumed I wouldn’t have a problem both because of my background, because anyone who reads the booklet will realize it is impeccably sourced, nary a conspiracy theory to be found, and frankly because Amazon shouldn’t be censoring anything that doesn’t explicitly help people commit criminal behavior.” Amazon spokeswoman Sarah Elison now says the book was removed in error, according to the Washington Post.  On Twitter, Musk called Amazon’s decision “insane” and called for the online retailer to be broken up, calling it a “monopoly.” Time to break up Amazon. Monopolies are wrong! — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 4, 2020  “I think Elon’s decision to highlight the censorship spurred Amazon to move quickly. It’s possible they would have backed down eventually, but his tweets made their position indefensible,” said Berenson.

NBC News’ Peter Alexander, a member of the White House Press Corps, shouted a question at President Donald Trump during a Rose Garden press conference on Friday morning: “How would a better economy have protected George Floyd?” The president held the conference to celebrate Friday’s unexpectedly good May jobs report, showing that the U.S. economy had added 2.5 million jobs, rather than losing some 8 million jobs, as expected. The unemployment rate fell to 13.3% rather than rising to 20%. After the president finished his remarks, he prepared to sign an extension to the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which the administration credited for much of the rebound in the jobs numbers. Trump said that a growing economy was “the greatest thing that can happen for race relations.” Shortly thereafter, NBC’s Alexander shouted his question: “”How would a better economy have protected George Floyd?” Floyd was killed by police on Memorial Day, after he was arrested for allegedly trying to use a counterfeit $20 bill. He had lost his job due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Chicago Tribune noted: Before he died after being pinned for minutes beneath a Minneapolis police officer’s knee, George Floyd was suffering the same fate as millions of Americans during the coronavirus pandemic: out of work and looking for a new job. Floyd moved to Minneapolis from his native Houston several years ago in hopes of finding work and starting a new life, said Christopher Harris, Floyd’s lifelong friend. But he lost his job as a bouncer at a restaurant when Minnesota’s governor issued a stay-at-home order.
… Harris said Floyd was laid off when Minnesota shut down restaurants as part of a stay-at-home order. He said he spoke with Floyd on Sunday night and gave him some information for contacting a temporary jobs agency. The president did not take that question, or any other. An undated photo provided to the Associated Press by a friend of Floyd’s showed him at work as a security guard: This undated file photo provided by Christopher Harris shows George Floyd. Floyd died May 25, after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck until he stopped breathing. (Christopher Harris via AP, File) Many of the new jobs consisted of people returning to their workplaces after temporary layoffs due to the pandemic. Black unemployment remained steady in May, despite improvements for whites and Hispanics. Joel B.

Catholic League president Bill Donohue slammed New York mayor Bill de Blasio Friday for his irrational coronavirus lockdown rules and anti-religious animus. Dr. Donohue underscored the arbitrary nature of de Blasio’s provisions on what is allowed and not allowed in New York City during coronavirus. While the mayor has severely curtailed religious practice in the city, he has defended the rights of citizens to form huge gatherings to protest, even violently, and obviously without social distancing or masks (except perhaps antifa masks). “What if, instead of protesting, a very small group of people want to go to a church, synagogue, mosque, or temple?” Donohue asked. “They don’t want to protest, just pray. They pledge to stay six feet apart. They promise not to engage in violence. Can they do so? No.” When a reporter for a Jewish newspaper called out the mayor for the irony of allowing throngs to take to the streets in a mass assembly, but denying permission for a small church service, he got indignant, Donohue notes. “Four hundred years of American racism, I’m sorry, that is not the same question as the understandably aggrieved store owner or the devout religious person who wants to go back to services,” de Blasio replied. The upshot, Donohue writes, is that de Blasio has decided to “privilege” protesters, many of whom are well-off white folks, “all because he thinks that protesting racism justifies jettisoning his shutdown.” The hypocrisy grows even thicker because of the mayor’s own, well-known racism, Donohue notes, since he has adopted racial quotas, repeatedly promoting policies that discriminate against Asian Americans by denying them seats in New York’s public schools. De Blasio has also denied black and Hispanic parents the advantages of school choice, quashing the opportunities for charter schools and other avenues toward educational advancement. Perhaps most disturbing, however, is the mayor’s hostility toward religious faith. “This is a man who raised money for the communists in Nicaragua when he was young, and traveled, illegally, to Castro’s Cuba for his honeymoon, lying to his own children about where it took place,” Donohue writes. The mayor also boycotted the St. Patrick’s Day Parade for years and recently lashed out at Rev. Franklin Graham “because the minister thinks marriage should be between a man and a woman.” “This is the profile of an extremist,” Donohue concludes. “He throws the health of New Yorkers overboard to allow for a jammed protest he likes, and then invokes his health edict to ban people of faith from attending their house of worship.” Follow @tdwilliamsrome

The Supreme leader of Afghan terror group the Taliban may have recently died from the coronavirus, Afghanistan’s Khaama Press reported on Tuesday, citing information from a report by the American magazine Foreign Policy. According to the report, sources with knowledge of development within the Taliban’s ranks confirmed to Foreign Policy that the jihadi leader Mullah Hibatullah Akhundzada tested positive for coronavirus. The acting director of the Taliban’s military operations, Mawlavi Mohammad Ali Jan Ahmad, told the magazine Akhundzada is “sick but is recovering.” Khaama Press points out that at least three other Taliban figures told Foreign Policy under the condition of anonymity that Akhundzada died while receiving treatment for coronavirus symptoms. The Taliban has refused to officially comment on its leader’s health status so far. According to Khaama Press, recent unconfirmed reports indicate that Mullah Yaqoob, the son of the Taliban’s late founder, Mullah Mohammad Omar, has been appointed as the interim leader of the Taliban, further strengthening support of the claims that Akhundzada has died. Reports last month indicated that Mullah Yaqoob had been appointed as the Taliban’s military chief following a reorganization of the terrorist group’s leadership, suggesting Yaqoob was already primed to assume a top role. News of the Taliban leadership shuffle comes shortly after the Afghan government released hundreds of Taliban prisoners last week in response to a reportedly unexpected ceasefire called by the Taliban during the Islamic holiday weekend known as Eid al-Fitr at the end of May. On May 26, the Afghan government said it planned to release 900 Taliban prisoners in the following days. The Afghan government says it expects the Taliban to reciprocate by releasing members of Afghan security forces currently detained by the terrorist group. The prisoner exchange was proposed in February by the U.S. as a way to build goodwill between the two sides; the Taliban refuses to recognize Afganistan’s government as legitimate, claiming it is the country’s true ruler. This has lead to repeated breakdowns in peace talks set up by foreign supporters of a peaceful Afghanistan, such as the U.S.

Zimbabwe police arrested 1,312 people nationwide on Tuesday for violating coronavirus quarantine measures as authorities reinforce lockdown restrictions, Zimbabwe’s state-owned newspaper The Herald reported on Thursday. National police spokesman Paul Nyathi confirmed Tuesday’s arrests to the newspaper. Security officials cited a “growing laxity” in people’s adherence to restrictions on movement as the main reason for the high number of arrests over the 24-hour period. Since March 31, law enforcement officials in Zimbabwe have arrested a total of 52,041 people for violating quarantine measures. According to the report, Zimbabwe police said they are making “special efforts” to track down escapees from coronavirus quarantine centers, a growing problem in the country that poses a major public health risk. On May 29, Zimbabwe police said they were “hunting down” over 100 people who escaped quarantine centers, which the national health minister referred to as “our source of danger” when describing the breakouts at the time. On Thursday, authorities said 158 people had escaped from quarantine and police had tracked down and arrested 26 of them. Police have also been cracking down on people entering the country illegally and said they had arrested 97 “border jumpers.” Zimbabwe requires people returning from abroad to enter a 21-day quarantine period at state-run quarantine centers to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Nearly all of Zimbabwe’s new coronavirus cases last week were linked to these quarantine centers. They reportedly hold hundreds of people returning to the country from abroad, sometimes involuntarily. Most of Zimbabwe’s returning travelers left the country seeking work in neighboring South Africa, the regional economic hub, or in Botswana, with which it also shares a border. “The total number of escapees from various quarantine centers in provinces across the country is now 158,” Nyathi said on Thursday. “Escapees who have been arrested are now 26 following the arrest of a 40-year-old woman who absconded from Vuti Quarantine Center in Mashonaland West. Since May 16, police have arrested 97 border jumpers and smugglers.” “We continue to urge the public to be health and security conscious and assist the police and other security services in the maintenance of law and order,” Nyathi added. On Tuesday, Zimbabwe’s government ordered troops and police to reinforce coronavirus lockdown measures in the capital, Harare, amid a recent surge in coronavirus infections which had “more than tripled” to 203 as of June 2, according to national health authorities.

The unemployment rate fell to 13.3 percent and payrolls unexpectedly rose by 2.5 million workers as the easing of restrictions on business activity and government aid led to new hiring in May. The U.S. unemployment rate fell below last month’s record-high 14.7 percent, which was the highest on record in data going back to 1948. Economists estimate that the unemployment rate reached 25 percent during the Great Depression, although that predated the scientific economy-wide record keeping the government now deploys. The job gains mark a sudden turnaround from a month earlier, when the economy shed a staggering 20.5 million jobs, by far the worst monthly decline on records back to 1939. Economists had expected the unemployment rate to rise to nearly 20 percent and the economy to shed an additional 8 million jobs. The mandatory closures of many businesses and stay-at-home orders slammed what had been a very healthy labor market hard. The economy added jobs for 113 straight weeks through February, a record streak of growth. The unemployment rate was 3.5 percent in February. And yet job creation was running very hot, with the economy adding an average of 211,000 new jobs each month. The government has undertaken unprecedented efforts to support employment and provide aid to those who have lost their jobs. Around 150 million taxpayers received stimulus payments of up to $1200 for adults in their household plus additional amounts for children. The Treasury’s Paycheck Protection Program is backing $669 billion of loans to small businesses that can be forgiven if borrowers do not lay off workers. The federal government has been providing an additional $600 on top of state unemployment benefits, paying some Americans more than they earned on the job. Recent data suggest the labor market has been stabilizing and is now improving. The number of people applying for unemployment benefits has declined every week since hitting a record high 6.8 million in March. Last week, this number fell to around 1.8 million. Over 40 million new claims have been made for unemployment since the wave but ongoing claims are just over 20 million, indicating many Americans have been rehired after losing jobs. In May, employment in leisure and hospitality jumped by 1.2 million after falling by 7.5 million in April and 743,000 in March. Bars and restaurants hired an additional 1.4 million workers following a combined 6.1 million in job losses in April and March. Construction employment jumped by 464,000 in May, gaining back almost half of April’s decline. Dentist offices added 245,000 jobs. Health care employment overall rose by 312,00. Retail shops added  368,000 jobs in May, after a loss of 2.3 million inApril. Over-the-month job gains occurred in clothing and clothing accessories stores were 95,000. Auto dealers added 85,000. General merchandise stores added 84,000. Manufacturers added 225,000 jobs, about evenly split between the durable and nondurable goods components. Twenty-eight thousand of those were in auto making plants.

“When the facts change,” said 20th-century economist John Maynard Keynes, “I change my mind.” State governors and public health officials should follow this example in light of recent CDC data showing that Covid-19 is much less deadly than originally thought. The CDC recently revised its death rate estimate down to just 0.4 percent. And for many demographics, it is far less than that. Public officials should pivot from “flattening the curve” to “flattening the fear.” The data demonstrate that younger and otherwise healthy Americans face little risk of dying from this disease. Most people should immediately get back to living their daily lives without fear, boosting our beleaguered economy. One percent of counties in the country account for more than half of all Covid deaths. Ten percent of counties account for more than 90 percent of all deaths. Nearly half of the counties in the country haven’t experienced a single coronavirus death. Yet safe counties are often beholden to state reopening timelines based on conditions in major cities where Covid is often far more prevalent. Keeping these areas that have been relatively untouched by the coronavirus closed for business is a violation of residents’ basic civil liberties and is unnecessarily contributing to our dire economic situation. According to a recent analysis by Avik Roy at Forbes, 42 percent of all coronavirus deaths have come in nursing homes. In many states, nursing homes and assisted living facilities account for far more than half of all deaths—81 percent in Minnesota and 70 percent in Ohio. If governments pursued a tailored Covid response moving forward, protecting nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and the most vulnerable, we could dramatically reduce the Covid death rate while letting the vast majority of Americans resume something akin to a normal life. We can isolate the few to protect the many instead of isolating the many to protect the few. Like location, age is also a strong risk indicator. According to the most recent CDC data, more than 80 percent of all Covid deaths are among those over 65 years old. Those aged under 55 account for just seven percent of all Covid deaths. And the overwhelming majority of deaths are among those with at least one other underlying medical condition. It’s irrational for young and healthy people to live in fear of this disease. The original intent of flattening the curve was to not overwhelm our healthcare system. By working together, we have accomplished this goal. With this accomplished, government officials, business leaders, and the media must now flatten the fear—the consequences of which are just as dire as the disease. Our nation is paralyzed because people are paralyzed by fear. Over the last ten weeks, more than 40 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits, and one-third of small businesses won’t reopen. These numbers represent real people with lost paychecks and shattered dreams. Economic consequences breed societal problems. Alcohol and drug abuse have skyrocketed, with hard liquor sales up by about 75 percent. Prescriptions for anti-anxiety medication are up by about one-third. Community experts worry about associated spikes in domestic violence and suicides. The national Disaster Distress Helpline saw a 338 percent increase in call volume in March compared with February. Suicide rates generally rise by about one percent for every one percentage point increase in unemployment. Patients are avoiding necessary care due to unnecessary hospital restrictions against seeing non-emergency patients. Oncologists, who treat cancer patients, have recently seen their patient counts fall by nearly half. Sadly, we will have more victims of Covid who never had the virus. Extending stay-at-home orders could cause “irreparable damage,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the lead member of the White House coronavirus task force, on May 22nd. “I don’t want people to think that any of us feel that staying locked down for a prolonged period of time is the way to go.” The facts are in. Covid poses a low risk to ordinary Americans, yet Covid fear poses an enormous risk to our society. Flattening the fear will not only save lives and livelihoods but help prevent the unraveling of the fabric of American life. Alfredo Ortiz is the president and CEO of the Job Creators Network. C.L.

TEL AVIV – Eighty-seven schools around Israel have closed over coronavirus cases and nearly 10,000 students and staff members are in quarantine.  Of those, 300 people have been diagnosed to be sick with the virus, the Education Ministry said. The development comes amid an uptick in cases that began last week with 115 new infections in a 24-hour period – the highest in a month. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday announced “any school where a virus case is diagnosed will close.” the Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement. In addition, foreigners on their post-high school gap year, including yeshiva and seminary students, will no longer be permitted to enter the country, Interior Minister Arye Deri announced. The statement from Netanyahu’s officer said the prime minister had “directed Education Minister Galant to work on achieving solutions for protection and distancing for pupils and teaching staff. Cases that are found will continue to be dealt with. The Prime Minister instructed that the situation be monitored and assessed.” Gallant maintained the current infection rates do not justify shutting all schools down and added that doing so constituted “an irresponsible blow to students, parents and teachers.” Israel had 17,429 confirmed cases and 291 deaths as of Thursday morning.

On Thursday’s broadcast of CNBC’s “Mad Money,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) touted the Heroes Act and said that “If we want to open up the economy, and we all do, we need to defeat the virus, and that’s testing, tracing, treatment, and isolation.” Pelosi said, “Well, first of all, let me just say that the Heroes Act is an answer, in many ways, to the challenge that our economy faces. If we want to open up the economy, and we all do, we need to defeat the virus, and that’s testing, tracing, treatment, and isolation. And we don’t have a vaccine and we don’t have a cure, but we do have a method to defeat the vaccine – excuse me, the virus. And we have to do that. So, that’s one way to open the economy.” She continued, “The other way is to honor our heroes. Let’s keep these people working. The money that we’re putting into state and local governments to pay our healthcare workers, our first responders, our sanitation, transportation, teachers, and the rest are keeping people working. Otherwise, the states will have to fire some and raise taxes or some combination thereof. So, this is about the economy. It’s about stimulus. And the third is putting money in people’s pockets.” Pelosi later added that she wants to see money spent “to bolster the working families in America who have lost their jobs because of no fault of their own, whom [the] virus is debilitating in terms of getting the economy moving again, until we test, trace, treat, and isolate, as we wear our masks.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

Riots erupted in Western Mexico where protesters set fire to one police officer and physically clashed with several others. Rioters also set fire to multiple police vehicles. The incidents were not over the BLM protests in America, but to protest the death of a local day laborer who was allegedly killed by police for not wearing a coronavirus mask. The riots began on Thursday evening in Guadalajara, Jalisco, when hundreds of protesters took to the streets demanding justice over the death of Alejandro Giovanni Lopez at the hands of local police officers in May.

While state officials did not reveal the violation behind the arrest, relatives claim it was for not wearing a coronavirus facemask. Police officers are believed to have beaten and tortured Lopez until he eventually died. One of Lopez’s relatives took a video of the arrest and shared it on social media where the police officers can be seen striking the day laborer.

During the week, the case gained national attention in Mexico and even Oscar-winning director Guillermo Del Toro took to social media to demand justice and to invite the public to protest. @FiscaliaJal @EnriqueAlfaroR @CNDH @FGRMexico A mas de un mes, no hay respuestas, no hay arrestos.

Amazon failed to protect its employees from the coronavirus at a New York warehouse facility, according to a lawsuit filed by three employees from the warehouse. AFP reported that the complaint filed in federal court Wednesday said the “relentless pace of work at Amazon facilities” led to poor working conditions and that company policies “discourage workers from leaving their workstations to wash their hands and from taking the time to wipe down their workstations.” The legal action comes after one employee from Amazon’s Staten Island, New York, facility was fired for speaking out about the company’s response to the coronavirus. Amazon, however, claimed the employee was disobeying protocol about what to do in the pandemic. One of the three workers in the suit claimed they caught coronavirus “from workers who were explicitly or implicitly encouraged to continue attending work and prevented from adequately washing their hands or sanitizing their workstations,” according to the lawsuit. The three workers and their families are seeking a number of changes, including a more transparent leave and sick time policy, better contact tracing for infected workers, and back pay for quarantine leave. The complaint alleges that Amazon continued to allow workers on the job even after they made contact with infected individuals. Amazon, which received high praise during the early part of the pandemic for hiring 175,000 additional employees to deal with increased demand, says it has improved its health and safety at its facilities. “We are saddened by the tragic impact COVID-19 has had on communities across the globe, including on some Amazon team members and their family and friends. From early March to May 1, we offered our employees unlimited time away from work, and since May 1 we have offered leave for those most vulnerable or who need to care for children or family members,” a spokesperson for the tech giant said in a statement. “We also invested $4 billion from April to June on COVID-related initiatives,” the statement continued, “including over $800 million in the first half of this year on safety measures like temperature checks, masks, gloves, enhanced cleaning and sanitization, extended pay and benefits options, testing, and more. This includes two weeks paid leave for any COVID diagnosis or quarantine, and launching a $25 million fund to support our partners and contractors.” But Amazon has had trouble putting its money where its mouth is. The company recently ended hazard pay for its warehouse workers instituted after the outbreak of the coronavirus while Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos had a net worth increase of $32 billion since January. The company’s record on censorship has also led much to be desired. Amazon recently banned a book about the coronavirus from lockdown critic Alex Berenson after Bezos and company suggested that he, “Please consider removing references to COVID-19 for this book.” When Berenson refused, they banned his book from being featured on Amazon’s Kindle Direct Service.

Beijing’s decision to hide the severity of the novel coronavirus during the early stages of the outbreak, a move that allowed the disease to spill over to other countries, has rendered communist China an “existential threat” to the globe, a survivor of the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre proclaimed on Wednesday. China is the birthplace of the lethal and highly contagious Chinese coronavirus. Referring to China’s coronavirus “cover-up” during a Tiananmen remembrance event online on Wednesday hosted by Students for a Free Tibet, Fengsuo Zhou, a survivor of the massacre and founder of Humanitarian China, declared, “With this communist party in power, the world is doom to repeat such a disaster.” “This totalitarian regime, its globalization, and digital power, it cannot coexist with the universal values we love,” he added.  “Today’s China, under the CCP [Chinese Communist Party], it has become an existential threat to the world because there’s a pandemic we are all suffering from all over the world,” the Tiananmen massacre survivor explained. “This was because of a cover-up because there’s no freedom of people who can talk. There’s no way.” His comments came on the eve of the 31st anniversary of the incident in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square in which Chinese communist troops thwarted student-led protests in a bloody crackdown on June 4 and 5, 1989. Demonstrators were calling for democracy, free speech, and a free press, among other things. Although there is no official count, as the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has endeavored to keep precise information about the incident a secret, estimates place the number of casualties in the thousands. Alluding to China’s muzzling of whistleblower doctors who did not toe the CCP line of keeping silent about COVID-19, Zhou noted during the event on Wednesday: Even the doctors, for example, very early [in the coronavirus outbreak], end of last year, Dr. Li Wenliang, discovered that this was striking like SARS [Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome]. He raised alarms to his internal circle — his friends, and family – warning them and he was censored. Later he died of it, months later, and that’s why it spread to so many people and now. So many killed and so many infected. Health officials have named the coronavirus itself SARS CoV-2. The Trump administration has lambasted Beijing for allowing the lethal and highly contagious novel coronavirus to spread by mismanaging its response and covering up the extent of the outbreak during its early stages, with the help of the China-influenced World Health Organization (W.H.O.), a United Nations entity. U.S. intelligence and independent assessments have determined that China did cover up the severity of the coronavirus. Beijing reportedly muzzled and jailed whistleblowers and critics in a move that allowed the disease to spread and ravage other countries. Both China, the birthplace of the novel coronavirus, and the W.H.O. have denied the assertions. In late May, Trump announced he was severing ties with the W.H.O., ending U.S. taxpayer-funded aid to the U.N. agency for not doing enough to stop the spread of the virus. America is the agency’s top source of funding. The Trump administration has also taken action to prevent China from stealing research for vaccines and treatments to combat the Chinese coronavirus.

Chinese dissidents and human rights advocates gathered online Wednesday evening for a candlelight vigil to remember those killed during the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, urging the world not to look away or tolerate communist China’s crimes. The Victims of Communism Memorial Fund, a human rights organization dedicated to carrying the memory of those afflicted by left-wing totalitarianism, organized and broadcast the event. Given ongoing Chinese coronavirus social distancing measures, speakers “attended” the event from separate locations. The event occurred in the shadow of vandals, acting amid a nationwide wave of radical leftist violence, defacing Washington, DC’s, Victims of Communism memorial – a statue of the “Goddess of Liberty,” which Tiananmen protesters hoisted in the square before the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) rolled its tanks in.  In addition to discussing the lasting legacy of the pro-democracy advocates killed on June 4, 1989, in Beijing, the speakers noted that the communist policies that led to the complete erasure of the Tiananmen Square massacre from the Chinese internet, Chinese history books, and the Chinese public memory in the country are behind the obfuscation that resulted in extended delays in alerting the world to the potential threat of the newly discovered coronavirus in Wuhan, China. “Unfortunately, the evil regime of the Chinese Communist Party [CCP] is still raging on the land of China, and it is still using brutal and cruel methods to suppress and persecute the Chinese people,” Chen Guangcheng, a Chinese human rights attorney and former political prisoner, said at the vigil. “Not only we must not forget the CCP’s June 4th massacre, but we must also record each and every crime that the CCP has done to persecute the Chinese people over the past 30 years, and be prepared to hold them accountable.” “The appeasement policy must come to an end,” he added. Chen made the case that the communist regime’s “existence poses great threats to the freedom, security, and health of the people around the world. … in short, if the CCP evil regime is not destroyed, the world would not have real security and freedom.” “When a regime runs roughshod on its own people, it will sooner or later bring disasters beyond its border in one way or another,” Jianli Yang, the founder and president of Citizen Power Initiatives for China, said at the event, making the argument that an appropriated outraged global responses to the Tiananmen massacre would have prevented an emboldened China from deceiving the world on the coronavirus pandemic. “It is a well-established fact that if, when the coronavirus first broke out in Wuhan, there had been any space in society and government to sound the alarm – if the government had not suppressed the truth and misled the world – hundreds of thousands of lives would have been saved,” Yang said. “By the same token, if the Chinese communist regime, instead of slaughtering the Tiananmen protesters, had accepted their request of political reform, the world would not have been plunged into the catastrophe we are experiencing today.” Leaked Chinese documents show that the first diagnosed cases of novel coronavirus in Wuhan were identified in November 2019. China did not make public the discovery of a new virus until January, and multiple reports have revealed evidence that Beijing pressured the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) to hide evidence that the virus was transmissible from person to person. Pastor Bob Fu, the head of the Christian human rights organization China Aid, asserted that Beijing is using “the same pattern of lying, covering up, and afflicting so many millions of lives” in its response to the pandemic as it did with the crackdown in 1989. The Chinese Communist Party has been claiming [throughout] the past 31 years that nobody had been killed in Tiananmen Square, so they are good at telling lies and covering up,” Fu said. “A year ago, the Chinese communist regime unleashed this coronavirus, the Communist Party virus, to not only afflict millions of Chinese, but still afflicting millions, hundreds of millions of citizens around the globe.” “Because of that, millions of American children and throughout the world are not able to go to school. Millions of moms cannot send their children, cannot bring their children to churches, the synagogues, to mosques. This is a crime against humanity,” he affirmed. The Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation concluded the event by offering in absentia its Human Rights Award to Chen Qiushi, a citizen journalist who disappeared, likely detained by Chinese political police, while attempting to report on the reality in Wuhan at the height of the outbreak there. Participants then all lit candles in their homes in honor of those who died fighting for basic human dignity 31 years ago. Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.

On Thursday morning, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer told protesters to wear a mask and stay six feet apart. Later in the day, she appeared to violate her own rules. “I encourage everyone who is protesting, if you are out demonstrating or out congregating at all, please wear a mask and please try to stay six feet away from others,” she said on Mojo In The Morning. Whitmer, who is angling to be Joe Biden’s vice presidential running mate, participated in a protest in downtown Detroit over the death of George Floyd. She marched along as the closely packed large group chanted, “Hands up, don’t shoot,” and “This is what democracy looks like.” Whitmer, wearing a cloth mask, was standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Bishop Charles Ellis and Lt. Gov. Garland Gilchrist. VIDEO: Hundreds marching today in a walk to honor the life of George Floyd.

Tiffany Brown claimed the “unity march” didn’t violate Whitmer’s latest order because it states, “Nothing in this order shall be taken to abridge protections guaranteed by the state or federal constitution.” “That includes the right to peaceful protest,” she said.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer told radio show Mojo In The Morning on Thursday that she understands the “Defund Police” sentiment being pushed on social media by young people in the wake of George Floyd’s death. “What would the world be like without police?” Whitmer was asked by one of the hosts.  “I understand the frustration and the sentiment,” the governor responded, adding that “the youth of our country are going to take up the lead soon,” but that she’s “concerned about the sweeping observations people have.” The hosts noted U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) shared similar anti-police views on Twitter, such as this that she retweeted: Trump has given a green light to cops and militias to beat, maim and kill people with impunity.  He has now illegally activated the military to maintain power and use force on civilians. The red line has been crossed too many times.  He must resign.  Our lives depend on it. pic.twitter.com/DLmBwHKgfU — Movement 4 Black Lives (@Mvmnt4BlkLives) June 2, 2020  Whitmer touted quotas in the Michigan State Police, saying she has created an “equity and inclusion office,” which will increase minority applicants to “at least” 25 percent and the female trooper pool by 20 percent. As the appearance concluded, the governor was confronted by a caller who said he was “insulted” when Whitmer told residents that they should “Google” how to cut their own hair amid the ongoing lockdown of the state. He told her 49 other states are allowing salon services, a stat she disputed. “I made an off-hand comment about if you needed a trim you could Google it,” Whitmer said. She said barbers and stylists are “professionals.” “If my comment offended people, I do apologize for that. It certainly wasn’t my intent.” The caller also asked Whitmer what data she is looking at to inform her decisions. She didn’t answer that question. Kyle Olson is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) on Thursday said he is hoping to “get to ‘yes'” on having the Sunshine State host the Republican National Convention in August. “But to just rule out a convention at this stage, I think, is a mistake,” DeSantis said during a Thursday appearance on Fox & Friends. “So we’ve said we want to get to ‘yes’ on it, and I think you’ll be able to do it.” “We understand that there’s a virus. What can we do to be able to have activity in a way that’s safe?” the governor, who is moving the bulk of the state to stage two of reopening on Friday, told the network. “To just say no to everything, I don’t think is going to work. So we want to be able to do it, and I think we could do it in a safe way,” he added, urging officials to “be creative”: The last thing you would want is [for] delegates [to] go and end up getting ill … but I think that there’s probably ways we can do it. So, ‘We want to get to yes on it’ has basically been my message. Let’s be creative, and let’s figure out a way to do it. President Trump on Tuesday announced that he is in search of a different place to host the upcoming Republican National Convention — an announcement that followed North Carolina officials failing to guarantee that the convention would be able to proceed in Charlotte as planned due to coronavirus-related concerns: Had long planned to have the Republican National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, a place I love.

The convention is slated to take place August 24-27.

No new cases of the novel coronavirus have been reported among those who flocked to the Lake of the Ozarks over Memorial Day weekend, a top Missouri health official revealed on Wednesday. “The answer, to our knowledge, is no,” Dr. Randall Williams, Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, said on Wednesday when asked if there were emerging cases stemming from the crowded weekend. Concerns escalated after throngs of partygoers flocked to the Lake of the Ozarks, ignoring both social distancing guidelines and the broader call to avoid large crowds. One of the attendees, who reportedly visited various bars, restaurants, and an outdoor swimming pool, later tested positive for the virus and may have been contagious during the getaway: No covid concerns at the lake of the ozarks😳 #loto pic.twitter.com/Yrb4UNM64u — Scott Pasmore (@scottpasmoretv) May 24, 2020  Positive COVID-19 patient was at crowded Lake of the Ozarks bars over Memorial Day weekend https://t.co/L5AASU2YBR — KMOV (@KMOV) May 29, 2020  At the time, the St. Louis Metropolitan Pandemic Task Force warned that the crowds could cause “needless suffering and potential strain to our health care systems.” “Without a doubt, this type of activity, this type of behavior increases the risk of transmission, which means it can only go in one direction,” Dr. Alex Garza said at the time. St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson also sharply criticized the crowds, deeming their actions “irresponsible and dangerous.” Despite that — and the lack of adherence to guidelines, no new cases stemming from the Lake of the Ozarks partiers have been reported. According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, during Wednesday’s press conference, officials also detailed the overall decrease in positive cases and the “big drop in the number of hospitalizations from COVID-19.” “Our hospitals are not overwhelmed. Our positivity rate continues to decline. People are recovering, and we are moving forward,” Gov. Mike Parson (R) said. The revelation comes as protests, sparked by the death of George Floyd, broke out in the streets after weeks of lockdown orders and social distancing guidelines, which warn against large gatherings. “We don’t know what will happen to these numbers after we see the results of lots of people being together in very large groups during the demonstrations and protests,” Mayor Krewson said, signaling concern. “Some folks were wearing masks, some folks weren’t. But certainly, folks were not social distancing,” she added. “So we’ll see — fingers crossed — let’s hope that doesn’t result in a big bump up.” “As far as whether hospitals are able to breathe a sigh of relief after Memorial Day gatherings, Garza said officials ‘will give it a couple more days,'” the Dispatch added.

A person with knowledge of the situation says the NBA’s Board of Governors has approved a 22-team format for restarting the league season in late July at the Disney campus near Orlando, Florida. The format calls for each team playing eight games to determine playoff seeding plus the possible utilization of a play-in tournament for the final spot in the Eastern Conference and Western Conference postseason fields, said the person who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Thursday because the league had not yet revealed the vote result publicly. It is the most significant step yet in the process of trying to resume a season that was suspended nearly three months ago because of the coronavirus pandemic. There are numerous other details for the league to continue working through — including finalizing specifics of what the testing plan will be once teams arrive next month at the ESPN Wide World Of Sports complex and the calculating the financial ramifications of playing a shortened regular season. Another person, also speaking to AP on condition of anonymity because the details of the ongoing talks have not been publicly released, said the National Basketball Players Association and the NBA are continuing to work on a “lengthy” medical protocols document. The details of that document will be shared with teams once those discussions are completed, said the person, who added that teams should receive them in plenty of time for them to prepare for expected mid-July arrivals at the Disney-ESPN complex. If all 22 teams that are going to Disney play their allotted eight games before the postseason begins, the NBA would play 1,059 games in this regular season. That means 171 regular season games would be canceled, which could cost players around $600 million in salary. Those 22 clubs would play somewhere between 71 and 75 regular season games if the Disney portion of the schedule is completed, down from the customary 82-game slate. The teams who didn’t qualify for the restart will see their seasons end after having played somewhere between 64 and 67 games. But one of the biggest hurdles is now cleared, and if things go according to plan an NBA champion for a season unlike any other will be crowned in October. The season could go into that month if the league goes ahead with its plan for the same playoff rules as usual, that being every round utilizing a best-of-seven format. Thursday’s move by the board of governors — one that came, coincidentally, on the same day this season’s NBA Finals would have started if these were normal times — was largely a formality. The NBA considered countless restart options after suspending the season on March 11, whittled that list down to four possibilities last week and from there the 22-team plan quickly began gaining momentum. The 22-team plan includes all teams that were holding playoff spots when the season was stopped, plus all other clubs within six games of a postseason berth. Milwaukee, the Los Angeles Lakers, Boston and reigning NBA champion Toronto had already clinched playoff berths. Now with only eight games remaining for each team, it means that eight other clubs — Miami, Indiana, Philadelphia, the Los Angeles Clippers, Denver, Utah, Oklahoma City and Houston — have postseason spots secured, and Dallas virtually has one as well. That leaves nine teams vying for three remaining playoff berths. In the East, Brooklyn, Orlando and Washington are in the race for two spots. In the West, Memphis, Portland, New Orleans, Sacramento, San Antonio and Phoenix will jostle for one spot. If the gap between eighth place and ninth place in either conference is four games or less when the shortened regular season ends, those teams will go head-to-head for the No. 8 seed. The team in ninth place would have to go 2-0 in a two-game series to win the berth; otherwise, the No. 8 seed would advance to the postseason. Thursday’s decision also means that the seasons for Atlanta, Cleveland, New York, Golden State, Minnesota, Detroit, Chicago and Charlotte are over. The Knicks will miss the playoffs for the seventh consecutive season, the third-longest current drought in the league behind Sacramento and Phoenix — who still have chances of getting into the playoffs this season. And with the Hawks not moving on, it also means Vince Carter has almost certainly played the final game of his 22-year NBA career — the longest in league history. Carter, the first player in NBA history to appear in four different decades, has steadfastly insisted that he is retiring after this season. He appeared in 1,541 NBA games, behind only Robert Parish (1,611) and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (1,560) on the league’s all-time list.

The vast majority of counties in Florida are moving into the next stage of reopening on Friday, Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) announced on Wednesday. Almost the entire state will be moving into the second phase of reopening after a month in phase one. Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach, which were hit particularly hard by the novel coronavirus, will be excluded. However, they can seek approval to enter into the second phase of reopening with a letter from the county mayor or administrator. DeSantis explained on Wednesday: We started with phase one about a month ago but we only did the 64 counties, excluding the three large southeast Florida counties and the reason why we did that was those southeast Florida counties represented I think at that time about 60 percent of all the cases hospitalizations and fatalities, they still represent the bulk of those. The governor already eased some of the restrictions lifted in phase two, allowing salons and barbershops to operate at a limited capacity. Nonetheless, phase two allows bars and pubs to operate at a 50 percent capacity inside and full capacity outside, and restaurants will be able to offer top-bar seating. Phase two also allows retail stores and gyms to operate at full capacity while maintaining sanitization and social distancing guidelines. Entertainment businesses are also permitted to operate at 50 percent capacity. That includes movie theaters, bowling alleys, concert houses, playhouses, and auditoriums. People are still encouraged to avoid gatherings of more than 50, and DeSantis’s administration advises that employees of nursing homes and long-term care facilities undergo coronavirus testing “on a routine basis”: pic.twitter.com/jJRHYVjLFx — Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) June 3, 2020  pic.twitter.com/lrbjQE1uhZ — Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) June 3, 2020  pic.twitter.com/jjGNSTcFyC — Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) June 3, 2020  For more information on Phase 2 in Florida, see the full presentation here: https://t.co/OhtQbk99Vk pic.twitter.com/W7z98lgkil — Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) June 3, 2020  Florida, which has a population of over 21 million, had 60,183 total coronavirus cases and 2,607 related deaths, according to the Florida Department of Health’s numbers on Thursday.

Amazon, the world’s dominant online distributor of books and e-books, censored a book about the Chinese virus from lockdown critic and former New York Times reporter Alex Berenson. Jeff Bezos and company gave Berenson a suggestion on how to adjust his approach: “Please consider removing references to COVID-19 for this book.” After widespread criticism of the company, Amazon reversed its decision and has agreed to publish Berenson’s e-book. Berenson’s book, titled Unreported Truths About COVID-19 And Lockdowns Part 1: Introductions and Death Counts and Estimates, was to be the first in a series of short e-books about the coronavirus. The author planned to publish via Amazons’ Kindle Direct service, which allows authors to self-publish electronic books. But Amazon said no. In an email from Amazon that the author published on Twitter, the online retail giant informed the author that the book “does not comply with our guidelines,” and that Amazon customers are being referred to “official sources” about the virus. “Due to the rapidly changing nature of information around the COVID-19 virus, we are referring customers to official sources for health information about the virus. Please consider removing references to COVID-19 for this book.” Oh fuck me. I can’t believe it. They censored it. pic.twitter.com/GfPEr7OiV2 — Alex Berenson (@AlexBerenson) June 4, 2020  Berenson is well-known for his 2019 book Tell Your Children: The Truth About Marijuana, Mental Illness and Violence, which challenged the prevailing liberal orthodoxy that cannabis has little to no harmful effects. Berenson’s book argued that the drug is in fact linked to mental illness and violence. In comments to Breitbart News, Berenson explained the topic of his now-censored e-book on the coronavirus, calling it “An introduction and a discussion of death coding, death counts, and who is really dying from COVID, as well as a worst-case estimate of deaths with no mitigation efforts.” Berenson added, “I briefly considered censorship but assumed I wouldn’t have a problem both because of my background, because anyone who reads the booklet will realize it is impeccably sourced, nary a conspiracy theory to be found, and frankly because Amazon shouldn’t be censoring anything that doesn’t explicitly help people commit criminal behavior. (Books intended to help adults groom children for sexual relationships, for example, should be off-limits – though about 10 years ago Amazon did not agree and only backed down from selling a how-to guide for pedophiles in the face of public outrage.)” “I have no idea if the decision was made by a person, an automated system, or a combination (i.e. the system flags anything with COVID-19 or coronavirus in the title and then a person decides on the content),” said Berenson. “I am considering my options, including making the booklet available on my Website and asking people to pay on an honor system, but that will not solve the problem of Amazon’s censorship.” “Amazon dominates both the electronic and physical book markets, and if it denies its readers a chance to see my work, I will lose the chance to reach the people who most need to learn the truth — those who don’t already know it.” For updates on Berenson’s book and upcoming works, you can follow him on Twitter. Following the publication of this article and widespread pressure on social media, Amazon reversed its decision and agreed to publish Berenson’s book.

Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D) joined a large gathering of protesters in Harrisburg on Wednesday, just weeks after slamming local leaders and business owners as “cowardly” for moving to reopen their counties and businesses outside of his far-reaching lockdown orders. Wolf, who threatened business owners who signaled they would move to reopen their businesses outside of his guidelines, marched with protesters in Harrisburg on Wednesday, seemingly unbothered by the stark violations to his own orders. Dauphin County, home of Harrisburg, moved to the yellow phase last week, which prohibits large gatherings of more than 25: I want Pennsylvanians to — as safely as possible — get back to the activities they most enjoy. Remember that as long as #COVID19 is a threat, no social activity outside your home where you will run into others is completely without risk of catching this virus. pic.twitter.com/Y7OeoqNl02 — Governor Tom Wolf (@GovernorTomWolf) May 30, 2020  Photos show Wolf congregating with a large crowd, which is prohibited under the yellow phase of reopening. Another participant in the background can be seen holding a sign reading, “Blue Lives Murder”: I’m at today’s March Against Injustice and Gun Violence 2020 in Harrisburg in solidarity with our community. Black lives matter. Racism must end. I am here to listen. pic.twitter.com/MoTYi7AtuW — Governor Tom Wolf (@GovernorTomWolf) June 3, 2020  Governor Wolf is walking with protestors in Harrisburg.

May 11 business owners were called cowards for wanting to reopen their businesses, and today the governor is actually marching in that. Is that not in violation of your order and his order for large gatherings?” a reporter asked. “The governor has always said that people have the right to protest and to demonstrate and the right of free speech,” Levine, whose birth name is Richard, said. “And so overall, we want large gatherings — such as maybe a party or some type of concert — to be under 250 people. But we are not restricting people’s right to protest,” Levine continued. “There are obviously significant social issues, you know, that are present that people feel that they need to have a voice, and so the governor is always supportive of that and is participating in that,” he added: This is why you have reporters at press conferences. Levine is asked about @GovernorTomWolf calling officials coward and then marching today in Harrisburg. Wait for the end. pic.twitter.com/6VkaYyMpwr — Real_Dave_La_Torre 🍿 (@David_LaTorre) June 3, 2020  Wolf made waves last month after accusing business owners and leaders, clamoring to reopen amid his restrictions, of engaging in a “cowardly act.” He also said that lawmakers “urging businesses to risk their lives and risk the lives of their customers or their employees by opening prematurely” were “engaging in behavior that is both selfish and unsafe.” “To those politicians who decide to cave in to this coronavirus, they need to understand the consequences of their cowardly act,” Wolf said, lecturing business owners as well. “By opening before the evidence suggests you should, you’re taking undue risks with the safety of your customers,” the governor warned. “That’s not only morally wrong; that’s also really bad business,” he continued, threatening them with the loss of their health department certificate, liquor license, or certificate of occupancy.

The former head of Britain’s foreign secret intelligence office, Sir Richard Dearlove, has claimed that coronavirus originated in a Chinese laboratory and escaped, quoting a study that found some elements of COVID-19 had been “inserted” and did not evolve naturally. He also suggested that the academic community suppressed the original paper because it was explicit in its blame of China. Scientists from around the world maintain that the virus originated in either bats or pangolins before spontaneously jumping to humans. However, the 75-year-old former spy chief referenced a Norwegian-British study that points to a man-made interference in the virus. According a paper written by Professor Angus Dalgleish of St George’s Hospital, University of London, and Norwegian virologist Birger Sørensen seen by The Telegraph, scientists had found “inserted sections” on the virus’s surface. It had “unique fingerprints” which could not have been a result of natural evolution but likely “indicative of purposive manipulation” in a lab capable of producing “chimeric viruses of high potency”. Sir Richard said the study was a “very important contribution to a debate which is now starting about how the virus evolved and how it got out and broke out as a pandemic”. He told the newspaper that the study will “shift the debate”, causing countries to “rethink how it treats its relationship with China and how the international community behaves towards the Chinese leadership”. The paper has not been without controversy, with one scientist, John Fredrik Moxnes of the Norwegian military, seeking to have his name removed from it. Other members of the scientific community have dismissed the findings. The original version of the paper was not accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Academic journals had rejected it on the grounds that it was “unsuitable for publication”. Sir Richard, however, suggested that this reception to the first paper may be due to its politically incorrect findings. The former spy chief revealed that the article had been rewritten several times. An earlier version, seen by the newspaper, said it was factually correct to call coronavirus the “Wuhan virus” (Wuhan having two labs studying bat coronaviruses). It had also said that they had proven “beyond reasonable doubt that the Covid-19 virus is engineered”. “We are aware that these findings could have political significance and raise troubling questions,” the original paper had said. After being rewritten to reduce explicit blame on China, the paper was eventually accepted for publication in the Quarterly Review of Biophysics Discovery. China Lied, People Died: Five Eyes Report Details CCP Coronavirus Cover-up https://t.co/sHLCxA7ZRt — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 2, 2020  “This [the first] article was submitted to a… journal, which refused it within a week of receiving it, and in the same period accepted for publication two or three Chinese articles that relate to the virus, within 48 hours,” Sir Richard told The Telegraph’s Planet Normal podcast published on Wednesday. “So I mean, as this debate about the virus develops, I think all this material is going to be in print and is going to embarrass a number of people, I think. Let’s suggest that the Chinese maybe have too much say in their journals, in what appears and what doesn’t.” China has maintained that it was not responsible for the outbreak. But reports in recent months have revealed that China had deliberately destroyed evidence about the origins of the virus and “disappeared” whistleblower scientists who spoke out about coronavirus. The coronavirus pandemic coincides with growing tensions around Hong Kong as well as the rising concern of the security risks of engaging Huawei in building the UK’s 5G. Mr Dearlove called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to reverse his decision on Huawei, saying: “It’s important that we do not put any of our critical infrastructure in the hands of Chinese interests. So telecommunications, Huawei, nuclear power stations, and then things that, you know, we require and need in a crisis, like PPE. “We have allowed China so much rope that we are now suffering the consequences, and it’s time to pull the rope in and to tighten the way we do business. It’s very, very important that we keep a keen eye on this and do not allow the Chinese to, as it were, benefit strategically from this situation that has been imposed on all of us.” EU Kowtows to China, Revises Coronavirus Disinfo Report After Pressure from Chinese Communist Party https://t.co/BVGmBzWBxw — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 25, 2020 

While I no longer believe in polls, I do believe in trends, and the current polling trends for President Trump are terrible. Over the past seven or eight weeks, according to the reliable RealClearPolitics Poll of Polls… Trump’s job approval has sunk from 47.3 percent to 43.5. His disapproval number has jumped from 49.5 percent to 54 percent. The public’s approval of Trump’s handling of the coronavirus has completely flipped, from 51 percent approve to just 43 percent approve — from 45 percent disapprove to 54 percent disapprove. Against Joe Biden in their upcoming 2020 match-up, Trump went from a 4.4 point deficit to what is now nearly an eight-point deficit. And let’s not forget that in 2016, the national polls called the race right. Though not as sharp, the trend is the same in the swing states — moving away from Trump. But… It is important to remember how wrong the state polling was in 2016. The good news in the polling, and it’s not a small thing, is enthusiasm. In the June 1 Washington Post poll, Biden beats Trump by ten points, 53 to 43 percent. In late March, Biden was only up two points, 49 to 47 percent. But on the issue of enthusiasm, 90 percent of Trump’s voters are enthusiastic, compared to just 74 percent of Biden voters. The other two pieces of good news are that Slow Joe Biden is a terrible politician and there’s plenty of time and a million news cycles between now and Election Day. If you don’t believe the polling trends, stop reading here, because I do believe the trends, and I’m going to analyze why I believe Trump’s numbers are sinking… During a crisis, a president really only has one job: to project steadiness. That’s it. That’s all the American people really want from their leaders. That’s why Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-NY) can screw absolutely everything up with his coronavirus response and still enjoy huge approval numbers. That’s why Iraq could fall completely apart on former President George W. Bush in 2004 and he still won his reelection. That’s why a radical like Barack Obama could beat war hero John McCain, who came off as erratic and neurotic. Calm, cool, unruffled, and steady is the key… Trump either refuses to behave in his own best interest during the dual crises of the coronavirus and these riots, or he’s incapable of behaving in a way that’s in his own best interest. You know, I like Trump being Trump … when times are good. When 100,000 people are not dying, when the economy is not imploding, and when dozens of Democrat-run cities are not on fire, Trump being Trump makes my day. I like that he hits back at the media, hijacks the news cycle with his Twitter feed, and blasts back twice as hard at his critics. I not only like it; I think it’s good politics, most especially when Deep State Traitors like James Comey are trying to legitimize a coup. I’ll tell you something else I have no problem during normal times… If Trump wants to troll the execrable Joe Scarborough over a dead intern. I’ll pop the popcorn. That scumbag Scarborough and his Trophy Wife have been falsely accusing Trump of everything from being a Russian spy to genocide… In normal times, during good times, I would find that hilarious and just. When 100,000 Americans are dead, and the economy is imploding, and dozens of Democrat-run cities are on fire, I find it childish, selfish, and self-destructive. As is encouraging your supporters to show up in what will almost certainly be a violent confrontation in front of the White House. As is repeatedly shouting “LAW & ORDER!” out of nowhere. As is re-tweeting a guy who says the “only good Democrat is a dead Democrat.” As is continuing to engage in grudges, grievances, silly insults, and petty fights. What’s even more frustrating is that Trump’s done a solid job managing both the coronavirus and the riots. He’s also said a lot of the right things, but his refusal to calm down, project steadiness, and rise above it all is undermining all the good work. Trump’s problems all started right here — he was doing just fine and earning solid approval numbers handling the coronavirus until he allowed the corporate media to bait him into overriding his own message and burying vital information the public needed under those endless and godawful briefings where he wrestled with the media pigs for hours. To what end? Why? As far as I’m concerned, that was all Trump’s fault because he allowed his (perfectly understandable) hatred for the media to get the best of him, and the result was not only the implosion of his own approval ratings, but necessary public information imploding in a fit of presidential pique. Over the past six or so weeks, he’s at least put an end to those destructive briefings, but the presidential steadiness is still not there … because Lil’ Joey Scarborough said something mean. For five years, Trump has told us he is perfectly capable of acting presidential if he wants to, but when sliding poll numbers can’t make him want to act presidential, I start to wonder. When projecting steadiness and calm would go a long way towards beating the bastards Trump wants so badly to beat and he still doesn’t, I start to wonder. I’m still going to crawl over glass to vote for the guy, but I’m pretty disgusted right now. Forty million people are out of work, our cities are on fire… Trump needs to do better, for the country’s sake and his own. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.

The British government is reportedly talking with Japanese firm NEC and South Korean company Samsung about diversifying the UK’s options for technology, in another strong signal that Britain is serious about pulling Chinese Huawei out of her telecommunications networks. British officials spoke with NEC in May about bringing the Japanese company into Britain’s 5G market through a trial programme called “5G Create”, according to a source speaking to Bloomberg. The Johnson administration is also reportedly speaking with South Korean company Samsung about developing 5G infrastructure, according to the Bloomberg report published on Wednesday. The British government has been under pressure from international allies after Johnson gave the go-ahead to Huawei to build 35 per cent of the UK’s next-generation 5G network. Five Eyes intelligence-sharing partners the United States and Australia have warned that engagement of the effectively state-owned Chinese company was a security risk, with Huawei able to build a backdoor into British networks, which can be used by Beijing spies. Last month, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), part of the signals intelligence service the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), announced that it would conduct a security review of Huawei’s involvement in Britain’s 5G following U.S. sanctions on the company. Tory rebels who are against the prime minister’s plans to employ Huawei hope that the report is a means of formally cutting ties with Huawei over the 5G deal. China Trying to Drive Wedge Between UK and U.S. with Huawei, Says Senator https://t.co/JDmkm8dADu — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 3, 2020  Prime Minister Johnson declined to deny on Wednesday he is looking for a way out of the arrangement, which has not yet been passed into law. He said during Wednesday’s Downing Street press briefing: “On high-risk vendors in our critical national infrastructure… we’ve got to make sure that we have solutions for the UK that protect UK security.” But periphery reports strongly suggest that has changed his mind. Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Dominic Raab is reportedly leading up “Project Defend”, which will examine the UK’s economic resilience. It will report on vulnerable supply chains that are strategic for national security but which may be dependent on foreign countries, including China. The review was reportedly activated after the UK struggled to source medical equipment during the coronavirus lockdown, with items like masks and ventilators coming from the communist superpower. It is believed the review will be used as a blueprint for self-sufficiency. An earlier report had revealed that the UK was reliant on China for 71 “critical goods” categories including electronics, personal protective equipment (PPE), and pharmaceuticals. Even if the UK does pull Huawei out of future 5G plans, the Chinese tech firm still makes up around one-third of the country’s 4G mobile network service antennas and is used by major providers EE, Three, and Vodaphone. British officials have also therefore been tasked with drawing up plans to pull Huawei out entirely by no later than 2023. Mr Johnson is also said to be exploring state financial aid for tech companies to replace dependence on Chinese tech firms. The need to shore up and protect British companies come after Nigel Farage had warned that Chinese interests are lining up for a “fire sale” of British tech businesses affected by the economic downturn caused by the Wuhan coronavirus, with senior Conservatives echoing those concerns.

A racehorse named for Dr. Anthony Fauci reached the finish line at a safe enough distance from others that would have made his namesake proud. Fauci the 2-year-old colt finished a distant second to a horse named Prisoner and was well ahead of third-place Indoctrinate in his much-anticipated debut Wednesday at Belmont Park. In a sport known for topical names, Fauci is the first of a series of horses inspired by the coronavirus pandemic and the latest tribute to the respected director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Social Distancing, Self Isolation, Flatten the Curve, Herd Immunity and No Spectators have also been registered with the Jockey Club. Co-owner Phillip Antonacci picked the name Fauci in mid-March after the 79-year-old started doing daily coronavirus briefings from the White House. The Antonacci family, like Fauci, is Italian-American and from Brooklyn. “We wanted to honor the service that he’s given to the whole world: beside COVID, fighting all the other infectious his whole life,” Antonacci said. “Throughout the whole thing, he seemed like a voice that knew what was going on and, without trying to be too political, kind of calmed things and provided real data behind what was going on.” Antonacci hoped to name a filly after Dr. Deborah Birx. In the end, though, Antonacci said he didn’t have horse good enough to name after the coordinator of the White House’s virus task force. This colt who debuted Wednesday was named Fauci in part because his owners thought he’d be a special horse. Trainer Wesley Ward has seen that since the then-unnamed horse got to his barn in September. “He’s a beautiful colt, done everything right on the track in the mornings, got a beautiful mind on him to where he’s not fractious or anxious and seems very, very intelligent,” Ward said. “He’s just a real easygoing guy. Not much bothers him.” Antonacci has sensed a lot of hype surrounding the horse because of his name. Since the global pandemic began, Dr. Fauci’s likeness has been used for a plush doll, a bobblehead and a donut, and he has a namesake beer. And now a thoroughbred. “He’s a really, really good horse,” Ward said. “Especially with the name that’s been assigned to him, you know that he’s got to live up to the name.” Ward said depending on how Fauci comes out of his first race, he could be headed to Royal Ascot in England for the Coventry Stakes in mid-June. Fauci’s debut coincided with the first live horse racing in New York since March and amid protests nationwide following death of George Floyd in Minnesota. Jockeys stood for a moment of silence to pay respects for those who died of COVID-19 and in tribute to medical professionals, then took a knee in the paddock prior to the first race as a show of solidarity with protesters in the wake of Floyd’s death. “There’s a lot going on in the world right now and we wanted to show respect to all causes, and to all people, and to show that we here at (the New York Racing Association) support everybody,” jockey Reylu Gutierrez said. “Horse racing, in general, supports all ethnicities. Horse racing is a worldwide sport and it doesn’t matter what color you are, what religion you are, or what ethnicity you are. What matters in horse racing is that we are one.”

Despite starting a gradual return to normal activities this week, Mexico recorded the most Coronavirus fatalities in one day. Mexico ranks seventh in the world for deaths and fourteenth for cases. During their daily news conference, Undersecretary of Health Hugo Lopez Gatell and his staff revealed that Mexico currently has 101,238 confirmed cases and another 44,869 undergoing testing. The nation has recorded 11,729 fatalities tied to the virus. Al 03 de junio de 2020 hay 101,238 casos confirmados, 16,829 confirmados activos y 44,869 sospechosos por #COVID19. Se han registrado 157,354 negativos, 11,729 defunciones confirmadas, 948 defunciones sospechosas y fueron estudiadas 303,461 personas. 1/3 pic.twitter.com/Xlwbbo0KRx — Hugo López-Gatell Ramírez (@HLGatell) June 4, 2020  The government figures show that Mexico recorded 1,092 fatalities in one day, the most to date. Mexico also recorded the most new daily cases with 3,912. Mexico still ranks high globally despite admitting to undercounts. The nation has only conducted a total of 303,461 tests. Lopez Gatell admitted that some of his figures only include cases from government hospitals. This discrepancy has led several state health officials to release their own figures which show between 20-40 percent more cases. Ildefonso Ortiz is an award-winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.

Actress Alicia Silverstone revealed that she has been taking baths with her nine-year-old son while isolated in quarantine due to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. “My son and I take baths together, and when he’s not with me, I take a bath and that really feels nourishing and comforting,” the Clueless star said in a recent interview with the New York Times. This does not appear to be Silverstone’s only headline-making (if not head-scratching) parenting method, as the report added that the actress has also put her son, Bear Blu, on a vegan diet, and that she has even “bird fed” him — chewing food in her own mouth first, before passing it to him to eat. The report added that a spokesperson for Silverstone clarified that Bear Blu prefers a vegan diet. Moreover, in her 2014 book, The Kind Mama, on diet, lifestyle, and parenting, the Ass Backwards actress explained that her son — who was just a few years old a the time — had “never had a drop of medicine,” as Silverstone does not agree with immunization. “People said lots of different things, and I was sort of ‘the freak,'” said the Clueless actress. “And I guess I’ll take pride in that because it is hard to be the person that’s speaking out, and it is hard to be the person that is saying the thing that isn’t what everybody else wants to hear.” In sharing her daily routine while in quarantine, Silverstone said she “always bring[s] everything back to diet.” “When I don’t eat well, I don’t feel well, and then my moods go all over the place,” Silverstone told the New York Times. The report added that while in quarantine, Silverstone also lost her friend and former co-star Mark Blum, who died of the Wuhan coronavirus in March. “It’s a really sad, scary time for so many people,” she said.

TEL AVIV – Israeli researchers have developed a “disinfection tunnel” which they say could enable mass gatherings by spraying visitors with a sanitizing water-based liquid.  The walk-through tunnel, the joint venture of scientists at Bar Ilan University and the Karmiel-based industrial automation company, RD Pack, would reduce the danger of crowds at synagogues, hospitals, schools, sporting events and concerts even while a pandemic rages. The tunnel has the ability to spray thousands of people with an aerosol using electrochemical technology that eliminates bacteria and viruses, including microbes from the coronavirus family. The tunnel itself is made of aluminum and polycarbonate. “When people walk through the tunnel, their whole body gets sprayed with the disinfectant, which works fast and efficiently, and provides the complete sterilization of a person,” said Eran Druker, business development manager at RD Pack. According to the university researchers, the disinfectant is both safe for the environment and for use on humans. “This disinfectant substance is extremely effective, 100 times more so than a regular disinfectant, and the advantage is that the substance is also unstable,” Izaak Cohen, who developed and patented the disinfectant together with Eran Avraham and Doron Aurbach, said. “Due to the substance being unstable, it is more friendly to the environment. Other disinfectants are more stable and remain on you, and can cause all sorts of burns. The more stable they are, the less friendly they are to both you and the environment.”  Dr. Izaak Cohen, a researcher at Bar-Ilan University, walking through the sanitation and disinfection tunnel  (Photo: Yoni Reif) The tunnel is currently awaiting approval from the Health Ministry. “The objective is to create an active process that does not interfere with daily routine,” Druker said. “People think that coronavirus is over, but it is still with us. As people are no longer proactive in disinfection and cleaning, we are creating the opportunity for disinfection and breaking the chain of infection.”  

During an interview with Newsmax TV’s “Spicer and Co.” on Wednesday, President Trump stated that social distancing is needed, it’s too soon to go back to normal, and criticized Democratic elected officials for being “tough as hell on keeping people locked up in their houses” and “very weak” on handling riots and looting. Host and former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer asked, “I haven’t heard a lot about social distancing and gathering since all of these large protests and riots. [Does] that mean that social distancing is over?” Trump responded, “No. It’s not over.” He added, “We want to be back to normal, but it’s a little bit soon, but I watch these protesters, and they’re the ones that are all claiming social distancing, everything else, it’s really interesting. They do that, and then they’re jumping on top of each other by the thousands when they’re screaming and ranting and raving, which is not a good thing. I mean, we’re going to have to see how that works out.” Trump also stated that it’s “very interesting with these liberal mayors, liberal Democrats — and governors, how they’re tough as hell on keeping people locked up in their houses. But when it comes to ending the crime and those stores being broken into, and the looting…they’re very weak on crime.” He also said that the initial shutdowns were needed. Because without them, far more people would have died. Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

A report published Wednesday evening indicated George Floyd had coronavirus approximately two months before his death, though multiple autopsies did not attribute his death to the illness. Ed O’Keefe of CBS News said on Twitter that the official autopsy found George Floyd had coronavirus, which could be a significant development in the case if medical officials follow their pattern of categorizing deaths related to the disease. JUST IN: Official autopsy report finds #GeorgeFloyd had #coronavirus. Hennepin County Medical Examiner's full report says he tested positive April 3. — Ed O'Keefe (@edokeefe) June 4, 2020  According to O’Keefe, who cited the Hennepin County Medical Examiner, Floyd tested positive on April 3rd. Multiple autopsies were completed and arrived at differing conclusions. CBS News reported: Dr. Allecia Wilson, one of the pathologists who conducted the independent autopsy, said Monday afternoon that Floyd died as a result of mechanical asphyxiation. But the report released later Monday by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s office said Floyd died of “cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint and neck compression.” The manner of death was ruled homicide, but the office noted that “is not a legal determination of culpability or intent.” A preliminary autopsy report cited earlier by prosecutors said the county medical examiner’s review “revealed no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation.” In April, Minnesota, along with many other states, began attributing deaths to coronavirus if no test was done and the deceased was suspected of having the illness. Via the Minnesota Department of Health: If a diagnosis of COVID-19 is suspected or likely “ …it is acceptable to report COVID-19 as ‘probable’ or ‘presumed’.” That could have an impact on Floyd’s suspected cause of death. There have been several instances around the country where an individual had COVID-19, but died under unrelated circumstances, and the death was blamed on the virus. In May, a Colorado man had a blood alcohol level of .550 and died of alcohol poisoning, but his cause of death was later changed to coronavirus, Fox News reported. Michigan counted deaths “with COVID-19,” as opposed to “of COIVD-19,” leading some to accuse the state of cooking the numbers. In Alabama, “a bedbound patient with aspiration pneumonia in one lung and a person with a buildup of fluid and partial collapse of one lung” had their deaths attributed to coronavirus, according to the Washington Post. “In this country, we’ve taken a very liberal approach to mortality,” Dr. Deborah Birx said at a press briefing on April 7th. “The intent is, right now, that … if someone dies with COVID-19, we are counting that as a CODID-19 death,” she said.

Former Rep. Allen West (R-FL) highlighted Facebook and Twitter’s politically-driven and arbitrary censorship of information, contrasting the platforms’ facilitation of operations executed by Antifa and Black Lives Matter while censoring disagreement with public health authorities’ positions. West joined Tuesday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with host Rebecca Mansour and special guest host Ed Martin to discuss ongoing unrest, protests, and riots following the death of George Floyd. West remarked, “What infuriates me more than anything else is that these social media platforms are being used by groups like Antifa and Black Lives Matter to organize, to get out their orders and instructions, but when we had everyday Americans that wanted to have rallies about the unconstitutionality of these stay-at-home orders and the lockdowns and shutdowns — I call it illegal martial law and house arrest — Facebook and Twitter threatened to censor them … Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey need to stop making decisions based upon their ideological agendas.” LISTEN:  “[The killing of George Floyd] was heinous,” West stated. “It was offensive. It was evil. It was tyrannical and despotic to see someone put their entire weight in their left knee on the carotid artery of a man who was handcuffed, and his crime was forgery — $20 bills — not armed robbery, not attempted murder, or aggravated assault. So, he was not armed or any danger to any of those four police officers that were there around him.” West continued, “There is no excuse for what we see happening in America. It just goes back to the Rahm Emanuel mantra of never letting a good crisis go to waste.” “Antifa is a domestic terrorist group,” West declared, “and we need to peel the onion back. We need to find the leadership. We need to find the resourcing. Black Lives Matter is no better. Black Lives Matter does not show up in Chicago or any of the other major urban population centers across the country run by Democrats, where you see black-on-black crime. They say nothing about the atrocious fact that 20 million black babies have been murdered in the womb thanks to Planned Parenthood, which was founded by a white supremacist and a racist.” West went on, “I see people cherry-picking and using the theme of racism and being a racist to fit an ideological agenda, and we have got to have strong voices to stand up and push back against this. If we cannot maintain law and order in our streets, then we’re going to see the undermining of our constitutional republic.” “We now have a domestic enemy,” West said. “We have an enemy that, without a doubt, has declared that they want to undermine this constitutional republic. They want to replace it with a governing system that is completely different.” West added, “We cannot have these seditious organizations and groups that are running amok in the United States of America and recruiting people.” November’s elections present a choice between individual sovereignty and collective enslavement, determined West. “It comes down to understanding the right and true relationship between the individual citizen and the institution of government,” West said. “In the United States of America, the individual citizens — if you read our Declaration and our Constitution — are sovereign. And why is the individual sovereign? Because their inalienable rights come from their creator, God, not from man.” West articulated a fundamental distinction between left-wing ideology and conservatism. “There are people that believe that the institution of government should be supreme and sovereign over the individual, and that’s not what we have in America,” West explained. “We have to decide, are we going to be individually sovereign or are we going to be collectively subjugated?” West went on, “We have to decide, do we want to be victors or do we want to be victims? We have to decide, do we want to be economically empowered or do we want to be economically enslaved? There is no greater time in the history of the United States of America to draw a clear delineation in these two very different philosophies of governance.” West concluded by noting the links between Antifa, Black Lives Matter, and the Democrat Party. “Barack Obama said we’re five days away from fundamentally transforming the United States of America, and they believe that they can do that,” West recalled. “That’s why you see them out there on the streets, using fear, intimidation, coercion, and violence to get the ends that they want.” Breitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.

As of June 16, President Donald Trump’s administration will bar all passenger planes originating in China from entry to the U.S. The order, announced by the U.S. Department of Transportation, applies to Air China, China Eastern Airlines Corp, China Southern Airlines Co, Hainan Airlines Holding Co, Sichuan Airlines Co, and Xiamen Airlines Co. Despite the agreement to restrict travel, airlines have continued to regularly ferry passengers from the origin point of the novel coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, both Delta and United have requested permission to resume flights to China, though the country “remains unable” to say when it will “allow U.S. carriers to reinstate scheduled passenger flights,”  according to a formal order signed by the Transportation Department top aviation official Joel Szabat. In a statement on Wednesday, Delta said “we support and appreciate the U.S. government’s actions to enforce our rights and ensure fairness,” while United said it looks forward to resuming passenger service between the United States and China “when the regulatory environment allows us to do so.” The decision will enforce a level of parity between both sides, eliminating the lopsided permissions currently in effect. “We will allow Chinese carriers to operate the same number of scheduled passenger flights as the Chinese government allows ours,” the department said in a separate statement. Additionally, China will no longer be allowed to use charter flights to “further [increase] their advantage over U.S. carriers in providing U.S.-China passenger services.”

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with survivors of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre at the hands of Chinese communist troops on Tuesday afternoon, amid strained relations between the United States and China over the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic and Hong Kong protests. The meeting came two days before the 31st anniversary of the incident in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, where Chinese communist troops thwarted student-led protests in a bloody crackdown on June 4 and 5, 1989. Protesters were calling for democracy, free speech, and a free press, among other things. There is no official death count for the number of victims of communist violence that day, as the Chinese Communist Party has endeavored to keep precise information about it a secret. Most estimates suggest thousands of peaceful protesters, many students, killed by Chinese military forces. Beijing played down the number of casualties, estimating the events led to the death of 241 people (including soldiers) and wounding of 7,000 others, the Encyclopedia Britannica noted. China reportedly sentenced many of those detained in Tiananmen Square to varying lengths of time in prison and executed others. “In the years since the incident, the government generally has attempted to suppress references to it,” Britannica added. “Public commemoration of the incident is officially banned.” In a statement on Wednesday, Morgan Ortagus, a spokesperson for State, revealed that Pompeo met with four of the Tiananmen protesters. Ortagus stated: Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo was honored to meet yesterday with Wang Dan, Su Xiaokang, Liane Lee, and Henry Li – four of the thousands of brave participants in the heroic protests for democracy that were brutally put down by the Chinese Communist Party on June 4, 1989. pic.twitter.com/W6ATJykhre — Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) June 3, 2020  A traditional Chinese-language report from Channel News Asia (CNA) first identified the four participants in the meeting with Pompeo. According to the State Department’s public schedule, Pompeo met with the Tiananmen Square massacre survivors at 2:30 p.m. on Tuesday, June 2. Although China has officially banned public commemoration of the Tiananmen events, Hong Kong residents have held an annual vigil on the anniversary of the crackdown, even after the region reverted to Chinese administration. This year, however, China will not allow Hong Kong to mark the massacre’s anniversary, Pompeo said, describing the move as unprecedented. On Monday, Pompeo wrote on Twitter that the pro-Beijing Hong Kong government did not approve the June 4 Tiananmen vigil, saying: For the first time in 30 years, Hong Kong authorities denied permission to hold the [Tiananmen Vigil]. If there is any doubt about Beijing’s intent, it is to deny Hong Kongers a voice and a choice, making them the same as mainlanders. So much for two systems. It starts; so soon. For the first time in 30 years, Hong Kong authorities denied permission to hold the #TiananmenVigil. If there is any doubt about Beijing’s intent, it is to deny Hong Kongers a voice and a choice, making them the same as mainlanders. So much for two systems. — Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) June 2, 2020  In recent weeks, Hong Kong has been home to pro-democracy protests increasingly challenging the Chinese Communist Party’s tightening grip on the region after Beijing moved to crush the island’s autonomy. U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has lambasted China’s move, threatening to take action against the Asian giant, like stripping Hong Kong of special trading privileges. Under the “One Country, Two Systems” policy signed after Britain handed the island over to Beijing, Hong Kong was granted autonomy while its residents enjoy quasi-democratic freedoms inconceivable in China. Officially, Hong Kong is a special administrative region of communist China. Since taking office as Secretary of State in 2018, Pompeo has issued statements in early June condemning the Tiananmen Massacre. This year is no different. Ortagus, Pompeo’s spokeswoman, stated on Wednesday: Today we honor the brave Chinese people whose peaceful calls for democracy, human rights, and a corruption-free society came to a violent end when the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) sent the People’s Liberation Army into Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989, armed with tanks and guns. … Thirty-one years later, the total number of missing or dead Tiananmen protesters is still unknown. The United States continues to applaud their aspirations, and the American people stand with the families still grieving their lost loved ones, including the courageous Tiananmen Mothers who have never stopped seeking accountability for their children’s deaths, despite great personal hardship and risk. We reiterate our call for a full, public accounting of those killed or missing. We mourn the victims of June 4, 1989, and we stand with the people of China who continue to aspire to a government that protects human rights, fundamental freedoms, and basic human dignity. Pompeo’s meeting with Tiananmen survivors will likely fuel tensions between China and the United States in the South China Sea and beyond. Today, the U.S. protests the PRC’s unlawful South China Sea maritime claims at the @UN. We reject these claims as unlawful and dangerous. Member States must unite to uphold international law and freedom of the seas. #FreeAndOpenIndoPacific https://t.co/h6UCoBnnnb — Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) June 2, 2020  The demonstrations, which reportedly began in May 1989, and the subsequent repression at the hands of Chinese communist troops spilled outside of Beijing to cities across the country and beyond in events that came to be known as the May Fourth Movement. American officials instituted sanctions on China over the 1989 massacre. U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has accused China of allowing the lethal and highly contagious COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, to spread by mismanaging its response and hiding the extent of the outbreak during its initial phase. China, the birthplace of the coronavirus, denies the assertions.

The media is reporting that “health experts” signed an open letter supporting the protests that have, in many American cities, devolved into violent riots that have destroyed neighborhoods and businesses, because “white supremacy is a public health issue” that has contributed to the spread of the coronavirus. The protests were sparked by the death of a black man, George Floyd, who died in police custody in Minneapolis on Memorial Day. The letter is, in fact, signed by physicians, medical organizations, and academics, but scores of others who are described as “community stakeholders” also signed the document. “White supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to COVID-19,” the letter says. The letter also says that while large protests could spread the virus and some of the recommendations like social distancing still apply, “do not disband protests under the guise of maintaining public health for COVID-19 restrictions.” On the other hand, the letter said protesters should not be arrested because crowded cells could spread the virus and that protesters should “demand that law enforcement officials also respect infection prevention recommendations by maintaining distance from protesters and wearing masks.” The letter also tells people they should donate to pay for the bail of people arrested at protests or riots. “We continue to support demonstrators who are tackling the paramount public health problem of pervasive racism. We express solidarity and gratitude toward demonstrators who have already taken on enormous personal risk to advocate for their own health, the health of their communities, and the public health of the United States. We pledge our services as allies who share this goal,” the letter says. The letter talks about police “violence” but not the violence in some protests, including some protesters who set businesses on fire and looted businesses. Dozens of public health and disease experts have signed an open letter in support of the nationwide anti-racism protests. "White supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to COVID-19," they wrote.https://t.co/EewPNgDSu3 — NPR (@NPR) June 2, 2020  Taxpayer-funded National Public Radio (NPR), however, did not include much of the details in its report on the letter, instead turning to a source that did not sign it, Dr. Elaine Nsoesie, an assistant professor of global health at Boston University. “Data is showing that blacks and Latinos have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 in many states,” Nsoesie said. “Racism is one of the reasons this disparity exists.” “Racism is a social determinant of health,” Nsoesie said. “It affects the physical and mental health of blacks in the U.S. So I wouldn’t weigh these crises separately.” Follow Penny Starr on Twitter.

Remember when the Internet and TV commercials and public service announcements were all filled with healthcare workers holding up signs that said “We’re Here For You, Stay Home for Us”? Do you remember all that emotional blackmail? It was all over the place. The message was basically this: Dear Ungrateful Commoner: We’re out here risking our lives on the front lines, and we selfless and brave healthcare heroes need you to remain on lockdown and lose your jobs and your businesses and give up everything that makes life living,  for us… Cuz we’re brave and awesome, so we need you to destroy the economy that might get the Orange Bad Man reelected, even though, if you’re under 50, the coronavirus is no more lethal than the flu Remember all that sanctimonious, anti-science garbage? Well, guess what… It was all bullshit. Many of us knew that at the time. But now we know that our oh-so precious healthcare workers also knew it was bullshit, because look at them now… No, really, look at them now openly encouraging mass gatherings of people. Tell me if I got their science correct… You’re killing grandma and making life harder for all of your precious healthcare heroes if you leave your home to attend church, use the swings at a local park, play a game of basketball, gather in groups of ten or more, or attend a house party… But if you leave your home and completely ignore every social distancing rule to attend a massive gathering of humanity to protest, riot, loot, and burn Democrat-run cities — well, according to these very same healthcare heroes, that’s no problem at all. You know, cuz burning down predominantly black neighborhoods is fighting the virus of racism in a country that just elected a black president and enjoyed the lowest black unemployment rate in history — at least until we all told you to stay home … for us. Seriously, look at our “We’re Here For You, Stay Home for Us” healthcare heroes now.

"White supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to COVID-19," they wrote.https://t.co/EewPNgDSu3 — NPR (@NPR) June 2, 2020  Overnight, we went from America’s health experts telling us that attending church will kill grandma to America’s health experts telling us “they support the demonstrations — because racism also poses a dire health threat.” In other words, all of the so-called science was tossed out the window as soon as a pet cause made that necessary. Don’t waste any energy getting angry… Just remember this the next time our healthcare “experts” try to shove you around and control you with their “science.” America’s experts are only experts when it comes to lying, to manipulating us with fear into a box where they can boss us around. If anything, take away something positive from this… As I said yesterday, we owe a debt of gratitude to the rioters. After all, it was America’s left-wing terrorists in Antifa and Black Lives Matter who exposed the lockdowns as a left-wing hoax, as a total fraud, as purely political. And I don’t know about you, but the rioters who exposed this aren’t rioting in my neighborhood. They’re not rioting out here in Rural America. Nope, the only place they’re rioting and looting and burning is in Democrat-run cities. So those stupid enough to vote for Democrats are getting what they voted for, while the rest of us learned an important lesson about how phony, dishonest, and partisan our healthcare “experts” are. It’s all good.  Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.

Venezuela’s rightful president Juan Guaidó announced an agreement with Nicolás Maduro’s socialist regime and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO, a subsidiary of the World Health Organization) on Tuesday to seek assistance in dealing with the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. The agreement, signed Monday in Caracas, will establish the necessary “priorities” for dealing with the pandemic, including the rapid detection of cases, epidemiological surveillance, and the effective treatment of those infected. “Both parties propose to work in coordination, in coordination and with the support of PAHO, in the search for financial resources that contribute to strengthening the country’s response capacities in the face of the new coronavirus,” the Maduro regime’s Communication Minister Jorge Rodríguez said in a state television address on Tuesday. “The coronavirus does not respect or discriminate against gender, orientation, or political party,” he continued. “So this is good news, a good start so that we can deepen our work together to combat the coronavirus.” Guaidó confirmed on Twitter that after “months of fighting and insistence, we have finally convinced the PAHO to provide the necessary donation to the National Assembly to handle the pandemic in Venezuela.” “Our politics is based on saving lives, in dealing with the emergency, and ending this dictatorship,” he added. Neither side has confirmed the estimated amount required for the plan and has not reported under what conditions the resources would be distributed. Luego de meses de insistencia y lucha, logramos que la OPS reciba la donación aprobada por la AN para atender la pandemia en Venezuela. Nuestra política se centra en salvar vidas, en atender la emergencia y salir de la dictadura. Urge el Gobierno de Emergencia Nacional. https://t.co/4QHmH34psf — Juan Guaidó (@jguaido) June 3, 2020  In a statement, Guaidó’s team assured that the agreement allows money to put emergency funds “into the hands of international organizations” and not the socialist regime. They added that the donation had been “approved” by the country’s National Assembly, the country’s last legitimate lawmaking body. This fact does not appear in the document released by Rodríguez, who accused the opposition leader of trying to “politicize something that does not have to be politicized.” Despite its alleged commitment to removing the Maduro regime from power, mainly through the imposition of crippling economic sanctions, Washington celebrated the “coordinated association” agreement between the two sides. “It is an important step, but only a democratic transition will save Venezuela from catastrophe,” the U.S. Embassy said in a statement. Gobierno Interino de @JGuaido firmó acuerdo con la OPS de asociación coordinada con el régimen para enfrentar el #COVID19, priorizando necesidades urgentes de atención médica de venezolanos. Es un paso importante, pero solo transición democrática salvará Venezuela de catástrofe https://t.co/GdcmWdTJRa — Embajada Virtual de los EE.UU., Venezuela (@usembassyve) June 3, 2020  The agreement raises further questions about the veracity of Venezuela’s official coronavirus figures. Health authorities claim that just 1,819 people have contracted the disease, leading to 18 fatalities. The country’s decrepit “universal” healthcare system and the vulnerability of its poverty-stricken population arouse suspicion regarding the numbers. The PAHO has previously faced accusations of enabling slave labor in relation to Cuba’s slave doctor system, in which the Castro regime forces doctors to work abroad while taking a large percentage of their pay. In 2012, the PAHO was a signatory to a deal signed by Brazil’s socialist leadership and Cuba’s regime to introduce a program known as “Mais Médicos” (More Doctors) and received a payment from the Brazilian government as a result. The deal signed this week underlines Guaido’s rapidly dwindling authority as Venezuela’s legitimate yet effectively powerless president, which has led him to repeatedly try to enter negotiations with the Maduro regime in return for supposed concessions. After several rounds of discussions, Guaidó conceded that he had given up negotiating with such a “deadly dictatorship.” A nationwide survey taken at the time found that 87.6 percent of Venezuelans opposed any form of dialogue with Maduro.

Stocks rose on Wednesday as investors glimpsed signs that the economy had bottomed, coronavirus infections are waning, more government aid is likely, and President Donald Trump’s move to quell riots in D.C. may have stemmed the civic unrest around the country. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 527 points, or 2.05 percent. The S&P 500 moved up 1.36 percent, its fourth day of gains. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 0.78 percent, climbing within two percent of the all-time high hit in February. All 11 sectors of the S&P were up. Industrials and financials were the best performing sector, rising by 3.91 percent and 3.83 percent respectively. Communications services and consumer staples were the worst, rising by just one-fifth of a percent. The top gainer on the Dow was Boeing, followed by American Express, J.P. Morgan Chase, and Exxon Mobil. Home Depot, Walmart, Intel, and United Health were the only Dow stocks to lose for the day.  

NEW YORK (AP) — Major League Baseball rejected the players’ offer for a 114-game regular season in the pandemic-delayed season with no additional salary cuts and told the union it did not plan to make a counterproposal, a person familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity Wednesday because no statements were authorized.
Players made their proposal Sunday, up from an 82-game regular season in management’s offer last week. Opening day would be June 30 and the regular season would end Oct. 31, nearly five weeks after the Sept. 27 conclusion that MLB’s proposal stuck to from the season’s original schedule. MLB told the union it had no interest in extending the season into November, when it fears a second wave of the coronavirus could disrupt the postseason and jeopardize $787 million in broadcast revenue.
While management has suggested it could play a short regular season of about 50 games with no more salary reductions, it has not formally proposed that concept. Teams and players hope to start the season in ballparks with no fans, and teams claim they would sustain huge losses if salaries are not cut more. The sides agreed to a deal March 26 in which players accepted prorated salaries in exchange for $170 million in advances and a guarantee that if the season is scrapped each player would get 2020 service time matching what the player accrued in 2019. That deal called for “good faith” negotiations over playing in empty stadiums or at neutral sites. The union has said no additional cuts are acceptable. MLB’s proposal on May 26 would lower 2020 salaries from about $4 billion to approximately $1.2 billion, establishing a sliding scale of reductions. Players at the $563,500 minimum would get about 47% of their original salary and those at the top — led by Mike Trout and Gerrit Cole at $36 million — would receive less than 23%. The union’s offer would have salaries total about $2.8 billion, leaving each player with about 70% of his original salary.

Amazon announced this week that it is ending its two-dollar pay increase for warehouse workers instituted after the outbreak of the Chinese virus. Meanwhile, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has enjoyed a net worth increase of $32 billion since January. According to a report by Business Insider, Amazon is killing the two-dollar pay raise that warehouse workers received at the outset of the Chinese virus pandemic. Although Amazon warehouses were overwhelmed with demand in March and April, reports suggest that Amazon’s warehouse operations have mostly returned to normal. Some warehouse employees even claim that they recently been asked to take voluntary time off. In short interviews with Business Insider, Amazon warehouse workers around the nation expressed their frustration with the company’s decision to end the pay raise. “The $2 an hour won’t have much effect on my life — I find kind of laughable,” one warehouse worker in New Jersey said. “There are others though who can really use it and with the present circumstances they should actually be increasing it instead of taking it away.” “It just kills me that the company cares nothing about what a pay cut will do to morale,” a South Carolina Amazon worker said. “Almost everyone is very disappointed and angry,” one Amazon warehouse worker in Indiana said. “We want the pay until the masks go away.” Breitbart News reported in April that America’s billionaire executives have seen significant increases in their wealth during the coronavirus pandemic. At the same time that 26 million Americans were forced to file for unemployment, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Tesla CEO Elon Musk saw their wealth increase by ten percent. Stay tuned to Breitbart News for more updates on this story.

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday factory orders in April fell 13.0 percent, the biggest month-to-month fall in records dating to 1992. Orders fell 11 percent in March, revised down from the initially reported then record-setting 10.3 percent decline. The decline was slightly less than the 14 percent forecast by economists. Business investment was weaker than it looked in last week’s initial reading. Orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft, a proxy for business investment, fell 6.1 percent compared with the prior estimate of a 5.8 percent decline. Durable goods orders were revised down from a 17.2 percent decline to a 17.7 percent decline. Wednesday’s data included the first look at nondurable goods orders. These fell 9 percent. The overall picture is one of an economy in deep contraction in April and March. But data since then suggest the economy probably hit rock bottom in that period and has been recovering as businesses have been permitted to reopen.  

President Donald Trump in an interview on Tuesday mocked former Vice President Joe Biden for continuing to wear a mask. The president pointed to a speech that Biden gave on Tuesday about race relations, where the former vice president removed his mask. “He took his mask off for the first time in a while, I haven’t seen his face for a long time,” Trump said. Trump spoke about Biden in an interview with Fox News host Brian Kilmeade on Wednesday morning. The former vice president has religiously worn his mask in recent months, even while delivering remarks or even while maintaining social distance outdoors. Trump mocked Biden for putting the mask back on while he was speaking. “Actually, then he started speaking through the mask again, he feels comfortable with a mask on I think, even though there was no one near him, which is interesting,” Trump said. Biden criticized Trump for fanning the “flames of hate” and trafficking in “fear and division” for political gain. But Trump mocked Biden for successfully reading a speech written by his staff after leaving his basement quarantine. “That speech was written, he didn’t say that, he repeated the words, that’s all, that speech was written for him because he doesn’t speak like that,” Trump said.

Polling across six swing states shows a tightening presidential race, as President Trump and Joe Biden (D) find themselves neck and neck, according to a Change Research/CNBC survey released this week. Change Research conducted the poll May 29-31, surveying 3,958 likely voters in six battleground states Trump won in 2016 — Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Biden holds just a one-point advantage over the president across the six states — a lead within the poll’s +/- 1.56 percent margin of error. The individual results indicate a tight race across the board. Trump leads in Pennsylvania by four points and Arizona by one point, while Biden leads in Florida by three points, Michigan by two, and North Carolina by one. Both are tied in Wisconsin, seeing 45 percent support each: Joe Biden has a 7-point lead over Donald Trump nationally (48% Biden, 41% Trump). That is up from his 3-point lead two weeks ago and his greatest lead to date. Across the six battleground states Trump won in 2016, Biden now leads by 1 point (47% Biden, 46% Trump). This is a 3 point shift in the margin since our last wave and the first time Biden has led. Biden and Trump are at parity in Arizona (+1 Trump), North Carolina (+1 Biden), and Wisconsin (even), Biden leads in Florida (+3) and Michigan (+2), and Trump leads in Pennsylvania (+4). #NEW @CNBC /@ChangePolls:#Pennsylvania Trump 50%Biden 46%___#Arizona Trump 45%Biden 44%___#WisconsinTrump 45%Biden 45% — Political Polls (@PpollingNumbers) June 3, 2020  NEW @CNBC/@ChangePolls  Florida:Biden 48% Trump 45%__Michigan:Biden 48% Trump 46%__North Carolina:Biden 46% Trump 45% — Political Polls (@PpollingNumbers) June 3, 2020  While the election remains several months away, experts and critics appear to be taking recent polling data with a grain of salt, as many pollsters and establishment media outlets failed to accurately predict Trump’s victory in many of those battleground states and, ultimately, his shocking defeat of Hillary Clinton in 2016. The survey coincides with the country’s gradual reopening following coronavirus shutdowns, which has been inundated by protests, many of which have turned violent. Trump addressed the nation in a Rose Garden speech on Monday, vowing to restore law and order in the event that state leaders fail to adequately act and stop the lawlessness dominating their streets. While Biden has criticized violent protests, he has also blamed police for escalating tension. “There’s no place for violence, no place for looting or destroying property or burning churches or destroying businesses,” he said in part, adding, “Nor is it acceptable for our police, sworn to protect and serve all people, to escalate tension, resort to excessive violence.”

TEL AVIV – An employee at the Prime Minister’s Office has been confirmed with coronavirus, potentially compelling Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to go into self-quarantine for the third time in as many months. The development comes amid an uptick in cases that began last week with 115 new infections in a 24-hour period – the highest in a month. The infected PMO worker, a technical staffer, was in a room with Netanyahu, Israeli media reported. “A worker at the office tested positive for coronavirus,” the statement from Netanyahu’s office said. “At the moment, an epidemiological investigation is being conducted, at the end of which appropriate guidelines will be given to those who came in contact with him.” Netanyahu entered self-quarantine on two occasions over the past three months, once in March after an advisor was diagnosed with the virus, and again in April when then-health minister Yaakov Litzman contracted it. The PMO worker was infected by a family member linked to a student at the Gymnasia Rehavia high school in Jerusalem, where more than 130 students and staff members were confirmed to be coronavirus carriers. Thousands of students and their families went into quarantine as 21 schools around the country racked up cases. The Health Ministry warned Sunday that it might order the shuttering of all high schools if outbreaks continue. According to the first Israeli antibody study, between two and three percent of the population has contracted the virus. That figure, representing up to 270,000 Israelis, is at least 10 times higher than the number of confirmed cases. Researchers conducted serological tests on blood samples of 1,700 Israelis.  

On Tuesday, Oklahoma State star linebacker Amen Ogbongbemiga said he tested positive for the coronavirus after he attended a protest in Tulsa. The six-foot-one, 21-year-old player made his announcement in a tweet on Tuesday. “After attending a protest in Tulsa AND being well protective of myself, I have tested positive for COVID-19. Please, if you are going to protest, take care of yourself and stay safe,” he wrote. After attending a protest in Tulsa AND being well protective of myself, I have tested positive for COVID-19. Please, if you are going to protest, take care of yourself and stay safe. — Amen Ogbongbemiga (@closedprayer) June 3, 2020  Ogbongbemiga reportedly discovered his diagnosis after being tested on Monday when he returned to the Oklahoma State campus to resume training with the school’s football program, ESPN reported. Now, instead of resuming his training, he will be quarantined in special housing and will undergo frequent testing until he is cleared of the virus. Still, it seems unlikely that Ogbongbemiga contracted the virus at a protest he only attended the day before. The coronavirus does not develop that quickly. Last year, the Canadian-born Ogbongbemiga was voted defensive MVP for the OSU Cowboys, and was ranked sixth in the Big 12 conference with 100 tackles. He also ranked fifth in the conference with tackles for loss taking 15.5 yards from his opponents Follow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry dismissed leaked World Health Organization (W.H.O.) documents on Wednesday as “seriously inconsistent with facts” after the Associated Press revealed the agency had concerns that the Communist Party was hiding pivotal information on the Chinese coronavirus. The AP reported on Tuesday that the leaked documents it had access to showed that senior W.H.O. officials were extremely frustrated in the early days of the pandemic with China for, among other things, delaying sharing information on the virus’s genome for over a week. In the months following the initial announcement of the discovery of a new virus, reports revealed that Chinese Communist Party officials had destroyed early samples of the virus obtained from Wuhan, where it originated, making it impossible for scientists to study its early evolution. The AP report also revealed W.H.O. officials complaining that Beijing was sharing information with the global agency “15 minutes before it appears on CCTV,” the communist state broadcaster, and that some feared a public rebuke of China would result in the Communist Party physically harming its doctors and scientists. “I don’t know where these ‘internal documents’ come from, but I can assure you that certain reports were seriously inconsistent with facts,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian – who rose to prominence on the world stage for claiming, without evidence, that the U.S. Army may have caused the Chinese coronavirus pandemic – asserted on Wednesday. “Since the outbreak of COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus], China has been acting with openness, transparency, and a high sense of responsibility,” Zhao said. “We have been in close and good communication and cooperation with W.H.O. and its office in China. We will continue to support W.H.O. in leading the global fight against the virus with concrete actions and work with the larger international community to uphold global public health security.” Zhao stopped short of denying the accuracy of the AP report or denying the authenticity of the documents the AP alleged to have access to, suggesting that Beijing does not have evidence that the W.H.O.’s alleged private concerns did not actually occur. Instead, Zhao left open the possibility that W.H.O. officials were, in fact, frustrated and concerned over Communist Party obstruction of scientific development to fight the virus, and branded their concerns “inconsistent with facts.” The Global Times, one of China’s most belligerent English-language state propaganda outlets, also did not offer any refutation of what the AP alleged about the W.H.O., failing to use the word “alleged” when relaying that the AP “cited recordings of internal U.N. meetings and internal documents claiming the W.H.O. publicly praised China in a bid to pull more information out of the Chinese government.” “Although the W.H.O. continued to publicly commend China, the recordings show they were concerned China was not sharing enough information to assess the risk posed by the new virus, costing the world valuable time,” the AP report asserted on Tuesday. Among the transgressions the W.H.O. documents show officials accusing China of committing were observing the party “sat on releasing the genetic map, or genome, of the deadly virus for over a week after multiple government labs had fully decoded it, not sharing details key to designing tests, drugs, and vaccines.” The internal documents showing that China stalled for as much as two weeks on sharing information like the genome of the novel coronavirus directly contradicts one of the most vocal points of pride in the Communist Party’s version of the Chinese response to the pandemic. While reports have indicated China knew of coronavirus cases as early as November 2019, the regime released the genome in late January, nearly a month after it shut down the wet market in Wuhan it claimed was the origin of the virus and after it alerted the W.H.O. to the existence of that virus. Chinese regime propagandists have insisted disclosing the genome of the virus occurred at nearly record time. The AP report also claimed W.H.O. officials felt threatened, according to their internal documents, by the Chinese regime, to compliment Beijing or risk losing all access to any information. Non-compliance with regime praise, they reportedly considered, may also lead to violence against Chinese scientists who may have disagreed with Beijing’s secrecy. Chinese officials are known to have arrested at least eight health workers in the early weeks of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan for posting advice on social media on how to contain a contagious disease. At the time, both Beijing and the World Health Organization were insisting that the Chinese coronavirus was not transmissible from human to human. The AP report follows a similar report from Reuters last month claiming that senior officials within the W.H.O. were frustrated and concerned about Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus’ insistence on complimenting and defending China on the world stage. “We knew how it was going to look, and he can sometimes be a bit naive about that, but he’s also stubborn,” an anonymous W.H.O. official told the news agency. “The [W.H.O.] advisers encouraged Tedros to use less effusive language [in praising China] out of concern about how he would be perceived externally, the person familiar with the discussions said, but the director-general was adamant, in part because he wanted to ensure China’s cooperation in fighting the outbreak,” Reuters asserted.
The German newspaper Der Spiegel published a report shortly before Reuters revealed that German intelligence agencies had reason to believe Chinese dictator Xi Jinping pressured Tedros to delay declaring the coronavirus epidemic a pandemic – meaning no global community was safe – and not to announce that the virus was contagious.

Zimbabwe’s ruling leftist party, Zanu-PF, will stage anti-U.S. demonstrations on Thursday at the United States Embassy and the European Union Ambassador’s office in direct violation of the country’s ban on large gatherings to contain its worsening coronavirus outbreak, New Zimbabwe reported on Tuesday. Zanu-PF’s national political commissar Victor Matemadanda confirmed the planned demonstrations at a press conference in the capital, Harare. Matemadanda said he “invited” Nelson Chamisa, president of the opposition party Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), and his supporters to join the anti-U.S. demonstrations. On Sunday, U.S. National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien described Zimbabwe, China, and Russia as “foreign adversaries.” He accused them of using social media to stoke unrest and “sow discord” in America, currently enduring violent and, in some cases, deadly riots nationwide following the recent death of a black man named George Floyd while in police custody in the state of Minnesota. The officer involved in his death was arrested. In response, Zimbabwe’s foreign ministry spokesman James Manzou reportedly summoned U.S. Ambassador to Zimbabwe Brian Nichols on Monday to “explain” O’Brien’s remarks. After the meeting, Nichols reminded Zimbabwe’s ruling party of its longstanding record of violations against human rights. He said: Mr. Floyd’s killer was charged with murder in days. Every American official, from our president to Minneapolis African-American Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, has vowed to deliver justice. Zimbabweans surely wonder when, after so many years, Patrick Nabanyama, Itai Dzamara, and Paul Chizuze will get justice? Americans will continue to speak out for justice whether at home or abroad. The ambassador referred to missing Zimbabwean political activists from opposition parties who have disappeared without a trace in recent years after standing up to the ruling party. News of the planned demonstrations comes as Zimbabwean troops and police reinforced coronavirus lockdown measures in Harare on Tuesday, tightening control of people’s movement amid a recent surge in coronavirus infections. Zimbabwe health authorities say the number of cases has “more than tripled” to 203 over the past few days, Reuters reported on Tuesday. President Emmerson Mnangagwa had recently eased Zimbabwe’s lockdown since it was first imposed at the end of March to curb the spread of the deadly virus. The MDC accuses the ruling party of taking advantage of the government’s restrictions on movement during the pandemic to target its members, calling Tuesday’s reimposed lockdown in Harare politically motivated. “So if this is about Covid-19 [Chinese coronavirus] why is it only happening in Harare? This appears to be more about politics than medicine or health,” MDC senator David Coltart wrote on Twitter. The MDC says Mnangagwa’s Zanu-PF party is “trying to suppress protests over a worsening economy” and attempting to “stop MDC supporters from gathering at the courts” where the MDC leader’s lawyer was due to appear after being arrested by ruling party authorities on Monday.

Health officials in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have confirmed a new outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in the country’s northwest, Voice of America (VOA) reported on Monday. The revelation comes as health authorities struggle to contain a separate Ebola outbreak in eastern DRC. The country is also currently battling a Wuhan coronavirus upsurge and the world’s largest measles outbreak, according to the report. Authorities identified the center of the new Ebola outbreak as Mbandaka, the capital of the DRC’s Equateur province. The city is home to over one million people and is known as a transport hub, located on the Congo River. At a press conference on Monday, DRC health minister Eteni Longondo said “four people have already died” from Ebola in Mbandaka, Al Jazeera reports. “The [DRC’s] National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) has confirmed to me that samples from Mbandaka tested positive for Ebola,” the minister said at the briefing. Equateur province previously battled an Ebola spike from May-July 2018 that killed 33 people. “This is a province that has already experienced the disease. They know how to respond. They started the response at the local level [on Sunday],” Longondo said. According to the report, health authorities in eastern DRC have been battling an Ebola flare-up that began in 2018 and has killed 2,280 people. This outbreak emerged in North Kivu province in August 2018. It then spread to the neighboring Ituri province, the site of ongoing inter-ethnic violence which further complicates the disease’s spread there. A recent U.N. report said that from March to May, over 200,000 people were displaced by violence from tribal hostilities in Ituri province. In March, DRC health officials had expected to declare the Ebola outbreak in Eastern DRC officially over after the last known Ebola patient was discharged from treatment. On April 10, however, a new case of Ebola was recorded in North Kivu province. The ongoing epidemic in eastern DRC is the world’s second-largest Ebola outbreak on record and the country’s single worst. The severity of the outbreak has exhausted the country’s hospitals. In March, a U.N. report declared the DRC’s healthcare system to be “on life support.” A recent coronavirus flare-up in the DRC further threatens the country’s public health. At press time on Tuesday, the DRC had recorded 3,326 infections and 72 deaths from the Chinese coronavirus.

Businesses in the United States shrank their payrolls by 2.76 million, according to a report Wednesday from ADP and Moody’s Analytics. This was far better than expected and indeed outside of the range of estimates. Economists had estimated the ADP private payrolls figure to show a loss of between 3.3 million and 11 million, according to Econoday. The median estimate was for a loss of 8.6 million jobs. April’s payroll figure was revised to show a smaller job loss, 19.6 million instead of the earlier reported 20.2 million. The report suggests the labor market may be healthier than it has looked to many economists. It is possible that businesses kept many workes on in anticipation of reopening in May or hired workers back. The Trump administration’s Paycheck Protection Program, which makes loans to small businesses that can be forgiven if they do not layoff workers, is also likely supporting employment more effectively than expected. It is also possible that the ADP report may not be accurate in these wild times. In the past, it has missed some big shifts in the economy. ADP estimates that Friday’s non-farm payroll number from the U.S. government will show a contraction of 8.6 million jobs. That is slightly higher than the Econoday consensus expectation of a loss of 7.7 million jobs. The hospitality and leisure category, the hardest hit in April, shrank by 105,000 jobs, according to the report. That was the best performing sector and likely reflects the deep cuts in prior months. There just were not that many jobs left to lose. Trade and transportation was the worst performing category in the services in May, losing 826,000 jobs. Overall the services sector lost 1,967,00o jobs. The good producing sector lost 794,000, with 719,000 coming from manufacturing.  

Teenage climate worrier Greta Thunberg has been watching the tumultuous riots that have erupted across America over the past week and voiced disappointment at what she sees. Late Sunday night she took to Twitter to register her displeasure and issue a call for “global structural change”: Devastating to see the development taking place in the USA.Centuries of structural and systematic racism and social injustice won’t go away by itself.We need a global structural change.The injustices must come to an end. #BlackLivesMatter pic.twitter.com/V5NWJFm0Qh — Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) May 30, 2020  The call to social action by the teen came just three days before she restarted her global campaign against all manner of “climate sins” by lashing the Danish capital Copenhagen for channeling waste water overflow into the sea. As Breitbart News reported, Thunberg expressed anger that these actions are coming from “the same Copenhagen who claim they’ll be climate neutral by 2025,” doubtless a disappointment to her and her supporters who see global climate action as a necessity for the very survival of the planet. Thunberg’s return to castigating the world for climate errors both real and perceived comes after an admission in March it’s “extremely likely” she contracted the Chinese coronavirus but subsequently “basically recovered” from it. The 17-year-old said she and father exhibited coronavirus-like symptoms at the time and chose to self-quarantine for two weeks following a trip through western Europe. Now she has added the U.S. to her expanding list of global concerns.

BERLIN (AP) – Europe’s unemployment rate ticked up modestly last month, contained by use of labor programs that have kept millions of workers on payrolls and as some people stopped looking for work, official data showed Wednesday. The jobless rate in the 19 countries that use the euro rose to 7.3% in April, the first full month when pandemic lockdowns hit the continent, from 7.1% in March, statistics agency Eurostat said Wednesday. Europe’s rise in unemployment has been moderate by international standards because employers are making extensive use of government-backed short-time work programs that allows them to keep employees on the payroll while they await better times. In Germany, Europe’s largest economy, the federal labor agency pays at least 60% of the salary of employees who are on reduced or zero hours. Some 10.66 million people were registered for that program in March and April, and 1.06 million followed in May, the labor agency said — though it stressed that this doesn´t mean all of them were actually put on short-time work. Germany has a population of 83 million. The European jobless figures also appear flattered by the fact that some unemployed people likely stopped looking for work and stopped counting as jobseekers. That seems to be the case in a country like Italy, where the jobless rate actually fell, to 6.3% from 8% in seasonally adjusted terms. In Germany, the unemployment rate rose modestly to 6.3% from 5.8% according to its own labor agency measures. On Wednesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s governing coalition was spending a second day hammering out a stimulus package meant to help kick-start the economy. It’s expected to be worth as much as 80-100 billion euros ($89-112 billion). Germany already is offering a total of more than 1 trillion euros in aid via various packages, which include money to tide small companies and individual entrepreneurs through virus-related closures and to pump capital into bigger companies where needed. The crisis has derailed the government´s dedication to keeping its budget balanced, long a point of pride. After six years in the black, it is borrowing 156 billion euros to finance the existing rescue packages and cover an expected shortfall in tax revenue. Germany started loosening coronavirus restrictions on April 20, about a month after they were introduced, and the easing has gathered pace since. However, the economy went into a recession in the first quarter and that is expected to deepen in the current quarter.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has claimed that “herd immunity” from the Wuhan coronavirus will be achieved by Autumn of 2021 at the earliest. Josep Jansa, an epidemiologist at the ECDC, said that the Chinese virus continues to change rapidly and that the agency has been reluctant to give solid advice for issues like international travel. But he said that the ECDC has offered indicators to EU member states on what stage of the infection they may be in. The epidemiologist added, during an interview with Finnish broadcaster YLE on Monday: “People have learned to do the right thing in terms of hygiene. This first wave is also waning. We believe that the situation will calm down by the summer.” Jansa went on to speak of the negative consequences of the virus, saying: “The situation has serious consequences for society. Unemployment, debt, poverty are rising. It is very difficult for very many people. Many have lost relatives. Some have lived in complete isolation, and it affects mental health.” Swedish Virus Deaths 'Catastrophically High' But Herd Immunity Not on Horizon https://t.co/dCU3qCmaY5 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 23, 2020  While most countries enacted lockdown measures to stop the spread of the virus, Sweden did not and has been seen by some as adopting an approach to achieve so-called “herd immunity”. A report from last month revealed that only 7.3 per cent of Stockholmers, the area in Sweden most affected by the virus, had antibodies against the virus, the number reduced to just 3.7 per cent nationwide. Jansa said herd immunity, which can require up to 60 per cent of the public to have antibodies, is unlikely to be seen anywhere in the world in the coming months. “Herd immunity will not be achieved until the Autumn of 2021, not here in Stockholm either. There will be some degree of protection, but herd protection requires that 60 per cent of people have contracted the disease,” he said.

Those protesting the police involved death of George Floyd can now receive funding if they are injured, bail money if they are arrested, and money to pay for coronavirus-related medical bills thanks to Saturday Night Live star Chris Redd, who announced a fund he set up for what he called “front line protesters.” “I’m working on a relief fund for front line protestors who may contract COVID19 over the next couple of weeks due to body to body contact. I would hate for my people fighting for justice struggle later because of it. If you would like to help, let’s connect!,” Redd said on Monday. By Tuesday night, the fund was live and well on its way to reaching its goal of $250,000. And here we go!!!!https://t.co/M4VTgrjnpS — Chris Redd (@Reddsaidit) June 2, 2020  The fund’s mission statement? As thousands of people take to the streets to protest racial discrimination and the many Black Lives lost at the hands of injustice,  we also have the unfortunate fact that this deadly pandemic is still upon us. The lives at risk of the injustice being fought against are also the most vulnerable to COVID-19. Many will not be in position to pay the inevitable cost associated with their brave efforts. This fund is to assist those that contract this disease while protesting and other protest related injuries as many are being attacked while speaking out. Monies raised, the fundraiser says, will help get protesters tested, help with coronavirus-related medical bills, and will provide bail money should protesters be arrested. Chris Redd is just the latest Hollywood star to either donate or help raise funds for those taking to the streets to protest across the country. The fund went live on the heels of a dark week in America, as mass looting, vandalism, and terror were rampant across the country. In New York City, where Chris Redd lives, NYPD Chief of Department Terence Monahan said his officers “made 700 arrests” on Monday night. “So, if there were 2,000 out here. We put handcuffs on 700 of them. The problem being is that they’re back out here again tonight,” Monahan said. The looters, Monahan said, are “using the cover of protests to fill their pockets.” As of this writing, Redd’s fund has raised more than $66,000.

ROME — Dr. Alberto Zangrillo, the head of intensive care at the San Raffaele hospital in Milan, told Italian media Sunday that Italy has beaten the coronavirus and it is counterproductive to keep attention focused on it. Speaking on the RAI 3 television network, Dr. Zangrillo said that “the swabs performed over the last 10 days showed a viral load that was absolutely infinitesimal in quantitative terms compared to the ones carried out on patients a month or two ago.” Professor Zangrillo was citing a new study by Massimo Clementi, director of the Microbiology and Virology Laboratory at the San Raffaele hospital, which is due to be published shortly. The Lombardy region, where the hospital is located, has been Italy’s hardest hit in terms of absolute numbers of those infected by the coronavirus as well as in fatalities. The study shows that, “in reality, from the clinical point of view, the virus no longer exists,” Zangrillo said. The doctor declared that his conclusions are corroborated by studies from Milan’s Vita-Salute San Raffaele University as well as by Italian virologist Dr. Guido Silvestri, chair of pathology at Emory University in Atlanta, who has stated that the retreat of COVID-19 “continues undaunted.” Zangrillo also said that to continue drawing attention to the coronavirus can wind up looking “ridiculous” from the perspective of clinical virology. Italian officials, who have gone to great lengths to encourage caution, reacted swiftly to Dr. Zangrillo’s comments. “I can only express great surprise and absolute puzzlement over the statements made by Professor Zangrillo,” said Franco Locatelli, the head of Italy’s supreme health council. “Just look at the number of new cases confirmed every day for evidence of the persistent circulation of the virus in Italy.” In point of fact, however, there were only 318 new cases discovered in all of Italy during the 24-hour period from June 1-2, despite aggressive testing, true to the ongoing trend in reduction. On June 2, the number of active cases of coronavirus in Italy dropped below 40,000 for the first time since late March, to a total of 39,893, continuing a declining trend of some 10,000 per week. Deaths with coronavirus during the same 24-hour period fell to 55 out of an average 1,800 deaths per day in Italy from other causes. Globally, 360,412 people have died with the coronavirus, according to Johns Hopkins University, putting it roughly in the range of worldwide deaths from the 2008-2009 swine flu, estimated at between 151,700 and 575,400 people. Coming to Zangrillo’s defense, Dr. Matteo Bassetti, director of the infectious diseases clinic at the San Martino hospital in Genoa, said Monday that the virus seems to have lost much of its lethal force. The coronavirus “may now be different: the firepower it had two months ago is not the same firepower it has today,” he said. Follow @tdwilliamsrome

During a press conference on Tuesday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) said that while he is concerned that protesting in New York City might cause a resurgence of coronavirus cases, “grappling with an extraordinary crisis, seated in 400 years of American racism…is not the same question as the understandably aggrieved store owner or the devout religious person who wants to go back to services.” De Blasio was asked why he was merely recommending that protesters stay home, while retail stores were banned from opening and religious services with more than 10 people were banned and whether there were different rules for different people. He responded, “We’re in the middle of a national crisis, a deep-seated national crisis. There is no comparison. I’m sorry, I do feel for the store owners. I really do. … And I’m so happy that on Monday, we’re going to start to open up.” After talking about the coronavirus numbers, de Blasio said that religious leaders in the city have said they wouldn’t move prematurely. He also expressed concern that there might be a resurgence of the coronavirus because of the protests, and that he wishes people would stay home in the name of health. He added, “But this is the other piece of the equation, when you see a nation, an entire nation, simultaneously grappling with an extraordinary crisis, seated in 400 years of American racism, I’m sorry, that is not the same question as the understandably aggrieved store owner or the devout religious person who wants to go back to services.” De Blasio also stated that the protests have only taken place over a few days are taking place outdoors and there’s less risk than having people indoors.

Donald Trump Jr. on Monday wondered why the establishment media’s obsession with restrictions spurred by novel coronavirus virtually disappeared, asking why such outlets are no longer condemning “mass gatherings that would have been so deadly due to COVID 19 just a few days ago” as rioters take to the streets. “Why is the media no longer concerned, and often almost gleeful, about all the mass gatherings that would have been so deadly due to COVID 19 just a few days ago?” Trump asked, noting the shift in coronavirus coverage as weeks of emphasizing social distancing abruptly came to a halt. “I guess these people magically aren’t ‘killing their grandmas’ by going outside anymore?!?” he added: Why is the media no longer concerned, and often almost gleeful, about all the mass gatherings that would have been so deadly due to COVID 19 just a few days ago? I guess these people magically aren’t “killing their grandmas” by going outside anymore?!? 🙄 — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) June 1, 2020  Many progressive personalities who condemned Americans taking part in the peaceful Reopen America protests across the nation — and who criticized the president for urging states to reopen — are refusing to extend the same critiques to protesters flocking to the streets this week and participating in demonstrations that have been, largely, dominated by violence and looters. “@realDonaldTrump already has the smell of death on him, and he is going to get more people killed with his ignorance, cowardice, chaos & incompetence. Period. This ain’t a carnival game,” actor Jeffrey Wright said in April: 👉🏾@realDonaldTrump already has the smell of death on him, and he is going to get more people killed with his ignorance, cowardice, chaos & incompetence. Period. This ain't a carnival game. Liberate America.✊🏾🇺🇸 — Jeffrey Wright (@jfreewright) April 17, 2020  Actor Ron Perlman implied that Trump was guilty of negligent homicide for his tweets promoting the liberation of states, and pop star Pink blasted Americans who gathered to demand leaders to reopen the country so they could get back to work: Maybe we should all protest the protesters?Hand out waivers for people to sign that says if they get sick they wave their right to healthcare.then they also agree to pay hospital bills of any single person they come in contact with. I feel like I’m living in the movie IDIOCRACY. — P!nk (@Pink) May 2, 2020  She has not extended the same proposal to this week’s protesters. Social distancing guidelines and restrictions limiting the gatherings of large groups still remain in place in most parts of the country. However, many members of the establishment media have demonstratively eased their calls for coronavirus-era safety precautions as chaos, in the name of “justice,” consumed U.S. streets.

A police lieutenant colonel has become the latest Russian official to mysteriously fall from a window amid the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, local media reported Monday. The 45-year-old woman, identified solely as Yulia B. by local authorities, allegedly fell from the fifth floor of Moscow City Clinical Hospital No. 24 on the evening of May 30th, where she was being treated for the coronavirus. She was described as a senior expert for the Forensic Center of the Interior Ministry, a government agency. Initially, reports suggested that she had died on impact, although these have since been contradicted by claims that she survived, but is currently being treated at an intensive care unit. According to Komsomolskaya Pravda, the policewoman left her ward to go into the corridor and consequently “fell” from the window and landed on the grass below. There has been no information on what caused her to fall. The incident comes after three Russian health workers fell out of windows over the past two months in mysterious circumstances during the coronavirus outbreak. All three of them had also expressed concerns about the Kremlin’s response to the pandemic. The most recent of these victims is 37-year-old Alexander Shulepov, who last month fell from the second floor of a hospital in rural Voronezh, breaking several ribs and suffering a skull fracture. He is understood to have survived his injuries. In April, the acting head doctor of a hospital in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk, Elena Nepomnyashchaya, died soon after another supposed fall from a window at the hospital where she was in charge. Before the incident, she had complained about her staff being forced to treat coronavirus patients without the necessary personal protective equipment (PPE). The previous day, Dr. Natalya Lebedeva — the head of the emergency medical service at Star City, where the majority of Russia’s cosmonauts are trained — allegedly committed suicide by jumping from the building after failing to contain the outbreak. The hospital insisted her death was merely a “tragic accident.” Falling or defenestration from buildings appears to have become a signature manner of death for numerous government critics in Russia over the past decade. Before this year’s incidents, the most recent case was that of the 32-year-old investigative journalist Maxim Borodin, who was thrown out of a fourth-floor window in April 2018 after investigating Russia’s military involvement in Syria. Having initially slow to pick up cases, Russia has now become one of the countries most badly hit by the coronavirus. As of Tuesday, Russian health authorities had recorded 423,741 coronavirus infections and 5,037 deaths, although some analysts believe the figure could be much higher as a result of lack of testing or even government coverups.

The massive protests over the death of George Floyd across the United States, which have devolved into rioting and looting mostly at night, cast doubt on the partial reopening of several non-essential businesses in cities plagued by the unrest as of Tuesday. Moreover, coronavirus testing sites have shut down in at least four states — Pennsylvania, Florida, California, and Illinois, over the violent protests, “limiting cities’ ability to track the virus just as thousands of people participate in crowded demonstrations across the country,” Politico reported Monday. Tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets in cities across America, with many rioting and looting at night, to express anger over the death of George Floyd, a black man, at the hands of the Minneapolis police. Two independent autopsies have deemed Floyd’s death a homicide. Now-fired white police officer Derek Chauvin kneed Floyd’s neck for several minutes. The mass gatherings in dozens of cities have prompted fears by government leaders and health experts of a spike in cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, which has disproportionally plagued minority populations. Many of the demonstrators have disregarded coronavirus mitigation policies imposed by local and state governments, particularly social distancing. The delayed reopenings could intensify the coronavirus negative impact on the economy, including the job market for minorities. In the nation’s capital on Monday, Mayor Muriel Bowser said the city is “very concerned” about the potential for a COVID-19 spike in the wake of several days of massive protests and riots, the local Fox 5 News reported. The mayor has scheduled D.C. to continue its phased reopening of non-essential businesses this week after starting the process last Friday, May 29. District officials have been relying on the community spread metric to make reopening decisions. While the city has excluded COVID-19 ­cases at confined facilities when calculating the community spread of the virus, Dr. LaQuandra Nesbitt, the city’s top public health official, said the city would take cases from the mass gatherings into account, the Washington Post revealed. Dr. Nesbitt proclaimed: As we ramp up our contact tracing, we will try as best as we can to link their exposure to having participated in one of these events, but it could be tricky to do so. If people are going to work, if they are going to dine in at the outdoor restaurants and we do a complete interview of all the activities that they participated in, we may be able to link their activity or participation to one of these protests. D.C. officials said Monday they would announce the criteria for lifting the additional restrictions on non-essential businesses later in the week. On Sunday, the Seattle Times reported that in that city, there is “fear the weekend’s destruction could make recovery even more difficult for businesses already wounded by the pandemic shutdown.” “This isn’t going to make that any easier,” Jon Scholes, CEO of the Downtown Seattle Association, told the Seattle Times. “It’s something we’ve just never seen in downtown Seattle.” In California, some businesses are also considering postponing the reopening over the demonstrations. Santa Clara County Public Health Officials eased the shelter-in-place order last Friday, allowing in-store retail, outdoor dining, and other opportunities. However, store owners received an urgent alert by the Alameda Business District, warning them to “consider boarding up their storefronts,” ABC 7 News reported on Tuesday. Other regions in California are also delaying the reopening until further notice. On Monday, the Los Angeles Times reported: South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa has postponed its planned reopening following the significant protests, violent clashes between demonstrators and police, and looting that have rocked Southern California in recent days. The upscale mall had planned to throw open its doors for customers Monday following a lengthy coronavirus-related closure but, in an online message, officials said the reopening would be delayed to an unannounced date. On Monday, CNBC pointed out that the demonstrations might derail Nevada’s scheduled reopening of casinos on Thursday. “Las Vegas is getting ready to launch a ‘Welcome Back’ ad campaign to encourage visitors to come. But now guests will have to weigh not only the risks of coronavirus but also of civil unrest,” the news outlet noted. “The current circumstances are tragic and negative for any business that requires physical access — certainly casinos would be included,” David Katz, a gaming industry analyst at Jeffries, told CNBC. The protests turned riots may also impact the planned reopening of casinos in Missouri, the news outlet added. In places like Chicago, where Mayor Lori Lightfoot (D) said the city would move forward with its third-phase reopening plans for Wednesday despite the protests and rioting, businesses may not be ready to reopen their doors. On Monday, the Chicago mayor reportedly acknowledged: I’m concerned about businesses all over the city who were preparing and saw the additional resources that they were putting in to opening up their businesses, community groups that were ready to start fully engaging with them. For many of those people, those resources and efforts were reduced to kindling or went down in flames. Minnesota Tim Walz (D) declared on Saturday that a spike in coronavirus cases is “inevitable” after the protests and riots.

The Associated Press (AP) on Tuesday reported on leaked documents from the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) that showed its officials were well aware China was withholding vital information about the coronavirus in January, even as W.H.O. leadership extravagantly praised China for its transparency. The AP report described a massive disconnect between W.H.O.’s public statements and the private frustration of its officials as the Chinese “sat on releasing the genetic map, or genome, of the deadly virus for over a week after multiple government labs had fully decoded it, not sharing details key to designing tests, drugs, and vaccines.” The report noted that even after a Chinese lab seemingly broke with Communist Party officials and published the genome of the Wuhan coronavirus, “China stalled for at least two more weeks on giving W.H.O. the details it needed, according to recordings of multiple internal meetings held by the UN health agency in January.” “Although the W.H.O. continued to publicly commend China, the recordings show they were concerned China was not sharing enough information to assess the risk posed by the new virus, costing the world valuable time,” the AP report said.  One W.H.O. official ruefully noted that the international health organization was getting vital information about the coronavirus “15 minutes before it appears on CCTV,” the Chinese state television network. The AP oddly insisted these revelations “do not support the narrative of either the U.S. or China,” even though it is exactly the narrative of the U.S. that China withheld information and gave W.H.O. false information, and W.H.O. spread those falsehoods while commending Beijing for its high degree of cooperation. The AP writers seemed to think W.H.O. should get a break because its officials were privately seething in frustration, rather than enthusiastically “colluding” with Beijing as willing agents of its political agenda. For example, some of the emails uncovered by the AP show W.H.O. officials worrying that if they openly accused China of wrongdoing, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) would stop cooperating entirely, and might even commit violence against Chinese scientists who were trying to help. That’s hardly a refutation of the U.S. narrative, since American critics have long suspected W.H.O. played softball with China – putting hundreds of thousands of lives around the world at risk – because it knew Beijing was ready to play hardball with them. It also does not speak well of W.H.O. that its officials refused to discuss the report with Associated Press interviewers unless they could be supplied with “audio or written transcripts of the recorded meetings, which could not be supplied while protecting sources.” In other words, they would not say anything unless they knew they had been caught red-handed spreading false information about a historically devastating pandemic to the world. The leaked documents also confirmed that W.H.O. knew the CCP was preventing Chinese scientists from discussing the coronavirus and ordering the destruction of samples, which is a direct contravention of W.H.O. protocols. W.H.O. Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was fully aware of these issues, but deliberately chose not to mention them when he finally declared a global health emergency at the end of January, instead gushing over the “incredible things” China had supposedly done to “limit the transmission of the virus to other countries.” Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) was quick to note that the AP report confirmed some of the worst suspicions critics held about both W.H.O. and the Chinese government. “Now we know for sure that Communist China hid critical data that could have altered the global response to the pandemic,” Scott said on Tuesday. “Communist China was more concerned with their global image than with saving lives. And instead of exposing Communist China’s deceit to the global community, the World Health Organization praised their response and was complicit in China’s cover-up.” “The W.H.O. clearly is not qualified to handle a worldwide health crisis, which is why I’m leading an investigation into their failures that led to the spread of the coronavirus,” Scott continued. “The president was right to cut funding to the WHO, and now the U.S. must take steps to hold Communist China accountable for the spread of the virus.”

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) dismissed growing impatience with her economic lockdown orders Monday and recommended residents take to the Internet to learn how to cut their own hair. Whitmer is easing some restrictions in the coming weeks, but has not budged on allowing barber shops and hair salons to legally reopen. Hair salons will still not be open, even though the stay-at-home order has been lifted. Governor Whitmer suggests people Google how to cut hair. Read More: https://t.co/Y78IJOJAnM pic.twitter.com/5nY400hblt — Mid-Michigan NOW (@midmichigannow) June 1, 2020  “Like me, you need a haircut desperately? A couple more weeks of this and we may be back in a place where we’re able to do that safely,” she said. “It’s still going to require strict protocols. It’s still going to require every one of us keeping our guard up and doing the right thing,” she continued, saying she hopes to take more steps before July. “But we’ve got to follow the data. And so if you’re one of those people that’s going to Ohio, I hope, I pray,” she said, holding up a mask, “that you’re doing your part not to bring COVID-19 home.” For those who have not traveled, she said, “Google how to do a haircut or throw your hair in a ponytail or curl it and get through the next couple of weeks so we can resume some of these things.” Whitmer’s Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs requires 1,800 hours of coursework “satisfactorily” completed in order to obtain a barber license in Michigan. Last Wednesday, a coalition of more than 350 salons, barber shops, and spa owners unveiled an eight-step plan to safely reopen their establishments. “Michigan’s licensed cosmetologists, barbers and their team members are capable, ready, and excited to get back to work meeting the needs of our clients,” Lisa Dennison, a regional director for Michigan Supercuts and Cost Cutters salons, said, WDIV reported. “Our salons have always met detailed health and safety standards, and we’ve developed a comprehensive plan to go even further to keep everyone who walks through the door healthy. We urge Gov. Whitmer to lift her ban on our jobs immediately.” Kyle Olson is a reporter for Breitbart News.

The establishment media and Democrats are encouraging Americans to go out and riot, which proves the coronavirus lockdowns are purely political. Item: You can’t social distance when you riot. Item: You can’t social distance when you protest. So we now know these lockdowns and all this crap about social distancing was a lie, because what you have here are the media encouraging their own viewers to riot and protest, and Democrats encouraging their own voters to riot and protest… And I think it’s safe to assume if the media and Democrats believed the coronavirus would kill their viewers and voters, they would not encourage such a thing. Here are some perfect examples… The hideous Gretchen Whitmer, the hideous Democrat governor of Michigan, spent weeks gleefully punishing her own constituents for the sins of going to church, buying garden seeds, getting a haircut, and holding house parties… Anyone who dared ignore Gretchen’s Kafka-esque outlawing of the very things that make life worth living, were harassed, fined, arrested, and basically terrorized by the State — all in the name of the threat of the coronavirus. And God help those who dared protest her tyranny, God help those protesters, who she shamed, blamed, and used to extend her anti-science lockdowns. Well, well, well — will you look at the hideous Gretchen now… Suddenly large gatherings and the coronavirus is no real problem in Michigan! How else to explain why the hideous Gretchen all of a sudden turned around to support large gatherings (unless, of course, you’re going to church). So we can at least thank the rioters for exposing the hideous Gretchen for the tyrant she really is. What’s more, after the rioters encouraged her to come out in favor of large gatherings, Gretchen’s entire rationale for lockdowns collapsed to a point where she finally surrendered on Monday and put an end to them. Thank you, rioters! And then there’s Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who led by example to prove lockdowns and social distancing are purely political by taking it to the streets! Yep, there she was, a walking-talking (but not very bright) piece of proof America’s political class know these lockdowns are a joke… There she was protesting outside the White House on Saturday with a large group of people who were definitely not practicing social distancing… There she was, openly violating Washington DC’s lockdown orders… Once again, let’s thank the rioters for exposing the truth. What more proof do you need than that, than a U.S. Senator violating these anti-science lockdowns? Well, how about the media’s turnaround? For two months you’ve had CNNLOL, MSNBC, the New York Times, and the Washington Post literally shrieking at anyone who dared go to church, the beach, or a house party… But now, thanks to the rioters, the media have all come out in full-throated support of violating lockdowns and ignoring social distancing. The facts about these pointless lockdowns are this… If you’re under the age of 50, the coronavirus is no more lethal than the seasonal flu. Almost all of these rioters are under the age of 50, so there is no real threat. Hell, those in their teens and twenties are probably in more danger of dying in a car accident than of the Chinese Flu. Bottom line: there is no reason to keep anyone but the elderly in quarantine. But in order to keep us locked down, in order to ensure Trump’s economy went south and they could institute cheat-by-mail, Democrats and the media (but I repeat myself) refused to inform us of those facts. Thanks to the rioters, we are finally liberate from that lie. When the rioters flooded into dozens of Democrat-run cities, Democrats like Whitmer and Harris, and fake news outlets like CNN and MSNBC, had no choice but to end their opposition to lockdowns and stupid social distancing rules. What else could they do? They had to support their left-wing terrorist allies in Antifa and Black Lives Matter. So what we have now are Democrats eating each other alive with all this blue on blue violence, which has no effect whatsoever on those of us in Red America — well, other than the fact that these riots have  finally forced and end to the coronavirus tyranny. So… That’s called a win-win. And when you add in the fact that Democrat and media support for these riots proves beyond any doubt there is no need for cheat-by-mail, that’s called a win-win-win.  Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

Nigel Farage has said that China’s increasingly aggressive foreign policy stance since it let the Wuhan virus loose onto the world must force Prime Minister Boris Johnson to get tough on the communist country. Leaked documents from the World Health Organization (WHO) revealed that China had withheld vital information on coronavirus in the early days of the outbreak. While for a fortnight afterwards, China delayed sharing critical information to the WHO on human-to-human transmission, according to records obtained by the Associated Press and reported on Tuesday. The latest report of a Chinese coverup of the deadly pandemic has handed the West more impetus to get tough on China. Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, in particular, has been consistent in calling for the British government to take a stronger position on the communist state’s transgressions on the global stage. Speaking to The Sydney Morning Herald on Tuesday, Mr Farage noted that China had shown its “true colours” in recent weeks, with its increased aggression towards those who call for the eastern powerhouse to take responsibility for the spread of the virus. Last month in retaliation for Canberra calling for an independent investigation into the virus’s origins, China put an 80 per cent tariff on Australian barley. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has also called for an international probe into origins of coronavirus. The calls were timed with several reports that the UK is planning to pull out of a deal for the all-but-state-owned Huawei to build 35 per cent of the UK’s 5G network, which intelligence allies warn represents a security risk. In response, Chinese state-owned media said that the UK would pay a “price” for expelling the tech firm. Report: UK Likely Funding Chinese Communist Military Through Joint University Projects https://t.co/Sh74XVN5kf — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 2, 2020  The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has also threatened “countermeasures” after the UK offered to extend visa rights — resulting in a pathway to citizenship — for Hong Kongers in response to China’s parliament rubberstamping a ‘security’ law that would effectively crack down on democracy advocates in the city. “The cat’s out of the bag, we now know what we’re dealing with,” Mr Farage told The Sydney Morning Herald. “The truth of it is if we are really going to get tough with China and we want to try and hurt China’s ability to become this global superpower then we’re going to have to face the facts that in the short term this will cost us too,” the Brexiteer said, hinting that China might make good of its threats, likely compatible to the economic sanctions it levelled against Australia. Amidst the intimidation, Mr Farage said: “It’s not something we can do that’s cost-free; it isn’t cost-free but, in terms of strategy, in terms of geopolitics, this is the biggest geopolitical struggle since the fall of the Berlin Wall 30 years ago.” Mr Farage has already committed to boycotting “mass-produced Chinese rubbish” and urged fellow Britons to do the same. After coronavirus exposed Britain’s reliance on China for medical equipment, the government said that would be exploring self-reliance from the communist state as well as looking to aid the growth of British tech companies to wean the UK’s telecommunications networks off of Huawei by 2023, with the company already imbedded in Vodaphone’s, EE’s, and Three’s infrastructure. Boris ‘Changed His Mind’ on Huawei, as Govt Explores Support for British Tech: Reports https://t.co/fqhpajZ0Io — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 1, 2020  Last week, U.S. President Donald Trump, who takes a hard line on China, postponed the G7 summit, suggesting that he might instead host a “G11”. Comprised of the usual G7 members — the U.S., UK, Italy, Germany, France, Canada, and Japan — Russia, South Korea, India, and Australia may also be invited, signalling the American president is looking to bolster support in the zone surrounding the communist superpower. The UK’s defence committee chairman Tobias Ellwood has also proposed the formation of an “Atlantic Charter 2.0” with the United States and Britain “leading the pursuit to design a new and defendable international architecture”. “Its purpose would be to establish a fresh international framework to promote and defend human rights, democracy, and trade (including digital) in contrast to the closed model envisioned by Beijing,” Mr Ellwood said on Tuesday. Mr Farage warned, however, that if Mr Johnson does not take this opportunity to stand up to the Communist tyrant, the Brexiteer is ready to return to frontline politics to campaign for Britain to do so instead. “And of course if the Brexit Party does have to reactivate you can rest assured that China will be up there in one of the top two or three policies,” Mr Farage said. “With my base, the debate on China has started [but] it’s still got a long way to go.” Exclusive: ‘Freedom and Autonomy in Hong Kong is Dead’ Says HK Watch Founder https://t.co/Xksx9OY0pd — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 28, 2020 

Green Party mayor Femke Halsema, who was photographed at a protest without a mask, has been accused of “spitting on” residents over her handling of the mass demonstration. A protest march in Amsterdam took place on Monday, with residents coming out in sympathy with Black Lives Matter protests in the United States and organisers saying they also wanted to bring attention to racism in Europe, as well. Among the thousands who turned out was the hard-left Green Party mayor of Amsterdam Femke Halsema, who mingled with the tightly-pressed crowds and was photographed without a mask covering her face. Dutch government coronavirus lockdown rules make a 1.5 metre spacing between pedestrians in public a legal requirement, but only strictly require masks be worn while on public transport — a demand backed up by police action and fines. Hoe is dit nog uit te leggen aan al die Amsterdammers die – ook financieel – lijden onder de coronaregels die wél door Femke #Halsema zijn gehandhaafd? pic.twitter.com/6by9rX4kBw — Forum voor Democratie (@fvdemocratie) June 1, 2020  The appearance of the mayor, and the fact the protest was able to take place at such a large scale at all while the country is otherwise being strictly controlled over coronavirus, has led to heavy criticism, reports Het Parool. All partner parties of the nation’s centre-right coalition government have condemned the event, remarking the images of so many Dutch residents out and protesting in public would undermine public faith in the coronavirus restrictions. Geert Wilders, leader of the Dutch Party for Freedom — a noted anti-mass migration campaigner who lives under constant police supervision because of his outspoken criticism of Islamism — noted Tuesday that “Halsema must go!” and told Ongehoord Nederland that it was unacceptable for the mayor of a great city to behave like a street activist and that she had shown no respect for the rules the rest of the Dutch people are expected to live by. Dutch journalist at the state NOS broadcaster Joris Van Poppel noted on Tuesday that ultimately, the mayor’s future would be decided in two weeks’ time if there was a sudden spike in coronavirus infections traced back to the demonstration she allowed to go ahead. Responding to criticism, Mayor Halsema said she only expected hundreds, not thousands, to turn up to the rally. To disperse it would have required police to deploy “with a hard hand”, and she was not willing to do that. Supporters of the mayor protested on Twitter that because many people at the demonstration wore face masks, outrage about the event was hypocritical. The apparent hypocrisy of the mayor’s protest appearance has been underlined by prominent Amsterdam residents, who compare the mayor attending the protest unmasked this week with her blocking the annual Second World War commemorations that were due to take place on May 4th. Rather than the typical annual commemorations of the Netherlands being liberated from Nazi occupation on May 4th-5th, which sees mass crowds laying flowers in the same city square as Monday’s demonstration, a small number of dignitaries including Mayor Halsema, the Dutch king, and a single survivor of the war laid flowers in an empty square instead. Amsterdam theatre producer Albert Verlinde was cited by Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad as expressing that frustration when he said: “Ms Halsema personally intervened so there should be only one survivor on the [Amsterdam city square] to lay flowers and now she allows this, while hard-working entrepreneurs and well-meaning Dutch do their utmost to comply with the 1.5-metre rule… Halsema spits in our faces.”

Liberty University announced this week that it had zero Chinese virus cases on campus during the spring semester. The university was criticized by mainstream media outlets over its decision to reopen the campus open in March at the outset of the outbreak. University President Jerry Falwell Jr. wrote in a letter to students, ““We are thankful to God that nobody who lived in a campus residence hall or who worked in a campus office tested positive for the virus.” According to a report by the College Fix, Liberty University reported zero cases of the Chinese virus despite criticism that the university prematurely reopened their campus to students in March when they returned from spring break. At the same time, most universities and colleges around the nation had already decided to suspend campus operations to mitigate the spread of the virus. But this week, Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. told students that no students or staff contracted the Chinese virus during the spring semester. “We are thankful to God that nobody who lived in a campus residence hall or who worked in a campus office tested positive for the virus,” Falwell said in a message to students. “No positive COVID-19 test anywhere in our region was linked to Liberty students who returned to their dorm rooms after Spring Break.” “The only COVID cases in the university community were employees working from home or offices off-campus and their infections were all traced to contacts in the local community with persons infected with COVID who were not related to Liberty,” Falwell added. During an interview on Fox News, Falwell Jr. said that their approach to the Chinese virus crisis should be a “model” for other universities. Student Carter Chapman argues that the university was able to maintain standard campus operations by restricting large gathering and access to common areas. “All classes were moved online and all university buildings were open but were restricted to ten people at a time,” said Chapman. “There were no places to sit and relax as all tables, chairs and booths were taped off and closed due to the virus.” Stay tuned to Breitbart News for more campus updates.

Maine Democrat Gov. Janet Mills reversed her decision last week to allow restaurants in the state’s southern counties to reopen June 1, suggesting to owners they sell already purchased perishable foods to prisons at the government contract rate. Just days before restaurants in Cumberland, York, and Androscoggin Counties were slated to reopen to allow for indoor dining with health and safety measures in place, the governor reversed course, claiming an uptick in COVID-19 cases in the region. “A date for the reopening of dine-in services in these counties is yet to be determined,” the Mills administration said. Mills’ decision to block the restaurants from reopening as the vacation season is underway, caused an uproar among business owners who had already purchased sufficient food for potential customers, called back employees, and implemented health and safety measures, the Maine Examiner reported: Mills was the recipient of further backlash, however, when she advised restaurant owners stuck with perishable foods of the “opportunity” to sell their provisions to the Maine Department of Corrections (MDOC) “at a price equivalent to the price paid for the same items through MDOC’s food contract.” In a statement to Breitbart News, Maine Rep. Larry Lockman (R) said Mills “imposed martial law lite” on Mainers back on March 18. “Her dictatorship has been marked by no less than 55 executive orders,” he said. “The first one forced restaurant owners statewide to close their dining rooms, without any prior notice, and toss the contents of their food lockers into the dumpster. Now she’s sucker-punched dining establishments in Maine’s three southern-most counties with her flip-flop on re-opening.” The Mills administration said in a statement released Saturday MDOC would “support” the restaurants: The MDOC has capacity to purchase perishable and non-perishable food items, except for dairy, at a price equivalent to the price paid for the same items through MDOC’s food contract. Purchased food will be served to staff and inmates. Restaurants interested in selling to MDOC would need to be a registered vendor (PDF)with the State of Maine. Payments to vendors typically take two weeks. “I hope this move will provide some measure of relief to businesses in these counties as we work to protect public health, keep Maine people healthy and alive, and mitigate the spread of this deadly virus so we can safely reopen,” Mills said. “There is no scientific basis for these orders,” Lockman said. “It’s all about the arbitrary exercise of unchecked executive power by an unreconstructed 1960s radical who posed as a moderate to win election in 2018.” As the Bangor Daily News reported Tuesday, to date, 284 Mainers have been hospitalized with the infection caused by the Chinese coronavirus, and 89 people have died. There have been 2,349 confirmed and likely cases in the state. Those who have fully recovered from the illness number 1,586, leaving 674 active and likely cases, a drop from 684 on Sunday. Last week, a federal judge allowed to stand Mills’ order requiring tourists to self-quarantine for two weeks after entering Maine, which is known as “Vacationland.” The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a statement of interest in support of a lawsuit by campground and restaurant owners. According to a statement by Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband of the Civil Rights Division: The United States Constitution requires government to protect the privileges and immunities of all citizens in our nation. These privileges and immunities include the right of Americans to travel freely anywhere in our country, and state governments cannot limit the right of out-of-state Americans to travel to their state unless doing so is substantially related to protecting the public safety. The Department of Justice remains committed to defending the constitutional rights of all Americans no matter where they live. The department will continue to be especially vigilant of any infringement on the right to travel that unduly harms the ability of Americans to earn a living and support their families. In response to the DOJ’s statement of interest, Mills said, she was “deeply disappointed – and frankly disgusted – that the U.S Department of Justice is making a concerted effort to undermine the health of the people of Maine.” The governor added the DOJ did not raise similar objections “when the President and his own task force took steps to limit travel.” Mills said the required quarantine for visitors is “a proven tool to prevent the spread of this deadly disease.” “It seems to me that [the DOJ’s] only actual ‘interest’ here is, at best, political or, at worst, to harm Mainers, not defend them,” she stated. Lockman, however, said, “Jackboot Janet has effectively killed Maine’s summer tourist season, and, with it, hundreds, perhaps thousands of family-owned independent businesses.” “I’m afraid the damage to Maine’s fragile small-business economy will be permanent and irreversible,” he added.

As Mexico returns to normal activities, health officials revealed the country surpassed 10,100 fatalities from Coronavirus (COVID-19). The most recent figures rank Mexico seventh globally for fatalities and 14 for confirmed cases despite widespread allegations of under-counting. During a nightly news conference, Mexico’s Undersecretary of Health Hugo Lopez Gatell and staff revealed the most recent numbers showing 93,435 confirmed cases and 10,167 fatalities. Al 01 de junio de 2020 hay 93,435 casos confirmados, 16,303 confirmados activos y 38,497 sospechosos por #COVID19.

The real scope of the pandemic could be much worse since Lopez Gatell and his staff are widely accused of under-counting cases. Lopez Gatell admitted his figures only accounted for government hospital patients. That practice pushed several states to release their own figures showing between 30 to 50 percent more infections. Mexico continues to see between 2,500 to 3,200 new cases per day. The country began its return to normal activities on Monday where businesses in some regions are allowed to resume operations in a limited capacity.

PARIS (AP) – Parisians who have been cooped up for months with takeout food and coffee will be able to savour their steaks tartare in the fresh air and cobbled streets of the City of Light once more – albeit in smaller numbers. The city famed for its vibrant cafe society and coffee culture will get some of its pre-lockdown life back as cafes and restaurants partially reopen Tuesday. The Paris City Hall authorized the opening of outside seating areas, but indoors will remain closed to customers until at least June 22. Dampening the mood of new freedom, social distancing of one meter (about three feet) between tables will be obligatory and drastically reduce the numbers. For the city well-known for its tiny chairs and fashionably-small 50-centimeter-wide (20-inch-wide) round tables that often touch, this will lower capacity in some outside areas by over half. To help matters, the normally space-restricting Paris City Hall is now allowing restaurateurs to be expansive – and have issued an authorization for them to enlarge their outside areas, or create one, without the normal legal red tape until Sept. 30. To do this, they will have to sign a charter promising to respect “pedestrian traffic, the cleanliness of the premises, safety or even noise reduction vis-à-vis residents.” But some restaurateurs have said that they haven’t received the charter, and the details remain fuzzy and confusing.

In one of his restaurant-bars La Belle Hortense, he said that out of a normal capacity of 126 people, there will just be room for eight. “It´s a start,” he conceded, but “two in three outside tables had to be removed.” Customers will have the freedom to eat without wearing a mask, but as soon as nature calls they will be required to don one to go to the inside bathroom. Some have complained that the government´s speedy announcement of the plans, just five days before reopening, were also problematic. “It was confirmed on Thursday, and with the holiday weekend it´s been almost impossible to order all the necessary products from Rungis,” Denamur said, referring to the Paris region´s principal food market.

ROME — Italians across the country are increasingly fed up with the bureaucratic slowness of returning life to normal after strict lockdowns, according to a survey. A survey of Italians during the final week of May reveals the highest levels of anger as a predominant emotion since the lockdowns began in early March. While feelings of uncertainty and vulnerability both diminished in the last week of May, these were replaced by growing ire at the government’s reluctance to relinquish its stranglehold on society. As Italians feel more and more confident in their overall health situation, they are losing hope in the future, reveals the survey, conducted by the marketing research company SWG. Survey by SWG market research company The underlying malaise and increasing rage were in evidence this past weekend, as protests erupted up and down the peninsula, from Milan to Sicily. The anger is chiefly directed at Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and many of the demonstrators called for his resignation as well as respect for the constitution, which guarantees basic freedoms. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> According to an analysis by Roberto Arditti, the president of Kratesis, a strategic management consultancy firm, the evident growing discontent among Italians is a powder keg that will explode if government does not accelerate a return to normal. While we have witnessed a decline in the primary emotions that dominated the long lockdown phase, only one has grown, that of anger, Arditti observes. The anger, which has increased from 17 percent in mid-March to 23 percent today, is still manageable, but only if swift action is taken, he states. According to Arditti, there are two primary causes of the rising resentment, namely the proverbial slowness of the public administration, that seems unable to take immediate action when it is called for, as well as recent discussions over continued isolation of certain regions, which risks provoking deeper divisions in the country. If the response to the current crisis are slow in coming, “the anger of the Italians could turn into a tsunami,” Arditti said. Italy is set to open up to interregional and international travel on Wednesday, but continuing restrictions on hotels, coffee bars, restaurants, and firms has made going back to business difficult and in many cases impossible. Last week, the iconic restaurant Dal Fortunato near the Pantheon in Rome posted large notices outside the building saying that there is no way for the establishment to reopen under current conditions.

On MSNBC on Monday, Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf (D) defended imposing an 8:oo p.m. curfew on the city by stating that the looting on Sunday, which impacted minority neighborhoods where people had already been hurt by the coronavirus. She also stated that while protests on Monday had been peaceful up to that point, if people don’t disperse when the curfew time comes, they will be arrested. She argued that such an action is needed, and “these types of demonstrations are really endangering public health.” Schaaf said that the protest on Friday, “was used as really a foil by people that were intent on doing damage and violence. But then last night was extremely different. We had groups all over our city, vandalism, looting, in, particularly, neighborhoods that are the most impacted by the coronavirus. Our neighborhoods in East Oakland and the Fruitvale where our African American and Latino communities live and depend on these businesses. They were hit last night.” She added that “there are two different things going on and let us not conflate them. There is legitimate protest and anger and grief over yet another killing of a black man at the hands of police, and this is within the context of the larger travesty of racism in America. And there is a group that is taking advantage of this moment to commit illegal acts, to do damage, to steal, to cause chaos. And we believe that those are two very different groups of people.” She concluded that the protests going on at the moment were a “beautiful, peaceful, family demonstration in solidarity with George Floyd and the quest for justice in our country. It’s going along beautifully. We are facilitating that peaceful demonstration, but when 8:00 comes tonight, we will be very clear that people must disperse. We will warn them. We will give them a safe way to exit an area. But if they do not, we will arrest them, and that is what we believe is necessary under these unprecedented conditions. And remember, you know, we were the very first region in the country to shut down our economy, to impose shelter-in-place, because of the coronavirus. So, our core small businesses are already suffering. We also believe that these types of demonstrations are really endangering public health.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

Violent protests erupted this weekend between “antifascist” radical leftists and supporters of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro across the country’s largest cities. The large organized “act against fascism and in defense of democracy” in Sao Paulo was reportedly organized by fans of the Corinthians soccer club. “We need to retake this space. The street is ours. We’ll be back next week,” one protester said as he was applauded by others, according to O Globo. The march attracted supporters of conservative President Bolsonaro, many of whom came dressed in the yellow and green colors of the Brazilian flag. AGORA NA AVENIDA PAULISTA.Ato contra o fascismo e em defesa da Democracia. O ato foi chamado pela Gaviōes da Fiel e vai unir outras torcidas organizada. “Hoje é o primeiro e vai se espalhar pelo Brasil” Por Lina Marinelli/jornalistas livres#fascistasnãopassarão pic.twitter.com/u2iS6VsZ3E — Jornalistas Livres (@J_LIVRES) May 31, 2020  The arrival of the conservative counter-protesters prompted Brazilian police to place a cordon between them to keep the peace. The two groups then proceeded to shout insults at each other. Conservatives reportedly began shouting, “go to Cuba!” to the leftist protesters, while the leftists replied, “go take chloroquine, cattle!” Bolsonaro has been a supporter of research suggesting that the drug chloroquine may be useful in combatting the Chinese coronavirus, a claim that has become a point of tense contention along ideological lines. One of the two health ministers Bolsonaro has fired during the pandemic claimed the president wanted to officially label chloroquine safe for use against coronavirus. “Go to Cuba” became a common slogan against the left in Bolsonaro’s 2018 campaign, a reply intended to highlight the ties between the Castro regime and the past presidents belonging to the socialist Workers’ Party (PT), Dilma Rousseff and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. In Rio de Janeiro, hundreds of protesters converged on the square in front of the state government palace Sunday chanting, “I can’t breathe! I can’t breathe!” an apparent reference to the riots in the United States in response to the death of Minnesota resident George Floyd, killed by a police officer. The Rio de Janeiro protest compared police brutality in the United States to that within Rio’s favelas, or slums, with signs calling on the police to “Stop killing us” and declaring that the “favela asks for peace.” “We are here today because we want to live,” one activist named Santiago told Voice of America. We are here today because we are tired of this genocidal state. We are here to say no more, no more!” In Brasilia, Bolsonaro attended an event organized by his supporters in continued protest against the lockdown measures imposed in response to the Chinese coronavirus by local authorities around the country. Having arrived on horseback and without a facemask, he did not make any remarks but instead greeted those in attendance, holding children in his arms and posing for selfies with his supporters.

As of Monday, health authorities have confirmed close to half a million confirmed cases of coronavirus and over 28,000 deaths, although some analysts believe these figures are below the actual number due to widespread lack of testing.

Over 70 people violently stormed the Karachi Civil Hospital in Pakistan on Friday night after alleging that the hospital administration “delayed handing over the body” of a coronavirus victim to his family, Pakistani newspaper Dawn reported on Saturday. At least one doctor was injured in the attack after she was “slapped” by one of the victim’s relatives, with one hospital official describing the mob as “beating doctors” during the assault. The mob vandalized the medical facility and “forcibly took away the body” of the victim. In videos taken of the mob at the hospital’s entrance, dozens of people are seen removing medical equipment, such as stretchers, from the facility and “breaking the sanitizer gate” at the entryway, Dawn reported. A local journalist for Pakistani newspaper the Express Tribune shared video footage of the mob attack, reporting that “the attackers had iron rods [and] knives” and shouted, “There is no corona[virus]. This is all a drama of doctors.” Karachi police and hospital officials said that a male patient was brought to the hospital early Friday morning “complaining of a heart problem” and died while being treated, according to Dawn. Suspecting the patient had coronavirus, the doctors conducted a test, which came back positive. The man’s relatives refused to accept the test results, accusing the doctors of declaring him to be positive for coronavirus “even though he was normal.” They then claimed the hospital was purposefully delaying the release of the man’s body and mobbed the facility late Friday night to forcibly retrieve it. Responding to allegations that the medical facility had delayed the release of the body, the hospital’s medical superintendent, Dr. Khadim Hussain Qureshi, told Dawn that doctors at Karachi Civic had followed the national government’s standard operating procedures (SOPs) for handling bodies of people who die from coronavirus. “We are government servants. We only follow what the government tells us,” he said. “It takes time for the [coronavirus test] result to be received,” he added. Qureshi expressed concern over the mob’s violent assault on doctors: What kind of ethics are these? Doctors are already putting their lives in danger to save people; the public should support them. The way they have resorted to beating doctors … if doctors refuse to work, who will save [the people]? A senior Karachi police official speaking to Dawn anonymously said that the hospital administration had not approached police to file a “first information report” (FIR), or the basic document to report a crime in Pakistan. He said that the police had decided to register a criminal case against the people involved in the attack over “charges of rioting and creating hindrances in official work.” Karachi police officials have also asked the hospital administration to supply CCTV footage of the incident so that authorities may identify and arrest suspects, according to the report. On May 14, a similar attack occurred at a different Karachi hospital, with a mob of at least nine people vandalizing a hospital ward and forcibly retrieving the body of a coronavirus victim they believed to be withheld from family by hospital authorities. Police arrested at least nine people involved in the attack and said no one was injured during the incident. Pakistan’s failing healthcare system struggled to treat citizens prior to the coronavirus pandemic due to the country’s poor infrastructure. Now, amid a recent increase in coronavirus cases and with the nation’s lockdown restrictions on peoples’ movement recently lifted, Pakistan’s hospitals are overwhelmed with the burden of treating a surging number of infections. National health authorities have warned they may be forced to reinstate a lockdown following the most recent spike in cases caused by the Eid al-Fitr Islamic holiday weekend at the end of May. At press time on Monday, Pakistan had recorded 72,460 infections and 1,543 deaths from the Chinese coronavirus. However, a lack of medical supplies such as testing kits and personal protective equipment (PPE) coupled with a general reluctance to test properly by the national government means Pakistan has tested just a small fraction of the population. The true number of coronavirus cases is likely much higher than reported.

President Trump activated the full D.C. National Guard on Sunday afternoon to protect life and property, after rioting throughout the weekend, the defacement of  monuments, and the setting fire to a historic church near the White House. A spokesman for the D.C. National Guard said “hundreds” of National Guardsmen — soldiers and airmen — are now added to other D.C. National Guard units that had been activated over the past four days. Trump was able to activate the National Guard forces versus a governor doing so, as D.C. is not a state and there is no governor to act as the approving authority. He activated them on Sunday at 5:00 p.m. D.C. National Guard Commanding General Army Maj. Gen. William J. Walker will command the Guardsmen. He will decide how to deploy and disperse them around the city to protect personnel and property, according to the spokesman. The Guard will be working with the U.S. Park Police, the federal police force for the district’s federal parks and monuments. They are working “24/7,” said spokesman Air National Guard Capt. Edwin Nieves, Jr. Nieves said the National Guardsmen may be armed by the order of the President for personal protection since they are not acting in a law enforcement role. They will also be wearing personal protective equipment and using crowd control equipment such as shields. The tasking for the National Guard across the country comes amid their mission to also assist with the fight against the coronavirus.   Follow Breitbart News’s Kristina Wong on Twitter or on Facebook.

Hong Kong police branded the city’s annual memorial for the victims of the Communist Party massacre at Tiananmen Square, Beijing, a “major threat to public health” on Monday, refusing to offer a permit. Every year since the massacre, beginning in 1990, Hong Kong has organized a candlelight vigil in honor of those killed during the 1989 massacre in Beijing. The vigil usually takes place in the city’s large Victoria Park, attracting thousands of people. Police have allowed the move without objection — including after China took over Hong Kong in 1997 — until this week. Hong Kong’s pro-China officials extended restrictions of public gatherings meant to contain the spread of the Chinese coronavirus last month, scheduling them to end June 5. When organizers submitted a request to hold the annual vigil on June 4, police said no. “Public assemblies are a high-risk activity due to large crowds gathering,” the police department said in a letter rejecting permission for the vigil. “Police believe that the event will not only increase participants’ chances of contracting the virus but also threaten citizens’ lives and health, thus endangering public safety and affecting the rights of others.” The letter was addressed to the organizer of the event, Richard Tsoi, vice-chair of Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China. Tsoi told reporters that his group may file an appeal, though they had also begun encouraging people to engage in a socially distanced candlelight vigil by holding candles at their doorsteps. The local broadcaster RTHK also highlighted impassioned comments from alliance Secretary-General Lee Cheuk-yan at a press conference on Monday in which he called the vigil a “litmus test” for One Country, Two Systems, the policy China agreed to govern Hong Kong under after the end of British rule. The policy prevents China from imposing Communist Party laws on the city and prevents the city from asserting national sovereignty. “In a way it’s a litmus test of one country two systems, if they suppress us, it means that one country two systems is no more,” Lee said, expressing concern that observance of the anniversary at all may soon be illegal. Hong Kong has seen a return of the pro-democracy protests that swept the region last year in the past month, as authorities were forced to ease coronavirus restrictions due to a lack of significant numbers of cases. The latest wave of protests is against a “national security” law passed by Beijing’s National People’s Congress, the Communist Party legislature, which allows Beijing to arrest and imprison Hong Kong residents for crimes such as “treason” and threats against the national security of China. As the Congress did not specifically enumerate elements of these crimes — but most dissent within China is tantamount to treason — Hongkongers have expressed alarm that they no longer possess freedom of expression. At the press conference Monday, Lee noted that vigil attendees typically chant, “end one-party dictatorship,” which may now be illegal. Lee also disparaged the alleged public health concerns to ban the vigil as “totally unreasonable and unscientific.” “We will mourn individually. We hope that there will be candles lit up in various districts across the city including ours at Victoria Park,” Lee announced. “Each candlelight vigil is self-initiated and does not constitute an assembly.” Hong Kong currently bans public gatherings of over eight people, so the organizers are hoping that small groups of eight will pop up throughout the city with candles. In addition, the Alliance has announced an online “vigil” and moment of silence that night. The Tiananmen Square massacre of June 4, 1989, killed an untold number of people, believed to be at least in the thousands, who had gathered peacefully in the nation’s capital to demand pro-democratic reforms. In 1989, the influence of the Soviet Union was waning in much of the world and uprisings against communist regimes spreading. Communist Party officials in Beijing responded by killing as many as possible, including many young people and students, in a military assault Beijing celebrated as recently as last year. Outside of Hong Kong, the Communist Party strictly censors searches related to the massacre. On June 4, even trying to conduct online searches for words like “today” could yield no results. In an exception, state media covered the massacre last year approvingly, a rare acknowledgment it ever occurred. Without mass killings, “China would have followed the way of the Soviet Union and collapsed,” an “expert” told the state-run Global Times. “That incident was a political turbulence and the central government took measures to stop the turbulence which is a correct policy,” China’s defense minister General Wei Fenghe said last year. “The 30 years have proven that China has undergone major changes China has enjoyed stability and development.” Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.

Monday at a press conference, Gov. Charlie Baker (R-MA) accused President Donald Trump of “bitterness, combativeness, and self-interest” amid the protests and looting in reactions to George Floyd’s death and the coronavirus pandemic. Earlier during a conference call, the president said governors and mayors were “weak” for not jailing protesters. Baker said, “I heard what the president said today about dominating and fighting. I know I should be surprised when I hear incendiary words like this from him, but I’m not. At so many times during these last several weeks, when the country needed compassion and leadership the most, it simply was nowhere to be found.” He continued, “Instead, we got bitterness, combativeness and self-interest. That’s not what we need in Boston. It’s not what we need right now in Massachusetts. And it’s definitely not what we need across this great country of ours either.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Government leaders and health experts fear the novel coronavirus, which has disproportionally plagued minority populations, could spread rapidly during mass protests over the death of George Floyd. On Sunday, Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) warned during NBC News’s Meet the Press that the protests, which tend to descend into rioting and looting at night, could “compound” the deadly and highly contagious COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus: I’m concerned that we had mass gatherings on our streets when we just lifted a stay at home order and what that could mean for spikes in coronavirus cases later. In fact, I’m so concerned about it that I’m urging everybody to consider their exposure — if they need to isolate from their family members when they go home and if they need to be tested — because we have worked very hard to blunt the curve. And while I saw some people with masks last night, others didn’t. When I saw some people social distancing, other people were right on top of each other. So we don’t want to compound this deadly virus and the impact it’s had on our community. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) expressed a similar sentiment on CNN’s State of the Union, saying he is “a little bit concerned” about the protests fueling the further spread of the coronavirus. He proclaimed: Right now, the immediate concern is to lower the temperature, stop the looting, and potentially keep our citizens safe from the riots that are going on. But the next step is to worry about this, what we have been focused on for the past couple of months, is the safety — dealing with this coronavirus. And there’s no question that, when you put hundreds or thousands of people together in close proximity, when we have got this virus all over the streets, is — it’s not healthy. There’s about a 14-day incubation period. So, two weeks from now across America, we’re going to find out whether or not this gives us a spike and drives the numbers back up again or not. Over the weekend, Breitbart News reported that some political leaders, namely in Minnesota and New York, fear that the mass protests and riots are an ideal breeding ground for COVID-19. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) expressed concerns about the riots’ impact on coronavirus, declaring on Saturday that “it’s inevitable” the demonstrations will lead to an increase in cases. “I am deeply concerned about a super-spreader type of incident,” the Democrat governor said. “We’re going to see a spike in COVID-19. It’s inevitable.” Minnesota State Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm issued a similar warning last Thursday. “We know, large gatherings do pose a risk in any epidemic, but certainly where we stand today with the state of COVID-19 spread in our community,” she said. “Knowing that we have community spread, we just want to again encourage folks who gather to be mindful of the risk.” Officials in New York, considered the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States, shared Gov. Walz’s fears about the potential for a rise in coronavirus among protesters. On Saturday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) proclaimed: I would still wish that everyone would realize that when people gather, it’s inherently dangerous in the context of this pandemic, and I’m going to keep urging people not to use that approach, and if they do, they focus on social distancing and wearing face coverings. “The last thing we would want to see is members of our community harmed because the virus spread in one of these settings,” he added. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) echoed De Blasio over the weekend, saying protestors and rioters “don’t have a right to infect other people.” On Monday, Cuomo indicated the demonstrations could jeopardize the state’s huge gains against the deadly virus. The protests and riots sweeping cities across the nation, including New York City, “could potentially be infecting hundreds and hundreds of people, after everything that we have done,” the governor noted. He added, “We have to take a minute and ask ourselves, what are we doing here?” Public health experts also warned that the crowds participating in the protests across American, numbering at the very least in the tens of thousands, could cause a surge in COVID-19 cases. Dr. Howard Markel, a medical historian who studies pandemics, told the New York Times: Yes, the protests are outside, but they are all really close to each other, and in those cases, being outside doesn’t protect you nearly as much. Public gatherings are public gatherings — it doesn’t matter what you’re protesting or cheering. That’s one reason we’re not having large baseball games and may not have college football this fall. “There are a huge number of asymptomatic carriers, and that makes it hugely risky,” he added. In an interview with CBS News’s Face the Nation, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), predicted that mass demonstrations would lead to new “chains of transmission.” Floyd died last Monday after a Minneapolis after Derek Chauvin, a now-fired white police officer, kneeled on his neck for several minutes in an incident caught on camera. Floyd was unarmed. On Friday, authorities charged Chauvin with third-degree murder and manslaughter.

The government has effectively made it illegal for people who don’t already live together to have sex, as that would be considered a “gathering”, and against the coronavirus lockdown social distancing laws. New amendments to the lockdown law loosen most of the major restrictions than had been put in place in March, including easing restrictions on senior citizens and those with underlying health conditions. Schools can reopen on Monday, and people can gather outside, including in gardens, in numbers of up to six as long as social distancing is still maintained. But a new line to the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) Bill adds on Monday: “No person may participate in a gathering which takes place in a public or private place indoors, and consists of two or more persons.” It says elsewhere, according to The Mirror, that “no person may, without reasonable excuse, stay overnight at any place other than the place where they are living”. The law means that both the person visiting and the person whose house is being visited could be fined £100, or £50 if paid within 14 days. Lawyers went to work on Twitter to discuss the interpretation of the law, with Human rights barrister Adam Wagner writing on Sunday: “I can’t believe I’m about to tweet this. From tomorrow sex between two (or more) people in a private place who do not live in the same household is a ‘gathering’ between 2 or more people and is therefore illegal.” However, George Pertez QC put forth that if the visitor was a prostitute, then that might be permissible “as that is reasonably necessary for work purposes”. Professor Lockdown Resigns After Breaking Own Lockdown Rules to Meet Left-Wing 'Open Marriage' Lover: Report https://t.co/N8LmFZSrKS — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 5, 2020  Police, however, will not have the power to forcibly enter your home to stop you having intercourse with a lover from another address. A spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the Metro that police could only enter a property “where they suspect serious criminal activity is taking place under separate and existing laws”. The spokesman added that police would continue “exercising their common sense and engaging with the public”. The Police Federation of England and Wales had said in April that it wanted increased powers to forcibly enter private houses to see if there were illegal gatherings. Constabularies and police forces across the country had come under criticism for their tyrannical approach to enforcing the lockdown. Such examples have included pouring black dye into a body of water in a beauty spot to deter swimmers, using a drone to follow dog-walkers, and shaming people for going for a drive out of boredom or families who walked to the shops together. Last month, the Crown Prosecution Service said that it was going to review every fine and prosecution made under the coronavirus legislation after it was found that the law had been applied either incorrectly or in a heavy-handed manner. The government’s scientific adviser Neil Ferguson, the author of the UK’s lockdown measures, resigned from his post after it was revealed that he had broken lockdown to have at least two liaisons with his married lover. Police said at the time that they would not be investigating further Mr Ferguson’s lockdown breach.

MADRID (AP) – Spain on Monday reported no official deaths from the new coronavirus in a 24-hour period for the first time since March. The development is “very, very encouraging,” emergency health response chief Fernando Simón said. Also, Spain recorded only 71 new COVID-19 infections over the past 24 hours, he told a news conference. “We are in a very good place in the evolution of the pandemic,” Simón said. “The statistics are following a trend. They are going in the right direction.” Spain reported its first two deaths on March 3. Another was reported two days later. Spain´s number of infections and death jumped exponentially. On April 2, it recorded 950 deaths in 24 hours – the peak death toll. The official death toll now stands at 27,127, with 240,000 confirmed cases. Spain was the second European country after Italy to be forcefully hit by the pandemic before it also spread death in France and Britain. One of the world´s strictest lockdowns was put into place in mid-March and managed to eventually reduce the pressure on hospitals after some were overwhelmed with patients suffering from the virus. The lockdown is gradually being relaxed as the medical situation improves. The Spanish government has warned, however, that the threat is not over and that the loosening of restrictions could be reversed. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said last weekend he will be asking parliament for an extension of the government´s special emergency powers for another two weeks. That enables authorities to order people to stay home. Simon said recent hot spots caused by people holding unauthorized “fiestas” can potentially bring a major new resurgence. “We are still at risk. Any of these outbreaks can mean a new wave of infections,” he said. “We must remain cautious.”


Sadiq Khan has written a letter to the government in which he called for an extension to the Brexit transition period to avoid “needless and hazardous” impacts during the economic crisis spurred on by the Chinese coronavirus. The Europhile mayor of London wrote to the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove — the minister in charge of the country’s Brexit talks with the European Union — saying that an “extension to the transition period is now urgently needed to give businesses and public services some certainty” during the coronavirus crisis. “The last thing the country needs as it tries to find a way back from the devastation wreaked by coronavirus is more chaos and uncertainty,” he wrote, per City A.M. “I urge the government to put political ideology aside and pursue the pragmatic route of seeking an extension to the negotiations so that we and our European partners can focus on recovery from Covid-19,” he added. The move by Khan comes in opposition to the party line set out by Labour leader Keir Starmer, who said last week that the issue of Brexit was “over” and pledged not to campaign to rejoin the EU. “We’ve left the EU, and therefore the Leave/Remain argument is over and the only argument now is what sort of a deal we have with the EU and what sort of deals we have with the rest of the world,” Starmer said. Brexit Day: Sadiq Khan ‘Heartbroken’ Britain is Finally Leaving the EU https://t.co/dPn7dmP2Ba — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 31, 2020  Khan’s attempt to stymie the UK from reclaiming full independence from the bloc comes after the EU’s trade negotiator, Michel Barnier, wrote a letter to a group of Europhile MPs, saying that the bloc would support extending the transition period by up to two years. The proposed delay would effectively postpone Brexit until 2023 — seven years after the British people voted to leave. A government spokesman said in response to the mayor’s letter: “An extension to the transition period would bind us into future EU legislation, without us having any say in designing it, but still having to foot the bill as we would still have to make payments into the EU budget.” “The EU themselves have said that their next budget will be unusual, and we would have no say in what it would go towards. “We need to be able to design our own rules, in our best interests, to manage our response to coronavirus – without the constraints of following EU rules,” the spokesman added. Teams of negotiators from the UK and the EU will meet this week and meetings between Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are scheduled for next month. The top negotiator for the UK, David Frost, has pledged that if there is no progress made, Britain will walk away from talks and begin preparing to trade with the bloc on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms. “It’s the firm policy of the government that we will not extend the transition period and, if asked, we would not agree to it,” Frost said. London Mayor Sadiq Khan says "structural racism" in Britain has led to more racial minorities dying from coronavirus. https://t.co/sAUVrZc4Fr — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) April 22, 2020  Follow Kurt on Twitter at @KurtZindulka

First Lady Melania Trump on Monday spoke out against the violent protests blighting major cities across the country. “Saddened to see our country and communities being damaged and vandalized,” she wrote on Twitter. “I ask everyone to protest in peace and focus on taking care of one another and healing our great nation.” Saddened to see our country & communities being damaged & vandalized. I ask everyone to protest in peace & focus on taking care of one another & healing our great nation. — Melania Trump (@FLOTUS) June 1, 2020  The first lady continues to condemn the rioting and vandalizing on social media. “Our country allows for peaceful protests, but there is no reason for violence,” she wrote on Friday morning. She also urged Americans to continue working to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. “I’ve seen our citizens unify and take care of one another through COVID19 and we can’t stop now,” she wrote. She also offered her sympathies for the family of George Floyd, who died after a police officer pressed his neck with his knee for several minutes while putting him into custody. Floyd’s death sparked protests across the country. “My deepest condolences to the family of George Floyd,” she wrote. “As a nation, let’s focus on peace, prayers & healing.” Saddened to see our country & communities being damaged & vandalized.

ROME — Pope Francis has called for priority to be given to persons rather than to the economy in responding to the coronavirus pandemic. “I make an appeal: that nobody lacks healthcare,” the pope said during his Regina Caeli message in Saint Peter’s Square Sunday. “Care for people, instead of saving for the economy. Care for people, who are more important than the economy.” “We people are temples of the Holy Spirit, the economy is not,” the pontiff insisted. The pope has often proposed a dichotomy between opting for people or opting for the economy, but it is not apparent how this clean differentiation works. The economy does not exist independently of people and when people lose their jobs and their savings, it is these real people and those who depend on them who suffer as a consequence. According to a series of reports, in fact, poor people are suffering disproportionately from the economic downturn caused by the extreme measures adopted to counter the coronavirus pandemic. While many affluent people have reserves of savings and can get by even without working for a while, the poor do not have this luxury since a great many live from paycheck to paycheck. One recent report predicted that the rise in the suicide rate caused by lockdowns and job losses in Australia will exceed deaths from the Wuhan coronavirus by a factor of ten. Researchers from Sydney University’s Brain and Mind Centre said they expect a 50 percent rise in the national suicide rate because of the economic and social impact of government responses to the virus, which will drive deaths to as much as ten times higher than those causes by the coronavirus itself. Italy, on the other hand, has reported large numbers of people who are paid under the table and therefore have no unemployment benefits when they are unable to work. Some 300,000 people are paid under the table in Sicily alone, out of 3,700,000 in all of Italy, and most now find themselves without any income, a situation that the Mafia could exploit as people get desperate, warned Leoluca Orlando, the mayor of Palermo, Sicily. “Discomfort and malaise are growing and we are recording worrying reports of protest and anger that is being exploited by criminals who want to destabilize the system,” Mr. Orlando said in late March. “The more time passes, the more resources are exhausted,” he said. “The little savings people have are running out.” “In the south, there is a very fragile socio-economic balance, where black market work, mafias, and crime thrive,” noted the former president of the Italian Senate, Pietro Grasso. “There is a portion of population that leaves the house in the morning with the sole aim of feeding their family, without a reference point. All these families now have no chance of finding a solution to their livelihood,” he said. Last week, the Italian newspaper Il Giornale reported that nearly a third of the country’s businesses will not reopen and millions will remain without work or income, part of the long-term human cost of Italy’s nationwide coronavirus lockdown. In the United States as well, a number of social commentators have suggested that the damage caused by lockdowns could be worse than those of the virus itself. “Many large companies can withstand a few weeks without revenue but that isn’t true of millions of small and mid-sized firms,” one Wall Street Journal op-ed noted. The human cost of government-mandated shutdowns in terms of job losses and bankruptcies will “exceed what most Americans imagine,” the article stated, adding that shuttering the national economy will result in “a tsunami of economic destruction that will cause tens of millions to lose their jobs.” In a 2015 press conference Pope Francis confessed that he has “a great aversion” toward the economy because his father was an accountant and used to bring his work home with him on the weekends, and that, in fact, he does not actually “understand” the economy very well. If this is indeed the case, humility and good sense would seem to dictate that sweeping statements denouncing attention to economic recovery in favor of helping “people” would be better left unsaid. Sometimes, saving the “people” means saving the economy that puts food in their mouths and clothes on their backs. It is hard to imagine a more effective strategy for helping real people than by putting them back to work. Follow @tdwilliamsrome

AP MADRID – Spain´s national statistics office said that it received zero international tourists in April after the nation had closed its borders at the height of its coronavirus outbreak. In April 2019, 7 million tourists spent 7 billion euros ($7.8 billion) in Spain. Spain is waiting until July to reopen its border for foreign tourists. In the meantime, authorities are encouraging Spaniards to vacation inside at home. Tourism is a pillar of Spain´s economy. Eighty million annual visitors generate 12% of Spain´s gross domestic product and help employ 2.6 million people. Amid the global economic slowdown provoked by the pandemic, Spain´s government forecasts its economy will shrink by 9% and unemployment to reach 19% this year. Meanwhile museums are reopening in the Netherlands. AP reports: In the Netherlands, some of the most beloved museums in the world reopened to the public, with Rembrandt´s The Night Watch and Van Gogh´s Sunflowers back on show. And out of gratitude, visitors to the Van Gogh museum even received a real sunflower upon their departure. At the Mauritshuis in the Hague, the gaze of Vermeer´s Girl with the Pearl was also enticing visitors to come back. All such treasures had been hidden from the public for over two months as the nations was forced into lockdown measures for the coronavirus. At the most famous institution, the Rijksmuseum, visitors even got to hear that the blockbuster show “aravaggio-Bernini. Baroque in Rome” was being extended until September. Museums all over the world have been struggling to get through the pandemic crisis and UNESCO has said that one in eight might have to close their doors for good. Some of the major institutions in Europe have been losing over 2 million euros ($2.2 million) a month. Rembrandt´s The Night Watch

On Monday morning, certain states in Mexico will be given permission to return to a “new normal” as they restart from lockdown. The push to reopen comes as the country climbs to seventh place globally for Coronavirus fatalities. During a daily news conference, Mexico’s Undersecretary of Health Hugo Lopez Gatell said the nation will follow a color-coded system based on the number of cases in each state. Most of Mexico is listed “red” as the virus spreads with an approximate fatality rate of 11 percent. La Nueva Normalidad del 1 de junio no significa que miles de personas puedan salir a la calle como antes. Las autoridades sanitarias estatales podrán aplicar disposiciones adicionales para evitar contagios, no al contrario. pic.twitter.com/L890A3mp9T — Hugo López-Gatell Ramírez (@HLGatell) May 31, 2020  The most recent federal figures show a current total of 90,664 confirmed cases and 9,930 deaths. Mexico recently surpassed Belgium for seventh place in fatalities. Al 31 de mayo de 2020 hay 90,664 casos confirmados, 16,962 confirmados activos y 36,803 sospechosos por #COVID19.

Despite the sharp increase in official figures, federal authorities are still widely accused of under-reporting the true scale. Lopez Gatell admitted that some of the figures in his reports only account for cases in government hospitals. This discrepancy pushed several states to release their own statistics that show between 30-50 percent more cases. Ildefonso Ortiz is an award-winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.

Democrats locked young people down for no valid reason for an indeterminate amount of time and now we got riots. Huh? How about that? What did you idiots expect? Did you think you could lock down millions and millions and millions of young people for no valid reason, give them no reopen date — rob them of their jobs, of school, of structure; remove the social outlets — sports, bars, parties — that allow them to burn off energy and aggression, to blow off steam, and there would be no consequence? Worse still, and exclusively in the Democrat-run states and cities that have so far seen the worst violence (Minneapolis, Los Angeles, Chicago, Detroit, New York), young people are still locked down, and they’re locked down with no end in sight because their idiot political leaders (all Democrats) keep moving the goalposts and still refuse to offer a clear reopening deadline to grab hold of. And then there is the simple fact young people were and are locked down for no valid scientific or moral reason. It’s just a fact that if you’re under 50 years of age, the coronavirus is no more fatal than the seasonal flu. Nevertheless, even though people in their teens and twenties are probably in more danger of dying in a car accident than they are of the coronavirus, we shut them down, we shattered their lives… We locked them down, annihilated whatever structure they had — we killed their source of income, told them they couldn’t gather, couldn’t go to camp, they lost graduation ceremonies that can never be repeated and graduation parties they dream of all year… We boarded up the basketball hoops, poured sand in the skateboard parks, closed the parks and beaches, eliminated church functions, outlawed parties… Hell, we outlawed just hanging out and playing grab-ass with your buddies, which is the perfect way to blow off some steam. And in many of these Democrat-run cities, there’s still no end in sight. Just when the citizens of these states and cities believe their Democrat leaders are going to set them free, it’s two more weeks, two more weeks, two more weeks… This is madness. The curve is bent and has been bent for more than a month. Remember that? Remember when we were told we had to lose our jobs and social lives and everything that makes worth living to bend the infection curve, to ensure our health care systems weren’t overwhelmed? Remember when we were told that was The Goal? Well, the curve is not just bent, it’s flattened, and in 98 percent of the country the system was never in any danger of being overwhelmed… But here we are, two more weeks and two more weeks and two more weeks, and there are still Democrat governors who still have their citizens locked down… And for no good reason —  unless you believe keeping entire cities locked down to damage the economy to get Rapey Joe Biden elected is a good reason. Listen, I’m not saying that there would not have been some violence after what those cops did to George Floyd (cops who are part of a police department that’s been run by Democrats for 48 years). Another Ferguson or Baltimore was certainly possible without these pointless lockdowns. But, come on, this no longer has anything to do with Mr. Floyd. Listen, when you’re teenager or a twenty-something who’s been locked down for weeks, and have lost faith the lockdown will ever end, a little of the ol’ ultra-violence looks pretty good, like a choice way to finally blow off that steam, socialize, and feel a part of something other than your iPhone and crappy apartment. Plus, these riots are media approved! That’s the best part! The media will scold and shame you for going to the beach, attending church, enjoying a block party, or hanging out at the park. That’s verboten. But as soon as people started gathering to riot… Well, did you notice how the very same media that shamed churchgoers and kids partying in the Ozarks turned around to justify and excuse massive crowds of people gathering and socializing? You see, according to the media (who set all the rules), pick-up basketball is evil, looting and burning is moral. What the hell did you expect to come from that? “Woe to those who call evil good and good evil.” Listen, don’t get me wrong… I don’t really care about any of this. You see, I live in Rural America… Y’all want to vote for the Democrats who lock people down until they blow up, that’s your choice. Y’all want to support a media that encourages people to burn down your neighborhood, that’s your choice. It’s a free country. You get what you vote for and you fools got riots. Out here in Red America, we all we got is peace and quiet… Out here in Red America, these riots are merely a reality show called TOLDJASO. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

One of the witnesses who reported Dominic Cummings for allegedly breaking lockdown drove 250 miles during it himself, while another now admits he made up a sighting of the adviser — supposedly as a joke. Retired teacher Robin Lees reported Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s chief adviser to the police after seeing him near Barnard Castle, where he had made a short drive to see if he was well enough for a longer journey back to London. Durham Constabulary, which did not find that Mr Cummings’ initial trip from London broke the lockdown rules, has said the Barnard Castle outing may have been a “minor breach”. However, the Mail on Sunday now suggests that the man who reported Mr Cummings to the police force “broke lockdown regulations himself by making a 526-mile round-trip from Barnard Castle to London to bring his university student daughter to the family home. “My daughter came back from Canada and isolated in London. She never came home for seven weeks. I didn’t break any lockdown rules. I went and collected her after we were told we could,” Lees insisted to reporters, referring to an easing of travel restrictions on May 11th to allow people to drive as far as they pleased — although the Mail on Sunday notes that “this was only if they were going to an outdoors location and as long as the social distancing protocol was observed.” “I tell the truth and I do not like this intrusion into my family and this is absolutely nothing to do with them,” Lees complained — somewhat ironically, given Cummings did himself move from London to Durham to make sure his 4-year-old would not be without childcare if he and his wife were incapacitated by their coronavirus infections. “I do object to my family being involved. This is nothing to do with my family, right? I have had a lot of stuff on Twitter,” Lees added. ‘Social distancing’   pic.twitter.com/yEHWYmjxvA — Michael Heaver (@Michael_Heaver) May 24, 2020  The revelations come as another supposed witness to Cummings’ movements during lockdowns, Remain supporter Tim Matthews, reveals he outright fabricated his sighting of Cummings — lending credence to the Brexiteer’s insistence that allegations of a second trip to Durham are wholly false. “I made that up afterwards, a few days ago in fact,” Matthews admitted. “I modified it for a little bit of comedy value,” he added, referring to Strav running app data which he doctored in order to make it look as though he was in an area where Cummings was alleged to have travelled. “I undid it later, I’m sorry. A bit of comedy value even if it was really inappropriate,” Matthews added.

ROME — Pope Francis urged Christians Sunday to work for unity and warned them of the triple threat of narcissism, victimhood, and pessimism. In homily on the feast of Pentecost, which commemorates the coming of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles, the pope said that there are three main enemies “always lurking at the door of our hearts: narcissism, victimhood, and pessimism” and each of these has been present during the coronavirus pandemic. “Narcissism makes us idolize ourselves, to be concerned only with what is good for us,” he said in St. Peter’s Basilica. “The narcissist thinks: ‘Life is good if I profit from it.’ So he or she ends up saying: ‘Why should I give myself to others?’” This temptation has been especially evident during the health crisis, he suggested, where selfishness and a retreat into one’s own concerns has been in evidence. “In this time of pandemic, how wrong narcissism is: the tendency to think only of our own needs, to be indifferent to those of others, and not to admit our own frailties and mistakes,” he said. “But the second enemy, victimhood, is equally dangerous,” the pontiff continued. “Victims complain every day about their neighbour: ‘No one understands me, no one helps me, no one loves me, everyone has it in for me!’” Like narcissists, professional victims are self-centered, but this malady reveals itself in a slightly different way. “How many times have we not heard these complaints! The victim’s heart is closed, as he or she asks, ‘Why aren’t others concerned about me?’” he said. “In the crisis we are experiencing, how ugly victimhood is! Thinking that no one understands us and experiences what we experience.” The third enemy is pessimism, according to which nothing is going well in society, politics, or the Church, Francis said. “The pessimist gets angry with the world, but sits back and does nothing, thinking: ‘What good is giving? That is useless.’” This temptation has also manifested itself during the pandemic, the pope concluded, and shows itself especially in exaggerating the problem and believing that nothing will ever return to normal. “At this moment, in the great effort of beginning anew, how damaging is pessimism, the tendency to see everything in the worst light and to keep saying that nothing will return as before!” he said. “When someone thinks this way, the one thing that certainly does not return is hope.” These three enemies disguise an unnamed idolatry, the worship of a false god, Francis said. The narcissist’s idol is the mirror, the “mirror-god,” he said, while the victim worships the “complaint-god” and the pessimist worships the “negativity-god,” each of which leads to a loss of hope and of appreciation for the gift of life. “We need the Holy Spirit, the gift of God, he said, because He “heals us of narcissism, victimhood and pessimism” and heals us from “the mirror, complaints, and darkness.” Follow @tdwilliamsrome

ROME — Pope Francis said this weekend the coronavirus pandemic should transform people’s lives for the better, opening the way for a “more Christian society.” “When we get out of this pandemic, we will not be able to continue doing what we have been doing, and how we have been doing it. No, everything will be different,” the pope said in a video-message for the Christian feast of Pentecost, commemorating the coming of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles. “Out the great tests of humanity — and among them the pandemic — people come out either better or worse. They do not come out the same,” Francis said in his Spanish-language address. Having suffered the lockdowns, people should be more attuned to the needs of others, he said, and more disposed to tackle the “pandemic of poverty.” “All the suffering will have been useless if we do not build together a fairer, more equitable, more Christian society, not in name, but in reality, a reality that leads us to Christian conduct,” he continued. “If we do not work to end the pandemic of poverty in the world, with the pandemic of poverty in each of our countries, in the city where each one of us lives, this time will have been in vain.” “Today more than ever we need the Father to send us the Holy Spirit,” the pope said, because the world needs true witnesses to Jesus. “Today the world suffers, it is wounded. We live in a very wounded, suffering world, especially the poorest, who are discarded,” he said. “When all our human securities have disappeared, the world needs us to give it Jesus. It needs our witness to the Gospel, the Gospel of Jesus.” “We do not save ourselves. No one is saved alone. Nobody,” Francis said. “We know it, we knew it, but this pandemic that we live has made us experience it in a much more dramatic way.” “We have before us the duty to build a new reality,” he added. “The Lord will do it and we can collaborate, since he says, ‘I make all things new.’” Follow @tdwilliamsrome

NEW YORK (AP) — Major League Baseball players proposed a 114-game regular season Sunday, up from 82 in management’s offer, but no additional pay cuts beyond the one they agreed to in March, a person familiar with the plan told The Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because no details were announced. Opening day in the coronavirus-delayed season would be June 30 and the regular season would end Oct. 31, nearly five weeks after the Sept. 27 conclusion that MLB’s proposal stuck to from the season’s original schedule. The union offered scheduling flexibility to include more doubleheaders. Players, like MLB, would increase postseason teams from 10 to 14. While management proposed an expanded postseason for 2020 only, the union offered it for this year and next. A player would receive about about 70% of his salary under the union plan. MLB’s offer Tuesday included a sliding scale in which those at the $563,500 minimum would get about 47% and those at the top — led by Mike Trout and Gerrit Cole at $36 million — would receive less than 23%. All players would have the right to opt out of the season under the union plan. Those who meet qualifications for high risk or reside with a person who qualifies as high risk would receive salary and major league service. Others who opt out would receive major league service time but no salary. If the postseason is not held because of a second wave of the pandemic, the union plan calls for $100 million of the approximately $2.8 billion in salary to be deferred with interest, payable in November 2021 and November 2022. Only players whose original 2020 salaries were $10 million or more would be subject to having money deferred. The union estimates high-payroll teams would have up to $7 million in payroll relief, the person said.

Several peaceful protestors — including the brother of former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn — were arrested at an anti-lockdown demonstration at Speakers’ Corner in London. On Saturday, at least five protestors were arrested by police for allegedly breaking the national lockdown rules by gathering in Hyde Park. Piers Corbyn, a British meteorologist and the brother of the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, sarcastically told police officers that he came to the park for a “picnic”. The climate change sceptic and anti-lockdown activist claimed in a speech: “We’ve got to take back control of the National Health Service (NHS) from this Covid operation. In April, as many people committed suicide in the whole year, there are more people dying because of the Covid lockdown than it is saving.” “The National Health Service has become a Nazified propaganda machine for ‘contagion’. They’re telling us — they said the Jews had contagion — they’re saying everybody in this country could have possible contagion. So, therefore, they can be followed and locked up, ghettoized. We have the Nazification of the National Health Service and we oppose it absolutely,” Corbyn added. After his short speech, Mr Corbyn was arrested by police, who took him away in a van. Mr Corbyn was also arrested earlier this month during a similar anti-lockdown protest in Hyde Park. At the May 16th protest, Breitbart London’s James Delingpole was threatened with a fine and possible arrest by a member of London’s Metropolitan Police for attending the event, despite his “key worker” status as a journalist. There have been over 14,000 fines issued by police during the lockdown since it was introduced on March 23, by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. One protester told Breitbart London: “Isn’t it extraordinary that in the whole history of the world, we’ve never had such a thing as ‘lockdown’ before, so where did that idea come from? Well, it came from Wuhan didn’t it? “So the rest of the world looks at this concept of lockdown — based on these completely erroneous figures — and thinks ‘Well we’ll copy it’. So with that, the Communist Party [of China] have managed to take down the global capitalist system institutions without even firing a bullet,” she concluded. In response to the demonstration, a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police said: “A small number arrests have been made at each site for breach of Covid-19 regulations and some fixed penalty notices issued.” PICS: Antifa, Black Lives Matter Flood London Despite Lockdown, Police Do Little https://t.co/ySrdWGyW0R — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 31, 2020  Follow Kurt on Twitter at @KurtZindulka    

A Cleveland business owner whose cupcake shop got destroyed on Saturday night by rioters said that during the Chinese virus pandemic, she couldn’t have imagined her business getting “hit worse than ever.” Colossal Cupcakes — a popular vibrant and colorful cupcake shop located in the heart of downtown Cleveland, Ohio — was completely “destroyed” by rioters on Saturday evening, according to a report by Fox 8 News. “A gunshot went off and the main window went down. Protesters started pouring into the store,” said Kelly Kandah, the owner of Colossal Cupcakes, to Fox 8. Kandah, who lives nearby her cupcake shop, said that she rushed to the store to close it down upon hearing that rioters were on the move in the city. At the time of closing, four employees were still inside the shop. “I thought if they saw me there, they wouldn’t want to hurt anyone,” said Kandah. “But they started throwing bricks and paint cans and stuff at me and the staff. We hurried and rushed into the back bathroom but they kept coming through the windows.” From there, the store owner barricaded herself with her four employees inside the bathroom and locked the door. She then called the police. “It was horrible,” she said. “We were just listening to them destroy everything. I was so scared in so many ways.” Kandah said that she and her employees remained locked inside the bathroom, only to come out after hearing that police had entered the cupcake shop. “Everything is gone or destroyed,” said Kandah of what remains of her store. “The chandeliers are ripped down, the actual cupcake cases are gone. They took our princess chairs and used them to destroy other cases.” “There is nothing left in there, just glass,” she added. “We just got through what I imagined would be our hardest time, the COVID crisis,” said Kandah. “I never imagined we could get hit worse than ever.” Other businesses in the area were also broken into on Saturday night, including the Cleveland Indians Team Shop and CVS, according to Fox 8. Riots taking place in cities across the country appear to be in response to the death of George Floyd, who died on Monday after former police officer Derek Chauvin was seen pressing his knee onto Floyd’s neck. On Friday, the state of Minnesota announced that Chauvin was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Following Floyd’s death, days of protests ensued, which quickly devolved into the violent riots that are now taking place across the country. The riots have involved looting, buildings being set on fire, businesses destroyed, the White House going on lockdown, and people being beaten and killed. The riots have prompted the mayors of several cities across the country to issue curfews in an attempt to quell the chaos, with some even calling on their state’s governor to activate the National Guard for help. On Saturday, Ohio governor Mike DeWine activated the state’s National Guard to help respond to the violent riots in Cleveland. On Sunday, President Donald Trump announced that the United States will be designating the violent leftist group Antifa as a terrorist organization.

The chairman of the Republican Party in New Mexico on Saturday lambasted the state’s Gov. Michelle Lujan-Grisham (D), suggesting she is a hypocrite for violating her coronavirus lockdown order to make a frivolous jewelry purchase and accused her of lying about it. Asked about the governor breaking her own lockdown rule back in April, Steve Pearce told Breitbart News Saturday host Matthew Boyle, “All across the country Democrat governors think of themselves above the law.” “I think that’s the pattern that we’re seeing,” he added later. “This sense of entitlement. This sense of not having to live by the same rules that they impose on the rest of us is really angering a lot of people and is devastating to New Mexico’s economy.” He went on to accuse Lujan-Grisham (pictured), a potential running mate for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, of lying about violating her stay-at-home order. “Her staff said well [the jewelry] was actually delivered at the curb and then they changed their story — well it was actually delivered to the home of one of the staffers,” Pearce explained. “All of that stuff was not permitted in New Mexico at the time.” He pointed out the state forced a business in Albuquerque to shut down for making curbside sales, consistent with what the governor claimed to have done to get her jewelry in the same city. “An Albuquerque nursery was doing the same thing showing pictures online. People would come and pick up a plant at the curb,” he said. “They were shut down” around the time that the governor made the jewelry purchase under similar circumstances back in April. “The governor’s office is now saying innovative businesses could’ve done the same thing [make curbside sales] if they had any ingenuity about them, just total lies coming out of the governor’s office,” Pearce declared. “And that’s what should make people mad that number one, you do it, number two you get caught, and number three you lie about it.” Our Governor is the latest Democrat to decide that the rules they impose on their citizens to address the COVID-19 pandemic don’t apply to her. A bombshell report reveals that the governor violated her own stay-at-home order to stock up on some high-end jewelry. — New Mexico GOP (@NewMexicoGOP) May 27, 2020  On April 6, New Mexico Health Secretary Kathy Kunkel issued a public health order, prohibiting non-essential businesses like jewelry stores from making any in-person sales. It was not until May 1 that the health order allowed retail curbside pickup. The governor made the jewelry purchase in April. In an interview with the Albuquerque Journal, Nora Meyers Sackett, a spokeswoman for Lujan-Grisham, argued the governor did not violate the lockdown order because it was “contact-free purchase.” She claimed a friend of the governor picked up the purchased item form outside the home of one of the jewelry store’s employees. Ultimately, the governor claimed she purchased the jewelry during the shutdown to “support a local business.” The GOP chief agreed with the Breitbart News Saturday host that Gov. Lujan-Grisham is distracted by her desire to be Biden’s vice president, and has taken her eye off the ball of helping New Mexico residents deal with the coronavirus. “I think she’s trying to stamp some sort of invisible credentials the rest of us don’t see,” Pearce said.

Michel Martin, the black host of National Public Radio’s Weekend Edition Saturday, said “protesters” in Minneapolis have been subjected to tear gas and other enforcement while “mostly white protesters” who gathered in Wisconsin and Michigan last month to push for governors to allow businesses to reopen after the coronavirus lockdown were “heavily armed” and “occupied” the state capitols. The report comes as riots break out in Minnesota and across the country after the death of George Floyd at the hands of police officers on Memorial Day. “This hour, we’ll have the latest from Minneapolis and an update on protests nationwide,” said Martin on the taxpayer-funded media outlet’s weekly program. “But first, we want to take a moment to note how the unrest over Floyd’s death comes at an extraordinary time for America, as the country takes the first tentative steps to reopen from a pandemic lockdown, a crisis in which black and brown Americans have experienced disproportionate sickness, death and economic harm.” “It’s also a moment where other disparities are in full view,” Martin said. “For example, recent protesters in Minnesota have been subjected to tear gas, and President Trump has spoken of using the military to restore order, while last month, heavily armed, mostly white protesters in Wisconsin and Michigan occupied state capitals to demand that businesses be allowed to reopen, at times openly confronting law enforcement.” “Few arrests took place,” Martin said, followed by a soundbite of one of those protesters from last month saying, ‘The guns are fine. We are allowed to bring guns. We are allowed to bring them here.” “President Trump called those protesters very good people and said this about them,” Martin said, followed by an edited soundbite from President Donald Trump. “They seem to be very responsible people to me, but it’s – you know, they’ve been treated a little bit rough,” Trump said in the selected soundbite. “Yesterday in a tweet, President Trump referred to the protesters in Minnesota as thugs, writing the word in all capital letters,” Martin said.

As far as Washington Nationals pitcher Max Scherzer is concerned, there is no reason to continue talks with the league about pay cuts during the negotiations for a revamped 2020 baseball season. Scherzer, who is one of the player reps in talks with Major League Baseball about the scheme to launch a truncated 2020 season, now seems very pessimistic about an agreement being reached. The Nats player issued a statement on Wednesday: After discussing the latest developments with the rest of the players, there’s no reason to engage with MLB in any further compensation reductions. We have previously negotiated a pay cut in the version of prorated salaries, and there’s no justification to accept a 2nd pay cut based upon the current information the union has received. I’m glad to hear other players voicing the same viewpoint and believe MLB’s economic strategy would completely change if all documentation were to become public information. pic.twitter.com/nWKtqGSQo4 — Max Scherzer (@Max_Scherzer) May 28, 2020  Scherzer is a member of the eight-player MLBPA executive subcommittee. The other members include Andrew Miller (Cardinals), Daniel Murphy (Nationals), Elvis Andrus (Rangers), Cory Gearrin (Twins), Chris Iannetta (Yankees), James Paxton (Yankees), and Collin McHugh (Red Sox). A major stumbling block for the negotiations is that the teams have closed their books, and the numbers are unavailable for the players to look at to double-check what the league is saying about the effects the COVID-19 pandemic is having on finances. The player’s union is reportedly preparing a counter-proposal to the league’s offer for a 2020 season featuring a more than 100-game schedule and guaranteed prorated salaries. However, if Scherzer’s sentiment is pervasive, then it looks like the two sides are still not in the same ballpark on negotiations.

Jim Bognet, a former Donald Trump administration official, told Breitbart News Saturday swing district Democrat Rep. Matt Cartwright (D-PA) is “out of touch” on the coronavirus pandemic as well as the George Floyd protests and riots. Bognet (pictured) hopes to unseat Cartwright in Pennsylvania’s eighth congressional district, a pivotal swing district that could help Republicans recapture the House in 2020. The eighth district Republican primary is on June 2. Bognet said his campaign has garnered significant momentum ahead of the congressional primary. Bognet told Breitbart News Saturday host Matthew Boyle, “We are in great shape, we’re gaining a lot of momentum, you can feel the energy and excitement. People are really enthusiastic about coming out and voting for President Trump to get him more votes than ever before in Pennsylvania. We know we are going ahead looking into the fall, that we are going to be ground zero. We need to win Pennsylvania; the campaign can feel the energy, reaching thousands of voters every day on the phones.”  Boyle noted Bognet had been ahead of the curve on many issues, such as calling for a travel ban from China in the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak. Bognet said Republicans need to take back seats such as Pennsylvania’s eighth district because a Republican-controlled House will protect President Donald Trump from future impeachment shams. “I ran for this office to protect President Trump,” Bognet said. “If we don’t get a Republican House, he will be impeached again in 2021.  We can never let that fiasco, sham, and tragedy happen again. So that is my mission.” Bognet said Trump has worked to improve the lives of the black community and the death of George Floyd was a tragedy; however, he cautioned rioting would not heal the nation’s wounds. He said, “It is a tragedy, national tragedy, George Floyd died. It made me sad; it was very disturbing. I was so glad that President Trump reached out to his family, to offer some solace. And Trump has done amazing things for the black community,” including criminal justice reform. Bognet continued: But there is no excuse for rioting. There is no excuse for burning down your own city. There is no excuse for Antifa agitators to come in, whip people up and try to have mayhem and destruction happen. It’s so sad because you know who it hurts, Matt? It hurts the people in that community. It hurts their brothers and sisters who poured their lives into building laundromats and small shops and businesses, and they burn, and then I saw a guy crying as his business was burning down last night. That was horrible. Bognet said this moment could serve as a catalyst for future criminal justice reform. He added that in a similar manner to the coronavirus response, Democrat Gov. Tom Wolf and Cartwright have not led on criminal justice. Bognet said, “This can be a moment where we get some really positive reforms done. You see police misbehavior? We have to go after it. Because it besmirches the name of the 99.99 percent of good cops. And what I saw the other day was disturbing to a large degree I’m very glad that they brought charges. We cannot allow our neighborhoods to be burned down and when these blue state governors and blue state mayors, instead of taking decisive action, like I think President Trump would have if he was a governor, you know Matt, we’ve seen it with Gov. Wolf, and we’ve seen with Matt Cartwright, they are so out of touch they don’t even know what’s going on in the ground. We’ve seen it with coronavirus, and now we’ve seen it with these riots, the people in these communities are going to feel the pain from this.” Breitbart News Saturday airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 10:00 A.M. to 1:00 P.M.

As the world grapples with the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, ongoing turmoil in the Middle East and Beijing’s brutal interventions in Hong Kong, the organization once charged with offering solutions to such problems is sidelined with nobody listening to its calls for “peace, harmony and global unity.” U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has bemoaned a “lack of leadership” during the world’s worst series of crises since 1945. “Where we see power, we sometimes do not see the necessary leadership,” he said recently. AFP reports even after more than two months of negotiations, the 15 Security Council members are still unable to reach agreement on a resolution supporting a call from Gutteres for a global cease-fire while the world battles the Chinese coronavirus. At the U.N., there is a sense the globalist body is drifting and dysfunctional, even as it continues to plead for more money to fund its operations: <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> “In the past, when you had disagreements among members of the Council, it was compartmentalized,” said a U.N. official, speaking on grounds of anonymity to AFP. “So your adversary one day on a particular issue was your best ally the next day on another issue. What we see now is everything spilling over. “So there are camps, or there are disagreements which just spill over from one issue to another,” the official said, clearly alluding to the situation in Hong Kong, where tough new Chinese security legislation has pitted the two leading permanent members of the U.N. against each other. “The tensions between the U.S. and China are really problematic” for the world body, meaning the Security Council is “not able to move forward on a range of things,” the official added. At a press conference Thursday, Guterres expressed his regret the coronavirus pandemic had not evoked a greater sense of unity from world powers. “If the present crisis shows something, it is our fragility. Collective fragility. When we are fragile, we should be humble. When we are humble, we should be united and in solidarity,” he said, in remarks directed to members of the Security Council. As Breitbart News reported, Guterres has been working for months to secure a global ceasefire to enable countries to stop the spread of the virus that first appeared in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year. Today I am calling for an immediate global ceasefire in all corners of the world. It is time to put armed conflict on lockdown and focus together on the true fight of our lives – the #COVID19 pandemic.https://t.co/F6JRA6ekvZ pic.twitter.com/7WgtFMk5GC — António Guterres (@antonioguterres) March 23, 2020  Oxfam International is just one global charity to register its frustration with the U.N.’s impotence, publishing a report saying the globalist cause has been totally ignored. The cease-fire remains unattained due to the Security Council’s “diplomatic failure” to collectively broker a resolution amid the deadlock, the Oxfam report observed, and its absence is expatriated by years of investment in peace-building and countries continuing to sell weapons for use in war-torn regions. “We expect leadership from the council as well as many of those countries who say they support a cease-fire, but who nevertheless remain active participants in conflicts around the world conducting military operations, selling arms and supporting third parties,” Oxfam Interim Executive Director Jose Maria Vera said in a statement. The U.N. recently called for $2 billion to be transferred from wealthy countries to the poor via the globalist body as an aid in tackling the global pandemic which fell short. The slim financial response prompted another call for funds last month, lifting the target to $6.7 billion to accommodate the U.N.’s all new, specially updated global plan to counter the viral epidemic. Trouble is, nobody is listening to a word the U.N. says, even as it burns through those member financial contributions and a yearly budget of $3,073,830,500 it approved for itself to cover the year 2020.

TEL AVIV – Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday offered Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro help and cooperation to combat the coronavirus in the South American country, which is not the epicenter of the pandemic. According to a statement from his office, Netanyahu expressed “solidarity of the Israeli people with the Brazilian people over the spread of the corona pandemic in Brazil.” The Israeli leader also “offered cooperation with Brazilian industries in manufacturing the medical equipment necessary to deal with the pandemic,” the statement said. Netanyahu also offered to organize discussions between the two countries’ teams of experts in order to pass along Israel’s accumulated experience in dealing with the virus. Bolsonaro, for his part, congratulated Netanyahu on forming his new government and said he expects to continue strengthening bilateral relations together. Brazil has confirmed about 375,000 coronavirus cases, second only to the U.S. Because of the lack of testing, the real number is also believed to be much higher. The countries share warm ties. In a visit to Jerusalem last year, Bolsonaro professed his love for Israel in Hebrew, telling Netanyahu, “Ani ohev et Israel,” or “I love Israel.”

SKOPJE, North Macedonia (AP) — North Macedonia has decided to extend a state of emergency for another two weeks because the coronavirus pandemic shows no sign of slowing down. President Stevo Pendarovski announced the extension of on Saturday following a meeting of the National Security Council. The country´s health authorities reported five new deaths and 35 infections in the previous 24 hours, days after the government allowed bars, cafes and restaurants to reopen. The government does not plan to make the establishments close again. North Macedonia had a total of 2,146 confirmed virus cases as of Saturday, including 131 deaths.    

IVANO-FRANKIVSK, Ukraine (AP) – Wearing a white biohazard suit, a face shield and a blue mask over his mouth and nose, the Rev. Yaroslav Rokhman is hard to recognize as a priest when he visits terminally ill patients at a Ukrainian care centre. But his words still bring comfort to the dying. Rokhman, a clergyman in the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, is pleased just to be performing one of a cleric’s most heartfelt duties again. As the coronavirus pandemic’s grip slowly recedes in Ukraine, priests received clearance on May 22nd to resume religious services and to visit the sick and bereaved. “Patients missed the support and spiritual care. They needed a priest. They needed to pray and talk,” he said while attending to patients at a palliative-care facility in Ivano-Frankivsk, a city 450 kilometres (270 miles) west of the capital of Kyiv. Galina Shamineva, a 34-year-old mother of two with cancer, was heartened to see Rokhman, his intimidating protective gear notwithstanding. “I feel good — all thanks to you,” she said from her bed. “I really needed to be able to confess and partake in the sacrament.” Rokhman spoke to Shamineva in a soothing way and made the sign of the cross with his gloved hands. “Sometimes I cry, but I never give up. I’m fighting ’til the last breath,” she told him. In Chernivtsi, one of the Ukrainian cities hit hardest by the virus, the Rev. Vasyl Gasynets has returned to conducting services at his Greek Catholic church, wearing vestments along with a mask while giving Holy Communion. Members of the congregation also were masked as they stood near each other, as did some choir members as they sang. “Our church was clean before the pandemic. And it’s clean during the pandemic. We respect our people. We want everyone to be healthy,” Gasynets said. “We want them to believe that in the house of God, Jesus Christ, Holy Church, everything is clean.” Regulations to prevent the spread of the virus widened a religious fault line in Ukraine. The Orthodox Church of Ukraine and the Greek Catholic Church complied with government restrictions on holding services. But the rival Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which is affiliated with the Russian Orthodox Church, resisted. After the Russia-linked church allowed people to attend Easter services, authorities filed criminal cases against five priests. If convicted, they face prison sentences of up to eight years. At the church’s world-renowned Pechersk Monastery in Kyiv, more than 100 clerics were infected with the virus, and at least three died. Ukrainian authorities reported 393 new confirmed cases on Saturday, down from some 500 new cases a day earlier in May. The country has recorded a total of more than 23,000 confirmed cases and 696 deaths.  

A United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) report has revealed that as many as 650,000 migrants are currently waiting in Libya, ready to cross the Mediterranean Sea to Europe. The report notes that the Chinese coronavirus pandemic could have a major impact on mass migration, but the outbreak has also made such movements increasingly difficult to predict. “The global crisis caused by the pandemic is unprecedented and it is difficult to predict its impact on human trafficking and migrant smuggling,” the report stated, adding that the severe economic consequences of prolonged lockdowns could fuel a surge of migration from various countries, Il Giornale reports. The UN report states: “This suggests that the travel and movement restrictions caused by Covid-19 are not stopping the movement of people fleeing conflict, violence and dangerous and inhuman conditions,” and added that Libyan migrants are forced to use the services of people smugglers. “Information from Libya, where around 650,000 migrants and refugees are currently registered, suggests that the Covid-19 public health crisis has not discouraged people from trying to reach Europe.” Cargo Vessel Unloads Migrants in Sicily As Migrant Route Numbers Rise https://t.co/HU6nenHUmJ — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 10, 2020  While the number of migrants entering the European Union has decreased overall during the coronavirus outbreak, Italy has seen a surge in new arrivals in recent weeks. On the long-term impact of the pandemic on mass migration, the UNODC report predicted that “Future economic downturns are likely to have an impact in terms of movements of people to the richer countries.” Migrants who have arrived in Italy during the coronavirus lockdown have been placed under quarantine aboard vessels off the coast. A report released earlier this month revealed that Italian taxpayers were paying as much as €4,000 per month per migrant in order to maintain the quarantine. Alessandro Pagano, a member of populist leader Matteo Salvini’s League (Lega), slammed the costs, saying: “We are not talking about a third-hand dinghy, but of a ship equipped with a self-service restaurant, pizzeria, ice cream parlour,  pub with special wine assortment, play area and video room, double or quadruple cabins with services and even luxury suites.” Farage: French Navy Coordinates with UK Authorities to Transfer Boat Migrants to England https://t.co/aVQwxcHAPn — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 21, 2020 

WASHINGTON (AP) – The European Union on Saturday urged President Donald Trump to rethink his decision to terminate the U.S. relationship with the World Health Organization as spiking infection rates in India and elsewhere reinforced that the pandemic is far from contained. Trump on Friday charged that the WHO didn’t respond adequately to the pandemic and accused the U.N. agency of being under China’s “total control.” The U.S. is the largest source of financial support for the WHO, and its exit is expected to significantly weaken the organization. Trump said the U.S. would be “redirecting” the money to “other worldwide and deserving urgent global public health needs,” without providing specifics. The head of the EU’s executive arm urged Trump to reconsider. “The WHO needs to continue being able to lead the international response to pandemics, current and future,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. “For this, the participation and support of all is required and very much needed.” The WHO wouldn’t comment on the announcement but South African Health Minister Zweli Mkhize called it an “unfortunate” turn of events. “Certainly, when faced with a serious pandemic, you want all nations in the world to be particularly focused … on one common enemy,” he told reporters.

A federal judge has allowed to stand Maine Gov. Janet Mills’ (D) order requiring tourists to self-quarantine for two weeks after entering the state, which is known as “Vacationland.” On Friday, U.S. Judge Lance Walker denied a motion for preliminary injunction while the lawsuit proceeds. A group of Maine campground and restaurant owners, who claim the governor’s executive order is discriminatory against visitors to the state and harmful to their businesses, is challenging the rule. The Portland Press Herald noted Mills’ reopening plan has extended the two-week self-quarantine regulation for visitors through at least July. The judge’s decision comes in the wake of a statement of interest filed by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) in support of the lawsuit by the campground and restaurant owners. According to a statement by Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband of the Civil Rights Division: The United States Constitution requires government to protect the privileges and immunities of all citizens in our nation. These privileges and immunities include the right of Americans to travel freely anywhere in our country, and state governments cannot limit the right of out-of-state Americans to travel to their state unless doing so is substantially related to protecting the public safety. The Department of Justice remains committed to defending the constitutional rights of all Americans no matter where they live. The department will continue to be especially vigilant of any infringement on the right to travel that unduly harms the ability of Americans to earn a living and support their families. In response to the DOJ’s statement of interest, Mills said, she was “deeply disappointed – and frankly disgusted – that the U.S Department of Justice is making a concerted effort to undermine the health of the people of Maine.” The governor added the DOJ did not raise similar objections “when the President and his own task force took steps to limit travel.” Mills said the required quarantine for visitors is “a proven tool to prevent the spread of this deadly disease.” “It seems to me that [the DOJ’s] only actual ‘interest’ here is, at best, political or, at worst, to harm Mainers, not defend them,” she stated. A group of Maine legislators sent a letter nearly two weeks ago to U.S. Attorney General William Barr, requesting an investigation into Mills’ numerous executive orders during the coronavirus crisis, and claiming she has “exceeded her executive authority.” Among the specific concerns the lawmakers cited are Mills’ “arbitrary distinction between ‘essential’ and ‘non-essential’ businesses; denial of Maine citizens’ “right to assemble” in churches with gatherings of more than ten people; and her executive order “establishing quarantine restrictions on travelers arriving in Maine.” “She ordered churches, restaurants, motels, state parks, and campgrounds to close their doors as ‘non-essential’ enterprises, while allowing abortion clinics and ice cream parlors to carry on business as usual,” Maine Rep. Larry Lockman (R) said in a statement to Breitbart News. “Mom-and-pop retailers have been shut down, but the big box stores never missed a beat.” “Before it’s over, the lockdown will kill more Mainers than the virus, in addition to killing tens of thousands of jobs and small businesses,” Lockman said. “And for what?” he asked. “On a typical day, no more than three dozen COVID-19 patients are hospitalized statewide, in a state of 1.3 million people.”

Howard County, Maryland, has reversed course on a ban on receiving the Eucharist during Masses this weekend as church services resume in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. Calvin Ball, the county executive, said Thursday in an update to his executive orders: Since Governor Hogan announced a modified reopening of restaurants yesterday, Howard County revisited all food consumption restrictions. As Howard County moves closer to a full Phase 1 Reopening, also as of 5:00 p.m. Friday, May 29th, food consumption restrictions will be lifted for faith institutions. Ball issued an order on Tuesday that stated, “There shall be no consumption of food or beverage of any kind before, during, or after religious services, including food or beverage that would typically be consumed as part of a religious service.” However, as Catholic News Agency reported, the Archdiocese of Baltimore said it had “serious concerns” about the public health guidance placing a ban on the Eucharist as a condition for churches to hold Masses. “Such restriction would restrict the distribution of holy Communion, an integral part of a Catholic Mass,” the archdiocese said in a statement. “In fact, if the priest could not consume the Body and Blood of Christ after consecration, it would not be a valid Mass”:  Archbishop William Lori said in a tweeted video message to Catholics of his archdiocese, “Without question, we’ve been apart for way too long, and we are hungry for the nourishment that the Eucharist provides”: "We have been apart for far too long and we are hungry for nourishment that the Eucharist provides," Archbishop William Lori says in special message to parishioners about the gradual reopening of churches. https://t.co/x9NmNT8sjl — ArchdioceseBaltimore (@archbalt) May 26, 2020  The archbishop said parishes in some jurisdictions are open this weekend “with limited attendance” for the feast of Pentecost. Lori cautioned that a “one size fits all” approach to reopening parishes “isn’t possible,” and she referred Catholics to their individual pastors for further guidance. Mary Ellen Russell, a spokeswoman for the archdiocese, said, “We are very pleased to hear that Howard County will be lifting their restrictions on faith institutions regarding food consumption.”

4. STAY SAFE and take care of each other. Further centralization of political power and enforced material equality should be the response to current unrest, determined Ocasio-Cortez. She said: If you are calling for an end to this unrest, and if you are calling for an end to all of this, but you are not calling for the end of the conditions that created the unrest, you are a hypocrite.  If you’re trying to call for the end of unrest, but you don’t believe health care is a human right, if you’re afraid to say, ‘black lives matter,’ if you’re too scared to call out police brutality, then you aren’t asking for an end of unrest. You are asking for injustice to continue, and for your people to continue to endure the violence of poverty, the violence of lack of housing access, the violence of police brutality, and not say a damn thing. That’s what you’re asking.  So if you’re out here calling for the end of unrest, then you better be calling for health care as a human right. You better be calling for accountability in our policing. You better be supporting community review boards. You better be supporting the end of housing discrimination. You better be standing up to for-profit real estate developers that are intimidating people and trying to evict them from their homes. That’s what you better be calling for, because if you don’t call for those things and you’re asking for the end of unrest, all you’re asking for is the continuation of quiet oppression. So if you want the end of unrest, then you should be asking for measures that actually liberate people in their lives from the oppression of economic and social inequity. Ocasio-Cortez regularly qualifies justice as “economic,” “social,” and “racial.” Follow Robert Kraychik on Twitter.

The protests across the nation over the death of George Floyd are fueling fears in U.S. cities that the demonstrations could exacerbate the spread of the novel coronavirus outbreak, which has disproportionally ravaged minority populations. At the very least, thousands of people, many of them from minority communities, have taken to the streets to express outrage over Floyd’s death while disregarding mitigation policies like social distancing meant to stem the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Minority communities have “been most traumatized by the dual crisis of a COVID-19 pandemic and an economic crisis that we’re facing right now,” St. Paul, MN Mayor Melvin Carter (D) pointed out during a press conference Saturday. “Those same communities are being re-traumatized right now as our black-owned barbershops, as our immigrant-owned restaurants as local generational family-owned businesses are damaged and destroyed night after night,” he added. “This must stop.” Some protesters are wearing masks, but Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) told reporters on Saturday they are doing so for the wrong reasons — to wreak havoc without being recognized and “take advantage of this situation.” “I will continue to stress because it seems like a lifetime ago: We are still in the middle of a pandemic and passed 1,000 deaths yesterday. We still have hospitals on the verge of being overrun with COVID-19,” Gov. Walz declared. “We are in the middle of a pandemic right now,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey (D) added, echoing Walz. “We have two crises that are sandwiched on top of one another.” On Thursday, health officials in Minnesota also warned that the mass protests were almost sure to fuel new COVID-19 cases. The Star Tribune quoted State Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm as saying: People are moved to want to speak and to want to gather in solidarity and in protest, and we certainly honor and respect that right. As we know, large gatherings do pose a risk in any epidemic, but certainly where we stand today with the state of COVID-19 spread in our community. Knowing that we have community spread, we just want to again encourage folks who gather to be mindful of the risk. Violent rioting and looting have been raging in Minnesota’s Twin Cities, particularly in Minneapolis, where Floyd died after Derek Chauvin, a now-fired white police officer, kneeled on his neck for several minutes in an incident caught on camera. Floyd was unarmed. The havoc that began in Minnesota has spread to urban centers across America, including New York City. “You have a right to demonstrate. You have the right to protest. God bless America,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) declared during his coronavirus briefing Saturday. “You don’t have a right to infect other people. You don’t have a right to act in a way that’s going to jeopardize public health.” “Even if you think you’re a superhero because you’re young and you’re strong, you can get it and then infect someone else,” he added. “So it’s just wholly irresponsible… You can have an opinion, but there are also facts, and you’re wrong not to wear a mask.” Protests, including peaceful demonstrations, have been sweeping the nation since Floyd’s death on Monday as many cities began a phased reopening. “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” Minnesota Gov. Walz said. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear, and disrupting our great cities.” At least initially, some Democrats, including Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, endorsed the protests that have spiraled out of control. On Friday, Authorities have charged fired police officer Chauvin with third-degree murder and manslaughter.

During Friday’s Democratic Weekly Address, Rep. Frank Pallone (D-NJ) stated that the HEROES Act “lays the foundation we will need to ease social distancing and safely reopen the economy.” Transcript as Follows: “Hello, I’m Congressman Frank Pallone from New Jersey. This week, our nation mourns the loss of 100,000 Americans to the coronavirus. It’s a staggering number and grim milestone. Families all around our nation continue to grieve lost ones, oftentimes from a distance. While it’s difficult to even comprehend this loss, it reminds us that we must come together to combat this terrible virus so that we can save lives and protect communities in the weeks and months ahead. This national emergency requires every aspect of government to work together. We must reduce the spread of the virus so we can confidently begin to reopen our economy and get more than 40 million Americans, who’ve lost their jobs as a result of this pandemic, back to work. And the only way we can do that is through a coordinated national strategy: a strategy that significantly boosts testing and invests resources into contact tracing, surveillance and containment. We simply cannot fight this pandemic if we don’t know who has it and where it is being spread. And that requires a national strategy and response. Unfortunately, President Trump and his Administration have failed to provide the consistent and stable leadership that is necessary to guard our nation through this public health and economic crisis. Instead of showing leadership, competence and vision, the Trump Administration is shirking all responsibility and is instead forcing states to find their own way out of this pandemic. For months, the President has refused to develop and implement a national testing program. For months, we’ve been promised millions of tests were right around the corner and that everyone that wanted a test could get one. These promises have been hollow. Testing is getting better, but public health experts continue to warn that our country is far short of the testing we need. And the failure of national leadership has forced states to compete against each other to procure tests and the vital supplies needed to administer tests from the private market. We simply cannot allow the Trump Administration’s failures to persist, and that’s why House Democrats took bold action and passed The Heroes Act earlier this month. This legislation continues our ongoing commitment to providing the health care resources and support needed to combat the coronavirus crisis. The Heroes Act will strengthen testing by finally requiring the Trump Administration to develop comprehensive, coordinated strategies for testing, contact tracing and surveillance. The Administration will be required to include clear benchmarks and timelines. It will also be forced to publicly report key metrics. These requirements are critical to bringing much needed transparency to our nation’s response efforts. It will allow us to see if the Trump Administration is fulfilling their promises and hold them accountable when they are not. The Heroes Act also provides up to $75 billion in grants to support robust testing, contact tracing, surveillance and containment activities. It also provides additional funding to communities that have a high number of COVID-19 cases or are experiencing a surge, as well as for areas with populations experiencing disparities. This includes low-income and the uninsured, communities of color, people with disabilities and other underserved communities. We simply cannot beat this virus without these efforts in place. The Heroes Act builds on the progress we have made and lays the foundation we will need to ease social distancing and safely reopen the economy. Now, it’s time for the Senate to act. Unfortunately, to date, Senate Majority Leader McConnell continues to delay and obstruct. This cannot continue. With more than 100,000 Americans dead, we must collectively find solutions, like The Heroes Act, that will help us finally stop the spread of this virus. It is the only way we will be able to protect the American people, and safely and confidently reopen our communities. I thank you for listening, and please, stay safe.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

MANCHESTER, England (AP) – Sports events will be allowed to resume in England from Monday without any spectators, providing they comply with the government’s coronavirus protocols. The guidance for elite sports bodies was published by the government on Saturday as COVID-19 lockdown restrictions that were imposed in March are eased further. “The wait is over,” Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said. “Live British sport will shortly be back on in safe and carefully controlled environments.” It paves the way for the planned June 17 return of the Premier League, the world’s richest soccer competition. “There is still much work to be done to ensure the safety of everyone involved,” Premier League chief executive Richard Masters said. The government announcement allows English cricket authorities to plan for international series against West Indies and Pakistan. Formula One is also exploring two races at Silverstone from July, with the season yet to start. The first competitions to return on Monday are set to be horse racing, snooker and greyhound racing which lined up events in anticipation of the end of an 11-week shutdown of sports. British horse racing employs tens of thousands of people and the absence of meets since March 17 has left many facing “considerable hardship,” according to the Jockey Club. “The lockdown has been an incredibly hard period for our industry and it will be a long road back to recovery,” Jockey Club chief executive Delia Bushell said. “While we are not a human-contact sport, extensive plans are nevertheless in place to create the safest possible environment for participants.” Athletes and other staff will be required to travel to venues individually and by private transport where possible. Screening for coronavirus symptoms is required before entering. Where social distancing cannot be maintained – staying 2 meters (6 feet) apart – activities need to be risk assessed and mitigated. Media have been told to “minimize crossover” with others at the venue, including players. There is also a request that “during any disputes between players and referees, or scoring celebrations” they must stay apart. “This guidance provides the safe framework for sports to resume competitions behind closed doors,” Dowden said. “It is now up to individual sports to confirm they can meet these protocols and decide when it´s right for them to restart. “This is a significant moment for British sport. By working with clinicians every step of the way, we are creating the safest possible environments for everyone involved.” The first major event after the resumption of sports is set to be the 2,000 Guineas horse race next Saturday at Newmarket, with jockeys wearing face masks. But the government is not yet prepared to allow non-elite sports to resume, denying regular citizens the chance to play cricket and football in a park. “We are working hard to get grassroots sport back up and running safely too, so that people can reunite with their own football, rugby or cricket teammates and get back on their pitches, fields or athletic tracks,” Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston said. “But we will only do this when it is safe and appropriate to do so, based upon scientific advice.” The government, however, will from Monday allow groups of six people from different households to exercise outside as long as they remain 2 meters apart. Currently only two people from different households can meet up. Though the Covid-19 deaths per day have fallen in Britain since the peak in April, another 215 were still reported on Saturday by the government, bringing the known death toll in all settings including hospitals and care homes to 38,376. Deputy chief medical officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam said it was still a “very dangerous moment” but added the return of sports events without spectators “is not going to have any meaningful impact” on the infection rate.

BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Romania’s prime minister has paid fines totalling about $600 for smoking indoors and holding a meeting in a government building where several Cabinet ministers and other participants did not follow social distancing rules. In a photograph published in Romanian media, Prime Minister Ludovic Orban and others can be seen smoking with food and bottles of alcohol on a table. No one in the photo wore a mask or maintained the required spacing. Orban told the Mediafax news agency that the picture was taken on May 25th, his birthday. The foreign minister and economy minister of Romania were among those attending. Romania has registered 19,133 confirmed coronavirus cases and 1,259 deaths.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has cashed in the first portion of an incentive-based stock options payout for keeping the company’s market capitalization at $100 billion along with hitting revenue milestones. The award is valued at about $775 million. CNBC reports that Tesla CEO Elon Musk has earned the first part of a huge incentive payout according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday. The payouts are linked to 1.7 million shares of Tesla which are valued at around $775 million based on Thursday’s closing market value. Tesla shares closed at $805.81 on Thursday and options have a strike price of $350.02. Thursday’s filing also set a day of July 7 for the company’s annual shareholders meeting, stating: “As of the date of this proxy statement, one of the 12 tranches under this award has vested and become exercisable, subject to Mr. Musk’s payment of the exercise price of $350.02 per share and the minimum five-year holding period generally applicable to any shares he acquires upon exercise.” Musk has earned the first portion of stock options for keeping Tesla’s market capitalization at $100 billion on a 30-day six-month trailing average. A 2018 regulatory filing outlined the conditions for the payout which included Tesla hitting trailing-fourth-quarter revenue of $20 billion or EBITDA (minus stock-based compensation) of $1.5 billion for Musk to get the stock award. Musk owned approximately 18.5 percent of Tesla as of May 1 according to FactSet, an ownership stake worth around $24 billion. Thursday’s proxy filing revealed that Musk’s stake in the company had risen to 20.8 percent, a total of 38.7 million shares, including 18.5 million used as collateral for the CEO’s personal debt. Musk’s full award is set to vest over 12 tranches with different milestone requirements reaching up to $650 billion in market capitalization for Tesla. Since the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic began, Tesla has focused heavily on reopening its manufacturing facilities. Breitbart News recently reported that Tesla plans to open its plant in Fremont, California, and has told workers their options are to violate the state’s stay-at-home orders and come to work, or stay home and forgo payment and benefits. In an email obtained by the Guardian from Tesla’s management to its workers, the firm stated: “Choosing not to report to work may eliminate or reduce your eligibility for unemployment depending on your state’s unemployment agency.” Tesla workers told the Guardian that they feel that Tesla’s management is using intimidation tactics in order to force them to return to the job by threatening to cut their pay and unemployment benefits. Breitbart News recently reported that Tesla has sued local authorities for attempting to enforce shutdown orders. In a post to the company blog on Saturday, Tesla stated that the county’s position had left it no choice but to take legal action to ensure that Tesla and its employees could return to work.

Rapper Lil Wayne interviewed doctor Anthony Fauci — the director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases — on his new radio show, Young Money Radio. “I want to say thank you for even considering being on this show, Dr. Fauci, I really do want to say thank you,” said Lil Wayne as he introduced Dr. Fauci to his show, which is hosted via Apple Music’s Beats 1 radio. “You made a prediction that the U.S. could experience 100,000 to 200,000 deaths,” the Grammy-winner added. “I saw a week later, you were forced to revise that estimate. What number do you think we’re at now?” Fauci estimated that the United States will likely see between 120,000 to 140,000 coronavirus deaths this year. “Well, as you mentioned correctly, Lil Wayne, we’re over 100,000,” said Fauci. “And we still have a number of states, cities, regions, that have active transmission of infection. So although we don’t want to predict an exact number, I think it’s probably going to be at least another 20 or more thousand, maybe 120,000, 140,000.”     We have two doctors on the show today — Dr. Dre, and the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases DR. FAUCI!  We’re facing the worst pandemic of our lifetime and he’ll be on to have a REAL discussion about its affect on our community. Watch LIVE on  #YoungMoneyRadio at 4pm PT/7pm ET on @applemusic. 🏾 A post shared by  Lil Wayne (@liltunechi) on May 29, 2020 at 1:39pm PDT “You gotta be careful, because you know, all of these predictions that we’ve made over these months have turned out to not be completely accurate,” added Fauci. “If we don’t make sure — as we’re trying to ‘open up America again’ — to get things back to normal, there’s gonna be people who are going to get infected, and we may get rebounds.” “So we need to be able to prepare ourselves to respond to those rebounds,” affirmed Fauci. The rapper then asked whether Fauci thinks that returning to normalcy will increase the risk of infection. “I see a lot of cities opening back up and people partying in large numbers,” noted Lil Wayne. “Do you think this will affect the numbers of deaths?” “I think it will,” said Fauci. “I think that if you look at the dynamics of an outbreak in any given state, city, or county, or region, if the infection level is really low, they can afford to be a little more brisk in how they open up and get back to some form of normality.” But if you have a state our a county or a city in which there’s still a lot of active infection, and you jump out there and prematurely do the kind of mingling and get rid of the distancing — you know, you saw those pictures on TV of people crowding at bars and at beaches — you gotta be careful of that because you might be tempting to fate to allow there be a rebound infection, so you gotta do this with care with prudence. To date, the 21 states that have eased lockdown restrictions since May 4 haven’t experienced significant increases in Chinese coronavirus hospitalizations and fatalities, according to an ABC News investigation. The report also said there wasn’t a spike in the rate of people testing positive for the disease. “I hope we’ll get a vaccine,” added Fauci at one point during the interview. “By December?” asked Lil Wayne. “We’ve already started the early phases of the vaccine trial in a number of different candidates,” said Fauci. “And we hope that if we get lucky — and I’m cautiously optimistic that we will — that by the end of this calendar year, the beginning of 2021, that we would have a vaccine that we could deploy to people throughout the country, and then other vaccines maybe throughout the world,” he added.

ROME — The Vatican has decried the rise in anti-Christian hate crimes throughout Europe as well as the discriminatory treatment suffered by Christians during the coronavirus lockdowns. Speaking on behalf of the Holy See, Monsignor Janusz Urbańczyk stressed the gravity of anti-Christian violence in an address at a conference of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) on intolerance and discrimination, Vatican News reported Thursday. The Holy See’s Permanent Representative to OSCE noted the disturbing increase in explicitly anti-Christian acts in Europe, including “threats, violent attacks, murders and profanation of churches and places of worship, cemeteries and other religious properties.” In 2019, Christian sites in Europe suffered a record number of attacks, with some 3,000 Christian churches, schools, cemeteries, and monuments vandalized, looted, or defaced. Reports chronicling the anti-Christian acts describe a broad spectrum of profanation including arson, defecation, desecration, looting, mockery, Satanism, theft, urination, and vandalism. The greatest number of acts of violence against Christian sites have occurred in France, where churches, schools, cemeteries, and monuments “are being vandalized, desecrated, and burned at an average rate of three per day,” the reports state. In his address this week, Msgr. Urbańczyk said he was concerned over the growth of the false idea “that religions could have a negative impact or represent a threat to the well-being of our societies” as well as the push to make prayer and religious practice a private matter with no place in the public square.

Even in the midst of times of crisis, fundamental freedoms such as religious liberty must be respected, the monsignor declared. “Tolerance cannot be an alibi for denying or guaranteeing fundamental human rights,” he said.

China’s state-run Xinhua news service on Friday took great interest in an American researcher’s call for more aggressive censorship by Big Tech companies to reduce “misinformation.”  China’s censorship regime was originally justified as just such a crusade against false information and the regime’s apologists claim that is the primary goal of their million-censor army to this day. The article that caught Xinhua’s interest referred primarily to incorrect information about the Chinese coronavirus, which adds an extra layer of bitter irony since the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is the world’s undisputed heavyweight champion at spreading false coronavirus information: “The pandemic lays bare how tech companies’ reluctance to act recursively worsens our world. In times of uncertainty, the vicious cycle is more potent than ever,” said Joan Donovan, research director of the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School in Cambridge, Massachusetts. […] The senior researcher demanded that “tech companies become more transparent, accountable and socially beneficial,” while urging holding them to this commitment long after the pandemic. “Social media companies must flatten the curve of misinformation,” she added. The Chinese government would never leave it to any private companies to bulldoze that “curve of misinformation” according to their own notions of accuracy or fairness. In China, all of the misinformation bulldozers are driven by Communist Party officials, and a private company CEO who decided to “fact check” a statement by dictator Xi Jinping would never be seen or heard from again.  Dissident Xu Zhiyong, for example, who attempted to do just that in a scathing letter demanding Xi resign, is facing 15 years in prison for his “fact check.” Donovan’s article, which probably caught the eye of the Chinese Communist Party because she railed at length against President Donald Trump and “right-wingers” (and special guest star Elon Musk) for being too enthusiastic about using hydroxychloroquine to combat the effects of the coronavirus, perhaps inadvertently made the case that only a massive government censorship apparatus on the scale of the one constructed by Beijing could provide the level of inoculation against “misinformation” that she advocates: After blanket coverage of the distortion of the 2016 US election, the role of algorithms in fanning the rise of the far right in the United States and United Kingdom, and of the antivax movement, tech companies have announced policies against misinformation. But they have slacked off on building the infrastructure to do commercial-content moderation and, despite the hype, artificial intelligence is not sophisticated enough to moderate social-media posts without human supervision. Tech companies acknowledge that groups, such as The Internet Research Agency and Cambridge Analytica, used their platforms for large-scale operations to influence elections within and across borders. At the same time, these companies have balked at removing misinformation, which they say is too difficult to identify reliably. Moderating content after something goes wrong is too late. Preventing misinformation requires curating knowledge and prioritizing science, especially during a public crisis. In my experience, tech companies prefer to downplay the influence of their platforms, rather than to make sure that influence is understood. Proper curation requires these corporations to engage independent researchers, both to identify potential manipulation and to provide context for ‘authoritative content’. U.S. tech companies are not shy about admitting they cannot police everyone for misinformation, hate speech, and so forth. An ostensibly fair system can be made grossly unfair by applying it unevenly, which is the heart of the criticism from those who noticed that Twitter will contentiously label a post from President Trump for “glorifying violence” but seems untroubled by the Supreme Leader of Iran’s enthusiasm for genocide. The Chinese Communist Party does use “sophisticated artificial intelligence” as part of its massive censorship apparatus, but also has a huge number of human operators working to suppress speech the government dislikes. China imposes its censorship mandates on foreign speech as much as possible and blocks foreign sources of information it cannot control. The cost of such an operation is far beyond anything a profit-seeking company could pay and, as the current debate about Twitter censorship demonstrates, it is exceedingly difficult to find a standard of absolute truth or perfect fairness that would insulate private censors from complaints, retaliatory loss of business, and possibly legal action.  Hydroxychloroquine is, like everything else related to the coronavirus, a matter of much debate among the medical community. That community is still torn by vigorous arguments over whether surgical masks provide any protection from the pandemic. The World Health Organization, of which Donovan wrote approvingly in her article, continues to insist they do not, but masks have become tremendously important to the American Left and the Democrat Party, and its members regard challenges to the effectiveness of masks as “misinformation.” This, again, is not a problem for China. A high-ranking member of the ruling party in good standing would never be accused of spreading misinformation because the truth is whatever the Party says it is. If the truth changes tomorrow, the old truth becomes misinformation. If a high official falls from Party grace, he suddenly becomes a source of misinformation.  The CCP believes its approach is the only way to police the turbulent Internet for “truth,” so it is quite happy to hear people who haven’t thought all the way to the end of the censorship game take a few fumbling steps in its direction.

In Mudanjiang, a city in China’s northeastern Heilongjiang province, a recent spike in coronavirus cases has caused the government to reimpose a partial lockdown, the Epoch Times reported on Friday, with local reports indicating that authorities are sealing residents in their homes. Over the past three days, Mudanjiang health authorities announced that they had identified eleven asymptomatic carriers of coronavirus in the city. The news followed a period of several weeks in which authorities reported no confirmed or asymptomatic cases of the virus. According to the report, Chinese officials record asymptomatic cases separately from symptomatic, or confirmed, cases. Flights into and out of the city have been halted, along with train and bus services, according to the report. Students who had returned to school in recent days were ordered to return home. This is the third time Mudanjiang has faced lockdown restrictions. It was first locked down in January, along with most of China, after the initial Wuhan coronavirus outbreak late last year in the eponymous central Chinese city, then again last month following another outbreak. Students had just been allowed to return to school on May 25 when the third lockdown was announced, according to the report. On May 28, a local taxi driver surnamed Huang told the Chinese-language Epoch Times that residential compounds in Mudanjiang where asymptomatic carriers live have been fully “locked down” from the outside. “Shuguang Xincheng has 107 residential buildings and is one of the largest residential compounds in Heilongjiang Province,” Huang said. “The whole compound was locked down on the evening of May 25.” She added that the Lishui Lantian residential compound, where a colleague of hers resides, was also locked down. A video uploaded to social media by a Mudanjiang local on May 25 and shared by the Epoch Times supports Huang’s account of residences being fully “locked down.” It shows government workers at the Shuguang Xincheng residential compound installing a metal bar on the gate of a residential building, sealing it off from the outside. A similar lockdown was documented last month in Harbin, the capital of Heilongjiang province, located about 200 miles northwest of Mudanjiang. There, one local filmed a residential unit that had been locked from the outside by authorities, who placed an official notice on the gate stating that people suspected of having coronavirus lived inside the sealed compound. At the time, Harbin had officially admitted to just 58 cases of coronavirus, despite enforcing the extreme lockdown measures.

Some Wuhan residents admitted to state hospitals for coronavirus treatment have said they were left in prolonged isolation during their stay under torturous conditions, with at least one person allegedly committing suicide due to maltreatment, Bitter Winter, a human rights magazine, reported on Thursday. According to the report, one Wuhan resident wrote an open letter criticizing the Chinese government after his coronavirus patient mother was left in agony from poor treatment at state hospitals and subsequently took her own life. The man says that his 75-year-old mother was assigned to an isolation unit at a Wuhan hospital after being diagnosed with coronavirus on February 9. “I feel blindsided and cheated by the government,” the man wrote in his letter, blasting the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) “propaganda machine” that “promote[s] … news about its solid attempts to fight the epidemic, how the epidemic was put under control, and how many patients were treated, fully recovered, and were released from the hospital.” He said his mother’s death proves the CCP coronavirus propaganda is a lie. “During her isolation, no doctor treated her at all, and no one gave her injections, medicine, or other most basic care to prevent the deterioration of her condition,” the man wrote. The man’s mother told him that she was not the only coronavirus patient left unattended in the isolation ward. According to her account, two older women assigned to her wing were “barely breathing” and “constantly soiled their beds,” but no one came to clean or check on them. Left along in such desperate conditions, the woman told her son that she “had no choice but to wait for her death.” After a week in the isolation ward, the woman was transferred to Wuhan’s No. 3 Hospital, where doctors again failed to administer her any treatment. The man wrote that doctors did nothing more than take his mother’s temperature each day. “On February 26, the hospital declared my mother cured of coronavirus, and she was transferred to a medical observation facility for 14 days,” the Wuhan resident says. According to the man’s account, his mother was discharged from the observation facility on March 11 despite a persistent fever that had not yet abated. The woman had also been suffering from an “unbearable” stomach pain that her son says was still present when she was discharged. The woman’s family then took her to another local general hospital in the hopes of finding treatment elsewhere. However, doctors there refused to admit the woman, claiming her condition “did not meet hospitalization standards.” The man says the family tried other hospitals but were unsuccessful. Without further recourse, the family took the woman home, despite her fever and “severe [stomach] pain.” At home without treatment, the woman grew desperate from her condition in the subsequent weeks. “My mother gave up all hope,” the man wrote in his letter. “On April 15, she ingested pesticide and killed herself.” Several accounts of coronavirus patients facing “isolation without treatment” have been documented on Chinese social media in recent weeks and months, with some describing the isolation wards as “death camps.” “The hospital repeatedly said they gave me the best treatment design, but in reality, they did nothing for me,” a 23-year-old university student from Wuhan wrote on her Weibo account (China’s version of Twitter) in March while in an isolation ward for coronavirus patients in Wuhan. The account was reportedly part of a suicide note, as the woman threatened to take her own life. “I’ll die in discontent!” she said. In April, another Wuhan resident whose parent died after contracting coronavirus in a Wuhan hospital on February 1 blamed the local government for the death. The Wuhan coronavirus was first documented in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Before authorities had publicly admitted there was an epidemic in Wuhan, Zhang Lifa took his father to a Wuhan hospital in January for medical treatment unrelated to the virus. While admitted, the man contracted the virus and later died. Zhang says the authorities’ “lies and cover-ups” during Wuhan’s initial coronavirus outbreak late last year were directly responsible for his father’s death.

A Cuban poet and political activist claimed this week that Cuban dissidents confined to their home during the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic are essentially under house arrest, with the Communist regime taking advantage of the conditions to further silence anti-government voices. Amaury Pacheco lives in Alamar – less than ten miles east of Cuba’s capital, Havana – with his large family. They have been confined to their home under strict coronavirus lockdown measures for several weeks, which should apply to most Cubans on the island, but police, dissidents say, have been more intensely enforcing the measures against them. A poet and vocal critic of Cuba’s Communist regime, Pacheco told the Spanish newspaper Diario de Cuba that he has come to understand firsthand how the government has taken advantage of mandatory restrictions on people’s movement during the pandemic to further repress political dissent. Forced home confinement during the pandemic has significantly hindered traditional methods of protest, according to Pacheco. Before, activists would stand up to repressive regimes in person, he said, using their bodies to occupy public space in a physical demonstration that spoke volumes. Historically, Pacheco says, “[w]e take to the street. We break the mantra that the street belongs to the revolutionaries. We give it another meaning. We set aside those old tropes and present our physical bodies in their place.” “[The new conditions] have created some anxiety for me because there are arrests [of dissidents],” he said. Pacheco continued: The government has taken advantage of Covid-19 [Chinese coronavirus] to convert our houses into prisons. I understand that there are many measures that are important, but a government that takes advantage of and treats all citizens as criminals … It detains activists, people who are against obscure decrees that go against freedom of expression. During and after Covid-19 [the Chinese coronavirus pandemic] what will we do? … Will our activism collapse because the government has gained ground and has detained us in our very homes? The artist said that during the pandemic, almost all political activism in Cuba has been pushed online. “[All the activism] has spilled over onto the internet. There is more communication now because people are there, Cubans in Cuba, and those in other parts of the world,” he said. Pacheco said that political writing and poetry that the Communist regime might not allow people to share publicly remains free to be published in online forums. “Now we present poetry online as perhaps we could not have presented it in public spaces. In that sense, it [the transition to online activism] has been a benefit,” the poet said. Pacheco says he and his wife, also an artist, are homeschooling their four children – ages 8, 9, 11, and 12 – during the pandemic, adding that they had already been supplementing their children’s state-mandated education prior to the lockdown. “The education they give at school is very bad. We have noticed in recent years that there were elements missing in [the state-mandated curriculum that] we have had to supply as parents,” the writer said. Homeschooling prior to the pandemic was illegal in Cuba. Schools serve as pivotal indoctrination centers, teaching allegiance and zeal for the Communist Party. Cuban officials have famously imprisoned parents for homeschooling. Last year, Pastor Ramón Rigal and wife Ayda Expósito, were sentenced to two years and a year and a half in prison for insisting on homeschooling their children to avoid their indoctrination with communist values. Expósito recently concluded her sentence. In his interview with Diario de Cuba, Pacheco also mentioned that he had witnessed the infamous bread lines that many Cubans are forced to stand in for state food rations. Pacheco said he and his family had stocked up on basic supplies prior to the pandemic and were fortunate enough not to have to wait in these lines yet. He said many people wait in long lines only to receive nothing as the food supplies run out before they reach the end of the line.

Authorities in Blackburn said they will “take action” over a gathering of Muslim men praying in the streets which constituted a “serious breach” of coronavirus lockdown measures. Police in Lancashire had granted “special permission … to perform the [Muslim] call to prayer” in Blackburn to mark Eid, according to a letter signed by Assistant Chief Constable Peter Lawson and local government leader Mohammed Khan. But the document, which was seen by BBC Asian Network, reportedly emphasised that individuals must “pray privately in their home” as “restrictions on congregational prayers had not been lifted”. “Not on the street, not in congregation with an Imam leading the prayer, not with amplified microphones and not with road closures,” the authorities specified.

Sayyed Osman, the council’s director of adult services, suggested that “the whole community feels let down” by the event, which appeared to breach Wuhan virus guidelines on social distancing and public meetings. “No permission was given for any such gathering and we see this as a serious breach of the national lockdown,” he said, claiming that it was “only a very small minority” who had prayed on the street. “We are working with the police to take action against the individual who organised the gatherings.” Multicultural Blackburn is said to be one of Britain’s least socially cohesive places, with the “Muslim Asian and white communities were living worlds apart” in a kind of informal segregation, according to a BBC investigation in 2007. A follow-up investigation by the BBC in 2018 found that the situation had, if anything, significantly worsened, with the broadcaster — not normally keen to highlight the downside impact of diversity on the country — quoting one South Asian heritage migrant saying: “There were probably about half a dozen Asian families here [when I arrived], nowadays there’s probably half a dozen white families left” — with “very little prospect for integration”.

Breitbart London previously compared the media uproar over Cummings, which attracted international attention, to the lack of establishment interest when globalist Irish leader Leo Varadkar was pictured at a topless barbecue in the park with multiple friends. The picnic was dismissed as a “storm in a bag of cans” with the assertion that Varadkar “did no harm” being made in the Irish Times — a newspaper which previously printed multiple pieces condemning British prime minister Boris Johnson for his refusal to sack Cummings. In one article, which decried Britain and America as “racist” nations “full of white people”, it was claimed that Cummings having held on to his job had revealed “a British political establishment that is obnoxious, its corruption and lies hiding in plain sight”.

MOSCOW – Russia has recorded nearly 9,000 new cases of the coronavirus, roughly consistent with the increases reported over the past two weeks. The national coronavirus task force said Saturday that 4,555 Russians have died of Covid-19 and 396,575 infections have been confirmed overall. The relatively low mortality rate compared with other countries has prompted scepticism domestically and abroad. In a bid to dispel suspicions that authorities are trying to lower the death toll for political reasons, Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova explained Friday that Russia’s count contains only those confirmed to have died of the infection, but she also gave figures for people who tested positive for the virus but died of other causes. If all categories are counted as Covid-19 deaths, the nation’s total toll for April would stand at 2,713, or nearly 60 per cent more than the previously announced number.    

BERLIN (AP) – Chancellor Angela Merkel will not personally attend a meeting in the U.S. with the leaders of the world’s major economies if President Donald Trump goes ahead with it, unless the course of the coronavirus spread changes by then, her office said Saturday. After cancelling the Group of Seven summit, originally scheduled for June 10-12 at Camp David, Trump said a week ago that he was again considering hosting an in-person meeting of world leaders because it would be a “great sign to all” of things returning to normal during the pandemic. Immediately after that announcement, Merkel suggested she had not yet made up her mind on whether to attend in person or by video conference, but her office told the dpa news agency she has now made a decision. “As of today, given the overall pandemic situation, she cannot commit to participating in person,” her office said. It added that the chancellor would continue to monitor the coronavirus situation in case things change.

Greece released a list of 29 countries whose nationals will be allowed to visit the country on holiday but several countries such as Britain and Sweden were notably absent. Tourists from the approved countries who arrive in airports in Athens and Thessaloniki will be checked for Chinese coronavirus symptoms, with the checks based on the passport of the traveller and not where the flight originated. The list of approved travel countries was created after announcements by the European Air Safety Agency (EASA) and includes several European countries such as Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Denmark, along with countries outside of Europe such as New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, and even China. All travellers attempting to enter Greece from countries not on the list, according to a report by newspaper Proto Thema, will have to undergo a mandatory two-week quarantine upon arriving. The Greek Ministry of Tourism said that the new policy would go into effect on June 15th and is the first phase of opening the country back up to international travel. Danes Want to Re-open Land Borders to Everyone Except No-Lockdown Sweden https://t.co/A2nX8Gi4Xo — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 17, 2020  The second phase, expected to start on July 1st, will involve all airports in Greece accepting international flights and a second “red list” created of countries that have not managed to keep the spread of the virus under strict control. While the list includes countries like Austria, Germany, and Hungary, it does not include countries like the United Kingdom and Sweden where infection rates continue to grow. Sweden has also been largely isolated by neighbouring Scandinavian countries due to a large number of infections and deaths in the country as a result of the Chinese virus and their refusal to lock down. Mika Salminen, health safety manager at Finland’s Institute for Health and Welfare said that it was much riskier for the country to allow in Swedish tourists, as opposed to those from Denmark or Norway. “It is a political decision, but the actual difference in the spread of infection is a fact, and I suppose the government, of course, takes that into account,” he said. The British government, on the other hand, did lock down — but never implemented travel bans or mandatory periods of self-isolation on people coming into the country.

A new poll released by USA Today/Ipsos found that one in five, or 20 percent, of teachers say they are not likely to return to their schools should they reopen in the fall. The “parallel” online polls of the views of 505 K-12 teachers and 403 K-12 parents were conducted May 18-21. The polls’ credibility intervals, which are similar to a margin of error, are plus or minus five percentage points for the teachers’ survey and 5.6 points for the parents’ survey. According to the polls, 83 percent of teachers said their job is more difficult now, while 71 percent of parents said they believe teachers are working harder. However, a report at Education Week in April observed that teachers have had many more “flexible arrangements” during the coronavirus crisis. “The actual amount of time teachers are expected to instruct on a daily or weekly basis is shorter,” the report noted. “But they must reserve specific times for ‘office hours,’ when they are available to help students and parents individually.” In the USA Today/Ipsos teachers’ poll, 76 percent said online learning is causing children to fall behind academically, and 24 percent said public school teachers are paid fairly. However, less than half, or 46 percent of parents, said online learning is causing their children to fall behind, and 40 percent of parents said teachers are paid fairly. USA Today/Ipsos noted that, in a separate poll of parents, six in ten, or 60 percent, said they will likely pursue at-home learning in the fall even if their public schools reopen, including 30 percent who said they are “very likely” to continue at-home learning options. A RealClear Opinion Research poll released two weeks ago found 40 percent of families are more likely to choose to homeschool their children or engage in virtual learning even after schools reopen. Additionally, an EdChoice poll released in April found 52 percent of parents have a more favorable opinion of homeschooling since the school closures due to the coronavirus. “As our world has changed, almost everything we do has changed, including how we view and approach education,” said Cliff Young, president of Ipsos, in a statement. “Though Americans are optimistic about a return to in-person learning, there is angst among teachers, parents and America at large about how to keep our schools safe if the virus isn’t fully contained.”

Delaware Gov. John Carney (D) issued a cease and desist notice on Thursday threatening to arrest and fine a spa owner for planning to reopen the business in protest of the state’s stay-at-home order, issued to get a handle on the novel coronavirus outbreak. “Further failure to comply with the Governor’s order constitutes a criminal offense and may result in fines and imprisonment,” the Delaware Emergency Management Agency (DEMA), a component of the state’s Department of Safety and Homeland Security, declared in the May 28 cease and desist letter, first published by the Gateway Pundit (TGP). Although the state will begin phased reopening on June 1, the letter said the V Spa will not be allowed to open during Phase I because it is a “close contact personal services business,” adding: Your anticipated operation of a close contact persona services business prior to the termination of the State of Emergency is a direct violation of the Governor’s order and endangers public health. The Governor’s order has the force and effect of law. By the authority vested in the Delaware Emergency Management Agency (“DEAMA). DEMA formally mandates that you immediately Cease and Desist business at the V Spa …. Lauren Witzke, who is trying to unseat Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE), has been an ardent supporter of the V Spa owner. In a statement to Breitbart News, she lambasted the Delaware governor’s office for threatening to imprison and fine the business owner. “The COVID-19 shutdowns in the state of Delaware have gone on far too long. It’s no longer about public health and safety. It’s about political control and ensuring the Democrats’ proposed ‘Vote by Mail’ scheme to steal the 2020 election from President Donald Trump is implemented,” the America First Republican candidate proclaimed. COVID-19 is the disease produced by the Chinese coronavirus. “Governor John Carney and [Senate Minority Leader] Chuck Schumer [D-NY] lackey Chris Coons plan to allow Delawareans to starve while they attempt to rig the upcoming election,” Witzke added. Taking a page from the governor’s playbook, a local news outlet threatened to have Witzke arrested for trying to hold a press conference outside the television station after it refused to cover the cease and desist order issue. Witzke told TGP: As for WBOC, threatening to have a political candidate arrested for holding a press conference outside their news studio is flatly absurd, though I can’t say I’m surprised by the far-left media. They continue to act as PR [public relations] agents for the DNC [Democratic National Committee]. Maybe WBOC should try covering the news, instead of covering for Chris Coons. Witzke announced via Twitter that she is still planning to hold the press conference outside the station Friday evening. pic.twitter.com/CbgD56DRDM — Lauren Witzke for U.S. Senate (@WitzkeforDE) May 29, 2020  The Democrat-allied leftwing media has reportedly been attacking Witzke, who is running on policies similar to President Trump’s. All U.S. states have at least partially reopened, with the vast majority allowing their stay-at-home orders to expire.

There was no significant increase in Chinese coronavirus hospitalizations, fatalities, and the percentage rate of people testing positive for the disease in 21 states that eased lockdown restrictions on May 4 or earlier, including seven that did not implement a shutdown order at all, an ABC News investigation reportedly found this week. Health analysts consider the number of hospitalizations, fatalities, and the positivity test rate, particularly the seven-day average given the swings in the figures reported daily, to be good proxies for the severity of COVID-19, the new coronavirus disease. Eric Strauss from ABC News identified the 21 states as South Carolina, Montana, Georgia, Mississippi, South Dakota, Arkansas, Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Wyoming, Kansas, Florida, Indiana, Missouri, Ohio, and Nebraska. On Thursday, he wrote on Twitter: JUST IN: [ABC News] looked at 21 states that eased restrictions May 4 or earlier & found no major increase in hospitalizations, deaths or % of people testing positive in any of them. [SC, MT, GA, MS, SD, AR, CO, ID, IA, ND, OK, TN, TX, UT, WY, KS, FL, IN, MO, NE, OH] via [Arielle Mitropoulos]. About a handful of those states — Arkansas, Iowa, South Dakota, Utah, Oklahoma, Wyoming, Nebraska — did not implement a statewide stay-at-home order or any similar measure to stem the spread of the highly contagious and lethal COVID-19. All U.S. states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia are at least partially reopened, with the vast majority allowing their stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders to lapse. New Jersey is the only state that remains mostly shut down, except for limited re-openings for specific retail stores and construction industries, data compiled by the New York Times showed on Friday. The stay-at-home order in New Jersey, home the strictest statewide lockdown, is expected to expire June 5. Delaware’s lockdown measure will not expire until Sunday, but the state has allowed more limited re-openings than New Jersey. ABC News had yet to publish the results of its study as of Friday afternoon, but the alleged author, Mitropoulos, retweeted Strauss’s post about the investigation: JUST IN: @ABC looked at 21 states that eased restrictions May 4 or earlier & found no major increase in hospitalizations, deaths or % of people testing positive in any of them.

Strauss (@ericMstrauss) May 28, 2020  Breitbart News has determined that after a spike in cases reported each day soon after the state allowed non-essential businesses to reopen on May 1, Texas turned things around. Over the past weeks, the Lone Star state has seen a steady decline in the seven-day average of new coronavirus cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and positivity test rates reported daily. To justify decisions to allow non-essential businesses to reopen, U.S. state officials have been relying on a five or seven-day average number of cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and test positivity rates to account for daily swings in the raw figures. Like several other state leaders, “Gov. Greg Abbott is looking at two specific metrics to justify his decision to restart the Texas economy — the positive test rate and hospitalization levels,” the Texas Tribune noted. To make its determination that there was no COVID-19 spike in the 21 states that reopened early, ABC News likely relied on the seven or five-day average numbers given that the daily hospitalization and fatality figures, along with the rate of people testing positive, fluctuate day by day. The overall number of cases and deaths continue to increase in the United States. As of Friday afternoon, over 1.7 million U.S. residents had tested positive for COVID-19, and over 102,000 had succumbed to it, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker.

Friday on MSNBC, network anchor Chuck Todd said it “seemed” as if President Donald Trump was afraid to lead because he did not take questions from reporters following his White House announcement earlier in the day. After Trump left the podium without taking questions, Todd said, “All right, President Trump with a not taking questions at all. Deciding with his announcement on the various ways he’s going to attempt to punish China over their decision to essentially erase the treaty they originally agreed to with Hong Kong. Look, it’s not lost, I think, on a lot of people to see number one, Katy, he had nothing else to say. He went right to that, stuck to the teleprompter, and walked right out. I think that tells us how he’d like to engage in the Minnesota issue.” Co-host Katy Tur said, “I think you’re right there. There’s a city that is smoldering right now, there are people across this country, the black community is in pain, there is a pandemic, and the president tried to clear it all up, or at least clear his part in potentially inflaming those tensions with a tweet earlier today. Didn’t want to take any questions from reporters.” Todd said, “I got to ask, is the president afraid to lead right now? To not engage at all, I just— that seemed like he was afraid of this. He doesn’t know what to say.” He added, “We’re struggling as a country right now, and that’s — no matter what you think — the president of the United States can’t bring himself to say anything about a Midwestern city that’s smoldering.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

President Donald Trump on Friday announced at the White House that the United States would terminate its relationship with the World Health Organization. The president said that Chinese officials failed to report details of the coronavirus properly to the World Health Organization (WHO) and pressured the organization to mislead the world about the its dangers. “Countless lives have been taken and profound economic hardship has been inflicted all around the globe,” he said. Trump said that the WHO failed to act on reforms that the United States had demanded, prompting his decision to end America’s role with the organization. “We have detailed the reforms that it must make and engage with them directly, but they have refused to act,” he said. Trump said that the United States would use the hundreds of millions previously sent to the WHO to other international aid programs. “The world needs answers from China on the virus,” Trump says. “We must have transparency.” He noted that Chinese officials shut off people from leaving Wuhan during the peak of the coronavirus pandemic to other parts of China but allowed them to travel the world and spread the virus. “The death and destruction caused by this are incalculable,” Trump said. “We must have answers, not just for us, but the rest of the world.”

No less than the New England Journal of Medicine has dealt a body blow to America’s growing army of mask fascists with the news that “wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection.” The reasons for this are both simple and logical: We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection. Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes). The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal. In many cases, the desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic. So there you go… The only real way to catch the China Flu is to hang out with someone infectious for a protracted period of time, so it’s unlikely you will catch it walking along somewhere, like a store or sidewalk. Obviously, as the Journal points out, if you are a healthcare worker, you are going to be dealing with someone infectious indoors, in a closed setting, and not just passing by. So the Journal warns that the “mask is a core component of the personal protective equipment (PPE) clinicians need when caring for symptomatic patients with respiratory viral infections, in conjunction with gown, gloves, and eye protection.” Even so, the Journal’s warning for healthcare workers points out that a mask is still not very helpful “since it does not provide protection from droplets that may enter the eyes or from fomites on the patient or in the environment that providers may pick up on their hands and carry to their mucous membranes.” “What is clear, however, is that universal masking alone is not a panacea. A mask will not protect providers caring for a patient with active Covid-19 if it’s not accompanied by meticulous hand hygiene, eye protection, gloves, and a gown,” the Journal adds. The World Health Organization (W.H.O.) goes even further: “Masks should only be used by health care workers, caretakers or by people who are sick with symptoms of fever and cough,” said Dr. April Baller, a public health specialist for the W.H.O. Baller adds that the danger to a healthy person wearing a mask is a “false feeling of protection” — which is something the CDC warned of early on during this pandemic, back when we were told not to wear masks. Of course, the CDC has flip-flopped completely on the mask issue, which means that what we are now being told by the New England Journal of Medicine and W.H.O. contradicts the latest CDC guidelines, which, after telling us for weeks that masks are useless against the virus, now “recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.” Since its flip-flop, I have never really bought into the idea that American health “experts” like the CDC and Drs. Fauci and Birx were genuine in their flip-flop on the mask issue. It always seemed to me that public and media pressure forced them into caving. Even today, Fauci can’t bring himself to offer a full-throated mask endorsement, only that the mask is a “symbol” of what “you should be doing” … they are a “valuable safeguard” and part of “respect for another person.” This is a far cry from what he said in March: “There’s no reason to be walking around with a mask,” infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci told 60 Minutes. While masks may block some droplets, Fauci said, they do not provide the level of protection people think they do. Wearing a mask may also have unintended consequences: People who wear masks tend to touch their face more often to adjust them, which can spread germs from their hands. It would seem to me that the need to wear a mask should be based on how the virus in question operates. If, as the New England Journal of Medicine points out, you need to be in close contact with an infected person for up to 30 minutes in order to get infected with the coronavirus, the mask is unnecessary unless you’re in that situation. Out of concern for my wife, I’ve worn a mask since day one, even when Fauci was telling me not to… And I will continue to, at least for the foreseeable future, even though I hate the damn thing. Sadly, though, this latest science against wearing masks will get no traction in our corrupt corporate media or with the corrupt Democrat politicians who have embraced mask fascism with the unbridled glee that all self-righteous bullies embrace such things, embrace any opportunity to join a pious mob and feels a false sense of superiority while shaming and terrorizing others. Like the fact that the coronavirus is no more lethal to those 50 and under than the seasonal flu, the media will cover up this important information. Like the fact Democrat Govs. Whitmer, Cuomo, and Murphy poured infection into nursing homes, the media well bury this information. But here’s the thing… If you believe a mask will protect you, go ahead and wear a mask. But what do you care if someone else is wearing one or not? As long as you’re wearing one what does it matter? Why can’t we just leave each other alone? Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.

Some left-wing Democrat governors want to damage their states’ economies with extended coronavirus-related lockdowns, noted Rep. Greg Steube (R-FL), offering his remarks on Friday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow. Marlow described Florida’s response to the coronavirus outbreak as “a pretty big success story” largely ignored by news media. “I think that the death toll and economic toll [in Florida] have been significantly lower than comparably sized states like New York,” Marlow said. “[The] decision to cram infected patients back into nursing homes and not clean the subway system is so unbelievably heinous.” Americans will voluntarily be conscientious about their health in the context of the coronavirus outbreak without governmental decrees, assessed Steube. “It just goes to show that people will take their own personal responsibility to ensure that they’re being safe and they’re taking care of themselves and their families,” Steube said. Steube referenced a Thursday-published Tampa Bay Times article which declared that “Florida hasn’t seen a spike in coronavirus cases” following its economic reopening.  Coronavirus-related statistics from Florida as noteworthy given the Sunshine State’s large share of elderly residents, noted Steuebe. Steube stated, “I have the second-most elderly district in the entire country. Florida has some of the most elderly population, one of the most diverse populations, and we have actually more people than New York does.” Steuebe continued, “If you compare the [coronavirus] numbers in New York to the numbers in Florida, they’re staggeringly different.” According to an interactive map produced by the New York Times tracking coronavirus infections and deaths — citing “state and local health agencies and hospitals” as its data sources — Florida had 52,277 cases with 2,363 deaths. New York had 371,559 cases and 29,438 deaths. Steube remarked, “I believe we live in the country that provides freedoms, and we should not be telling people they can’t leave their houses to do the things that they need to do or to [shut down] a business owner.” Steuebe noted much of the news media’s alignment with left-wing and partisan Democrat politics regarding the coronavirus-related shutdowns. “It’s interesting to watch the mainstream media just completely criticize DeSantis when — if you look at the numbers — he’s probably had one of the biggest success stories in the entire country from a state that is very populous, very diverse and very old, yet they’re not going to talk about that,” Steube said. Steube determined, “I think that some of these left-wing Democratic governors want nothing more than to destroy their states’ economies. Look no further than Michigan. The things that are going on there are just atrocious, and they violate, in my opinion, our individual liberties and our constitutional rights.” Steube concluded, “Hopefully, these things will start to change significantly, and the DOJ will get involved in these overly abusive and overly burdensome orders.” Breitbart News Daily broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.

The president of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) told the USA Today editorial board she does not agree with President Donald Trump’s view that schools should reopen as soon as possible. In an interview published Thursday, Randi Weingarten accused Trump of creating a “false narrative that people either want to stay in place, locked down, or you open things up as if it was last June.” Weingarten said if there is a second wave of coronavirus infections during the summer, “all bets are off” for reopening schools. The union leader said the distance learning taking place since schools shut down “is something that we all know has not been good for kids.” She noted teachers have “worked really hard” to be flexible to do remote teaching but said online education “is not a substitute for the relationship building and the alchemy that happens in schools and in classrooms.” Weingarten added perhaps “a kid or two” will do well with virtual learning, but dismissed it as a potential ongoing education mode. However, she admitted she could envision some high schools opening one day a week since students of that age “may be able to do more in remote.” She responded to a question about when Americans would know if schools will open in time for the fall semester with the statement, “I think your question is, what’s going to happen in terms of school buildings.” Weingarten added: I think we’re going to know that based upon two facts. Will we get this (financial aid) package (from Congress)? Because if we don’t get that package, then school buildings are not going to reopen in the way that they need to. The second real issue, which is a big uncertainty, is whether there’s going to be a second wave. If a second wave crops up that you can’t contain, then schools won’t open in September. I want schools to open safely and responsibly, and as a union, we are doing everything in our power to prepare people to do that and to try to make it work. The union leader stressed again that schools will need more funding to open “safely and responsibly.” “It’s going to cost more money than we’re spending now,” she continued. Weingarten suggested some possible means of social distancing in schools. “You might have to halve the size of the school in terms of the number of kids that are there,” she said. “You might have to stagger morning and afternoon sessions. … You’d have to clean the school between sessions.” The AFT president acknowledged the possibility of “hybrid models” of school for some districts but emphasized that reopening will be a difficult, but necessary, feat. “[I]t’s not good for kids to be home like this,” she said. In response to her support to “road test” some possible innovations for schools during the summer months, Weingarten admitted some of her members have asked, “[W]hy are you pushing for this? And why are you pushing for summer school?” She said the fear and anxiety associated with the infection caused by the Chinese virus is “legitimate.” “This illness, excuse my language, it knocks the s–t out of you,” she said.

Consumer sentiment improved slightly in May boosted by a big improvement in views of current economic conditions. The University of Michigan’s index of consumer sentiment rose half a percentage point in May, according to the survey’s chief economist Richard Curtin. Consumer assessments of current conditions jumped 10 percent compared with April. The gauge of current conditions crashed in March and early April, falling by 40 points. But it appeared to stabilize in April, perhaps because of government payments to taxpayers, programs to stabilize employment, and enhanced unemployment benefits. Now it is on the rise again. “The CARES relief checks and higher unemployment payments have helped to stem economic hardship, but those programs have not acted to stimulate discretionary spending due to uncertainty about the future course of the pandemic,” Curtin said. Troublingly, consumer expectations continued to weaken in May as it became clear that the reopening of the economy would be slower than many expected when the lockdown orders were initially issued. Expectations began weakening in March but held up better than the current conditions metric, indicating that Americans were startled by the sudden crash in stocks and lockdown orders that brought much of the economy to a halt but expected a quick recovery. April saw a steeper plunge in expectations as the extent of the economic damage became clearer and lockdowns stretched on. In May, the expectations gauge fell another 6 percent to 65.9, the lowest level in six years, from 67.7 in the mid-month preliminary reading and 70.1 in the April reading. “It should not be surprising that a growing number of consumers expected the economy to improve from its recent standstill, or that the majority still thought conditions in the economy would remain unfavorable in the year ahead,” Curtin said. While the government’s aid programs have likely boosted consumer sentiment they are also likely the cause of rising inflation expectations. Recent data on prices, however, suggests that the economy is experiencing deflationary pressure from lower consumer spending. Bond yields and other market based indicators do not predict much inflation in the year ahead.

Liberal Democrat leader Sir Edward ‘Ed’ Davey is attempting to use the Chinese coronavirus pandemic as an excuse to delay Britain’s true Brexit from the European Union, arguing that a two-year delay is “just common sense”. “We are facing the deepest recession in 300 years [a]fter the most serious public health crisis in over 100 years,” he argued in a statement posted on social media. “With a climate emergency that demands action now Delaying Brexit by 2 years is just common sense,” he claimed — although the link between the pandemic and an alleged “climate emergency” was left unclear. The 54-year-old’s choice of words was revealing, as, formally Brexit has already happened, with the United Kingdom leaving the European Union in January 2020. However, it is now in a so-called “transition period” with the bloc in which it remains an EU member-state in all but name, still subject to its laws, its judges, its trade policy, and its migration regime, among other things — with the only real change being that Britain has lost its representation in EU institutions such as the European Commission and the supranational Court of Justice. We are facing the deepest recession in  300 years After the most serious public health crisis in over 100 years With a climate emergency that demands action now Delaying Brexit by 2 years is just common sense @LBC https://t.co/pp2K4lnbBf — Ed Davey MP 🔶🇺 #StayHomeSaveLives #ProtectNHS (@EdwardJDavey) May 28, 2020  Sir Ed’s proposal to extend the transition for two years — meaning that, the better part of a decade on from the British people’s vote to Leave the European Union, the country would still not be free of the bloc in a meaningful sense — is backed by a range of EU loyalist British opposition leaders, as well as the EU itself. Indeed, a plan to extend the transition was reportedly “all but agreed at official level” while Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his chief adviser Dominic Cummings were out of action with coronavirus infections — but this was “scuppered” when the later recovered and returned to work. Now that Cummings’ is under pressure to resign from his position over claims that a move from London to Durham during the lockdown to ensure his young son’s childcare needs could be met, however, the efforts of politicians to delay Brexit by the EU and British EU loyalists like Sir Ed have intensified, with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier writing an open letter to British opposition politicians to make it clear that a two-year extension is very much on offer. The official position of Boris Johnson’s government is that it will not agree to any extension — at least for now. Thank you @MichelBarnier for your letter today confirming the EU is open to a two-year extension to the Brexit transition period. Time is running out. @BorisJohnson must put his responsibilities to jobs and the economy first –  agree an extension to prevent another crisis. pic.twitter.com/b9NqjP1YwZ — Ian Blackford (@Ianblackford_MP) May 27, 2020 

Friday on Fox News, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow warned unemployment news was to get worse before it gets better due to the economic downturn resulting from the coronavirus pandemic. Kudlow, however, said there were other positive signs in the economy offering reasons for optimism. “You know, the things are looking better, OK?” he said. “Now, we are still in the pandemic contraction. We probably haven’t peaked in unemployment, and the numbers coming in the weeks ahead are going to be very poor here in the second quarter. It’s a lot of hardship, a lot of heartbreak, OK, a lot of anxiety, so it certainly isn’t over. But, but, but, but I will say this. The virus is flattening and coming downward. The openings are coming across the country. Businesses are opening. New business applications are opening. There’s kind of a list, Steve, of all the – you know, I call them glimmers of hope and growth. Cars are driving more. Gasoline prices are up. The Apple Mobility Index is up.” “We’re even seeing on the unemployment claims, which is a terrible number – close to 40 million – but it is slowing in its increase,” Kudlow continued. “So there’s some hopeful signs, and I think we’re going to move strong into the second half of the year with perhaps as much as 20 percent economic growth. We’ll talk about this with the business leaders and next steps on economic policy. You know, we’ve gone through the liquidity phase. Now we’re in the reopening phase. I think the next phase has to go back to old fashion Trumponomics — cutting taxes, deregulating, fair trade deals, things that grew the economy rapidly in the first three years plus and things that can grow the economy rapidly in the second half and onto next year. The president rebuilt the economy. He can do it a second time. We’ll have this whole conversation with the CEOs and the others.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor

The world’s alarmists took another hit with the news Denmark was able to reopen its schools and daycare centers without an increase in coronavirus infections. Reuters reports that after a one-month lockdown, “Sending children back to schools and day care centres in Denmark, the first country in Europe to do so, did not lead to an increase in coronavirus infections[.]” In fact, the “number of infected children aged between one and up to 19 has declined steadily since late April[.]” It should be added the Denmark schoolchildren pictured in the Reuters piece are not wearing masks, nor are the adults. There was what is described as a “slight uptick” immediately after the schools reopened, but it came too soon to be blamed on the reopening and was probably due to the increase in testing. There’s more good news out of Denmark: a “steady drop in daily infections, hospital admissions and deaths since early April has led Denmark to continue its reopening, with shopping malls, bars, restaurants allowed to reopen in May.” And here’s more bad news for coronavirus alarmists, courtesy of no less than ABC News… “ABC looked at 21 states that eased restrictions May 4 or earlier & found no major increase in hospitalizations, deaths or % of people testing positive in any of them.” Well, how about that… Regardless of all this, even if the infection rate increased in Denmark, it still makes no sense to keep children out of school, especially now we know the coronavirus is no more lethal to those under the age of 50 than the seasonal flu. As far as teachers and staff over the age of 50, if they are concerned about infection, they can wear a mask or find a job that will allow them to work from home. There is just no valid scientific or moral reason to keep anyone under the age of 50 locked down, most especially children who have the least to worry about with the coronavirus. They are probably in as much danger of dying in a car accident as they are from the coronavirus. Regardless, if we are not closing schools to “save lives” during the seasonal flu, we should no longer be shuttering our schools for the coronavirus when the risks are exactly the same for students. And let’s not forget the risks that come from these lockdowns, the lack of socialization and structure, the damage that does to children. Over and over and over again, the science continues to prove that the “experts” we wrong about almost everything. What we appear to have here is a disease that ravages the elderly, but what did we do? We pulled kids out of school, locked up the young people who are in almost no danger, shattered 40 million of their lives by killing their jobs. And those who are truly at risk — those who live in nursing facilities? Well, Democrat governors like Andrew Cuomo of New York, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, and Phil Murphy of New Jersey had the plague poured directly into those nursing facilities.

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas will soon allow outdoor pro sports events to have spectators, but the numbers will be strictly limited, under a new order Thursday from Republican Gov. Greg Abbott. Abbott revised a decision to let pro sports leagues host events without fans starting in June as part of the state’s move to reopen amid the coronavirus pandemic. Abbott’s new order allows outdoor stadiums to host fans up to 25% of their normal capacity. Leagues will have to apply to state health officials to be allowed to have fans. Indoor events will still be without spectators. The change came the same day Texas reported a one-day high in new cases with 1,855 reported Thursday. Texas now has 59,776 confirmed cases through nearly 990,000 viral and coronavirus antibody tests. It has 1,601 deaths, a one-day increase of 39. The actual number of cases is likely far higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. IndyCar is set to open its season at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth on June 6, but track president Eddie Gossage said that even under the new rule, the Genesys 300 race will still not include fans. “Nobody wants to have the stands filled with fans more than me but we’re just not in a position to do that yet,” Gossage said in a written statement, noting the race will be broadcast live on NBC. “While the state will permit us to operate at 25 percent of capacity, there are still too many unanswered questions for an event that is just one week away.” PGA Tour has previously said it plans to restart its season at Colonial in Texas on June 11-14 without fans attending. Major League Baseball has proposed starting its season in early July at regular-season ballparks, if necessary without fans. Abbott’s order, however, may not impact the Texas Rangers and the Houston Astros because “stadiums with retractable roofs are not considered to be outdoors,” health department spokeswoman Lara Anton said. State health officials did not immediately respond to questions on whether any leagues or event organizer have asked to be allowed to have spectators. The state has set up several guidelines, including a recommendation that spectators and employees keep at least 6 feet (2 meters) apart from anyone not from their household. If that is not feasible, other measures such as face coverings and sanitation protocols should be followed. Athletes will not be required to wear masks, but the guidelines encourage them to be worn on the sidelines.
The order does not address college sports events. For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death. However, most patients recover.

Friday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” network anchor Joy Reid addressed the scene in Minneapolis as violent protests have ramped up. Reid pushed back against the situation being labeled as a “riot” despite the looting and burning of buildings, adding people in Minneapolis are “risking COVID” to say “stop killing us” and “acknowledge that we’re people.” “The lack of sense that these are people — as black people right now, we feel hunted,” Reid explained. “Everybody I know, white, black, every race that I know is angry. No one I know is sleeping. People are stressed. People are afraid. But everybody black I know feels hunted. And that is not the way we’re supposed to feel in our own country. And I disagree with only one thing that was said: the word ‘riot.’ What happened in 1921 in Tulsa, when black people were massacred just for having a nice neighborhood, that was a riot. That ain’t a riot what we’re seeing right now in Minneapolis.” “What we’re seeing right there is frustration and anger and rage and an uprising,” she continued. “It’s the same thing that we saw in Ferguson. It is the same thing that we saw in Baltimore. Because when people get good and sick of being killed for nothing in their own country and treated like sub-humans in their own country, people get mad, and people get sick of it. People are risking COVID to explain to this country that we’re fed up. Just stop killing us. This is not a — this is not a huge demand. Black Lives Matter was a minimal demand. Just acknowledge that we’re people. Now, we’re just saying, ‘Just stop killing us.’ Whether it is police or ex-police or civilians, please, just stop killing us.” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent

Police are scrambling to track down hundreds of people who fled coronavirus quarantine centers in recent days in Zimbabwe and Malawi, the Associated Press (AP) reported on Thursday. In Blantyre, Malawi, over 400 people escaped from a quarantine center set up at a local stadium recently, many of them “jumping over a fence or strolling out the gate” reportedly while police officers and health workers watched on. When local reporters asked police and health workers why they had not stopped the patients from escaping, they said they “lacked adequate protective gear” to confront them. While the shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) to treat coronavirus patients in the region has been well documented, some of the people who left the center said they had bribed police to get out. According to the AP, at least 46 of the patients who fled had tested positive for Chinese coronavirus. The report identified some of the quarantine escapees as having recently entered Malawi from South Africa, which has the highest number of coronavirus cases on the continent with almost 125,000 infections. A source of regional economic power, many people from Malawi and Zimbabwe travel to South Africa seeking work. In Zimbabwe, law enforcement officers are “hunting down” over 100 people who escaped from quarantine centers, spokesman Paul Nyathi told the AP. The country requires a 21-day quarantine for people returning from abroad. “They escape and sneak into the villages … We are warning people to stop sheltering them. These escapees are becoming a serious danger to communities,” Nyathi said. Almost all of Zimbabwe’s 75 new coronavirus cases this week were traced to quarantine centers that detain, often involuntarily, hundreds of people returning from abroad. As in Malawi, many of the people returning to Zimbabwe had traveled to South Africa. Many also returned from neighboring Botswana, according to the report. This week, Zimbabwe Health Minister Obadiah Moyo told a special parliamentary committee that the mandatory quarantine centers have become “our source of danger,” according to the AP. Both Zimbabwe and Malawi have fewer than 200 documented cases of Chinese coronavirus, although the true numbers are likely higher due to deficient testing in the region.

Jihadis were more prolific during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan this year despite the Chinese coronavirus pandemic and the associated lockdowns, carrying out at least 242 attacks, about 30 percent more than the 187 last year, data compiled by Breitbart News reveals. Islamic terrorists carried out an average of about eight attacks per day this year, compared to an average of six daily assaults in 2019. Three weeks into Ramadan this year, it appeared the number of deaths and injuries would exceed those from the same period last year, but the attacks became less lethal towards the end. Breitbart News’ tally covers 30 days, starting from Ramadan’s first full day on April 24 through May 23. Edwin Mora/Breitbart News Jihadis killed at least 867 people and injured 813 others across 20 countries during the holy month this year.  On average, jihadis killed 29 people and maimed 27 others each day during Ramadan this year. Last year, however, the holy month was slightly bloodier, resulting in at least 911 fatalities (30 per day) and 1,006 injuries (34 per day). The 1,680 casualties this year represent a drop of over ten percent from the 1,917 last year. Jihadis have been responsible for nearly 10,000 casualties during the past five Ramadans combined: 2020 (867 killed; 813 wounded), 2019 (911 killed; 1,006 injured), 2018 (841 killed; 1,014 wounded), 2017 (1,639 killed; 1,704 wounded), and 2016 (421 killed; 729 wounded). Edwin Mora/Breitbart News The Afghan Taliban remains the deadliest (423 deaths; 379 injuries) group during Ramadan this year, again followed by the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) and its affiliates (228 killed; 258 wounded). However, ISIS was behind Ramadan’s bloodiest attack, killing 32 people and wounding 133 others during a funeral in Afghanistan on May 12. Primarily fueled by several ISIS attacks, May 12 became the bloodiest day (79 fatalities; 165 injuries) of the holy month. Although the ISIS-West Africa branch (ISWAP) allegedly broke away from the Nigeria-based Boko Haram group in 2016 over leadership issues, it has never been clear that ISWAP members were different individuals than those in the original Boko Haram. Analysts have often attributed the same attack to both groups, making it difficult to differentiate between the two. Breitbart News combined the deaths and injuries carried out by the two groups. This year, the Nigeria-based Fulani herdsmen jihadis, known to target Christian farmers, killed (61) and wounded (23) more people than al-Qaeda terrorists and their affiliates (55 fatalities; 15 injuries). On May 11, Fulani herdsmen killed 17 civilians, including a six-year-old who was hacked to death. The Fulani jihadis also wounded six others that day, including a three-year-old who was hot in the head. Some of the Ramadan jihadi culprits designated as “others” primarily include militants from the Iran-allied Shiite Houthis in Yemen and terrorist groups that operate in the Kashmir region claimed by India — namely Lashkar-e Tayyiba (LeT), Hizbul Mujahideen (HM), and Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM). Breitbart News was unable to determine the culprit for 26 attacks that killed 77 people and wounded 85 others (about 10 percent of all casualties), deeming the perpetrators “unknown.” Those included occurred in areas where terrorism is overwhelmingly the product of jihadist groups. Edwin Mora/Breitbart News The top five deadliest countries during Ramadan 2020 are Afghanistan (498 deaths; 563 injuries), Nigeria (100 deaths; 57 injuries), Syria (87 deaths; 26 injuries), Iraq (57 deaths; 68 injuries), and Niger (33 deaths; 12 injuries). Most of the casualties in Afghanistan appear to involve U.S.-backed security forces. It is often difficult to differentiate between civilian and security force victims, but the Afghan government estimated that the Taliban alone killed at least 146 civilians and maimed 430 others across 20 provinces during the holy month. Edwin Mora/Breitbart News The Afghan government and the Pentagon also noted that the Taliban increased attacks during the holy month, a time when jihadis urge their followers and supporters to embrace martyrdom. Despite losing its caliphate in Iraq and Syria, ISIS, which also stepped up attacks during the holy month, continues to wreak havoc in those two countries and beyond. Again this year, ISIS went on to target the food supply in Iraq during Ramadan, burning crops and even killing livestock. Even after the Taliban killed and maimed hundreds of Afghan civilians and security forces, Kabul agreed to a three-day ceasefire with the narco-jihadi group. The truce began on Sunday, the first full day of the Eid al-Fitr (“Festival of Breaking the Fast”) holiday that marked the end of Ramadan in many countries. Some jihadi groups, including the Taliban, targeted Muslims while they prayed inside mosques. The vast majority of Ramadan victims are Muslims, except for a handful in Western countries and several more in Nigeria. On May 21, a jihadi targeted a naval base in Texas, injuring a sailor before authorities took him out. This year, jihadis intensified the number of Ramadan attacks in Africa’s Sahel region. Breitbart News documented an estimated 15 kidnapping incidents as injuries this year. Despite the Ramadan attacks, violence is entirely dissonant with the holy month for most Muslims. Most of them follow the tradition of abstaining from eating, drinking, smoking, having sex, and other physical needs each day, starting from before the break of dawn until sunset during Ramadan. Breitbart News primarily gleans its tally from the Religion of Peace website and the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED). This report only includes incidents Breitbart News has corroborated online through news agencies, governments, and/or other entities that monitor jihadi activity. The overall number of attacks and the associated casualties could be higher because not all incidents are documented online, including some that take place in regions with no free press. It also omits attacks where the jihadi nature of the perpetrators is not explicit, including incidents where no group has taken responsibility in an area where terrorists of non-jihadist ideologies are also present. For the most part, the tally also excludes casualties suffered by jihadis. However, some of the documented incidents in Syria may inadvertently include deaths and injuries sustained by opposition groups with jihadi ties. Death and injury figures may change as some victims succumb to their wounds.

Jerusalem (AFP) — Start-up nation Israel, on its way out of coronavirus lockdown, is seeking to export lessons that have allowed it to emerge as one of the least-hit victims of the pandemic. Use of distance diagnostics, blood analysis, mobile phone tracking and tracing and mandatory wearing of face masks are among measures credited with giving the Jewish state an official COVID-19 death toll of around 280, equivalent to 31 per million inhabitants. That compares with around 310 deaths per million in the US, about 560 in Britain and 427 in France. In Israel, patients equipped with “oximeters” are contacted twice daily by medical teams who ask them to report their data. A decrease in blood oxygen levels shows a downturn in the condition of the patient who is brought swiftly to hospital. The quasi-governmental Jewish Agency, formed to encourage Jewish immigration to Israel, has formed a partnership with the country’s Weizmann Institute of Science and private health services provider Clalit Health Services, to try to export the Israeli model to Jewish communities abroad. “The basic idea is to try to explain to the Jewish community — which has been proportionally more affected than the average population in France, in the United States, mainly in New York — the experience of doctors and scientists in Israel,” Amos Hermon, a Jewish Agency executive, told AFP. “We think that Israel has taken the essential measures (to stem the crisis).” “In comparison with other countries, Israel has done very well… We therefore would like to share this knowledge, with other communities which have been very affected,” he added. Israeli officials, mindful of the Jewish festival of Shavuot which began on Thursday evening, have urged French Jews to delay opening their synagogues for the time being and urged setting up medical committees to monitor the health of their community, according to viewers of an online discussion between a Paris Jewish leader and Israeli officials. The Israelis recommended checking worshippers before they arrive at their synagogue, by using oximeters, enabling a quick and simple measuring of blood oxygen as a measure of health. “The basic idea is to have a doctor in daily contact with patients in order to assess the signs of deterioration in their state of health …. The oximeter is the tool,” notes Boaz Katz, from the Weizmann Institute. According to a study by Tel Aviv University, about 70 percent of people diagnosed with the virus in Israel have been infected with a strain from the United States, and 30 percent from Europe, mainly from France and Belgium.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey (D) requested on Thursday that “protesters” in the City of Lakes practice social distancing and wear masks to reduce coronavirus transmission. The municipal government claimed to provide hundreds of masks to the public for this purpose. Frey’s comments came during ongoing protests and riots in Minneapolis following the death of George Floyd, a man who died after a municipal police officer placed his knee on Floyd’s neck while handcuffed. The city government issued a statement on Thursday via its website with the mayor’s request. “The City encourages everyone to exercise caution to stay safe while participating in demonstrations, including wearing masks and physical distancing as much as possible to prevent the spread of COVID-19,” the statement reads. “The City has made hundreds of masks available to protesters this week.” Frey linked the unrest to slavery during remarks he made on Thursday: What we’ve seen over the last two days and the emotion-ridden conflict over last night is the result of so much built-up anger and sadness, anger and sadness that has been ingrained in our black community, not just because of five minutes of horror, but 400 years. If you’re feeling that sadness and that anger, it’s not only understandable, it’s right. It’s a reflection of the truth that our black community has lived. While not from lived experience, that sadness must also be understood by our non-black communities. To ignore it, to toss it out, would be to ignore the values we all claim to have. That are all the more important during a time of crisis. “This could be the marker,” added Frey. “This could be a point in time, when several years from now we can look back to know that we rose to right the wrongs of the past. Not just with words, but with action.” Frey, who wore a mask for his Twitter profile photo, framed Lloyd’s death in racial terms. Video of my full remarks from earlier this morning. "Being Black in America should not be a death sentence. For five minutes, we watched a white officer press his knee into a Black man’s neck. Five minutes. This officer failed in the most basic, human sense." https://t.co/4cfPkSsf1A — Jacob Frey (@Jacob_Frey) May 26, 2020  Breitbart News Daily broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.

President Donald Trump on Thursday announced he is extending National Guard troops’ deployments in the fight against coronavirus until mid-August, which will allow them to qualify for certain benefits. “The men and women of the National Guard have been doing a great job fighting the CoronaVirus. This week, I will extend their Title 32 orders through mid-August, so they can continue to help States succeed in their response and recovery efforts,” Trump tweeted. The men and women of the National Guard have been doing a great job fighting the CoronaVirus. This week, I will extend their Title 32 orders through mid-August, so they can continue to help States succeed in their response and recovery efforts. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 28, 2020  The National Guard troops’ federal deployments were scheduled to end on June 24, which for many would have been just shy of the 90 days of duty needed to qualify for early retirement and education benefits. Approximately 46,000 Air and Army National Guard troops are supporting the fight against the coronavirus that originated from China. The deployment is the largest use of the National Guard for a domestic operation since Hurricane Katrina, according to the National Guard. More than 51,000 Guard members responded to that natural disaster. However, whereas during Hurricane Katrina, the National Guard was deployed to one region, during the current fight, they are deployed in all 50 states, three territories, and the District of Columbia. “The National Guard is as busy as it’s been for a very long time, and I’m proud to say we are trained and we are ready,” said National Guard Bureau Chief Gen. Joseph Lengyel in a statement Thursday. “The men and women who put on this uniform expect to be called to duty and deployed around the world as part of the Army or Air Force. They expect to be called to duty for homeland emergencies, because that is a unique thing the National Guard does,” he said. National Guard members are assisting at food banks, meal deliveries, serving as medical staff, supporting medical equipment delivery, distributing personal protective equipment, supporting law enforcement, conducting traffic control, performing testing, cleaning facilities, and many other critical tasks all across the nation.

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) lifted the restrictions he placed on houses of worship in his state Thursday after two churches filed an emergency injunction pending appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. Within hours after two Romanian churches, represented by Liberty Counsel, filed the emergency injunction, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh ordered Pritzker to respond by 8:00 p.m. Thursday. With less than four hours before the deadline, the governor released “guidelines,” rather than mandates, for houses of worship that wish to resume church services following the coronavirus lockdowns. None of the suggestions are legally enforceable, explains Liberty Counsel. The guidelines state that the governor’s administration recognizes worship is central to the lives of many people as is “the spiritual and emotional value of prayer, community, and faith.” Pritzker’s guidelines still “strongly recommend” the continuation of “remote services, particularly for those who are vulnerable to COVID-19, including older adults and those with co-morbidities.” For those churches that wish to resume in-person worship, the guidelines suggest gathering outdoors in small groups, with less than ten people as the ideal choice. “Congregants who are living together sit together, at least six feet apart” from others,” the guidelines continue, adding the recommendations of face coverings and the avoidance of singing and “group recitation” of prayers. “Restrooms should be regularly sanitized and have sufficient soap and hand sanitizer,” state the guidelines. The governor’s office says high-risk behaviors to be avoided are those that involve person-to-person contact, such as greetings, hugs, handshakes, use of a common communion cup, and offering communion on the tongue. Liberty Counsel said it filed the emergency request to the Supreme Court due to a letter sent to churches on Saturday by the Chicago Department of Public Health: The city is threatening closure and “summary abatement.” In the threatening letter, Commissioner Allison Arwady, who declared the churches a “public nuisance” for holding services with more than 10 people, wrote: “I am authorized to seek to enjoin such nuisance or to cause the same to be summarily abated in such manner as I may direct….” The letter ended by stating that “the City will take steps necessary to abate, including Summary Abatement.” According to Pritzker’s “Illinois Restored” plan, it was not until Phase 5 of the plan, when “testing, tracing and treatment are widely available throughout the state,” and “either a vaccine is developed to prevent additional spread of COVID-19, a treatment option is readily available that ensures health care capacity is no longer a concern, or there are no new cases over a sustained period,” that gatherings, including religious services, of more than 50 people, would have been permitted. The River at Tampa Bay Church will hold an outdoor worship service on church property this Sunday, May 31, the day of Pentecost, beginning at 9:30 a.m. This will be the church’s first in-person worship service since @rhowardbrowne was wrongfully arrested. https://t.co/ecu5RYuqNW pic.twitter.com/hAXuqC54rJ — Liberty Counsel (@libertycounsel) May 28, 2020  “The unilateral actions of Gov.

Pritzker is the classic example of tyranny,” said Liberty Counsel Chairman Mat Staver in a statement. “He knew he did not have authority to trample on the First Amendment rights of churches and houses of worship, but he did anyway and continued to do so until his case reached the U.S. Supreme Court.” Staver added that his organization wants “to make sure this tyranny and abuse never happens again.” Warning that Pritzker could easily reinstate his mandates, Liberty Counsel plans to file a reply to the Supreme Court, arguing that Pritzker’s “unconstitutional orders are capable of repetition yet evading review.” In a statement about the newly released guidelines for worship in Illinois, Kelly Shackelford, president and chief counsel at First Liberty Institute, said, “The massive religious discrimination and criminal threats against churches is over in Illinois.” “This was a disgraceful part of our history during the pandemic,” he continued. “We are grateful to President Trump for his leadership in urging Governors across America to restore religious liberty and allow Americans to return to their places of worship.”

Senators Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) are looking to end China’s pipeline of foreign students to fill spots at American universities and take American STEM jobs. In the wake of the Chinese coronavirus crisis, Cotton and Blackburn — as well as Rep. David Kustoff (R-TN) in the House — have filed legislation called the SECURE CAMPUS Act that ends the China-to-United States pipeline of Chinese nationals receiving student visas for STEM fields. “The Chinese Communist Party has long used American universities to conduct espionage on the United States,” Cotton said in a statement. “What’s worse is that their efforts exploit gaps in current law. It’s time for that to end.” In short, Cotton and Blackburn’s plan would: In 2019, nearly 117,000 Chinese nationals secured F visas to arrive in the U.S. as students — the most of any country in the world. https://t.co/A7ZfeKacsP — John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) April 28, 2020  Blackburn said in a statement: Beijing exploits student and research visas to steal science, technology, engineering, and manufacturing secrets from U.S. academic and research institutions. We’ve fed China’s innovation drought with American ingenuity and taxpayer dollars for too long; it’s time to secure the U.S. research enterprise against [China’s] economic espionage. As Breitbart News has chronicled, the U.S. legal immigration system remains hugely beneficial to China. From 2008 to 2018, more than 825,000 Chinese nationals arrived in the U.S. on green cards — an immigration status that provides them with permanent residency, a pathway to American citizenship, and eventually the ability to bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the country through the process known as “chain migration.” There are nearly 500,000 Chinese students in the U.S. in any given year — more than any other country — taking seats in university classrooms and looking to eventually obtain Optional Practical Training (OPT) visas to take entry-level jobs in white-collar professions. In Fiscal Year 2019, alone, Chinese nationals secured about 170,000 F, J, and M visas to arrive in the U.S. as students — more than any other country in the world.

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a federal lawsuit Wednesday challenging a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rule that requires women to have an in-person clinic visit in order to obtain drugs to induce an abortion. The ACLU filed the lawsuit in Maryland on behalf of the leftwing American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective, which claim the FDA rule that requires women to first have an in-person visit with the abortion provider is a “burdensome barrier.” The FDA regulates 20,000+ drugs. But it uniquely restricts one abortion-inducing drug – and it won’t lift those restrictions in a pandemic. So the ACLU is suing. My @vicenews latest:👇 https://t.co/uhxfhPrFBM — Carter Sherman (@carter_sherman) May 27, 2020  According to the organization, their complaint states, “Of the more than 20,000 drugs regulated by the FDA, mifepristone is the only one that patients must receive in person at a hospital, clinic, or medical office, yet may self-administer, unsupervised, at a location of their choosing.” ACOG says the FDA rules have “no medical basis” and “unnecessarily restrict access to care.” FDA’s medically unnecessary restrictions on mifepristone threatens to harm patients & their clinicians during a national crisis. It undermines the health care community's efforts to identify safe, effective ways to provide patients with the care they need. https://t.co/utC37UorOx pic.twitter.com/baQ1sRdkCE — ACOG Action (@ACOGAction) May 27, 2020  The organization adds the rules are “especially harmful” during the coronavirus pandemic because “forcing physicians to dispense this drug in person puts patients at increased risk of COVID-19.” Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers, however, have refused to stop providing elective surgical abortions in their clinics, claiming these are “essential” services, even as scarce personal protective equipment (PPE) has been needed by healthcare workers directly providing care to patients with the infection caused by the Chinese virus. “Like any lawyers, the ACLU pushes for their clients’ financial interests in a lawsuit designed to force the FDA to help abortion vendors make a quick buck,” Students for Life of America President Kristan Hawkins said in a statement sent to Breitbart News. “The FDA must hold the line on the health and safety standards in place that are meant to help women survive taking chemical abortion pills,” she added. “Using this COVID-19 crisis to force the sales of life-ending drugs in ways that risk women’s lives should embarrass the abortion industry. But perhaps that is asking too much of people who end life for a living.” In addition to claiming elective surgical abortions are “essential” for women’s health, industry giant Planned Parenthood announced during the pandemic its new tele-abortion service is now available in all 50 states. Acting CEO of Planned Parenthood Alexis McGill Johnson called her new tele-abortion service the “silver lining” of the coronavirus crisis. Planned Parenthood has been touting an increase in at-home abortions since its tele-abortion services began nationwide, though many physicians and pro-life advocates express concerns about the practice. Specifically, women are obtaining mifepristone illegally from other countries since it is not approved under the FDA Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). In early May, national pro-life leaders sent a letter to FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn, urging him to take action to block the illegal Internet sale of abortion-inducing drugs that are produced overseas and then shipped to the United States. In a press release, the leaders observed that, under REMS, the drug “cannot legally be sold in pharmacies or online due to the risk of serious complications.” However, websites such as AidAccess and Rablon sell and distribute the drugs regularly. “This is a medication that definitely has dangers associated with it,” Dr. Christina Francis, an Indiana-based OB/GYN and chairman of the board of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists (AAPLOG), told EWTN Pro-Life Weekly recently. Francis said some immediate complications of mifepristone could be “hemorrhage, the immediate possibility of infection, and the possibility of failure, where the pregnancy doesn’t fully pass from the medication and then leading to sometimes the requirement for emergent surgery for that woman because of either ongoing bleeding or the risk of infection.” Francis added that because of the uncertainties associated with the pandemic, many women “are being influenced by fear right now, and this is being perpetuated by the abortion industry.” One Planned Parenthood official in New York state touted that the organization’s new tele-abortion service is so much in demand that one mother began her drug-induced abortion “at home with her children running around behind her.” Dr. Meera Shah, chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood Hudson Peconic, told the Associated Press (AP), “We provided a medication abortion to an EMT while she was sitting in her ambulance. We provided abortion care to a mother who was at home with her children running around behind her.” Former abortionist Dr. Anthony Levatino explained in his videos about various abortion procedures that mifepristone blocks the action of progesterone, which the mother’s body produces to nourish the pregnancy. When progesterone is blocked, the lining of the mother’s uterus deteriorates, and blood and nourishment are cut off to the developing baby, who then dies inside the mother’s womb. The drug misoprostol (also called Cytotec) then causes contractions and bleeding to expel the baby from the mother’s uterus. Family Research Council President Tony Perkins wrote that, as a result of Planned Parenthood’s tele-abortion service, more women will have at-home “chemically-induced procedures that carry significant risks”: They tell women that it’ll be simple, natural, safe, and private process. They’ll recover in a day, maybe two. What they don’t tell them is that they might deliver a tiny, perfectly-formed child. Or that they’ll experience labor pains, heavy bleeding, vomiting, or lose consciousness. They don’t talk about the depression, anger, anxiety, panic attacks, and substance abuse that follow. Or the weeks to months of recovery time, usually managed alone. “This is Planned Parenthood’s ‘silver lining,’” Perkins said. “Babies who don’t have a chance at life, women who are haunted and harmed.”

Automated mailing of ballots to all persons on inaccurate voter rolls “is the definition of voter fraud,” said House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA), critiquing Democrat proposals to standardize mail-in voting during a Thursday interview on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow. Marlow noted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) calls to change voting laws under the pretense of public health during the coronavirus outbreak, including proxy voting for members of Congress related to legislation, as well as ballot harvesting and vote-by-mail measures for elections. “I want to connect some dots here, because Pelosi does not want the House to come back and be able to vote. She wants to have these proxy votes. I think this is all setting up the vote-by-mail narrative, or as we call it, ‘cheat-by-mail.'” Democrats want ballots sent to everyone without consideration of their legibility to vote, stated Marlow. “Democrats are going to use it to win this election and maybe future elections,” he added. Economic reopenings of cities and states following coronavirus-related lockdowns make it difficult for Pelosi to justify her advocacy for congressional proxy voting and various forms of remote voting in elections, assessed Marlow. “You’re seeing some Democrats in Washington that are trying to take advantage of a crisis,” Scalise replied. “We’ve heard that before. We’ve seen their playbook, and they’re trying to do it here.” LISTEN:
 Various Democrats, left-wing news media figures, and celebrities are calling for increased remote voting options — including vote-by-mail and ballot harvesting measures — as a public health endeavor to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Democrats’ voting reform proposals “literally would be federalizing elections,” determined Scalise, highlighting opposition to voter ID laws as a push to undermine election integrity. Marlow and Scalise differentiated between absentee voting and standardized mail-in voting. “We all want to be fighting for the right for every single American who’s legally allowed to vote to be able to vote once [per election],” Scalise stated. “Everybody ought to have that legal right, and I’ll fight for that for anybody.” Scalise continued, “If somebody who’s illegally registered to vote is casting a vote, that means they’re stealing your vote. They’re stealing the vote of people who are legally registered.” Scalise warned, “To say we’re going to automatically mail ballots to people who we know are on the rolls fraudulently, that is the definition of voter fraud, and it’s taking away the rights of law-abiding citizens, and it shouldn’t be allowed to go forward.” Scalise concluded, “States like California shouldn’t be the model for how to vote, when you saw — three weeks after election day two years ago — the person who won on election night is not the person being sworn in in Congress, because they were counting votes three and a half weeks after an election until they got the result they wanted. That happens in third world nations, but it shouldn’t be happening here in America.” Breitbart News Daily broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.

Seven-year-old Curtis Rogers, of Raleigh, North Carolina, created a social distance-style prom for his babysitter on Tuesday. Curtis knew his nanny, Rachel Chapman, would have to miss her senior prom due to the ongoing battle against the novel coronavirus pandemic. He decided that simply would not do and took matters into his own hands. “He planned a socially distant prom, complete with dancing & her favorite foods,” Rachel’s mother, Becky, tweeted on May 26. “I planned it out because Rachel probably wanted to see me a lot,” Curtis told ABC11. “She is also one of the best people I’ve known.” My daughter has been a nanny for this amazing kid for over a year. When he realized she wouldn’t have a senior prom, he wanted to throw her one. He planned a socially distant prom, complete with dancing & her favorite foods. @somegoodnews @ABC11_WTVD #bestpromever  #SomeGoodNews pic.twitter.com/8T8LY3DQZw — Becky Chapman (@bhchapman) May 26, 2020  The tweet — also featuring several pictures from the adorable “prom” — has gone viral. At the time of this writing, it has over 36,500 likes and more than 4,400 shares. The aforementioned photos feature Rachel and Curtis sitting on opposite ends of a long table, with a pool noodle for measuring distance. Another shows the two standing six feet apart in suit and gown. “He was really excited for it to start and make sure he was ready to impress her,” Curtis’s mom, Elissa, said. “Rachel is one of our favorite people and she also helps around the house a lot,” she added. “So, Rachel’s like the best nanny ever.” Ms. Chapman echoed the sentiment: “He had all my favorite foods and everything,” she said. “I could tell he put a lot of thought into it.” And while apples, peanut butter, and Chick-fil-A may not be a traditional prom dinner, it was perfect for Curtis’s favorite person. Even so, the day was bittersweet. “I was kind of like, bummed putting my dress on because I was sad; I don’t get to wear it to my senior prom,” she said. “After leaving it and having that time with him because it was the first time I had seen him in two months, it was like, really fun, and I’m really glad that he did that.”

Thirty-eight House Republicans have joined nine Republican Senators in lobbying the White House to continue importing foreign workers to the United States even as more than 36 million Americans are jobless. In a letter to Trump, Republican lawmakers including Rep. Roger Marshall (R-KS) — running against Kris Kobach for Kansas’s open Senate seat — and New York Representitives Elise Stefanik and Peter King ask that businesses continue to be allowed to import blue-collar foreign workers through the H-2B visa program amid mass unemployment. Every year, U.S. companies are allowed to import 66,000 low-skilled H-2B foreign workers to take blue-collar, non-agricultural jobs. For some time, the H-2B visa program has been used by businesses to bring in cheaper, foreign workers and has contributed to blue-collar Americans having their wages undercut. The Republican lawmakers claim that even though a record number of Americans in many states are jobless, businesses are still suffering from labor shortages — a claim that is made year-round by the cheap labor lobby. The Republican lawmakers who signed the letter include: The Republicans write: On behalf of the thousands of small and seasonal businesses in our Districts that are struggling in this unprecedented and uncertain economic climate, we respectfully urge you to refrain from imposing any further restriction on the H-2B nonimmigrant seasonal guest worker program as part of any forthcoming executive action relating to immigration and/or economic recovery. The letter continues: This is evident as, despite active recruitment by seasonal employers, very few US workers are seeking and accepting seasonal temporary jobs. Therefore, it is important that the H-2B program continue to be available to our seasonal employers as a failsafe in the event that we see a rapid drop in unemployment and a return to the extremely tight labor markets of just a few months ago. Such flexibility to meet business needs is critical to rapid, solid and fulsome economic recovery. [Emphasis added] … As such, we urge you to maintain the continued, uninterrupted operation of the H-2B program with the continued requirement that all employers only have access to it based upon their proven and certified need within the statutory cap. [Emphasis added] The full letter can be read here: GOPs Ask for H-2B Visa Prog… by John Binder on Scribd  Likewise, this week, nine Republican Senators sent a letter to Trump asking the administration to allow businesses to import more foreign workers. Specifically, the Senators said businesses must be able to exempt themselves from some existing labor regulations so long as they claim they cannot find qualified Americans to do the work. The Republican Senators who signed the letter include: Today, federal employment data reveal that there is no labor shortage of working- and middle-class Americans who want a job. There are currently more than 36 million Americans out of work, spurred by the Chinese coronavirus crisis. The H-2B visa program has been widely used by businesses to drag down the wages of American workers in landscaping, conservation work, the meatpacking industry, the construction industry, and fishing jobs, a 2019 study from the Center for Immigration Studies finds. When comparing the wages of H-2B foreign workers to the national wage average for each blue-collar industry, about 21 out of 25 of the industries offered lower wages to foreign workers than Americans. In the construction industry, wage suppression is significant, with H-2B foreign workers being offered more than 20 percent less than their American counterparts. In the fishing industry, foreign workers were offered more than 30 percent less for their jobs than Americans in the field. In the meatpacking industry, foreign workers got 23 percent less pay than Americans. Every year, the U.S. admits about 1.2 million legal immigrants on green cards to permanently resettle in the country. In addition, another 1.4 million foreign workers are admitted every year to take American jobs John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter at @JxhnBinder. 

Texas had seen a steady decline in the seven-day average of new Chinese coronavirus cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and test positivity rates as of Thursday afternoon, a couple of weeks after a spike in new daily cases reached its peak, marking the highest single-day figure, and the state set a new record for deaths. The drop in the seven-day average came after Gov. Greg Abbott (R) allowed the state’s stay-at-home order to expire on April 30, and non-essential businesses began a phased reopening the following day. To justify decisions to allow non-essential businesses to reopen, U.S. state officials have been looking at the seven-day average of cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and test positivity rates to account for daily swings in the raw figures. Most of the United States, including Texas, issued statewide lockdown measures, commonly known as stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders, to stem the spread of the highly contagious and deadly COVID-19 disease produced by the coronavirus. Soon after Gov. Abbott lifted Texas’s stay-at-home order, the state experienced an increase in the sheer number of new cases and deaths reported each day. On May 14, Texas recorded its second-deadliest day (51) since the first COVID-19 fatality in the state on March 16, data from the state’s health department showed. The following day, Texas documented the highest single-day tally of new cases (1,818) since it recorded its first case on March 4. In the weeks that followed, however, the seven-day average of new cases and deaths has been steadily going down, the state data revealed, echoing assessments by mainstream media outlets. The seven-day average number of hospitalizations and test positivity rates have also seen a steady, but modest decrease. Analysts consider the number of hospitalizations to be an essential measure of the severity of the ongoing outbreak. According to data from the Texas Department of Health, about 70 percent of Texas’s hospital beds were occupied as of Thursday afternoon, with 15,315 regular and 1,592 intensive care unit (ICU) beds still available. Currently, there are 1,692 lab-confirmed COVID-19 patients at Texas hospitals, occupying only about three percent of the available beds. The national average of coronavirus cases per one million U.S. residents, at 5,323, is more than double the 2,045 per one million in Texas, according to Worldometer. Furthermore, the 55 deaths per one million Texans are about six times lower than the national average of 312 per one million. The raw number of new daily cases in Texas has seen a substantial increase in the last few days, more than doubling from 440 on May 25 to 1,361 yesterday, state data showed. That change could push the seven-day average number of new cases up going forward if the amount reported daily keeps increasing. However, the sheer number of new daily deaths has remained relatively low in recent days. Meanwhile, the raw number of hospitalizations reported each day had also seen a modest decline. Gov. Abbott’s office has attributed the rise in new daily cases to a substantial increase in the states’ testing capabilities, as shown by data compiled by the Texas Tribune. More tests have allowed the state to detect more cases. “Gov. Greg Abbott is looking at two specific metrics to justify his decision to restart the Texas economy — the positive test rate and hospitalization levels,” the Texas Tribune noted. As of Thursday afternoon, about seven percent (57,921) of the total 855,674 tests administered by health officials in Texas had come out positive, marking a decrease from the estimated eight percent two weeks ago, on May 13, the COVID Tracking Project revealed. According to the White House reopening guidelines, a state can reopen if it reports a downward trajectory of the positive test rate over 14 days, even if the daily case count is on the rise. Texas has seen a gradual decline in the percentage of tests coming back positive. More people continue to test negative than positive. The cumulative number of cases and deaths continue to increase in the Lone Star state. As of Thursday afternoon, over 57,900 people in Texas had tested positive for COVID-19, and over 1,500 had succumbed to it.

Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Mike Lee (R-UT) spoke at a webinar hosted by the Heritage Foundation on Wednesday about what Congress’s next move should be in a post-coronavirus America. Both said any future legislation should be about recovery in the form of tax cuts and regulatory easing to help small businesses get back to work. Small businesses in America account for 99.9 percent of businesses in the United States, with 500 or less employees, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Cruz said he refers to the more than $2 trillion dollars the feds have doled out to help Americans and small businesses survive in the wake of the virus not as stimulus funding but as relief funding. “They were designed to provide emergency relief — short term emergency, short-term emergency bridge loans for individuals and families and small businesses to help them get through the immediate crisis they were facing,” Cruz said.  Cruz said the amount of money Congress has spent “takes your breath away,” and he disagrees with Democrats who want to hand out more money. “Where we are now, I believe the next legislation should be recovery legislation,” Cruz said. “It should be focused not on relief, not on spending more money and just shoveling more money at the problem,” Cruz said. “You can’t fix it that way.” He went on: Instead, the next stage should be focused on tax reform and regulatory reform. In other words, lessening the burden on small businesses and job creators. The only way out of this mess, economically speaking, is to get people back to work, which means we need to be looking at policies that help the small businesses that are just starting to open up their doors again; that are just starting to see customers again. We’ve got to unleash the engine of the American free enterprise system —the only thing strong enough to overcome this economic catastrophe. Cruz said examining regulations is a good starting point: One place to start is every regulation, state regulations, local regulations, that have been suspended because of the crisis, to deal with the crisis, I think we should all start with the presumption that those regulations should stay suspended going forward. That’s if it was deemed helpful for that regulation to be suspended during the time of crisis then it should still be helpful during recovery. I really think that’s what our focus needs to be is how do we empower small businesses to drive free enterprise forward and turn our economy around and get people back to work. Lee agreed with Cruz and added the value of limited government at a time like this. “One of the many things he said that is right and appropriate for our time is that we’re not going to fix our economy with more government spending,” Lee said. “We’re not going to fix our economy with more government programs.” “What we need is to get government out of the way so that Americans can start helping each other again,” Lee said. Both lawmakers are working on legislation to address these concerns, including the Right to Test Act to give states authority to approve and distribute tests during a national health emergency and the Prime Act to gives states more authority in regulating meat processing plants instead of federal control, which during the coronavirus has led to bottlenecks in the food supply chain. About this Lee said: We have to remember that the federal government was never intended to be this all-encompassing regulatory body that would regulate even purely local activities like labor, mining, manufacturing, and agriculture. It certainly wasn’t meant to be the comprehensive exclusive regulator of things like meat packing, and yet it is the federal commandeering of the meat packing licensing and regulatory business in this nation that has resulted in bottle neck. The Mercatus Center at George Mason University agrees with Cruz and Lee and wrote a proposal about some of the regulations that were lifted and should remain so, including the FDA approval process, Transportation Security Administration’s limits on hand sanitizers, tariffs on medical equipment imports, restrictions on telemedicine practices, restrictions on scope of practice for nurse practitioners, and state certificate-of-need laws, or certificate-of-need (CON) laws that require healthcare providers to first obtain permission before they can open or expand their facilities.  The proposal read, in part, “This list is not comprehensive; more suspended rules at the local, state, and federal levels are coming to our attention on a daily basis.This is not surprising, simply because so many rules have accumulated over the past 50 years. This regulatory accumulation has been well documented by the RegData Project, which, among other variables, measures the number of regulatory restrictions contained in US federal regulation. According to the project’s most recent dataset (RegData 3.2), the volume of federal regulations has increased by more than 150 percent in the past 50 years. In 1970, there were about 400,000 regulatory restrictions on the books. Today, there are more than 1,000,000 regulatory restrictions in effect.” Follow Penny Starr on Twitter

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo added two Hollywood actors, Chris Rock and Rosie Perez to his coronavirus update presser on Thursday, even as he continues to face criticism for forcing the state’s nursing homes to take patients with COVID-19. When the two Brooklyn-born actors took the stage with Cuomo, they gave the gov. glowing reviews for his orders to wear a mask in public in response to the coronavirus. Rock even said that Cuomo “brings him joy every day.” “I watch you every single day,” Chris Rock fawned. “You bring me calm. You bring me joy every single day.” Perez gushed that Cuomo was “such an amazing leader during this crisis.” Watch below: Chris Rock tells Governor Cuomo "I watch you every single day. You bring me calm. You bring me joy every single day" https://t.co/qDjBrx9AGO pic.twitter.com/iuk6Uit0dv — CBS News (@CBSNews) May 28, 2020  Gov.

Watch below: Chris Rock on helping NY Gov. Cuomo to get out the message about wearing a mask: “We’re soldiers for New York. It’s 100,000 dead Americans. I will go wherever I am called" https://t.co/qDjBrx9AGO pic.twitter.com/1YfnWGrARY — CBS News (@CBSNews) May 28, 2020  For her part, Perez excoriated people who refuse to wear a mask calling them “arrogant,” “hipsters,” and “yuppies.” “When I see hipsters and yuppies walking around without a mask, I go, what is it? Is it arrogance?” Perez said. Then she praised those who do wear masks, saying it makes everyone feel better and will ease “the mental-illness ramifications of all of this,” since “everyone’s on their last nerves.” The White Men Can’t Jump actress claimed she confronts people and tells them, “Hey, do the right thing. Put your mask on. Come on, people!” Cuomo, who ordered the state’s nursing homes and retirement villages to take COVID-19-infected patients causing thousands of older New Yorkers to die unnecessarily, recently made moves to make it illegal to sue nursing homes for the very deaths his orders caused.

Organizers said Thursday that they instead will have a “virtual event” in which participants who verify that they ran 26.2 miles on their own will receive their finisher’s medal. The race had originally been scheduled for April 20 before being postponed for five months because of the coronavirus pandemic. “While we cannot bring the world to Boston in September, we plan to bring Boston to the world for a historic 124th Boston Marathon,” said Tom Grilk, the CEO of the Boston Athletic Association. Although the title of Boston Marathon champion is contested by a few dozen elite athletes, the field includes more than 30,000 recreational and charity runners, with as many as 1 million people lined up along the course trek from Hopkinton to Boston’s Back Bay. That presented organizers with a social distancing problem that won’t be solved by the fall. The cancellation is the first ever for the race, which began in 1897 when 15 men drew a starting line in the dirt in Ashland and headed for the city to commemorate the first modern Olympic Games the previous year. In 1918, the format was modified to a relay due to World War I; the 2013 race was stopped when two bombs exploded at the finish line, several hours after the winners had finished but while many recreational runners were still on the course. For each of those years, the race was held in April on the state holiday to commemorate the battles in Lexington and Concord that marked the start of the Revolutionary War. Traditionally, the Red Sox have scheduled their first pitch for the morning so baseball fans could wander over to Kenmore Square after the game to see the runners pass by with one mile to go. In March, when the race was postponed to Sept. 14, Mayor Marty Walsh cited the desire to salvage the estimated $211 million pumped into the city’s economy each year. The Boston Athletic Association and marathon runners also raise about $40 million for charity. Walsh said at the time that there was no thought of excluding the tens of thousands of amateur runners who consider running Boston a bucket list achievement. The Tokyo Marathon went on as scheduled in March with just over 200 elite runners but not the 38,000 recreational runners who had signed up; spectators at the Los Angeles Marathon were advised to practice social distancing. “That’s not the Boston Marathon. We’re an inclusive marathon,” Walsh said. “The Boston Marathon is for everyone.” The 2021 Boston Marathon is scheduled for April 19 and the 125th anniversary edition is scheduled for April 18, 2022.

The coronavirus outbreak has turned out to be a get out of jail ticket for countless people behind bars, including in California where Democrat Gov. Gavin Newsom’s effort to balance the state’s budget could include closing prisons and reducing the inmate population by 11,000 people by 2024. The San Francisco Chronicle reported on how Newsom is trying to make up for the projected $54 billion deficit in part because of the cost of dealing with the virus: In a revised budget plan unveiled this month, Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed shuttering two state prisons within the next three years, ultimately saving the state about $400 million annually. That’s a much faster timeline than the governor envisioned just a few months ago. His original budget in January proposed closing one prison in the next five years, if the inmate population continued its decade-long decline. Newsom is looking everywhere for solutions, including changes that could allow thousands of inmates to earn a quicker release, positioning California to close a prison for the first time since 2003. “It’s my intention to shut down a state prison to continue to invest more and more in education,” Newsom said during a news conference on May 14. “It’s a core value.” Newsom is getting pushback for his idea, with some citing a possible spike in crime if transitioning programs are also slashed. “It’s a completely terrible idea to reduce all services available to inmates coming out of prison and then accelerate the release of inmates,” Scott Kernan, a former corrections secretary under Democrat Gov. Jerry Brown, said in the Chronicle report. The news outlet also noted a federal court order from 2009 required the state to reduce the number of inmates to 137.5 percent of capacity. The Chronicle reported: Before it can close any prisons, however, California will need to release many more inmates. In his budget proposal, Newsom said he wants to phase out three contracts with outside facilities that house about 1,600 state inmates over the next two years. Shutting down two prisons on top of that would eliminate 5,000 to 6,000 more spots from the overflowing system. Coronavirus also had led to the state to release some inmates early and stop accepting new ones, which reduced the prison population to just over 108,000 — a drop of almost 6,000, bringing the system to 127 percent of capacity. The report said that some policies already in place also will help reduce the prison population, including rehabilitation and good-conduct credits that reduce sentences. This could mean that the prison population would be reduced by 11,000 by 2024 and could allow for two more prisons to be closed. At least one Democrat, however, isn’t behind Newsom’s plan. Assemblyman Jim Cooper, a former sheriff’s captain, said criminal justice reform in the state has already cleared out the lowest-level offenders. Cooper is behind a November ballot initiative that would reclassify 15 offenses as violent, including human trafficking of a child, rape of an unconscious person and assaulting a police officer so that individuals convicted of those crimes could not earn parole faster under a 2016 law. “Who’s left in those jails and prisons?” Cooper asked. “It’s those bad people.” Follow Penny Starr on Twitter

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) got a win in court against 77-year-old barber Karl Manke on Thursday, but he vowed to continue operating his business she deemed “nonessential.” The Michigan Court of Appeals upheld Manke’s license suspension and ruled 2-1 that the state has the authority to close his shop. “I am astonished at this ruling,” Manke attorney David Kallman told Great Lakes News. “This is a blatant violation of the law. We’re filing an immediate appeal with the Michigan Supreme Court. You cannot summarily reverse a lower court’s ruling without it being unanimous. This decision was 2-1.” Manke was defiant after the ruling and told WILX, “I’m still open, still working until they cut my hands off.” The state’s chief medical officer and a top Whitmer adviser, Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, testified Wednesday that Manke’s shop is “an imminent threat to public health.” The lower judge disputed that notion when he noted Manke was not arrested by the state. Breitbart News talked to Manke during the “Operation Haircut” protest at the state capitol last week. He said the response during the protest and the support for his stand was “overwhelming,” and called himself “a Michigan small town barber that just wants to work.” “This is an oppressive move on this governor’s part,” Manke said, observing that it “reflects almost a police state.” “I refuse to stand down on this,” he said. “I wasn’t this rock star three weeks ago,” Manke told Breitbart News, but Whitmer made him one. He thanked God for the development. “I’m still standing up. I still have that courage,” Manke said. Kyle Olson is a reporter for Breitbart News.

The study that led the U.N.’s World Health Organization (W.H.O.) to halt clinical trials of the drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as a treatment for the infection caused by the Chinese coronavirus has been called into question. Physicians and researchers are raising concerns about the study, published in the Lancet, that stem from the fact that the source of some of the data for the study could not be determined. The study upon which the W.H.O. based its decision reported it found no benefit of HCQ to COVID-19 patients who received the malaria drug since the researchers said they were dying at higher rates and experiencing an increased frequency of heart arrhythmias compared to patients with other viruses. The researchers concluded: Although observational studies cannot fully account for unmeasured confounding factors, our findings suggest not only an absence of therapeutic benefit but also potential harm with the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine drug regimens (with or without a macrolide [antibiotic]) in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. The research team, led by Brigham and Women’s Hospital Heart and Vascular Center in Boston, reported of the 96,000 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 during the study period, about 15,000 received HCQ alone or combined with antibiotics. The control group contained the other 81,000 patients, who were not treated with drugs. The authors of the study said among the data they received were those from five Australian hospitals that documented, as of April 21, 600 COVID-19 patients and 73 deaths. However, as the Guardian Australia reported, Johns Hopkins University data showed “only 67 deaths from COVID-19 had been recorded in Australia by 21 April. The number did not rise to 73 until 23 April.” “The data relied upon by researchers to draw their conclusions in the Lancet is not readily available in Australian clinical databases, leading many to ask where it came from,” the report noted. In response to Guardian Australia’s questions about the data, the Lancet replied the study’s lead author said he received his data from a healthcare data analytics company called Surgisphere, the founder of which admitted they had mixed up data from an Asian hospital with those from Australia. While the Surgisphere founder said the data error did not alter the findings of the study, Dr. Allen Cheng, an infectious disease physician from Alfred Health in Melbourne, said the names of the Australian hospitals should be made public and that he had never heard of Surgisphere. “Usually to submit to a database like Surgisphere you need ethics approval, and someone from the hospital will be involved in that process to get it to a database,” Cheng told Guardian Australia. “If they got this wrong, what else could be wrong?” He also questioned the fact that the Lancet study had only four authors. “Usually with studies that report on findings from thousands of patients, you would see a large list of authors on the paper,” he said. “Multiple sources are needed to collect and analyse the data for large studies and you usually see that acknowledged in the list of authors.” Other physicians tweeted their concerns about the Lancet study: So Surgisphere Corp was caught falsifying data for the Lancet study on hydroxychloroquine Hospitals deny ever sharing patient data w/ this mysterious database When asked to reveal the hospitals the data came from, Surgisphere refused Is this real life?https://t.co/mvoBpE8IrE — James Todaro, MD (@JamesTodaroMD) May 28, 2020  Lancet registry study has problems.

Risch found that in five studies, including two controlled clinical trials, the drugs showed “significant major outpatient treatment efficacy” and concluded HCQ and azithromycin “need to be widely available and promoted immediately for physicians to prescribe.” “Hydroxychloroquine+azithromycin has been widely misrepresented in both clinical reports and public media,” he noted, observing as well that “Remdesivir has shown mild effectiveness in hospitalized inpatients, but no trials have been registered in outpatients.” Risch added: Hydroxychloroquine+azithromycin has been used as standard-of-care in more than 300,000 olderazithromycinazithromycin adults with multicomorbidities, with estimated proportion diagnosed with cardiac arrhythmias attributable to the medications 47/100,000 users, of which estimated mortality is <20%, 9/100,000 users, compared to the 10,000 Americans now dying each week.

Americans should be allowed to unite over George Floyd. I don’t know of anyone defending his sadistic treatment at the hands of the Minneapolis police. Everyone’s condemning what happened. President Trump is demanding justice and an investigation. The U.S. Attorney’s office in Minnesota and the FBI’s Minneapolis field office issued a joint statement saying they are in the midst of “a robust criminal investigation.” If such things were allowed today, the appalling death of George Floyd could bring the country together, could heal the racial divide that was cynically widened by the Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown hoaxes… Some good could come from this, could come from our shared humanity and revulsion over what happened to Mr. Floyd. But Democrats and our nihilistic media cannot allow that. Coming together is now forbidden in this country, thanks to a media that has lost so much credibility with the public it has turned to nihilism, has turned to fomenting chaos — because causing anarchy is the only influence the media have left. Let me put it this way… If you’re in a room full of people enjoying a robust political debate and no one is paying attention to you because you’ve been caught lying too often, been caught inventing facts too often — you only have one option to call attention to yourself. All you can do is stand on a table and scream FIRE! And that always works. Screaming FIRE! shuts everyone else up, puts all eyes on you, and best of all, everyone reacts to you, to what you’re saying. Watch them scramble! Watch them panic! Watch them scratch and claw as they crawl all over each other! That’s the corporate media today. That’s all they have left. They can’t win a fair debate; they can’t participate in an adult discussion anymore. We don’t trust them anymore. They have no credibility anymore. Plus, we’re informed now. We have access to the same information they do. So we don’t even need them. They’re useless liars no one trusts or believes. But they can still stand on a table and scream FIRE! Like any criminal or gangster or anarchist, like anyone evil enough to do so, the media will always have the power to spread fear, panic, and chaos… This turn towards nihilism began with the George Zimmerman Hoax in 2013. All Zimmerman was guilty of was defending himself against a deadly physical assault, but in order to stir up hate and racial division, the media described the Hispanic Zimmerman as white and even went so far as to fabricate evidence against him — ABC, NBC, and CNNLOL were all guilty of this. After failing to start a race riot over Zimmerman, the media immediately embraced the Hands Up, Don’t Shoot Hoax in Ferguson. This was when I first compared CNNLOL to Elliott Carver, the Bond villain in Tomorrow Never Dies, who generates tragedy to sell his newspapers and boost the ratings of his news networks. Not content to report on events in Ferguson, CNNLOL sent its anchors in, monsters like Jake Tapper and Don Lemon, to deliberately incite a riot. Using lies and hysteria (over what turned out to be a hoax) CNNLOL and the rest of the nihilist media pulled an Elliot Carver — invented news that created violence and death just to boost ratings and clicks — just to feel influential again. Hey, and so what if Ferguson burned down. No one in the elite media lives in Ferguson. So what if a predominantly black working class community is destroyed. Hey, sometimes you gotta break a few eggs… The nihilism then moved to Baltimore and more race riots. Then it moved to inciting violence at Donald Trump’s 2016 rallies. After Trump won, the media have screamed FIRE! non-stop, manipulating the public the only way they can: with panic and chaos based on big lies about Russia collusion and Charlottesville, and small lies like fish food. Well, on top of the deaths in Ferguson and Baltimore, the media’s nihilism can now add countless coronavirus nursing home deaths to its list of causalities, some 50,000 who died while the media created chaos by screaming about how we were all going to die of the virus unless we locked down the healthy and destroyed our economy. To create chaos around Trump, the media gushed over Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-NY) to undermine Trump’s federal authority — when the truth is that Trump was doing a pretty good job while Cuomo was pouring infection into nursing homes, needlessly killing thousands. And now that we’re learning the true toll of these unnecessary nursing home deaths, rather than focus on that, rather than ensure that doesn’t happen again (something we could agree on), the media ignore the nursing home holocaust to spread social chaos over masks — bullying everyone into wearing a mask even though if you’re under 50 the coronavirus is no more fatal than the seasonal flu. The media cannot influence us with truth because all the media do is lie. The media cannot influence us with persuasive arguments because all their ideas have either failed throughout history or are fascist. The media cannot influence us through bias because we now see through it. The media cannot influence us through news coverage because we are now more informed than the soc-called “journalists” are, too many of whom are spoiled, entitled twenty-somethings who know nothing about anything, most especially real life. So now the media gameplan is nihilism and chaos, which is why the unifying outrage over the death of George Floyd has been twisted into a black v. white issue, a left v. right issue, a pro-riot v. anti-riot issue. Any asshole without a conscience can scream FIRE!, can spread fear, panic, and chaos. That requires no skill, and that’s all the media have left. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

Boston University announced this week that it will be using “specialized robots” to test students for the Chinese virus upon their return to campus this fall. The university also announced that it will utilize contact tracing to mitigate the spread of the virus on campus. According to a report by Campus Reform, Boston University will use robots as part of its “multipronged” response to the Chinese virus pandemic. The robots will reportedly be used to expedite the testing process. A report from Boston University Today revealed that engineering faculty have been developing a robotics program that will aid in the university’s mitigation efforts. The program, which is still in development, will allow students to be notified electronically if they test positive for the virus. The samples would be tested for the coronavirus at a lab inside the Rajen Kilachand Center for Integrated Life Sciences & Engineering. Newly purchased specialized robots would be used to help speed up the test result process, and results of the tests would be delivered to people electronically. Leading the testing program will be Catherine Klapperich, a College of Engineering professor of biomedical engineering and director of the BU Precision Diagnostics Center. Once it’s running, the laboratory will be run and overseen by certified clinical lab professionals and will work closely with the offices of Student Health and Occupational Health. Breitbart News reported in April that Boston University officials were considering extending the campus shutdown through the end of the calendar year. However, these recent developments suggest otherwise. Boston University President Robert A. Brown suggested that the fall semester may involve a hybrid approach with both online and in-person courses. “We are starting to see a vision of fall emerge,” Brown said in a statement. “The goal is to take advantage of the best public health and safety tools at our disposal in order to allow our students to get back to school. Our classroom instruction will be designed with flexibility in mind, offering both remote learning with in-person participation, so that every student, whatever their location or personal circumstance, will receive the academic support and instruction they deserve.” Stay tuned to Breitbart News for more campus updates.

Universities and colleges around the nation are claiming that the ongoing Chinese virus pandemic has prevented them from complying with requests for public records from journalists. Some universities have even refused to comply with a federal investigation into foreign influence on higher education. According to a report by the College Fix, universities are using the Chinese virus pandemic as an excuse to delay responses to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. Although the Chinese virus pandemic began nearly two months ago, reporters claim that universities and colleges have continued to use the pandemic as a justification for delays. Frank LoMonte, the director of the University of Florida’s Brechner Center for Freedom of Information, said that many government agencies are using the pandemic to shut down records requests. “We are definitely seeing agencies across all levels of government taking full advantage of the COVID crisis to more-or-less shut down fulfillment of records requests,” LoMonte said. The problem, LoMonte, points out, is that universities and colleges typically try to avoid compliance with information requests. Unfortunately, the Chinese virus pandemic has presented institutions with a fresh reason to delay document production. “Frankly, there are a lot of agencies, including colleges and universities, that never wanted to answer [Freedom of Information Act] requests in the first place and that are opportunistically using the crisis to close the window to requester,” he added. “It’s totally understandable that fulfilling requests, especially requests for paper documents that can’t be remotely retrieved from home, is going to take longer than it used to. That’s legitimate,” LoMonte finished. “What’s not legitimate is totally shutting down processing requests.” Breitbart News reported last week that several universities and colleges have refused to comply with a federal investigation into the Chinese government’s influence on American higher education. Federal investigators believe that internal university documents will reveal undisclosed financial grants from the Chinese government. Stay tuned to Breitbart News for more updates on this story.

MANCHESTER, England (AP) — The Premier League plans to restart on June 17 after a 100-day shutdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic, with new staggered kickoff times to make sure every game can be shown on TV as fans are prevented from attending games. The clubs agreed Thursday that the competition should resume with a Wednesday night doubleheader featuring Manchester City playing Arsenal and Aston Villa hosting Sheffield United — two games that were postponed during earlier rounds. However, the league still needs formal approval from the government. “This date cannot be confirmed until we have met all the safety requirements needed,” Premier League chief executive Richard Masters said, “as the health and welfare of all participants and supporters is our priority.” After those makeup games are played, the 30th round will start on Friday, June 19 at 8 p.m. (1900 GMT) — if authorities approve safety plans. “Positive to see further steps on the return of football today,” Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden tweeted. “We are still working on govt guidance before we green light sports’ return.” It’s still unclear where games will be played when the league resumes. Police have said only neutral venues should be used over concerns fans would congregate outside, but that plan was opposed by the 20 clubs. The Premier League agreed to a government request for all remaining 92 fixtures to be aired live in Britain. Only 200 of the 380 games each season are normally broadcast live domestically while all are available to view internationally. For the first time since the Premier League launched in 1992, games will be shown live by free-to-air broadcaster BBC, which has four of the remaining games. “At a time when sports fans across the country are in need of lift, this is very welcome news,” BBC director of sport Barbara Slater said. Saturdays will see an additional late game start at 8 p.m. after fixtures at 12:30 p.m., 3 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. There will be a new early and late slot on Sundays of 12 p.m. and 7 p.m. between the usual 2 p.m. and 4:30 p.m. kickoffs. The Friday and Monday night games will be at usual at 8 p.m. Midweek rounds will now see an earlier set of games at 6 p.m. followed by 8 p.m. kickoffs. Football has already resumed in Germany, with three rounds of the Bundesliga played in empty stadiums. The Spanish league has government approval to restart after June 8. But lockdown measures have only just been eased to allow full practice sessions to resume at Premier League clubs. Liverpool is on the verge of winning the Premier League, sitting 25 points in front with nine games remaining.

Just one day after Breitbart News reported that Twitter had failed to “fact check” Chinese accounts promoting conspiracy theories about the Wuhan coronavirus, Twitter has applied a “fact check” label to two posts by China Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhao Lijian that were included in Breitbart’s report on the platform’s failure to hold the communist nation to account for its misinformation on the Chinese virus. On May 26, Twitter added a “fact check” label to a pair of tweets from President Trump expressing widely-held concerns about mail-in ballots increasing the risk of voter fraud. The “fact check” link, which urged users to “get the facts about mail-in ballots,” directed users to a Twitter “moment” — a collection of links and tweets, handpicked by Twitter employees. The “moment,” intended to fact-check the President, was filled with establishment media articles from CNN, the Washington Post and other outlets, baselessly asserting that Trump was lying about mail-in ballots. This is reportedly the first time the social media platform has branded Trump’s tweets with a link to a “fact check” of this type. Breitbart News reported yesterday that despite the “fact-checking” of President Trump by Twitter, the site had failed to apply the same standards to other governments and heads of state. In particular, the site had refused to remove or even fact-check posts from Chinese government officials spreading conspiracy theories suggesting that the Wuhan coronavirus actually originated in the United States. Today, Twitter added fact-check labels to posts by China Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhao Lijian, both of which were actually listed in the article by Breitbart News. The two tweets can be seen below: This article is very much important to each and every one of us. Please read and retweet it.

A Twitter spokesperson told Bloomberg News that Zhao’s tweets “contain potentially misleading content” about the virus and have been labeled “to provide additional context to the public. These actions are in line with the approach we shared earlier this month.” Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

California was one of a few states hit hard by the coronavirus as it spread throughout the U.S. in March. Hence, hospitals shut down routine procedures and called in thousands of health care workers from across the country to help patients. The only problem is, the predicted coronavirus surge never came. Reuters reported that many of the costs associated with setting up field hospitals, doubling intensive care units, and purchasing personal protective equipment hit the hospitals right in their purse strings, while the ban on elective procedures sliced their revenue in half. The measures drove some hospitals in the state close to bankruptcy, costing them as much as $14 million and forcing them to lay off close to thousands of health care employees, according to the California Hospital Association. Other hospitals, such as the Stanford Health Care (SHC) system, implemented a temporary reduction in hours across the whole organization to stay afloat, KGO reported. “But we’re being asked to use our hard-earned Paid Time Off, or to go unpaid, and file for unemployment until July- or for another ten weeks- if not longer,” one nurse revealed. California called for a Health Corps in March, which 95,000 people signed up for. But of those 95,000 people, fewer than 800 have been hired by the state, Reuters reported. “The worst thing we could do was really to under-prepare,” said Dr. Sanjay Kurani, Medical Director at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center, a public hospital system serving California’s Silicon Valley. “From a patient health standpoint and from a public health standpoint, we had to prepare.” The hospital industry is now asking the state for a $1 billion bailout to help hospitals pay off some of those costs, and another $3 billion once the new fiscal year starts July 1. “Most hospitals’ balance sheets have been trashed,” said Carmela Coyle, president of the California Hospital Association. “It’s a one-two punch that many hospitals will find it difficult to survive.”

Brothel operators in Saarland have launched a lawsuit aimed at the major restrictions on their businesses put in place by the German government’s Wuhan coronavirus lockdown. The brothel owners argue that the government prohibition on prostitution and sex work facilities is not justified as it conflicts with freedom of professional activity. They argued that hairdressers, nail salons, and massage parlours have all been allowed to resume business. The owners claim that they have developed their own procedures to ensure proper hygiene within the brothels just as other businesses have developed similar measures in order to stop the spread of the Chinese virus, Bild reported on Wednesday. Germany is one of the countries in Europe where prostitution is legalised either fully or partially. In Switzerland, where sex work is also legal, prostitutes face the same issues, and the national association of counselling centres for sex workers has demanded they be allowed to resume work on June 8th. French Prostitutes Demand Coronavirus Govt Cash Bailout https://t.co/DNflQPpdqc — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 9, 2020  The association has also come up with guidelines for prostitutes, including sexual positions deemed to minimise the risk of spreading the virus in which the two people engaging in sex have their faces as far apart as possible. The body suggests the “doggy” position would minimalise the likelihood of transmission between client and employee. Rooms in Swiss brothels would also be ventilated for up to 15 minutes or more after each customer and bed linens would be washed after every customer, as well. Brothels have also offered to log customer contact data for up to four weeks to track clients in case of an outbreak. Last month while France was in the middle of its severe lockdown measures, associations representing prostitutes demanded Emmanuel Macron’s government give prostitutes emergency government aid. “An emergency fund must be created to provide a replacement income during confinement,” the Red Umbrella Federation said. “In the short term, some of the poorest sex workers will find themselves forced to defy confinement, not with a gaiety of heart, but as a lack of means of subsistence because it is a question of survival,” they added.

Thursday on MSNBC’s “Andrea Mitchell Reports,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said President Donald Trump was a “terrible example” for mocking people wearing masks when not to do so is “very selfish.” Pelosi said, “100,000 people —more than 100,000 people have died from the coronavirus. This administration has been a failure in terms of what we’re doing when testing and tracing and treating and isolating people. The president has been a terrible example of not wearing a mask, belittling those who do. So anything he does is a distraction from the problem at hand. People are dying, Rome is burning, and all people want to talk about is what he said next about this. That is a success for him. So I just will not go there. It’s about testing, testing, testing, to open up our schools so our children can go back safely. It’s about opening up our economy, so we can flourish. It’s about saving lives. And all of this is a distraction from the problem at hand. We have people dying, and he’s talking about one thing and another and then monopolizes the whole conversation. I simply won’t go there.” She added, “When we talk about opening up, it’s foolish to open up in any way other than that which has guidelines about distancing and masks and the rest. And to do so in a way that preserves health and not endangers people. Because when you go out there, you’re not only endangering yourself, you’re bringing something home to your children or your parents if they’re older in that category with the predisposition. So this is about acting unselfishly. You don’t wear a mask. You’re being very selfish. It’s not about how strong you think you are. It’s how unconcerned you are about what you might spread to someone else. Of course, we all want to be out. That’s natural. I like the idea of fresh air, as a matter of fact, for my children and grandchildren. However, you have to do so in a very, very safe way. And that’s what leadership the administration should be taking instead of saying magically go away. It’s a hoax. Magically, this, that and the other thing. Face the facts, face the reality of what it is, and only then we’ll be able as we understand the challenge, address the needs, do it in a robust and fast way so that we diminish the death toll.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo (D) announced Thursday that he will sign an executive order allowing businesses to bar entry to individuals who do not wear a mask or face covering amid the Chinese coronavirus pandemic.  “We made them mandatory in public settings, public transportation etc., but when we’re talking about reopening stores and places of business, we’re giving the store owners the right to say, ‘if you’re not wearing a mask, you can’t come in,” Cuomo said during his daily press conference. “You don’t want to wear a mask? Fine, but you don’t have a right to then go into that store if that store owner doesn’t want you to,” added the governor.  To date, eight million masks have been delivered to public housing, homeless shelters, and food banks in New York City, while another one million will be sent to various neighborhoods Thursday, he said.  Cuomo’s remarks come as New York Attorney General Letitia James announced the passage of legislation rolling back N.Y. Penal Law 240.35(4), which made it a crime for people to don masks publically. “Wearing masks in public remains necessary for the health and safety of New Yorkers. But there was a clear conflict of law, and repealing this outdated provision is commonsense policy,” James said in a statement. “Even if it is difficult to imagine a police department enforcing, a prosecutor charging, or a judge upholding such a charge during the COVID-19 crisis, we should not tolerate a situation where following the law is dangerous. I thank Senator Bailey and Assemblymember Quart for their leadership and for permanently repealing this law.” New York City has over 200,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and 16,410 deaths, according to data tracked by Johns Hopkins University.

Dr. Anthony Fauci has urged Christians to wear masks, practice social distancing, and forego singing and receiving communion during worship services to curb the spread of the coronavirus. In an interview with the Jesuit-run America magazine published Wednesday, Dr. Fauci said that churches should “limit the number of people, so that you don’t have people in the pews right next to each other,” and the faithful should “absolutely” wear masks. Regarding the distribution of communion, Fauci said he does not think there is a safe way to go about it and the practice should be abandoned until further notice. “I think for the time being, you just gotta forestall that,” he said. Fauci, who identifies as a Jesuit-educated Catholic who has distanced himself from “the concept of organized churches, religions,” said that at the moment he believes that receiving communion is too risky, even if it involves only the distribution of the consecrated bread without the cup. “As many times as a priest can wash his hands, he gets to Communion, he puts it in somebody’s hand, they put it in their mouth,” he said, “it’s that kind of close interaction that you don’t want when you’re in the middle of a deadly outbreak.” Fauci said he thinks that religious practice should vary from place to place, according to the intensity and extent of infections. “It depends on where you are,” he said. “If you are in a region, a city, a county, where there is a significant amount of infection, I think with distributing Communion, I think that would be risky. I’m telling you that as a Catholic, it would be risky.” In recent weeks, there have been numerous confrontations between religious and civil leaders regarding the proper jurisdiction of each when it comes to the practice of the faith. One notorious case was that of Minnesota, where the state’s Catholic Bishops and Lutheran leaders announced that public worship would resume on May 26, in defiance of restrictions put in place by Governor Tim Walz. Many people of faith “were disappointed in Governor Walz’s May 13 announcement that he would end the Stay-at-Home order to allow more commerce but prohibit religious gatherings of more than ten people,” an order that “defies reason,” stated the Catholic bishops in a May 20 letter. Insisting that the life of faith is “essential,” the bishops declared that they have given Catholic parishes “permission for the resumption of the public celebration of Mass on Tuesday, May 26, which will give us time to be ready for the celebration of Pentecost on May 31.” “We are blessed to live in a nation that guarantees the free exercise of religion,” they said. “This right can only be abridged for a compelling governmental interest, and only in a way that is narrowly tailored to be the least restrictive means of achieving the desired end.” Last Saturday Governor Walz told reporters that it is unclear whether worship constitutes something “essential,” countering an assertion made recently by President Trump. “I think the case that the president is making and that may be up for debate in this country of deeming houses of worship essential, essential services and that’s one that we take into consideration,” the Democrat governor said during an hour-long briefing on opening up religious services during the coronavirus lockdown.

New York Yankees players Mike Ford and David Hale are giving online baseball lessons to kids who are unable to attend baseball camp due to coronavirus cancellations. The players are set to host lessons on Internet conference service Zoom for kids who would normally be attending the camp in New Rochelle, New York, PageSix reported. Camp coach Darren Gurney praised the effort, saying, “In the absence of the boys’ ability to play, it is so important to continue to foster their love of the game and to encourage them to stay fit. We are grateful for the opportunity to hear from top MLB talent.” Topics of the videos will include pitching and hitting tips, as well as ways to “stay motivated” despite being shut up in your home, thanks to the coronavirus lockdowns. The team has engaged in a number of actions during this pandemic. The team announced a $1.4 million distress fund for team and stadium employees who have lost salaries and work time due to the shutdowns. In another effort, the team donated cloth to make PPEs that would otherwise have gone into uniform making. Follow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston.

A California sheriff is vowing to look the other way as it pertains to enforcing an order requiring that residents wear masks in public. Orange County Sheriff Don Barnes made his announcement Tuesday in front of the county’s board of supervisors. The county recently passed an order requiring all residents to wear a mask if they cannot stay six feet away from people, the Los Angeles Times reported. “We are not the mask police — nor do I intend to be the mask police,” Barnes said. “I think what we have seen repeatedly throughout the community is Orange County residents acting responsibly.” Barnes went on to call the residents “adults” who “can take the protective measures as they see fit.” “We have not dealt with these issues through enforcement, and I will direct my staff not to direct any enforcement toward the … mask requirement,” he added. Orange County has had 5,646 confirmed coronavirus cases as of Thursday, 136 of them being fatal, according to the Orange County Department of Public Health’s website. Barnes is not the only sheriff not to enforce a mask order. Police and sheriffs’ unions in Texas’s largest county, Harris County, said in April that they would not enforce an order by county Judge Lina Hidalgo, a Democrat, requiring that everyone wear a mask.

A Mexican border state implemented southbound checkpoints at international ports of entry to enforce Coronavirus sanitation measures. Those wishing to enter who do not follow the protocols will be sent back to Texas. This week, the Tamaulipas government began a series of health inspections and outreach operations in the border cities of Matamoros, Reynosa, and Rio Bravo. According to Tamaulipas officials, travelers will be checked for symptoms and be given provide information about current restrictions.  Officials will also check that only one passenger is traveling per vehicle, require masks, and let them know that only essential activities are allowed. Only certain vehicles from the U.S. are allowed on Tamaulipas roads. “These filters are placed to protect the health of Tamaulipas families,” said Tamaulipas Health Secretary Gloria Molina Gamboa in a prepared statement. “They will help decrease the number of infections and deaths due to Coronavirus.” In recent days, Matamoros saw a dramatic spike in cases. Local politicians, including the mayor, claimed the spike is related to U.S. travelers visiting for social purposes who fail to follow health guidelines. The measures stand in direct contrast with the more relaxed federal approach. Mexico City now claims the pandemic under control. Ildefonso Ortiz is an award-winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.

NEW YORK (AP) — Baseball players appeared likely to propose more regular-season games this year while holding to their demand for full prorated salaries, people familiar with their deliberations told The Associated Press. Washington pitcher Max Scherzer, among eight players on the union’s executive subcommittee, issued a statement late Wednesday night calling management’s proposal for more salary cuts a non-starter. A day after Major League Baseball proposed a sliding scale of salary slashing for a pandemic-delayed season with an 82-game schedule in ballparks without fans, the union held a conference call Wednesday that included its executive board, player representatives and alternate player representatives, the people said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because no details were announced. Scherzer, among the sport’s highest-paid players, confirmed the call without divulging who was on it. “After discussing the latest developments with the rest of the players there’s no need to engage with MLB in any further compensation reductions,” he said in a statement posted to Twitter. “We have previously negotiated a pay cut in the version of prorated salaries, and there’s no justification to accept a 2nd pay cut based upon the current information the union has received.” “I’m glad to hear other players voicing the same viewpoint,” he added, “and believe MLB’s economic strategy would completely change if all documentation were to become public information.”
It was unclear when the union will respond to MLB’s plan, the people said. Stars Mike Trout and Gerrit Cole would lose the most under MLB’s plan, about 77% of the $36 million each they were set to be paid this season. In all, there are 133 players whose contracts call for salaries of $10 million or more, not including shares of signing bonuses. A big leaguer earning $1 million or less would keep at least 43% of his salary under the six-tier scale. That includes a share of $200 million earmarked for players that is contingent on the postseason being completed. About 460 of approximately 900 players on rosters and injured lists when spring training was stopped in mid-March due to the new coronavirus make $1 million or less. Trout and Cole would be cut to about $8 million each. Colorado’s Nolan Arenado would drop from $35 million to $7.84 million. “Interesting strategy of making the best most marketable players potentially look like the bad guys,” Milwaukee pitcher Brett Anderson tweeted. The players’ association called the proposal “extremely disappointing.” The union has argued players already accepted a cut to prorated shares of their salaries in a March 26 agreement and should not have to bargain again. MLB would like to start the season around the Fourth of July in empty ballparks and proposed an 82-game regular season. It claims teams would lose billions of dollars by playing with no ticket money and gate-related revenue.
“This season is not looking promising,” New York Mets pitcher Marcus Stroman tweeted. “Keeping the mind and body ready regardless.” Union head Tony Clark has not commented publicly on MLB’s proposal and has said very little publicly since late March. Agent Scott Boras has repeatedly criticized MLB for proposing more salary reductions and has questioned the accuracy of management’s financial claims. “Hearing a LOT of rumors about a certain player agent meddling in MLBPA affairs,” Cincinnati pitcher Trevor Bauer tweeted Wednesday. “If true — and at this point, these are only rumors — I have one thing to say… Scott Boras, rep your clients however you want to, but keep your damn personal agenda out of union business.” Boras declined to comment on Bauer’s remarks. “Working together to manage the public health issue has brought great solidarity among the players,” Boras said earlier in the day. “They are a strong united front and resolute in their support of the MLBPA.” A season with more than 82 games would lead to players earning a higher percentage of their original salaries. MLB says that without fans each additional game would result in a $640,000 loss.
Brewers chairman Mark Attanasio told the Greater Milwaukee Committee on Tuesday “the be-careful-what-you-wish-for part is hours every day.” “It’s got to come together very quickly or we won’t be able to, we will just run out of time,” he said. “To pay players at a full contract rate, pretty much 90% of that would go to pay them and wouldn’t cover any other costs.” Details of the plan have been disclosed to the AP by several people familiar with the proposal. They spoke on condition of anonymity because details had not been announced. MLB’s proposal says that within 48 hours of the ratification of an agreement for player compensation terms and health and safety protocols, the commissioner’s office would announce a proposed timeline for the resumption of the season. The resumption would include a training period of at least 21 days, and each team would be allowed a maximum of three exhibition games, all in the final seven days of the training period. Opening day would be in early July, and the final scheduled regular-season game would be no later than Sept. 27 — the same as in the original 2020 schedule. Issues such as roster size, trade deadlines, series length and treatment of the luxury tax would be delegated to a subcommittee.

The Gary Sinise Foundation, founded by actor and avid supporter of U.S. military veterans and their families Gary Sinise, has donated 20,000 meals to VA hospitals to help the coronavirus recovery efforts. “Donations like this mean a lot to our VA staff as they are on the front lines of caring for our nation’s veterans every day,” VA Secretary Robert Wilkie said in a press release. “We are very appreciative of this donation during the COVID-19 pandemic.” The VA noted that it would distribute the food donations among 80 VA facilities. The @DeptVetAffairs announced today that the Gary Sinise Foundation has committed to providing up to 20,000 meals to 80 VA medical facilities across the nation in the coming weeks.

Everybody’s been impacted by having to stay home from work or go to work because they’re a first responder, and they’re needed out there, so we’re trying to make a difference.” Sinise also recently donated PPEs to the San Diego Police Department. Sinese gave about 500 face shields and a shipment of hand sanitizer to the department. “We’re just so happy that an organization like the Gary Sinise Foundation is willing to make a donation such as this to the San Diego Police Department,” said San Diego Police Lt. Shawn Takeuchi. Follow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston.

BBC anchor Emily Maitlis has not apologised for a rant against Dominic Cummings which the broadcaster admits broke the rules on impartiality. The British Broadcasting Corporation, being funded by the public through a compulsory licence fee which live television viewers must pay whether they consume BBC programming or not –or else face fines backed by the threat of imprisonment — is obliged maintain a neutral, balanced stance in its news reporting. BBC staff may play Devil’s Advocate when interviewing politicians and so on, putting the arguments which they believe their guests’ opponents would put to them — but they are not allowed to use their publicly-funded platform to take sides or voice their own political opinions, like staffers on left- or right-leaning commercial networks in the United States such as CNN and Fox News. On the BBC’s flagship Newsnight programme, however, anchor Emily Maitlis opened the May 27th show with a speech declaring in definitive and highly partisan terms that Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson’s chief adviser, “broke the rules, the country can see that and it’s shocked the government cannot” when he travelled from London to Durham to ensure his young child’s healthcare needs could be met if he and his wife were incapacitated by the coronavirus. She followed with a dig about how Cummings had in the past “tagged the lazy label of ‘elite'” on political opponents — principally establishment Remainers — and claimed the public mood towards him is “one of fury, contempt, and anguish” before accusing the Prime Minister of “blind loyalty” for defending his “reasonable and legal” behaviour. BBC statement on last night's Newsnight pic.twitter.com/JFm4Nt5YMv — BBC News Press Team (@BBCNewsPR) May 27, 2020  The BBC received thousands of complaints about Maitlis’s tirade, and had to admit, after much obfuscation, that it “did not meet our standards of due impartiality”. While Cummings’ enemies believe he should be fired for alleged rule-breaking, however, Maitlis’s admitted rule-breaking does not appear to warrant any punishment in the eyes of the BBC, which merely noted that “Our staff have been reminded of the guidelines.” There was speculation that Maitlis’s absence from Newsnight the day after her rant was some form of punishment, but she has since revealed that she was absent simply because she had herself asked for the night off, with substitute Katie Razzall further confirming that she had “not been asked by the BBC to take [the night] off — and if I thought she had been, I certainly wouldn’t have agreed to present the show”. Indeed, Maitlis not only declined to apologise for her actions, she actually posted a message saying she was “overwhelmed by all the kindness, messages – and support on here – and I’ve probably missed much of it” on social media, and offered  “A big thank you” not just from herself, but “from us all at [Newsnight]” — suggesting a signal lack of contrition for the stunt. Whether the BBC or Ofcom, the broadcast regulator, will take any further, meaningful action remains to be seen. Just for the record, Emily @maitlis has not been asked by the BBC to take tonight off – and if I thought she had been, I certainly wouldn’t have agreed to present the show @BBCNewsnight — Katie Razzall (@katierazz) May 27, 2020  Maitlis has previous form for revealing her political biases in her supposedly impartial journalism, launching into an astonishing pro-EU rant after clashing with the Hungarian foreign minister in an interview centring on his government’s hard line against illegal immigration and state-sponsored multiculturalism in “The problem with the European Union is it believes in tolerance, diversity, and human rights,” she railed at him, visibly quivering with anger. “And you are rejecting them all. So maybe it isn’t for you,” she said.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) sounded off on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and congressional Democrats for utilizing “proxy voting” amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. McCarthy this week joined congressional Republicans in filing a lawsuit against Pelosi saying proxy voting is unconstitutional and during Thursday’s Fox News Channel broadcast of “America’s Newsroom” reiterated Pelosi’s attempt to “secure more power for herself” amid a crisis is “unconstitutional.” “Everybody should be opposed to proxy voting,” McCarthy told host Sandra Smith. “Almost one-third of the Democrats did not show up to work yesterday but they’ll still get their paycheck. More than 50 million Americans did not have a voice on that floor. Democrats signed a piece of paper that said they were physically unable to come to Congress, but Charlie Crist was able to even though he signed that paper to go to the launch across the state. So, he lied to his own constituents, he lied under oath to those members that are in Congress themselves. And think for one moment — 231 years, we have never done this. Through yellow fever of 1793, through the Civil War, through the Spanish flu, even when the building was burned down in the War of 1812, 9/11.” He continued, “We should convene, the Constitution says we should. It is only the ability of Nancy Pelosi to try to get more power. Her own words yesterday on the floor … she says this is an opportunity, every crisis is. She’s taking a crisis as an opportunity to secure more power for herself and allow only 20 people to control the entire floor. That’s unconstitutional. They do not have the power and the right to do it, and all Americans should stand against this.” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent

A newspaper editor fled South Africa last week after police repeatedly assaulted him for covering the country’s strict coronavirus lockdowns, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said on Wednesday. On May 19, local journalist Paul Nthoba fled South Africa for the neighboring country of Lesotho after receiving repeated abuse from local law enforcement for his coverage of the region’s stringent coronavirus lockdowns. “This is the first time in post-apartheid South Africa that a journalist has fled the country with the intention of seeking asylum as a result of reprisals in connection with their reporting,” RSF said. According to the report, Nthoba was “punched and kicked by police while covering the [coronavirus lockdown] operation in [the town of] Ficksburg” for the first time on May 15.” Nthoba told RSF he visited the Ficksburg police station to file a complaint about the abuse on the same day but was “punched and kicked again” and then detained for several hours afterward. “They promised to deal with me once I’m released,” he said. Nthoba said he then reported the assaults to South Africa’s Independent Police Investigative Directorate, but to no avail. The journalist has since been charged with “violating lockdown regulations” and faces up to six months in prison under South Africa’s Disaster Management Act, which was amended in April to assist with regulations during the coronavirus pandemic, according to the report. Arnaud Froger, the director of RSF’s Africa desk, condemned South Africa’s attack on press freedom during the pandemic. “It is unthinkable in the South Africa of 2020 that a journalist should have to flee the country for covering a simple lockdown operation. The police cannot act with complete impunity on the grounds that they are enforcing the lockdown,” Froger said. In late March, Johannesburg police fired rubber bullets at Azarrah Karrim, a journalist for South Africa’s News24, as she reported on the first day of the national lockdown. Under South Africa’s strict lockdown measures, people who are found guilty of “disseminating false information” about the coronavirus pandemic could face up to six months in prison, according to the report. On May 24, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced an easing of coronavirus restrictions starting June 1.

The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said it supports the use of the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) to prevent coronavirus on Tuesday despite the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) suspending clinical trials of the drug over safety concerns, the Times of India (TOI) reported. The ICMR, India’s top biomedical research body, has directed the Indian government’s response to the ongoing Chinese coronavirus pandemic. The council’s endorsement of HCQ comes one week after U.S. President Donald Trump said he has been taking the drug as a preventive measure against the coronavirus. The ICMR recorded “no major side effects” of taking the drug as a prophylactic [preventive medicine] in observational and case-control studies in India, the council’s director-general, Balram Bhargava said on Tuesday, according to Agence France-Presse (AFP). Bhargava added that some instances of “nausea, vomiting, and heart palpitations” were noted. Last week, the ICMR expanded its guidelines for taking HCQ as a preventive drug for coronavirus. It announced all healthcare workers in hospitals and some frontline workers could now take HCQ for “up to several weeks” under strict medical supervision. “We recommended that for prophylaxis [preventive medicine], it should be continued because there is no harm. Benefit may be there,” Bhargava explained in statements to the press on Tuesday, as reported by AFP. He added that once the ICMR determined that the potential benefits of HCQ outweigh its possible risks, the council decided “we should not deny it to our frontline workers and healthcare workers.” Bhargava also said that healthcare workers and those working on the frontlines taking the drug should still wear personal protective gear to further protect themselves from contracting the virus. Previously, the ICMR’s guidelines for HCQ allowed “only asymptomatic healthcare workers caring for suspected or confirmed patients, or household contacts of confirmed patients” to take the drug as preventive medicine for coronavirus, according to the report. On Monday, the W.H.O. said it was halting testing of the drug as a coronavirus treatment after studies reportedly led to doubts over its safety. India manufactures 70 percent of the world’s supply of HCQ and has increased production of the drug in recent weeks as doctors around the world continue to use it to treat coronavirus patients. Last month, India announced it would supply 85 million HCQ tablets to 108 countries to support the global effort to combat the coronavirus pandemic. On Tuesday, an Indian government source told the TOI that India would continue to export the promised shipments of HCQ to foreign countries despite the W.H.O.’s suspension of HCQ trials. The Indian government will “check if the countries who have not yet received HCQ supplies still want it as the medicine is used for other ailments too,” according to the source. At press time on Wednesday, India reported 158,086 infections and 4,534 deaths from the Chinese coronavirus.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who ordered nursing homes to accept coronavirus patients for more than six weeks during the height of the coronavirus pandemic, told MSNBC on Wednesday that he would not send his own mother to one. Cuomo was interviewed by MSNBC hosts Katy Tur and Chuck Todd, who asked him whether he believed he could keep nursing homes safe during a possible “second wave” of the virus in the fall. “Can we keep nursing homes safe? No,” he replied. “Can you keep a hospital safe? No. Can you keep any gathering safe? No.” Todd followed up: “Let me put in different terms, Governor. Would you advise a friend to put their parents in a senior facility if if they thought it was time right now? Or would you wait until this thing passed?” Cuomo replied: “If I were advising a friend, I would say you have a vulnerable person. Best to keep them at home and not put them in a congregate facility. Keep them if a situation where you have the most control. That is the blunt truth. That’s what I would do with my mother.” Asked whether he regretted ordering nursing homes to accept coronavirus patients, Cuomo claimed that the nursing homes had been required to turn such patients away if they could not care for them, and that New York State had merely been following guidelines set by the federal government that banned “discrimination” against coronavirus patients. He did not explain how nursing homes were to determine if they could treat coronavirus patients when he had barred them from even testing for the disease. More than 4,300 coronavirus patients were sent to New York nursing homes, according to the Associated Press. Joel B.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday outlined her vision for a global European Union, backing it to deliver guidance on handling the Chinese coronavirus pandemic based on what she claimed was the manifest evidence of the organization’s achievements. In a speech outlining Germany’s priorities when it takes over the E.U.’s rotating presidency in July, Merkel acknowledged the pandemic had destroyed a host of previous certainties but backed the E.U. to help bring the world to order, AFP reports. Her simple solution is: more E.U. in more places more often. This is despite the evidence Europe has struggled from day one to achieve any level of unanimous agreement on how to handle the crisis, with individual member states each taking their own course and eschewing direction from Brussels: EU President Apologises to Italy as Anger Against Political Bloc Grows https://t.co/wJCsaBIlbf — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 4, 2020  “Especially in times of crisis I want the European Union to show solidarity on a global level too and take on more responsibility,” she told the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung think tank by video link. “In many places, the pandemic will intensify existing conflicts and problems and will therefore also become a stress test for the European Union.” Merkel pointed to the E.U. as an exemplar of  “democracy, freedom and the protection of human dignity” that the world can aspire to, adding: I see our presidency as a chance to further develop Europe as a capable, cohesive, and accomplished power that takes responsibility for the peace and security on the planet. Europe could not tackle the world’s problems alone, however, and she said the United States remained Europe’s “most important partner.” “Of course I’m aware that the cooperation with America is currently more difficult than we’d like,” Merkel said, pointing to differences with President Donald Trump’s administration on a broad range of issues including the World Health Organization and its bungled handling of the coronavirus epidemic. While offering advice to the U.S. on how it could further cooperation with Europe, Merkel neglected to note the very public fractures already appearing in the organization: Le Pen: The EU Was the First Casualty of Coronavirus https://t.co/jrItlGWM3w — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 26, 2020  French National Rally (RN) leader Marine Le Pen back in March was pointing to failures in E.U. unity and cooperation, claiming solidarity was one of the first victims when the virus first reached European soil, as Breitbart News reported. Italy’s populist League leader Senator Matteo Salvini was another to add his voice of disappear to the E.U.’s collective response. He said: “I hope the pro-Europeans have understood that if Europe is hunger and death and sacrifice it is not the future that we must leave to our children.” “Let’s take back our country into our hands without going cap in hand to anyone. Long live Italy and long live the Italians,” Salvini added.

Hungarian Justice Minister Judit Varga confronted European Union officials over Hungary’s Wuhan coronavirus response, saying the globalist campaign against the country had no basis. Minister Varga spoke at a meeting of European Union ministers by teleconference on Tuesday, stating that Hungary should expect an apology from critics who had argued Prime Minister Viktor Orbán had become a “dictator”. Prime Minister Orbán had relinquished his emergency powers earlier this week, handing the parliament back its authority. “It wasn’t the first time that we have fell victim to a campaign that had no basis whatsoever. But fortunately, in this case, the misleading and false information spread about us has obviously been proven wrong,” Minister Varga said. Eight-in-Ten Hungarians Think Govt’s Coronavirus Response Better Than Other EU Countries https://t.co/36SEwyMdKB — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 27, 2020  She added that in an “ideal world” Hungary would be on the receiving end of apologies from critics, but given the silence so far she invoked British singer Elton John, saying: “Sorry seems to be the hardest word.” Prime Minister Orbán faced a wave of criticism by the establishment media and various liberal and left-wing politicians, including former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice who demanded the country be kicked out of the European Union. Despite the criticism, Hungary was bolstered by a European Commission report which said the country had not violated any laws and there was no legal basis for a case against the government. “But, but …all the media have told us for WEEKS that Hungary is basically a dictatorship… all this is VERY confusing…” Hungarian ambassador to the Vatican Eduard Habsburg said following the Commission report. While the measures may not have been popular with liberal elites, a poll released this week revealed that the vast majority (78 per cent) of Hungarians did approve of the steps, with only nine per cent of respondents saying the government’s actions had been too excessive.

A London based Islamic group, which purports to be a “human rights organisation”, has had an advertisement claiming the Chinese coronavirus is an act of revenge from Allah pulled from Facebook. CAGE, a Muslim campaign group perhaps best known for calling ISIS executioner ‘Jihadi John’ a “beautiful” man, was using social media sites to raise £400,000 during Ramadan. The group had posted 16 adverts on Facebook for its campaign called ‘Reviving Divine Justice’, four of which were banned, including one with a video on coronavirus. Facebook decided to remove the advertisements from the Islamist group because the video violated the Silicon Valley tech giant’s advertising policies, according to The Times. Facebook has said that it will remove any coronavirus material that it deems to be “misinformation and harmful content” during the pandemic. Despite the advertisement being pulled, the Islamist coronavirus video still remains active on CAGE’s Facebook and Youtube pages. The video, entitled “One deed that can change the world”, said that “The world is in crisis and no one seems to know how to stop it,” before adding: “Allah has warned us: ‘Whatever misfortune befalls you it is because of what your own hands have done.” In response to reports of the video being taken down, CAGE said: “The once-Hitler supporting Daily Fail (Mail) and the Murdoch Times have coordinated smear pieces on CAGE today because they don’t want you to see THIS video we put on Facebook.” “Also it’s ironic that in the midst of a national emergency, the highest Covid deaths in Europe and with the nation united in disgust at the incompetence of Boris and the breaking of the rules by his chief advisor — these racist rags decide to do the only thing they know to do in order to distract… Stoke fear and hatred of Muslims!” CAGE added. Reports from across the Middle East, Africa, and Asia this weekend described Muslims ignoring lockdowns to celebrate Eid al-Fitr. https://t.co/fXGQnt1567 — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) May 26, 2020  CAGE has previously come under fire after they called for the “abolition” of all terrorism laws in the United Kingdom, following the arrest of their former general secretary under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000. In 2017, Muhammad Rabbani was found guilty of obstructing police after he refused to divulge the passwords of his phone and computer to officers at Heathrow Airport. The group claimed the arrest was a result of racial profiling. The group’s director of outreach, Moazzam Begg, was a former Guantanamo Bay detainee who was released in 2005 following a pressure campaign from the British government despite objections from the Pentagon, which maintained that he was a dangerous terrorist. The Islamist group has also been subject to widespread criticism after they shot to public prominence in 2015 when they defended the Islamic State executioner Jihadi John, saying that he was as an “extremely kind, gentle, beautiful young man”. A spokesman for the group later doubled down on the controversy when he explained that “the concept of jihad is an important concept.” Loudspeaker Islamic Call to Prayer May Become Permanent Fixture in Britain https://t.co/rLL1qX57kx — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 25, 2020  Follow Kurt on Twitter at @KurtZindulka

Wednesday on Fox News, Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) argued against any efforts to bail out so-called blue states to help ease the burden of their liabilities as they tend to the coronavirus pandemic. According to Scott, many of the problems currently plaguing those states comes from their spending policies before the COVID 19 outbreak. He especially took exception to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s (D-NY) rhetoric promoting the idea of the bailout. “You know what’s un-American?” he said. “To keep borrowing so much money that your kids and your grandkids will have all this debt because we’re not fiscally responsible. I got elected when Gov. [Andrew] Cuomo got elected, back at the end of 2010. Both of our states had financial problems. He took a totally different tack. He’s borrowed money every year. He doesn’t pay down debt. I dropped about one-third of our state debt … I’ve cut taxes. And guess what — Cuomo is also mad because all of these businesses moved to Florida because they couldn’t afford to live there, and then the people moved here because they got sick and tired of his taxes, his regulation and his attitude.” “He doesn’t watch the money,” Scott continued. “And now he is tired of taxing his citizens, so he wants the citizens of Florida, including a whole bunch of New Yorkers who moved here to get away from him to pay for his excesses. I’m not going to have it. It’s not going to happen. It’s wrong. You look at places like California, Illinois and New Jersey with their unfunded pensions — why are Floridians responsible for these bad balance sheets?” Instead of more money allocated by the federal government, Scott argued there were other things for Congress to consider for recovery from the pandemic. “[A]t some point we have to say, ‘How much money can we all borrow because we know our kids and our grandkids are going to be paying for this?'” he said. “I think Leader [Mitch] McConnell is doing the right thing. Let’s look at what we’re doing. What can we do to help those unemployed? What can we do to help our small businesses? And what can we do to make sure lawyers aren’t just suing all of our businesses and preventing them from opening because they’re trying to comply with how do you keep people safe, and you have all these trial lawyers wanting to sue our businesses, and it is scaring the living daylights out of our businesses? You’ve got to have liability protection for our businesses and our first responders.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor

Data from the U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests that the novel coronavirus’s true fatality rate in the United States, which takes into account mild and asymptomatic cases, stands at 0.26 percent, about eight to 15 times lower than earlier mortality rate estimates of between two and four percent, which prompted the lockdowns. However, the true (or infection) mortality rate is more than double the flu’s 0.1 percent. The case (or crude) fatality rate only takes into account confirmed coronavirus cases, excluding people with mild or no symptoms that do not require medical attention. Meanwhile, the infection fatality rate (IFR) accounts for the estimated number of mild and asymptomatic cases. It tends to be lower than the crude fatality ratio because it shows that more people have contracted the virus without dying. The 0.26 percent mortality rate (about three in 1,000) linked to COVID-19, the disease produced by the coronavirus, is lower than the death rate predicted by the infamous Imperial College report and other assessments that prompted the lockdowns across America. Using data contained in a CDC report, last reviewed on May 20, Daniel Horowitz, a senior editor at Conservative Review (CR), noted in an editorial this month: For the first time, the CDC has attempted to offer a real estimate of the overall death rate for COVID-19, and under its most likely scenario, the number is 0.26%. Officials estimate a 0.4% fatality rate among those who are symptomatic and project a 35% rate of asymptomatic cases among those infected, which drops the overall infection fatality rate (IFR) to just 0.26% — almost exactly where Stanford researchers pegged it a month ago. … Ultimately, we might find out that the IFR is even lower because numerous studies and hard counts of confined populations have shown a much higher percentage of asymptomatic cases. Simply adjusting for a 50% asymptomatic rate would drop their fatality rate to 0.2% – exactly the rate of fatality Dr. John Ionnidis of Stanford University projected. Breitbart News and other analysts verified Horowitz’s calculations. 'Nuff Said….. pic.twitter.com/0nZsydNHNb — Ethical Skeptic ☀ (@EthicalSkeptic) May 22, 2020  The CDC data is consistent with other assessments. “By now, multiple studies from Europe, Japan, and the U.S. all suggest that the overall fatality rate is far lower than early estimates, perhaps below 0.1 to 0.4%, i.e., ten to forty times lower than estimates that motivated extreme isolation,” Dr. Scott Atlas, a senior fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution, told lawmakers in early May, referring to the infection rate. By taking into account mild and asymptomatic cases that were not clinically confirmed, some health analysts have determined that COVID-19 is more widespread but less deadly than early estimates suggested. Health experts have noted that the faster the disease spreads and hits its peak, the fewer people will die. In early March, the World Health Organization (W.H.O.), a United Nations component, explained the difference between the crude and infection mortality rates, noting: Mortality for COVID-19 appears higher than for influenza, especially seasonal influenza. While the true mortality of COVID-19 will take some time to fully understand, the data we have so far indicate that the crude mortality ratio (the number of reported deaths divided by the reported cases) is between 3-4%, the infection mortality rate (the number of reported deaths divided by the number of infections) will be lower. For seasonal influenza, mortality is usually well below 0.1%. In April, the CDC reportedly placed the crude fatality case at around four percent. Ultimately, the W.H.O. placed the globe’s crude mortality rate at 3.4 percent. Early in the outbreak, health officials, including Dr. Anthony Fauci from the White House Coronavirus Task Force, had concluded that the crude mortality stood at about two percent. Fauci is the top infectious disease expert in the United States. There is a patchwork of policies across the U.S. for how to count the number of coronavirus deaths, meaning that the total fatality figure could be higher or lower than the actual number, depending on the state.

The New York Times has removed a section of a story it published in April that falsely reported that a 26-year-old medical intern had died from coronavirus. The story, titled “I’m an E.R. Doctor in New York. None of Us Will Ever Be the Same. A Covid diary: This is what I saw as the pandemic engulfed our hospitals,” included the story of the young man’s death. On Tuesday, the Times ran an editor’s note dated May 26, 2020, explaining the error: An earlier version of this article described an account that circulated among doctors in April about a 26-year-old medical resident training in New York who was said to have died of Covid-19 in a New York City hospital. This account was verified with sources involved in the patient’s care, but further reporting after publication revealed that it was apparently a case of mistaken identity. According to a spokeswoman for the American College of Emergency Physicians, a 26-year-old man who died from complications related to coronavirus had the same name as a young medical resident at a different hospital. Health workers involved in the patient’s treatment mistakenly believed that he was a medical resident, but ACEP said it had subsequently confirmed that it was not the same man and that the medical resident with that name was healthy. The reference to that case has been removed from the article. So remember in April when The NY Times Magazine ran a cover story that was the diary of an ER doctor in NYC—and the piece reported on the death of a 26 year old doctor? Well, it turns out the doctor didn’t die—or even have covid. pic.twitter.com/3p1iTxZGTm — Zac Bissonnette (@ZacBissonnette) May 27, 2020  A screenshot of the article as it appears now online shows that the story was published on April 14, 2020, and updated May 27, 2020.

103-year-old Jennie Stejna defied the odds to beat the novel coronavirus on May 13 and treated herself to a victory bottle of Bud Light in celebration. “Hell yes,” Stejna told her grandson-in-law, Adam Gunn, when asked whether she was ready to go to Heaven. A brutal fight against the novel coronavirus looked grim, and her family was forced to say their goodbyes over the phone. And while Stejna did not specify when she wanted to go, the following days made it clear: Not yet. Stejna is a “hardcore Boston sports fan,” who “used to sit outside and listen to the Red Sox on the radio,” her family remembered. She also enjoys bingo, reading, and crochet, though the latter has become difficult due to arthritis. She has two children, three grandchildren, four great-grandchildren, and three great-great-grandchildren all rooting for her. Over a century old at 103, Stejna lost her husband in 1992. He was 82 years old. But she is still kicking and more than happy to take a victory lap. Staff brought her a cold bottle of Bud Light, a drink Stejna loves but has not been able to have in a long time. Shelley Gunn described her grandmother as having a “feisty spirit” — a sentiment echoed by her husband, Adam. Even so, the call they received on May 13 was a shocking surprise. “This feisty old Polish grandmother of ours officially beat the coronavirus,” Adam said. “We’re truly very thankful.”

Wednesday on CNN’s “Anderson Cooper 360,” presidential historian and network contributor Douglas Brinkley accused President Donald Trump of failing in his response to the coronavirus pandemic. Cooper said, “The president declared himself a wartime president. If you declare that and then you don’t follow through on it, and you have a huge death toll, I mean, do you think his legacy will be defined by his response to COVID?” Brinkley said, “I think it really will be. I mean, the big bell rang. We had the big crisis, one of the worst ever, and he basically went AWOL. He got in a denial mode, and then he worried about himself only.” He continued, “We look at presidents that we want to feel the empathy of an F.D.R. telling Depression people, ‘We have nothing to fear but fear itself,’ and pulling the country together. Or Ronald Regan after the Challenger disaster in 1986. Or Bill Clinton in Oklahoma City, on and on. There are all these great moments. Today should be a day of national mourning that we hit the 100,000-mark. He should be leading that, showing the open-heartedness of America, that there were mistakes, there were blunders. But instead, he refuses to have a heart, and that’s the part that makes me most sad about what’s happening here. It’s not just the bungled policies, bad decision-making, but it’s a president who doesn’t seem to ever be able to express love to people unless they’re ardent Trump supporters, and it makes him sort of a pathetic figure.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

CNN network president Jeff Zucker said in a company-wide memo Wednesday that “the majority” of CNN employees will not return to the network’s office this year due to health concerns stemming from the Chinese coronavirus, according to a report. Zucker wrote, as was first reported by The Hollywood Reporter: We expect that the majority of you will not be able to return to our offices this calendar year. What happens after that is still a question mark, as well. No doubt the world, and our understanding of the way COVID-19 continues to shape our lives and our work, will change countless times between now and then. But I know it is important as you all make decisions for your own lives and your families that you are equipped with the most honest and transparent information we can give you. Fifteen percent of CNN staffers are currently working from the office, while “a few more” plan to return over the coming weeks. Zucker wrote: When you consider physical distancing requirements, we simply cannot put the same number of people back into our workspaces that were there before the pandemic. So we need to make some tough decisions. We intend to spend the summer months hearing from all of you, and doing our best to balance the physical needs of our spaces with our production needs, as well as your preferences. And nothing happens without putting safety first. All of that will be taken into account as we make decisions about how and when we make the slow return back. Zucker’s Wednesday memo comes after he told CNN employees that most of them won’t come back to the office “in any significant way before the end of the summer.” Two CNN anchors, Chris Cuomo and Brooke Baldwin, have been infected and recovered from the coronavirus.

Michigan State University is set to resume in-person classes this fall and will also feature “enhanced” remote learning opportunities, according to an announcement from university President Samuel Stanley Jr. on Wednesday. In his announcement, Stanley said students will be allowed to return to campus for classes beginning on September 2, with certain modifications in place that will make the campus “look different from any previous semester at MSU.” Stanley said in an online letter sent to students, faculty, and staff: We recognize that some students may choose not to return to campus for health or other reasons, and we will endeavor to provide an enhanced selection of remote classes that allow them to begin or continue progress toward their Michigan State University degree. Stanley also stated that the university would offer online and remote opportunities, which will include the addition of “more hybrid classes” and resuming some “purely in-person options.” The university president also made it clear in his announcement that facial coverings and masks will be “essential components” of the school’s reopening. Stanley also suggested that large gatherings may be “strictly limited and regulated.” In-person instruction on the campus will conclude on November 25 and the following classes will transition to be finished online. After Thanksgiving break, Stanley said students will have the opportunity to move off campus or remain in their permanent residence. According to the university, the schedule shift was implemented due to the prediction of a surge of positive coronavirus cases this fall. Follow Kyle on Twitter @RealKyleMorris and Facebook.

Nine Republican senators are lobbying President Trump to import more foreign workers, claiming there are not enough qualified Americans to take jobs, even with more than 36 million out of work. While economists predict there may soon be 41 million unemployed Americans due to the Chinese coronavirus crisis, Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), John Cornyn (R-TX), Mike Crapo (R-ID), James Risch (R-ID), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Todd Young (R-IN), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), and James Lankford (R-OK) are asking Trump to continue an inflow of foreign workers to take agricultural and nonagricultural jobs. Specifically, the GOP senators say Trump must continue fast-tracking H-2A foreign agricultural workers and H-2B foreign nonagricultural workers into the U.S. and should allow businesses to exempt themselves from foreign worker restrictions so long as they claim they cannot find Americans to hire. The GOP senators write: The marked impact that the coronavirus has had on the job market is undeniable. Nearly 33 million Americans are unemployed, and close to eight million American small businesses are at risk of shuttering forever. Some of these struggling small businesses rely on labor that many Americans may not be qualified or able to perform, even in the aftermath of the pandemic, and some of these businesses operate in industry sectors that are not experiencing high unemployment … or in particular geographical locations where qualified labor is scarce. American businesses that rely on help from these visa programs should not be forced to close without serious consideration. Guest workers are needed to boost American business, not take American jobs. [Emphasis added] … Due to the temporary and seasonal nature of the work, it is exeedingly difficult to find American workers, even now, who wish to work only on a temporary basis. Many of the jobs lost since March are not temporary or seasonal. Much of the furloughed or laid off workforce are likely looking to return to the jobs they were forced to leave … we are afraid the unemployment insurance compensation included in the CARES Act has created a disincentive for many American furloughed or laid off workers from finding new jobs, especially those seasonal or temporary in nature. [Emphasis added] As the GOP senators lobby Trump to import more foreign workers during mass unemployment, grassroots organizations representing American workers and college students are asking the president to halt foreign worker visa programs to ensure scarce jobs go to unemployed Americans. Between the H-2A visa program for foreign agricultural workers and the H-2B visa program for foreign nonagricultural workers, more than 350,000 additional blue-collar foreign workers are imported to the U.S. labor market annually. Despite this year’s record unemployment, hundreds of thousands of H-2A and H-2B foreign workers are expected to take American jobs. For some time, the H-2B visa program has been used by businesses to bring in cheaper foreign workers and has contributed to blue-collar Americans having their wages undercut.

The South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported on Wednesday that the Democrat governor of Washington state, Jay Inslee, wrote a personal letter to Chinese dictator Xi Jinping in early April asking China to use its “enormous productive capacity” to provide “critically needed medical supplies” including masks, gloves, and gowns.  According to the SCMP, Washington “ultimately received donations of an unspecified quantity of supplies from several Chinese government and private sources.” Inslee’s letter to Xi, never before disclosed to the public, was uncovered by the SCMP with a public records request. The April 2 letter began with Inslee telling the authoritarian Chinese ruler than he made “many friends in the state of Washington” during his “historic visit in 2015” and now they needed Xi’s help with the coronavirus. “Your experience in successfully managing the progression of the disease has provided us with many important lessons and has helped us to mitigate the impact of the disease on our people,” Inslee told Xi. “While these lessons have helped us significantly in blunting this outbreak, it is still having a very serious impact on the state. We are facing extreme challenges in finding the supplies and equipment necessary to protect our health care workers and treat our patients.” The SCMP noted, as Inslee did not, that one reason Washington had so much trouble obtaining supplies was that “Beijing had tightened its vetting of exports of medical supplies, resulting in major delays of shipments of personal protective equipment to the United States.” “Beijing’s heightened screening followed complaints by some governments and hospitals that large quantities of PPE sent from China were below acceptable standards,” the SCMP further noted, alluding to substandard or useless equipment delivered by Chinese suppliers to countries around the globe.  Inslee’s letter continued with lavish praise for Xi’s handling of the coronavirus, which Inslee saw as such a smashing success that Beijing could surely afford to send some masks, gowns, gloves, and testing supplies to the Pacific Northwest. “In reviewing the global progression of COVID-19, we note that the situation in China has essentially stabilized due to your government’s leadership,” Inslee wrote. “I am asking you to consider allowing Washington State to access the enormous productive capacity of China to obtain critically needed medical supplies.” Behind the scenes, the SCMP said Inslee’s plea to Xi was brokered with the help of a naturalized American citizen from China named Qiang Wan, a Washington state-based software entrepreneur who chairs the nonprofit Tsinghua GIX Institute North America. The institute was created as a joint project by Microsoft, the University of Washington, and Xi’s alma mater Tsinghua University, which Inslee mentioned in his letter. Wan himself has been in Beijing since embarking on a business trip there in December. Tsinghua, located in suburban Beijing, was founded by Americans in 1911 to help prepare Chinese students who planned to study at schools in the United States, so it has long played a major role in U.S.-Chinese relations in addition to being one of China’s most prestigious universities. “Wan, whose father served as the Chinese ambassador to Morocco in the late 1980s and early 1990s, said he had been moved to act after watching the virus take hold in his home state while in China on business. Washington state, which has recorded about 19,500 coronavirus cases and 1,000 deaths, ultimately received donations of an unspecified quantity of supplies from several Chinese government and private sources following the letter appealing directly to Xi,” the SCMP reported. Wan wrote an email to Inslee’s office in March that was also obtained by the SCMP in which he expressed concern about the coronavirus outbreak in Washington, acknowledged political tensions between China and the United States, and hoped Tsinghua University could “help [Washington] State secure much-needed medical supplies and equipment.” China’s ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, swiftly wrote a letter to Inslee acknowledging that Xi had received his request for aid and “directed relevant government departments of China to provide needed assistance and facilitation.” Inslee, formerly a candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, is not the only U.S. governor to seek Chinese assistance with the coronavirus. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) in April praised the Chinese Communist government for sending 1,000 ventilators to his state amid a bitter feud between Cuomo and President Donald Trump.

During a press conference on Wednesday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo (D) said that the “obligation is on the nursing home” to say they can’t accept people who have tested positive for the coronavirus. Cuomo said that he has “always followed CDC guidance.” And “I think the rule that you can’t discriminate against a COVID patient is right.” He continued, “That doesn’t mean the nursing home has to accept a COVID-positive patient. They conflate those two things. I understand because politically, facts don’t matter…but because you can’t discriminate doesn’t mean you have to accept. Actually, the law is the opposite. You cannot accept a patient at a nursing home unless you can fully and adequately treat that patient. So, you can’t accept a COVID patient — COVID-positive patient, unless you can isolate and quarantine and have the staff. Unless you can do all that, you cannot accept that person. And the nursing home — the obligation is on the nursing home to say, I can’t take a COVID-positive person. I’m too crowded. I’m too busy. I don’t have enough PPE. Whatever the answer is. It doesn’t even matter. It’s — if they say, I can’t take the person, they can’t take the person. So, that’s how it works. It doesn’t mean they discriminate against the COVID-positive person. They just say, I can’t handle the person.” (h/t Harry Siegel) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

24-year-old Tian Yuxi of Wuhan, China, was killed by the coronavirus in early February. According to the Epoch Times, her mother Yang Min was arrested two weeks ago for accusing the Chinese government of being responsible for her death. Yang Min was reportedly dragged away from the Wuhan municipal complaints office on May 11 by four unidentified men because she arrived to file her complaint carrying signs that read, “Injustice,” “Give Me Back My Daughter,” and “The Government Conceals the Truth About the Epidemic.” Yang told the Epoch Times the heart of her complaint is that the Chinese government concealed the extent and lethality of the Wuhan coronavirus epidemic, so Tian went to the Wuhan Union Hospital for an unrelated matter without realizing how dangerous it was. Tian contracted the coronavirus while in the hospital and died there on February 6.  “If we had known about this virus, we would not have gone to the hospital and my child would not have left,” Yang said. Yang said she wants the officials responsible for hiding the truth of the epidemic to be investigated and charged with crimes against humanity if appropriate. The Chinese government is highly unlikely to consider it appropriate. The New York Times reported in early May that Yang was not alone in demanding accountability from the Chinese government, but most of the other Chinese citizens brave enough to complain about relatives who died in China’s brutal quarantine zones or were turned away from hospitals have been intimidated out of pressing their cases. Human rights activist Yang Zhanqing said some of the families he is working with were threatened into silence by the police, lawyers have been pressured into dropping their cases, and “volunteers who tried to thwart the state’s censorship apparatus by preserving reports about the outbreak have disappeared.” “They are worried that if people defend their rights, the international community will know what the real situation is like in Wuhan and the true experiences of the families there,” said Yang, who fled to New York after he himself was pressured by the Chinese police.  Zhang Hai, whose father contracted a lethal case of coronavirus in a Wuhan hospital just like Yang Min’s daughter, said Chinese newspapers have been forced to spike interviews they conducted with him, and even his attempt to crowdfund a monument to victims of the epidemic has been censored. The Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) determination to erase the true history of the coronavirus is so intense that people who were building archives of censored news reports have warned each other to erase everything on their computers before they get arrested. Victim support groups have been forced to disband and public mourning of the coronavirus dead has been discouraged, in part, because the government wants to conceal the true number of infections and deaths, say families. “If anyone dares to make a request and the government fails to meet it, they immediately are seen as a threat to national security It doesn’t matter whether you’re a lawyer or a victim, it’s like you’re imprisoned,” warned Chen Jiangang, one of the bereaved family members working with Yang Zhanqing. 

Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Rebecca Dallet, who argued that Democrat Gov. Tony Evers’ “Safer at Home” order should remain in place, spent Memorial Day weekend boating and surrounded by friends. Dallet, who joined Justices Ann Walsh Bradley and Brian Hagedorn, dissented from the state Court’s decision on May 13 to remove the “Safer at Home” order, which was originally set to expire on May 26. Dallet noted in her dissent that “Wisconsinites will pay the price” for the Court lifting the order two weeks early, while she and another family teamed up for a boating trip two days before the order was set to expire. Photos from the outing were shared to Facebook by one of Dallet’s friends and revealed that social distancing measures were not implemented on the small boat. As noted by News/Talk 1130 WISN, the friend who uploaded the photo to Facebook used a ‘Stay Home, Save Lives’ border on her profile picture.” Had the “Safer at Home” order still been in place, which is what Dallet wanted, she could have been held legally responsible and face 30 days in jail and/or $250 in fines because the order outlawed gatherings of people who do not live in the same home. A photo from the excursion, shared to Facebook, was uploaded by News/Talk 1130 WISN and can be seen here. Follow Kyle on Twitter @RealKyleMorris and Facebook.

The nation’s capital will begin a phased reopening on Friday, announced Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser on Wednesday, citing a 14-day decline in Chinese coronavirus community spread and sufficient hospital capacity, among other metrics the city must meet to reopen. D.C. is basing its 14-day decline in community spread on a five-day average, given that the number of cases fluctuates day by day. On Wednesday, Bowser told reporters: Today, I will be signing a mayor’s order that will lift the stay-at-home order. Beginning Friday, May 29, we will move into Phase One of reopening. So I want to clarify this, COVID-19 [the disease produced by the coronavirus] is still in our community, and our region and our nation and the public health emergency will continue. Gatherings of more than ten people are still prohibited. Starting Friday, the mayor will allow non-essential retail businesses to operate only with curbside and front-door or delivery; haircuts by appointments and with stations six feet apart; outdoor seating at restaurants in addition to takeout, delivery, and grab and go; the reopening of dog parks, golf courses, parks, tennis courts, as well as tracks and fields; and allow health care providers to continue or resume offering elective surgeries. 1/ We have reached our sustained, 14-day decrease in community spread. pic.twitter.com/bP8srfskZT — Mayor Muriel Bowser #StayHomeDC (@MayorBowser) May 27, 2020    3/ Effective Friday: nonessential retail businesses can operate with curbside, front-door or delivery. pic.twitter.com/7wyZVFHCQY — Mayor Muriel Bowser #StayHomeDC (@MayorBowser) May 27, 2020  5/ In addition to takeout, delivery, and grab and go, restaurants with outdoor seating can begin using that space. pic.twitter.com/nohFQg5ycE — Mayor Muriel Bowser #StayHomeDC (@MayorBowser) May 27, 2020  7/  Health care providers may continue to offer or resume offering elective surgeries. pic.twitter.com/N1Ir1TDKYY — Mayor Muriel Bowser #StayHomeDC (@MayorBowser) May 27, 2020  Dr. LaQuandra Nesbitt, director of the D.C. Department of Health (DOH), told reporters: As the stay-at-home order … is being replaced with the mayor’s order today, we still want people to be judicious around the types of activities that they are participating in. It is still favorable for us as a city, if people focus on participating in the essential activities that they have previously been engaging in and using good judgment when utilizing the non-essential activities that have been highlighted today. The health department director urged people to avoid contact with members of high-risk communities, like seniors, if they do go out and engage in non-essential activities. Bowser cautioned that the number of COVID-19 infections would likely increase as the more people venture outside when the city reopens Friday. “I want to make sure that we all understand that moving into Phase One means that more people can get infected because now more people will be moving around in the community,” the mayor warned. However, Bowser noted that D.C. is ready to deal with a potential spike in cases after it reopens. “We have put in place the hospital capacity, built up our PPE [Personal Protective Equipment] supply, and added new contact tracers,” she said. Asked about returning to lockdown if the coronavirus conditions worsen after reopening, Bowser said she does not “anticipate going back.” “DOH will continue to monitor the spread of the virus in the district, and this order [to reopen] can be turned up or turned down, or there could be [specific] activities that we know need to be changed, and we can change it by order,” she added. According to data from the mayor’s office, there have been sufficient days of a low COVID-19 transmission rate to reopen the city. Moreover, D.C. can test all priority groups, as mandated by the district’s reopening guidelines. Currently, the city can test 5,500 people per day, Bowser told reporters on Wednesday. The district also has an adequate capacity to contact trace all new cases and their close contacts, information from the mayor’s office revealed. Bowser urged people to continue wearing masks, social distancing, and practicing good hygiene as the city reopens. “Every single one of us has a role to play in protecting ourselves and each other,” she noted, later adding, “We have a shared responsibility to stop the spread of the virus.” The mayor also encouraged the federal government and private companies to allow people to continue teleworking when possible during Phase One. Monday was D.C.’s first day with no new coronavirus deaths since March. The following day, there were five new COVID-19 deaths, bringing the cumulative total to 445 since the district confirmed its first case on March 7. D.C. continues to see an increase in the cumulative number of new positive cases, which currently stands at 8,406, about 20 percent of the total 42,697 tested in the city, data from the mayor’s office showed.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said during a press conference on Wednesday that “every crisis” is an opportunity to advance a leftist agenda. “We have to open the economy, we have to do so in a way that gives more opportunity for access to care, to credit, to opportunity,” Pelosi said during a press conference regarding her coronavirus phase four bill, the HEROES Act. “Just as Mr. Clyburn said, this is an opportunity, every crisis is,” Pelosi added. The House leader referenced U.S. House Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-SC), who said before the passage of the $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill in March that the bill was a “tremendous opportunity to restructure things to fit our vision.” Pelosi rebuked media reports that the HEROES Act was partisan. “Nobody said that when Mitch McConnell put forth his bill, CARES one,” she said. House Democrats passed the $3 trillion, 1,815-page leftist Heroes Act in May, which many House Democrats reportedly admitted serves as more of a “policy wishlist” than a bill to alleviate the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Politico wrote: Privately, several House Democrats concede their latest bill feels like little more than an effort to appease the most liberal members of the caucus, many of whom were chafed that their most important priorities were minimized or ignored entirely in previous coronavirus negotiations. The Heroes Act contains many leftist provisions, including: Meanwhile, the California Democrat claimed the Heroes Act is “disciplined, focused, necessary.” Sean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News.

TEL AVIV – Israeli scientists have discovered that two drugs for treating Gaucher’s disease are also effective against the coronavirus, the Defense Ministry said Tuesday.  Scientists at the Israel Institute for Biological Research (IIBR) tested an analogue of the FDA-approved drug Cerdelga, and an analogue of a second drug, Venglustat, which is currently in the advanced stage of clinical trials, a statement from the ministry said, adding the drugs could act as a broad-spectrum antiviral therapy in a second coronavirus wave. IIRB’s study found “antiviral treatment using both drugs led to a significant reduction in the replication capacity of the coronavirus and to the destruction of the infected cell. The decrease in virus replication prevents further cell damage following infection,” the statement said. The drugs were also found to be effective against other virus strains, including influenza and West Nile fever. The Defense Ministry-run lab has also completed its clinical trials of the specific compounds in question, making it market-ready in the coming weeks. Earlier this month, IIBR made a breakthrough development in isolating an antibody that neutralizes the COVID-19 virus. The drug would also act to combat people already with the disease and not as inoculation.

Princeton University professor and MSNBC contributor Eddie Glaude, Jr. said Wednesday on his network that Americans need to understand “profoundly racist our country is.” Discussing the death of George Floyd after a police officer knelt on his neck in Minneapolis, Glaude said, “I think it’s pretty much common knowledge in the United States that we have multiple Americas, and that is evidenced in the way in which those Americas are policed. People need — the video exposes a kind of willful ignorance. It provides light on the shadow against the idea of innocence of the country. But I think there’s an intimate knowledge around the country that there are two Americas, that police don’t value the lives of black folk. When you look at the face of that officer, he doesn’t seem to assume that he has his knee on the neck of a human being. He’s with his hand in his pocket. He doesn’t hear him call out for his mother. He doesn’t hear him crying. So this is the America we live in. We just need to confront it honestly.” He continued, “We have to finally be honest with ourselves. We talked about this when this happened with El Paso. We have to understand how profoundly racist our country is and how it shapes the very ways in which communities are policed. That doesn’t lead to an indictment of each individual, but it gets us to the systemic nature of inequality.” He added, “You have a community that’s experiencing trauma and terror simultaneously. Minnesota just hit its peak with COVID-19 yesterday in terms of the number of hospitalizations and the number of dead. African-Americans in Minnesota are disproportionately impacted by Coronavirus. So we’re dealing with the devastation of this pandemic, and we’re seeing Ahmaud Arbery, we’re seeing Breonna Taylor, we’re seeing George Floyd. COVID has changed, in some ways, arrested so much of what the country has been doing about the business as usual, except killing black folk, except the devaluation of black folk.” He concluded, “When you see the police response to white protesters clamoring to open up the economy coming into the state capitol in Michigan, spitting and getting in the face of police, having a gun on their side, refusing to have their arms locked into handcuffs. They’re so patient and restrained. Here we are responding to the fact that this man treated George Floyd like an animal. What do we get? Rubber bullets, teargas, and the like. More than two Americans, Nicolle. This is the ugly underside of who we are.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

An incredible 43 percent of coronavirus deaths occurred in nursing homes and assisted-living facilities (ALF), reports Forbes. The 2.1 million Americans who live in nursing homes and ALFs represent just 0.62 percent of the population, but a staggering 43 percent of America’s coronavirus deaths. Forbes adds that this is almost certainly an undercount: States like New York exclude from their nursing home death tallies those who die in a hospital. Outside of New York, more than half of all deaths from COVID-19 are of residents in long-term care facilities., even if they were originally infected in an assisted living facility. In other words, if you remove New York from the tally, the percentage of American nursing home deaths jumps to over 50 percent. In Minnesota, the number is a breathtaking 81.4 percent. Washington State: 61.1 percent. Pennsylvania: 69.2 percent. Ohio: 70 percent. Virginia: 62.8 percent. North Carolina: 63.3 percent. Massachusetts: 61.9 percent. New Hampshire: 69.8 percent. Michigan, which like New York and New Jersey, forced nursing homes to accept patients still infected with the coronavirus, and is refusing to release its number of nursing home deaths. Gee, I wonder why. Florida, a state the corporate media have relentlesslyand falsely smeared as irresponsible over its refusal to institute these stupid one-size-fits-all lockdowns, has one of the lowest percentages of nursing home deaths: 43.5 percent — which is even more impressive considering Florida’s abnormally large senior population. Forbes says the contrast between New York and Florida is no accident: Contrast the decisions by governors like Cuomo with those of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. In Florida, all nursing home workers were required to be screened for COVID-19 symptoms before entering a facility. On March 15, before most states had locked down, DeSantis signed an executive order that banned nursing home visitations from friends and family, and also banned hospitals from discharging SARS-CoV-2-infected patients into long-term care facilities. Compare that policy to that of Govs. Andrew Cuomo (D-NY), Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI), and Phil Murphy (D-NJ), who would not even allow nursing homes to turn down an infected patient. Here’s what we know… If you are under 50, the fatality rate for the coronavirus is just 0.1 percent, or 1 in 1000, which is the same as the everyday flu. If you are over the age of 80, your chances of dying are about 150 times worse — 150 out of 1000, or 15 percent. But what did we do to those who were no more at risk of dying of the coronavirus than they were of the flu? We locked them down, and by extension took them out of their schools, shuttered their businesses, and destroyed some 40 million jobs. Yes, we shattered tens of millions of lives over a virus that is no more lethal than the seasonal flu if you are under 50. But we didn’t stop there, did we? Oh, no… Retirees, those who are no longer working, those who are most susceptible to the coronavirus — instead of locking them down away from the coronavirus, Democrat governor after Democrat governor after Democrat governor mandated that the infection be poured directly into the very  facilities that house those most at risk. And it’s not as if these Democrat governors did not know this. By the time the virus hit America, we already knew this was a virus that devastated seniors, especially seniors in nursing homes. We learned that from Italy. Think about that… We’re hit with a virus that primarily kills retirees, so the government locked up all the students and working people who aren’t at any real risk, and then forced infection into the homes of retirees who are. Imagine how different everything would look had these states protected their seniors. Imagine how much lower the death count would be. Imagine how much lower the infection and fatality rates would be… Imagine how many fewer lives would have been shattered had we been guided by the science instead of panic — had we not locked down those who were never in any real danger… What a debacle. As far as domestic policy goes, the government reaction to the coronavirus is the biggest and most deadly debacle in American history.   Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

The policy director of the Foundation for Government Accountability (FGA) wrote Tuesday that some business owners are having difficulty “reopening” their doors because their employees would rather collect funds through the Payroll Protection Program (PPP). In a column at the Washington Examiner, Sam Adolphsen observed business owners he spoke to in Camden, Maine, said their employees were receiving nearly $1,000 a week for not working through the CARES Act’s PPP coronavirus relief measure. "Business owners across the country are lamenting that people are not coming back to their jobs, even when offered. For small businesses able to survive the quarantine, more will need to be done to get their workers off welfare and back in the workforce" https://t.co/vwCXvP74OQ — The FGA (@TheFGA) May 27, 2020  “It’s a confusing and concerning problem for these business owners because they took the Paycheck Protection Program funds that were supposed to help them keep employees on the payroll,” Adolphsen wrote, citing a report released in early May by the Heritage Foundation that found the unemployment benefits in the $2.2 trillion CARES Act are actually creating devastating consequences for the U.S. economy. “Instead of bridging the gap, excessive unemployment payments will only increase the breadth and depth of the economic downturn,” research fellow Rachel Greszler wrote in her report, urging Congress to “fix” the CARES Act legislation so that no more than 100 percent of a worker’s prior wages would be provided through the emergency relief program. With up to 14 million jobs on the line and as much as $1.5 trillion in lost output, Congress should fix this disastrously flawed provision by capping total unemployment benefits at no more than 100% of workers previous wages. https://t.co/L6AuWvORmh — Heritage Foundation (@Heritage) May 2, 2020  Adolphsen explained further: Business owners across the country are lamenting that people are not coming back to their jobs, even when offered. For small businesses able to survive the quarantine, more will need to be done to get their workers off welfare and back in the workforce. It’s going to require thoughtful action from state and federal leaders, as well as strict enforcement of existing laws regarding unemployment benefits. Thankfully, some of the nation’s governors are making bold and commonsense moves to address the three-headed monster of a health crisis, budget woes, and businesses on the brink of extinction. Adolphsen praised Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), who fast-tracked COVID-19 protection for vulnerable nursing home residents, and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R), who came to the aid of healthcare workers by easing regulations and introducing more flexibility in the delivery of their services. Without Congress’s intervention to fix the CARES Act flaw, however, the nation is experiencing welfare on steroids. Adolphsen wrote: Congress created this problem, in large part, by adding a $600 per week unemployment benefit on top of the usual benefit so that many made significantly more money staying at home than they made while working. This is the perfect storm for wide-scale unemployment fraud and abuse. He applauded the courageous acts of those governors, including Kim Reynolds (R-IA), Phil Scott (R-VT), and Mike Parson (R-MO), who are asserting that workers who refuse to return to their jobs will no longer be eligible for unemployment benefits. “Reopening the economy only works if people return to work,” Adolphsen wrote.

Walt Disney World is planning on a phased reopening plan that would gradually open up its four parks in July, while SeaWorld Orlando plans to open its parks in June. Disney World plans to reopen the Magic Kingdom and the Animal Kingdom on July 11, and open Epcot and Hollywood Studios by July 15, Disney announced Wednesday. SeaWorld Orlando proposed reopening its three parks, including Aquatica and Discovery Cove, to the public by June 11 — about three weeks away, interim CEO Marc Swanson announced Wednesday. Gov. Ron DeSantis said each of the theme parks needs approval from the county before they can move forward with the reopening process, and approve of their plans. Both theme parks presented their reopening plans before the Orange County Economic Recovery Task Force, a panel of community and business leaders. The board unanimously approved of both of their plans. Both Disney and SeaWorld said guests and employees would have to wear masks and undergo temperature checks, and there would be some significant changes made throughout the park to promote social distancing and encourage hand-washing among park guests and employees. Swanson said masks would be required for guests ages two and older, temperature checks would be mandatory, and there would be a limit to how many guests who could use the pools and rivers. Hand sanitizer would also be available at the entrance and exits of each attraction. SeaWorld’s parks will open June 10 privately for an employee appreciation night the night before its set to open to the public, Swanson said. Disney visitors will also have to wear masks and undergo temperature checks, but the parks will provide masks for guests who do not bring their own. Disney cast members will enforce the rules as part of a “social distancing squad,” which had already received positive results when they made their debut in the Disney Springs retail area, said Jim McPhee, senior vice president of operations for Walt Disney World. Park attractions would also be limited, and not all attractions would open at once. Disney, SeaWorld, and Universal Orlando in Florida have been closed since March due to the coronavirus pandemic. Their decision to close was to stem the transmission of the coronavirus. Both SeaWorld and Disney, if approved by DeSantis, will follow the opening of Universal Orlando, which plans on opening June 5, the Tallahassee Democrat reported.

Washington State University (WSU) is working to provide “emergency” funding for illegal alien students in the wake of the Chinese virus pandemic. The publicly-funded university has partnered with a student activist group to help illegal alien students get “emergency” financial assistance in response to the Wuhan virus, according to a report by the school’s student newspaper, the Daily Evergreen. The report added that aside from emergency funds in response to the Chinese virus, the money will also go toward “the DACA renewal fund, and the scholarship fund,” and that the funds are available to all illegal WSU students, “even if they are non-DACA recipients.” The funds are being offered by WSU’s “Undocumented Initiatives Office” and the Crimson Group, the student organization working with the school to allocate the money toward illegal immigrant students. The Crimson Group describes itself as “an activist and support group for undocumented students and allies at Washington State University Pullman and the Palouse community,” according to the group’s Facebook page. “The federal government said the money going to universities and states for COVID relief will not be eligible for undocumented students,” said Linda Vargas, WSU’s Undocumented Inititatives ambassador and sophomore environmental science major. “So this is just another way that they can access funds and be able to afford their living expenses and pay their rent during these times,” she added. While it remains unclear whether or not taxpayer dollars are being provided for illegal immigrant students via this specific initiative alongside the Crimson Group, taxpayer dollars in Washington State are in fact available to illegal alien students through a state aid program called the Washington Application for State Financial Aid. The university describes the Washington Application for State Financial Aid as an entity that enables illegal immigrant students “to be considered for the Washington College Grant and for aid awarded by WSU.” Washington State University did not immediately respond to Breitbart News’ request for clarification on whether taxpayer dollars are being distributed to illegal aliens through this new initiative at the university.

Wednesday on CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” hosts Joe Kernen and Andrew Ross Sorkin battled over the stock market volatility amid the coronavirus pandemic. Kernen said, “Still looking at the coincidence and laggard indicator. For a while, it was how can stocks be where they are because of oil prices, remember that was your take then. How can it be based on where interest rates are right now. Every single discussion you had over the weekend is about how can stock prices be here when it is your earnings are here. Can you see how it isn’t the stuff in your face?” Sorkin said, “That’s the question there are a lot of smart people who have that view.” Kernen said, “Why is that the smart people? They’ve been wrong for 35 percent. Why are they smart? Just because they can see what’s right in front of their nose? That doesn’t make them smart! It makes them not savvy about the market!” Sorkin shot back, “Joe, Joe, Joe, you missed it a hundred percent on the way down too! You missed it 100 percent on the way down! And you missed 100,000 deaths.” As Kernen tried to respond, Sorkin said, “Hold on, hold on, hold on. I’m not going to do this with you, Joe. Every morning you try to question the questions I’m asking.” After some back and forth, Sorkin said, “Go ahead with the news!” Kernen said, “You panicked about the market, panicked about COVID, panicked about the ventilators, panicked about PPE, panicked about ever going out again. What good is it?” Sorkin interrupted, “Joseph, Joseph, you didn’t panic about anything! Joseph, 100,000 people died! One hundred thousand people died, Joe! And all you did was try to do was help your friend the president! That’s what you did! Every single morning on this show! Every single morning on this show! You used and abused your position, Joe!” Kernen shot back, “That’s totally unfair. I’m trying to help investors keep their cool. Keep their heads. And as it turned out, that’s what they should’ve done!” Sorkin said, “Do the news. Do the news.” Kernen said, “If they had listened to you, Andrew, we’re supposed to be at about 8,000.” Sorkin said, “I wasn’t arguing to go sell your stocks, Joseph! I was arguing about people’s lives! … Do the news, Joseph! I’m begging you! Do the news!” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

A copy of the since-canceled contact tracing contract Michigan Democrat Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s administration executed with a Democrat operative’s consulting firm, obtained exclusively by Breitbart News, shows the firm would have been paid to recruit 400 volunteers to collect medical information from state residents. The contract was signed April 20, 2020, between the Michigan Public Health Institute and Great Lakes Community Engagement, a nonprofit organization under the control of Mike Kolehouse, a Democrat campaign consultant. Great Lakes Community Engagement – Subcontract by Breitbart News on Scribd  Emails released on Tuesday show Whitmer’s team gave the “green light” to hire the firm, according to Bridge Magazine. “We got the green light from EOG [the executive office of the governor] to move forward with a slightly different organizational arrangement of the contact tracing volunteer work,” Andrea Taverna, a senior adviser at the Department of Health and Human Services, said in an email to other health department officials. “This would still be working with Mike Kolehouse, so work there isn’t lost — it’s just organized somewhat differently,” she wrote. Despite those statements, Whitmer’s office has sought to distance her from the arrangement. “When it was brought to my attention, I told them to cancel it,” Whitmer said during an April 22 press conference. She also defended the department, saying it “does not have a political bone in their theoretical body.” But no one has explained how Kolehouse, who has a long history of working exclusively for Democrat campaigns and progressive causes, came onto the scene to begin with. Janice Kidd, finance and budget manager at the Michigan Public Health Institute, signed the agreement. Kidd has not responded to Breitbart News about who authorized her to sign the document. The contract laid out personnel and a payment schedule. “The staff overseeing these programs will consist of the Owner/Operator, Director of Operations, and a 16-person management team. The management team includes two Project Managers and 14 Volunteer Managers who will each oversee approximately 400 volunteers,” it read. Initial Payment: The first 4 weeks of services of $64,500, plus the cost of an estimated 50 shifts ($17,500), for a total invoice amount of $82,000. Once invoiced, the first payment will be due on May 1st. Final Payment: The last 4 weeks of service will be based on shifts used in the previous month, subcontractor will adjust the bill accordingly. The invoice will include $86,000 for 4 weeks of management, plus the cost of an estimated 75 shifts ($26,250) for a total of $112,250. Once invoiced, the second payment will be due on June 1st. Total payments from MPHI to the Subcontractor under this Agreement, shall not exceed the sum of ONE HUNDRED NINETY-FOUR THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY and 00/100 DOLLARS ($194,250.00). MPHI shall make payments to Subcontractor within forty-five (45) days after receipt by the Business Office of an invoice that has been approved by the project coordinator indicating the amount due and the subcontract reference number. The contract also included a two-and-a-half page exhibit detailing privacy requirements due to the sensitivity of the medical information volunteers would be obtaining. The agreement also included a “Stop Work Order” provision, which was invoked the following day after media scrutiny in a letter to Kolehouse: The Michigan Department of Health & Human Services (MDHHS) has requested that the Michigan Public Health Institute (MPHI) issue a Stop Work Order to Great Lakes Community Engagement for work on project N-80007. Consequently, per Section 19 of your agreement, this letter serves as your Stop Work Order notification. All work must stop immediately on this project, effective April 21, 2020. Stop Work Order 4.21.2020 by Breitbart News on Scribd  Kolehouse has not commented on the matter. Kyle Olson is a reporter for Breitbart News.

A new poll suggests that the majority of college students do not think they will contract the Chinese virus by the end of the year. Only four percent of respondents said that they had already tested positive for the virus. According to a report by The College Fix, a poll revealed that a majority of college students do not think they will contract the Chinese virus by the end of the year. Of the 1,000 college students polled from around the nation, only 34 percent said that they believe they will be infected with the virus this year. The poll, which was conducted by College Pulse, revealed that Democratic students are more likely to believe they will contract the virus. Although 39 percent of Democratic students said they think they will become infected, only 27 percent of Republican students agreed. Some students argued that it is likely that many Americans will contract the virus if immunity isn’t achieved through a vaccine or a sufficient number of cases. “Until there’s a vaccine or enough people have had it to provide herd immunity, everyone is gonna get it unless they continue living in quarantine,” a student from Rowan University said. “Working in a hospital, my contact with possibly infected individuals that aren’t showing signs is high, especially since the tests take a while to come back with positives or negatives,” one student from the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga said. Some students claim that the lockdowns are causing more harm than the virus itself. One comment on the survey noted that domestic abuse, sexual assault, and suicide have all risen during the lockdowns. “OPEN AMERICA NOW!!! The stay at home order will do more damage than the virus itself … abuse, sexual assault, alcoholism, depression, and suicide just to name a few have all gone up rapidly,” a student at the Indiana University of Pennsylvania said. Stay tuned to Breitbart News for more campus updates.

The European Commission has proposed a massive €750 billion (£673bn/$825bn) Wuhan coronavirus bailout package as many across Europe have begun to question the European Union itself. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the coronavirus bailout package in the European Parliament on Wednesday. It will consist of €500 billion in non-repayable grants and another €250 billion in loans backed by bonds. “Today we are experiencing our own defining moment,” von der Leyen told the parliament and claimed the measures would be an investment in future generations, Die Welt reports. Economists Predict Potential End of the Euro Due to #Coronavirus https://t.co/VpZL1QJmhs — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 29, 2020  “This is Europe’s moment. Our willingness to act must keep pace with the challenges we all face,” she added, claiming that European countries would not be able to solve the coronavirus economic impact on their own. “What started with a virus so small your eyes couldn’t see it, has become an economic crisis so big that you simply cannot miss it,” she added. The plan comes just a week after a €500 billion bailout deal was proposed by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron. Not all member states are pleased with the proposal, which could reach up to a trillion euros in the coming years. Austria, Denmark, Sweden, and the Netherlands, which have been described as the “frugal four”, have come out against the idea of giving away cash to member states without seeking repayment. Experts Say German Court Decision Could End the Euro Currency https://t.co/e2pov7YFJX — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 21, 2020  The bailout package comes after many experts and economists have warned that both the euro currency and the European Union itself faced an existential risk over coronavirus due to a lack of solidarity from wealthier member states in the north towards poorer southern states more affected by the coronavirus. Italy, one of the countries hardest hit by cases and deaths relating to the virus, saw a wave of anti-EU sentiment in the early days of the crisis, leading polls to show nearly half of Italians thought their country would be better off outside of the EU. Another poll released this week by Redfield & Wilton Strategies has revealed that Euroscepticism has spread to Germany and France, as well. The poll found that 61 per cent of Italians said the coronavirus pandemic had weakened the case for the existence of the European Union, with 47 per cent of French and 40 per cent of Germans expressing the same view. A majority of respondents in all three nations also agreed that the EU had not done enough to help their respective countries battle against the spread of the Chinese virus. A majority, an average of two-thirds, also agreed strong national borders were important to secure their countries, a major blow to the EU’s free movement principles and the Schengen agreement which celebrated its 25th anniversary this year as most borders were closed.

Democrat governors are encouraging residents to wear masks during the coronavirus pandemic, describing it as a symbol or a sign of virtue. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) said Tuesday that wearing a mask during the coronavirus pandemic signified “strength.” “A face covering signifies strength and compassion for others,” Cooper said. “Wearing one shows that you care about other people’s health.” Cooper also expressed the sentiment on Twitter. A face covering signifies strength and compassion for others. Wearing one shows that you actually care about other people’s health. — Governor Roy Cooper (@NC_Governor) May 26, 2020  On Tuesday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) said that wearing a mask was “cool” and suggested he wanted to sign an executive order that said, “Wearing a mask is officially cool.” “Wearing a mask is now cool,” Cuomo said. “I believe it’s cool. … Wearing a mask is officially cool.” Dr. Anthony Fauci on Wednesday told CNN that wearing a mask was a “symbol.” “I want to protect myself and protect others, and also because I want to make it be a symbol for people to see that that’s the kind of thing you should be doing,” Fauci said, even though he reminded viewers that masks were “not 100 percent effective.” Former Vice President Joe Biden said that wearing a mask was a symbol of leadership. “What it presents and projects is leadership,” he said, berating President Trump for not wearing a mask. “Presidents are supposed to lead, not engage in folly and be falsely masculine.”

Recently Twitter added a “fact check” label to President Donald Trump’s tweets about the concerns surrounding mail-in voting fraud, but the social media site has failed to apply those same fact-checking measures to verified Chinese government accounts that spread coronavirus misinformation on the platform. Breitbart News recently reported on Twitter’s attempts to “fact check” President Trump, this time focusing on the President’s tweets discussing concerns surrounding mail-in voting fraud. Twitter chose to add its own personal “fact-check” to the President’s tweet, Breitbart News journalist Allum Bokhari outlined why this situation is unique in an article writing: Unlike Facebook, which gives itself plausible deniability for fact-checking bias by relying on “third party fact checkers” (almost all left-leaning) to pick and choose what to fact-check and what to ignore, Twitter made the decision to fact-check Trump’s tweet itself, linking to an official “moment” curated by Twitter employees and containing numerous articles from the mainstream media calling the president a liar. In a comment to Breitbart News, Twitter said there was no way for the President even to appeal the dubious “fact-check.” However, despite the “fact-checking” of President Trump by Twitter, the site has not applied the same standards to other governments and heads of state. In particular, the site has refused to remove or even fact-check posts from Chinese government officials spreading conspiracy theories suggesting that the Wuhan coronavirus actually originated in the United States. In March of this year, Breitbart News reported that Twitter refused to crack down on misinformation from Chinese officials, with the Daily Beast reporting: Coronavirus disinformation spread by senior Chinese government officials does not violate Twitter’s terms of service, a spokesperson for the company told The Daily Beast on Monday. The spokesperson pointed to language on its website, which gives wide latitude to statements from government officials. “Presently,” the company says, “direct interactions with fellow public figures, comments on political issues of the day, or foreign policy saber-rattling on economic or military issues are generally not in violation of the Twitter Rules.” Republican lawmakers Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE) and Rep. Mike Gallagher(R-WI) wrote a letter to Twitter’s CEO, Jack Dorsey, in March asking the CEO to crack down on Chinese propaganda on the site. The Senators stated in their letter: It is clear that Chinese Communist Party officials are using twitter to disseminate propaganda in the midst of a dangerous global crisis. Even worse, this propaganda obscures and confuses users over the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic and potentially undermines efforts to contain and control the outbreak. We believe this behavior more than warrants their removal from the platform. But just months later in May, Breitbart News reported that according to a study of data collected by the Hamilton 2.0 dashboard of the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a tool aggregating accounts connected to the Chinese government, the Chinese disinformation campaign had been ramped up. On May 8, the spokesperson for China’s Foreign Affairs Ministry posted a sweet that has been liked more than 4,000 times which reads: “The #US keeps calling for transparency & investigation. Why not open up Fort Detrick & other bio-labs for international review? Why not invite #WHO & int’l experts to the US to look into #COVI19 source & response?” The military houses and studies infectious diseases at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick, Maryland.

Why not invite #WHO & int'l experts to the US to look into #COVID19 source & response? — Hua Chunying 华春莹 (@SpokespersonCHN) May 8, 2020  It was estimated by Bret Schafer, the digital disinformation fellow at the alliance, that since the beginning of April more than 200 diplomatic and state-run media accounts had published more than 90,000 tweets in a massive Wuhan coronavirus information war. Schafer’s analysis estimated that Twitter output from China’s official sites had almost doubled since January with the number of diplomatic Twitter accounts tripling to 135 from 40 accounts at the same time last year. According to Schafer, the Chinese accounts “have become more aggressive, more conspiratorial, and the ones who have done that are their most popular accounts and have by far the most engagement.” Schafer stated that the Twitter account for the Chinese Embassy in France “has significantly more followers than the embassy in Poland, for example, because the embassy in France has been a driver of the most aggressive content.” On March 12, Zhao Lijian, the spokesman and deputy director of the Foreign Ministry’s Information Department, who has been one of China’s most prolific officials on Twitter, tweeted: “It might be the US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan.” A day later, Zhao tweeted that there was “Further evidence that the virus originated in the US.” This article is very much important to each and every one of us.

China has also previously rejected calls for an independent international investigation into the coronavirus outbreak, claiming that any demands for an inquiry are “politically motivated.” Despite all of this, Twitter has continued to refuse to fact-check tweets from Chinese government accounts, instead choosing to focus on President Trump’s concerns about mail-in voting fraud.

Michigan’s Democrat Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s decision to ban most residential construction during the coronavirus shutdown led to a 44 percent decline in Michigan construction jobs and contributed to her state’s second highest in the nation unemployment rate. Although unemployment rates rose in every state in April, three states stand out in particular: Nevada led the nation at 28.2 percent, followed by Michigan at 22.7, and Hawaii at 22.3. Michigan’s 22.7 percent jobless rate is the highest the state has registered since at least 1976, when comparable data was first tracked. The state’s previous high was 16.7 percent in December 1982 at the height of the 1980s auto downturn, making April’s numbers worse than the Great Recession of 2009 and likely the worst seen since the Great Depression nearly a century ago. The question is why was Michigan hit so hard in comparison to most of the nation. Nevada and Hawaii’s outlier jobless numbers are understandable. Both states rely heavily on the travel and tourism industry, which was hammered by the coronavirus pandemic even before government lockdown actions took effect. On March 17, both Hawaii and Nevada’s Democrat governors issued executive orders that shutdown their states’ leading source of revenue. Hawaii Gov. David Ige’s order urged tourists to “stay away” from the Aloha State, and Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak closed Las Vegas’ casinos, hotels, and entertainment venues. But Michigan’s economy does not rely on tourism, and although the state is home to the world’s automotive industry, the auto industry alone does not account for the Wolverine State’s outlier April unemployment numbers. The issue appears to be construction jobs, according to ZipRecruiter’s labor economist Julia Pollak. Construction jobs in Michigan fell by 44 percent in April, as compared to the national average of 13 percent, Pollak noted in a graph posted on social media. 2/ Michigan shut down construction when most states did not. As a result, construction employment fell by 44% (!) there, compared with only 13% nationwide, on average. — Julia Pollak (@juliaonjobs) May 24, 2020  3/ The state reopened construction in early May. Let's hope the industry bounces back. — Julia Pollak (@juliaonjobs) May 24, 2020  Whitmer’s original shutdown order, which took effect on March 24, deemed certain construction permissible, such as: [C]onstruction to maintain and improve roads, bridges, telecommunications infrastructure, and public health infrastructure (such as the creation or expansion of hospitals or other medical facilities to provide or support the provision of necessary care during the emergency). Construction workers may also undertake projects that are necessary to maintain the safety, sanitation, and essential operations of a residence during the emergency, including projects immediately necessary to restore the habitability of a residence. However, Whitmer’s order clearly stated that “[a]ny non-emergency maintenance or improvements to residences are not permitted.” That distinction effectively shut down a significant portion of Michigan’s construction industry. “She never closed down major construction like roadwork and large commercial projects during the pandemic,” one Metro Detroit area general contractor told Breitbart News. “So, you had road crews out there doing stuff. You had state construction projects.” The general contractor found the governor’s distinction between essential and non-essential construction to be arbitrary. “As a licensed electrician, I would be considered an essential worker if I got called to service someone’s house because they had no power,” the contractor said. “I’m allowed to go service that. But if I wanted to go to a remodeling project, I’m not allowed to do that. Tell me what the difference of the work site is? If I go to someone’s home to fix a power outage or if I go to their home that’s being remodeled, what’s the difference health-wise? And if I am going to a residence that is currently occupied and has someone who is infected living there, isn’t that a greater health risk than if I am going to work on a vacant house that’s being remodeled?” He feels that it was always possible to keep construction crews safe during the pandemic with face masks and basic social distancing. “When you’re framing something or hanging drywall, you’re not hugging each other. You’re standing within three, four, five, or six feet from each other at any given time. Now obviously, you use some common sense. If you’re not feeling well, you don’t come to work.” Roofers work on new housing construction in Oak Park, Michigan, on May 6, 2020, a day before Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s executive order allowed all construction to resume. (AP Photo/Carlos Osorio) Whitmer is not the only governor to halt residential construction due to the pandemic. New York’s Democrat Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s executive order also shut down “non-essential construction,” with an exception for “emergency construction,” which the order defined as “a project necessary to protect health and safety of the occupants, or to continue a project if it would be unsafe to allow to remain undone, but only to the point that it is safe to suspend work.” However, Cuomo’s order included a number of broad exemptions for “essential construction projects,” including construction on “roads, bridges, transit facilities, utilities, hospitals or healthcare facilities, homeless shelters, or public or private schools,” as well as work on “affordable housing” and any construction done by “a single worker who is the sole employee/worker on the job site.” A March 31 article in Curbed New York noted that Cuomo’s order essentially “puts the kibosh on entirely luxury residential and office construction, but still permits work on apartment buildings with a majority of market rate units.” That distinction still permitted a considerable amount of building in a state heavy with more apartment rental construction than single-family housing. According to U.S. Census Bureau data, the state of Michigan issued nearly 36 percent more building permits in 2019 for new single-unit residencies than the state of New York. Even still, the effect on construction jobs in New York was devastating. Like Michigan, construction jobs accounted for about 4 percent of all nonfarm jobs in New York at the start of the year. And construction employment fell about 41 percent. Overall nonfarm employment fell about 20 percent between February and April in New York. In Michigan, overall employment fell 23.5 percent. It is perhaps understandable that Whitmer and Cuomo took hardline shutdown stances, as both their states are epicenters for the coronavirus pandemic. However, California is also one of the pandemic’s hotspots, but the Golden State’s Democrat Gov. Gavin Newsom did not limit construction at all. Newsom’s shutdown order broadly defined construction workers as part of the “essential workforce,” and as such, his order specifically exempted: Construction Workers who support the construction, operation, inspection, and maintenance of construction sites and construction projects (including housing, commercial, and mixed-use construction); and workers who support the supply chain of building materials from production through application/installation, including cabinetry, fixtures, doors, cement, hardware, plumbing, electrical, heating/cooling, refrigeration, appliances, paint/coatings, and employees who provide services that enable repair materials and equipment for essential functions. Such a broad exemption basically allowed construction work to continue in California without interruption. And now such work is allowed in Michigan again since Whitmer lifted her construction ban at the beginning of May with an executive order allowing building to resume on May 7 with guidelines in place to ensure that workers maintain social distancing and employers conduct daily health screenings. Hopefully, this will be reflected in next month’s jobs numbers. But the bounce back for Michigan’s construction industry might take longer than expected because contractors now find that workers are harder to come by. “The problem is with everybody so scared about catching the virus, it’s hard to find employees,” the Michigan general contractor told Breitbart. “I have a personal friend with a framing crew who lost his entire crew because they won’t come back. They believe that there’s going to be a second wave, and they don’t want to risk their family. They’re content sitting on unemployment. They’re content with what they’re getting.” There is also some uncertainty about how much or how long businesses will be allowed to remain open. “Keep in mind that the governor here in Michigan has been engaged in a power play back and forth with the legislature threatening to extend the shutdown order,” he said. But he remains hopeful that the industry will be able to resume the projects that were put on hold when the lockdown order went into effect in March. “We had a really, really strong economy before this lockdown. We had plenty of work out there before the lockdown,” he said. “The construction industry was doing very well in Michigan. Now, it’s still very strong. But if I had to estimate, I would say that at least 10 percent of the jobs that were on the books dropped off.” The drop-off is a result of people cancelling jobs due to economic uncertainty, as well as jobs being further postponed because the shutdown delayed construction on winter projects that must now be completed before work can begin on projects that were scheduled for spring and summer. “There’s plenty of work out there for people to get off of unemployment and go back to work,” the contractor said. “There are more vehicles on the road now. You see construction vehicles everywhere now. People are hitting their construction jobs again. The demand for workers is rising.” “I can only hope that unemployment is dropping,” he said. “I pray it is because we need workers out here.” The contractor said that above all, he just wants to get back to work. “I don’t want or need unemployment. I’ve got half a million-dollar projects sitting out there waiting to be finished.” Rebecca Mansour is Senior Editor-at-Large for Breitbart News and the host of Breitbart News Tonight on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125, which broadcasts live weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern (6-9:00 p.m. Pacific).

Pakistan’s government said it may be forced to reinstate a coronavirus lockdown amid a surge in new cases, following the end of the Eid al-Fitr Islamic holiday on Sunday, Pakistani newspaper Dawn reported. On Monday, Pakistani health officials logged 1,748 new Chinese coronavirus infections. From Sunday to Monday, officials recorded 34 deaths from the virus. In response, Pakistan’s Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health Services, Dr. Zafar Mirza, urged people on Monday to heed the coronavirus prevention measures suggested by the government, such as social distancing, despite the lifting of official lockdown measures last week. “Otherwise, this crisis could turn into a huge tragedy,” he warned. Pakistan’s Supreme Court lifted the country’s remaining coronavirus lockdown measures on May 18, citing economic reasons and the claim that there “apparently is not a pandemic in Pakistan.” The order allowed larger businesses, such as shopping malls, to reopen. On May 20, train services were also allowed to resume operations. Prior to the decision, on May 9, Prime Minister Imran Khan eased restrictions on people’s movement meant to curb the spread of the virus, allowing smaller shops and markets to open. He also cited the negative impact of the shutdown on Pakistan’s economy as the main reason for reopening. First announced in late March, Khan’s lockdown was poorly enforced from the start. As the Islamic holy month of Ramadan began in late April, Islamic clerics – who command a high degree of power and influence in Pakistan – successfully petitioned Khan to ease restrictions on large gatherings at mosques, where Muslims congregate regularly during Ramadan for communal prayers and meals. Muslims were allowed to visit mosques if they followed certain precautions, such as physical distancing; mass gatherings were still discouraged. On May 19, without waiting for the approval of the national government, Pakistan’s most powerful Islamic clerics declared mosques throughout the country to be reopened for “five-time [a day] congregational prayers,” a bold move demonstrating the autonomy of Pakistan’s Islamic community. “We hope for cooperation from the government. The government should also announce lifting the ban on congregational prayers,” Mufti Usmani, a representative for Pakistan’s Islamic clerics, said in a statement at the time. Both decisions to lift Pakistan’s lockdown restrictions this month were made amid a steady rise in the number of new coronavirus cases throughout the country. Health officials had warned that lifting the lockdowns too soon could cause a surge in new cases. Observers noted that the lifting of lockdowns was timed to facilitate increased shopping and travel traditionally observed during the then-upcoming Eid al-Fitr festivities. Eid al-Fitr celebrates the end of the month-long religious holiday of Ramadan, a pious observance during which Muslims are expected to fast from dawn to dusk every day and perform additional nightly prayers on top of the usual five-a-day prayers required. To mark the end of this month of fasting, Muslims gather with their community at a mosque for the Eid prayer, which is often performed en masse. After the Eid prayer, Muslims often hold large gatherings in their home or community for family and friends, where people host festive meals and exchange gifts. With a focus on communal gathering, it comes as little surprise that the Eid al-Fitr holiday weekend led to a surge in new coronavirus cases. “As we promised when we eased the lockdown, if this trend [of new coronavirus cases] continues we may reimpose strict lockdowns after Eid,” Dr. Mirza said in statements to the press on Monday. Eid al-Fitr concluded on Sunday. “Unfortunately, there is now this thinking among us that this disease [Chinese coronavirus] was only here till Eid and that somehow it’ll disappear after Eid. This is a huge misunderstanding,” Dr. Mirza added. “I urge the nation to act with extreme responsibility to curb the spread of the virus. The cases are rising very fast and we need to be careful, more than ever,” he warned. At press time on Tuesday, Pakistan had recorded 57,705 infections and 1,197 deaths from the Chinese coronavirus. Pakistan’s health authorities believe the country’s true coronavirus numbers to be much higher due to deficient testing, which some regional authorities blame on the national government’s reluctance to test properly; others cite Pakistan’s struggling healthcare system, which lacks basic materials such as testing kits.

Michigan is now the only state among the 19 states with more than 900 COVID-19 deaths that is not reporting the number of those deaths that are from nursing homes. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, has failed to implement state level reporting on the number of COVID-19 deaths in the state from long term care facilities more than one month after local media reports first indicated the state of Michigan has a serious problem with COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes. That pattern of failing to report this key public health information continued on Tuesday when Gov. Whitmer refused to answer a reporter’s question about long term care facility reporting in the state. “Could you update us on the status of long term care facility reporting. I know we’re transitioning to a new process. Tell us what hasn’t been worked and what we can expect?” the reporter asked at the governor’s daily briefing. “You see me grabbing my mask, because I’m going to hand this over to Dr. J.,” Whitmer responded as she dodged the question and called the state’s Chief Medical Executive and Chief Deputy Director for Health for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services Dr. Joneigh Khaldun to the podium. Khaldun’s response was evasive and indefinite: So, great question. So if you go to our website now it will say we are currently updating it because what has occurred we are working with our long term care facilities to make sure we’re getting accurate infommation and that they understand what we’re actually asking them to report. What we found before is that every facility had a different interpretation of how to report so we wanted to fix that.ho In the mean time, CMS, at the federal level, has actually asked everyone in the country to report in a certain way, so now we’re aligning what we had previously asked our long term care facilities to do with the CMS guidance with the most accurate data when that’s available. Michigan Rising Action, a conservative political action committee, tweeted out the video of the governor dodging the question: VIDEO: @GovWhitmer Still Won’t Answer Why Michigan Isn’t Reporting COVID-19 Nursing Home Data pic.twitter.com/uhNKK7SiOJ — Michigan Rising Action (@MIRisingAction) May 26, 2020  As of Wednesday, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services website to which Dr. Khaldun referred still shows the following message, two days after it had originally promised to provide updated COVID-19 nursing home reporting: Michigan’s Long-Term Care data collection is undergoing a transition May 21 -25 as  MDHHS enhances its data collection process to improve accuracy, timeliness, and to align with new guidance from the federal Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Nursing facility data will be available once the transition period has ended and data appropriately validated. Gov. Whitmer’s failure to report COVID-19 nursing home deaths provides more reason for critics who already have faulted her COVID-19 nursing home policies for contributing to the crisis in those facilities. Even Democratic legislators have criticized Whitmer’s approach to nursing homes, as Click On Detroit reported earlier this month: Whitmer issued an executive order last month that requires seniors who are positive for COVID-19 to be brought to the TCF Center in Detroit or to “regional hubs,” which are nursing homes where the state says there has to be separation of the COVID-19 positive and negative patients. Rep. Leslie Love (R-Detroit) is critical of the practice. “To return seniors into an environment, seniors with the virus still recovering from the virus, into an environment with, well, seniors, just didn’t seem — it’s not a good idea,” Love said. Conservatives and Republicans have also criticized Whitmer for mismanaging nursing homes during the coronavirus pandemic. “The Whitmer administration has failed to release accurate nursing home data for months. We now know COVID-19 in nursing homes account for 42% of deaths nationwide yet Michigan still hasn’t released data or a thorough plan to protect the most vulnerable,” Tori Sachs, executive director of Michigan Rising Action, said on Tuesday. “Gov. Whitmer and the state’s Chief Medical Executive Joneigh Khaldun have both said they are following ‘facts,’ ‘science,’ and ‘data.’ How can Michiganders take that statement seriously if the state doesn’t have data on the most vulnerable population to COVID-19?” Sachs added. Two recent studies released last week, one from the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation and a second from the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity,  show that 42 percent of all COVID-19 deaths from 37 states that report this data are from nursing home residents. As Table 1 below indicates, Michigan is now one of only 13 states that are not reporting nursing home COVID-19 deaths, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, and it is the only state with more than 900 COVID-19 deaths that is failing to provide this critical public health information.   As far back as April 3, Bridge Michigan reported on the danger COVID-19 posed to the state’s nursing home residents: Roughly 10 to 12 Michigan nursing homes have reported COVID-19 cases, according to the Health Care Association of Michigan (HCAM), an industry group, though it declined to name them. The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services also could not provide precise numbers on the coronavirus. The department is “not currently tracking data on nursing home cases or nursing home workers,” spokeswoman Lynn Sutfin told Bridge on Wednesday. That has left residents, including families of nursing home residents, to rely on  homes themselves to self-report or follow news reports of COVID-19 outbreaks: approximately 20 at the Roseville home, 36 people at Metron in Cedar Springs in west Michigan, and so on. It was not until April 24 that the MDHHS began reporting the number of positive cases of COVID-19 at nursing homes, but it has failed to officially provide COVID-19 nursing home death data. A number of Michigan media outlets, however, have been able to obtain “partial” COVID-19 nursing home death data from MDHHS sources, but that data has been inconsistent and not officially confirmed. On April 23, Click on Detroit reported partial COVID-19 nursing home death data, apparently provided by public health officials at three of the hardest hit areas in the state: Macomb County, Oakland  County, and the city of Detroit: The city [of Detroit] is running tests in 21 of its 26 nursing homes, with 357 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 129 deaths. . . Oakland County has just over 200 nursing home and rehab facilities. So far, 127 have had positive cases — 1,038 people, including staff and residents, testing positive for COVID-19. There have been 146 coronavirus-related deaths. Macomb County has 77 long-term care facilities, and 46 of them have had COVID-19 cases. There have been 332 positive cases and 128 deaths. On May 9, for instance, the New York Times reported that only 5 percent of the state’s COVID-19 deaths at the time, or 211, were from nursing homes. Then on May 22, Michigan Public Radio reported 748 COVID-19 nursing home deaths according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, but that number, they acknowledged, was likely under reported. The percentage of COVID-19 deaths from nursing homes among the 37 states that currently report that data ranges from a low of 20 percent in New York to a high of 81 percent, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. Skepticism abounds on the quality of the reporting from some states–like New York–where the percentage is at the lower end of that range. The lack of any reporting to date from Michigan on the percentage of COVID-19 deaths from nursing homes does not engender confidence in the quality of the reporting that may emerge from the state at some point in the future.

Wednesday on CNN’s “Newsroom,” National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci said he wanted to be a “symbol” for Americans to wear face masks in public amid the coronavirus pandemic. Fauci said, “I think we should be recommending it. As you know, I wear it whenever I’m outside. We can try and keep the usual distance, but sometimes it is out of your control. So there are some fundamental things that we can do, we’re very aware of and sensitive to the need to try and make those steps towards reopening. But there are certain things that you can do and still do as you reopen. One is wearing a mask. The other is avoiding crowds of more than ten people, depending upon where you are and where the dynamics of the outbreak are. The other is continuing to wash your hands, which is important. And those kinds of things are simple. They’re easy to do. I think one can do that at the same time as you gradually try to get to the point of doing the reopening. I think those are the things that everybody should seriously consider doing.” Anchor Jim Sciutto asked, “Do you think when folks, members of the public are being asked to do this, and they look at folks like you doing it, does that encourage its use to a positive degree?” Fauci said, “No, it does, Jim. I wear it for the reason that I believe it is effective. It is not 100% effective. I mean, its sort of respect for the another person and have that other person respect you. You wear a mask. They wear a mask, you protect each other. I do it when I’m in the public for the reasons that, A, I want to protect myself and protect others. Also, because I want to make it be a symbol for people to see, that’s the kind of thing you should be doing.” He added, “When I walk around the street and the neighborhood where I live in Washington, D.C., which still has a considerable number of infections, it is very clear that many people are doing that.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Wednesday on NBC’s “Today,” Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) said President Donald Trump should “just stick with the facts, not opinions” in regards to the safety of mail-in voting amid the coronavirus pandemic. Anchor Savannah Guthrie asked, “The president tweeted about you and your plans to send mail-in ballots to registered voters in the state. What do you say to the president’s concerns about fraudulent ballots?” Newsom said, “Let’s just stick with the facts, not opinions. The reality is mail-in ballots are well utilized all across the spectrum, all across this country, and have been done so thoughtfully and safely for a generation. I think the president himself has used a mail-in ballot. In the past, our service members use them overseas very confidently and securely.” He added, “There’s been study after study — don’t take my word for it, don’t take the president’s — study after study that just lays claim to no evidence whatsoever that there’s widespread voter fraud. We want to prepare to keep people safe and allow them to have their constitutional rights protected, constitutional right to vote, without putting their health at risk.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

According to a recent report, local news stations across the United States have run news segments scripted and produced by e-commerce giant Amazon. Unsurprisingly, the segments were overly positive about Jeff Bezos’ company and its employment practices. Vice News reports that local news stations across the United States recently aired a segment that was produced and scripted by e-commerce giant Amazon praising the company’s role in delivering essential groceries and cleaning products during the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic, as well as highlighting that the company is “keeping its employees safe and healthy.” Vice reports that at least eleven local TV stations aired the segment which was introduced with a script written by Amazon and recited word for word by news anchors. The segments praise Amazon and its efforts during the pandemic despite reports that the firm is struggling to provide its workers with protective equipment, support the sellers on its platform, and cutting coronavirus pay increases to factory workers. The anchors in the segments introduce the script and then cut to an Amazon-produced exclusive look “inside” an Amazon fulfillment center which is narrated by Amazon spokesperson Todd Walker, who states: Millions of Americans staying at home are relying on amazon to deliver essentials like groceries and cleaning products during the COVID-19 outbreak. For the first time we’re getting a glimpse *inside* Amazon’s fulfillment centers to see just how the company is keeping its employees safe and healthy.. While delivering packages to your doorstep. Todd Walker takes us inside. A YouTube compilation shows the segment scripted by Amazon:  The segment further shows interviews with Amazon employees who praise the company and discuss their dedication to their job. One Amazon fulfillment center site leader, Marty Kuhl, states: “I was extremely proud of my team and the way they were handling the situation on a daily basis. Every day they came to work ready to embrace change.” 
 The footage inside the Amazon fulfillment center was sent to news stations as a press release along with instructions on how to best run the segment, which states: “Go inside one of the company’s fulfillment centers to see the unprecedented ways Amazon is using innovation to continue operating, including COVID-19 testing, disinfectant spraying and physical distancing.” Walker recently wrote on his LinkedIn page that he “got to dust off my reporting skills to give local markets their first look inside our fulfillment centers to see how Amazon is protecting the health and safety of its associates to continue delivering for you. News friends, the story is available to download in this link if you’d like to give your viewers inside access. I made a plug-and-play version, as well as one anchors and reporters can track themselves. It’s already been shared in markets from Los Angeles to Lexington.” Zach Rael, an anchor and reporter at ABC’s KOCO 5 News, recently tweeted out the script and “pre-edited” story that he said Amazon’s PR team emailed to him: Just got an email from Amazon’s PR team with a pre-edited news story and script to run in our shows. They are selling this as giving our viewers an “inside look” at the company’s response to COVID-19.  No. Let us go inside a fulfillment centers with our own cameras… pic.twitter.com/7mDk2xmf4O — Zach Rael (@KOCOZach) May 24, 2020  Alyssa Bronikowski, a spokesperson for Amazon, told Motherboard: “We welcome reporters into our buildings and it’s misleading to suggest otherwise. This type of video was created to share an inside look into the health and safety measures we’ve rolled out in our buildings and was intended for reporters who for a variety of reasons weren’t able to come tour one of our sites themselves.” Read more at Vice News here.

During the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, many health officials speculated a second wave as bad as the first would hit in the latter part of 2020 as the world waits for a vaccine. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of President Donald Trump’s Coronavirus Task Force, said there is a possibility of another wave, but said “it is not inevitable.” Fauci told “CNN Newsroom” co-host Jim Sciutto that a second wave is preventable with proper testing, isolation and contact tracing as the United States slowly reopens. “It’s getting better and better, Jim,” Fauci advised. “I’m feeling better about it as we go by with the weeks that go by, and we see that we’re getting more and more capability of testing. The CDC is putting more of a workforce out there to help us do the kinds of identification, isolation and contact tracing. I feel better and better that we’re capable of doing that.” He continued, “[W]e often talk about the possibility of a second wave, or of an outbreak when you’re reopening. We don’t have to accept that as an inevitability. Particularly when people start thinking about the fall, I want people to really appreciate that it could happen, but it is not inevitable. If we do the kinds of things that we’re putting in place now, to have the workforce, the system, and the will to do the kinds of things that are the clear and effective identification, isolation and contact tracing, we can prevent this second wave that we’re talking about. If we do it correctly.” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent

China’s National People’s Congress (NPC), one of its two communist legislative chambers, proposed drafting a sovereign immunity law on Wednesday to allow Chinese people to sue the American state in courts, an act of revenge for mounting litigation against China. Lawyers around the world – in states as far from each other as Italy, Nigeria, Turkey, and India – have brought lawsuits against the Communist Party and the state of China for silencing doctors early on in the pandemic who had identified a contagious respiratory disease. The lawsuits also accuse China of pressuring foreign states not to impose travel restrictions on Chinese nationals and of pressuring global agencies like the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) to downplay the severity of the outbreak. In the United States, the states of Missouri and Mississippi have sued the Communist Party for the damage caused by the Chinese coronavirus. Lawyers have brought lawsuits against China in states like Texas, New York, and Florida. America’s Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) prevents individuals from bringing lawsuits against foreign state entities in U.S. courts. Congress can override this limitation through legislation exempting certain states in certain circumstances. Several lawmakers – prominently Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Rep. Lance Gooden (R-TX) – have backed a law that would disable sovereign immunity provisions to allow lawsuits against China for damage related to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. Similar legislation exists in China, which is why Communist Party media reported on Wednesday that the NPC is attempting to carve an exemption out of that law for lawsuits against “other countries.” The Chinese lawmaker leading the charge, Ma Yide, told the state propaganda outlet Global Times that the law would “ensure Chinese citizens’ and companies’ rights to sue the US over its blame game and cover-up of information during the pandemic.” Ma said that Chinese citizens should have a right to sue the United States citing an unsubstantiated Chinese Foreign Ministry conspiracy theory that the U.S. Army is responsible for the ongoing pandemic. “Many believe that U.S. soldiers brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Others believe that the U.S. has hidden key information, which led to the global health crisis. Why can’t Chinese citizens and companies sue the U.S. government?” Ma asked the Global Times. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian accused the U.S. Army in March of releasing the pathogen and causing the pandemic, not offering an explanation for how that could be possible when there is no evidence the virus existed anywhere prior to its discovery in Wuhan, central China. Chinese state propaganda later added as an explanation that American soldiers could have brought the virus to Wuhan during October’s Military World Games, hosted by that city. China was disqualified from the games despite being the host for “extensive cheating.” There is also no evidence of any coronavirus infection related to the Military World Games. The American servicewoman accused of infecting Wuhan, Maatje Benassi, told CNN in an interview that the Chinese government’s false claims have resulted in a “nightmare” situation of incessant harassment from emboldened Chinese nationalists. As this conspiracy theory has also largely failed to convince the world, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying also speculated that the virus existed throughout last year in the United States and was disguised as e-cigarette, or vaping disease. Hua did not account for the fact that none of the cases of respiratory illness related to vaping were contagious; the Chinese coronavirus is believed to spread very rapidly. Coverage of the NPC sovereign immunity exception indicates that, should it pass, Chinese citizens could use these theories to demand redress from the U.S. government. The Global Times claimed that some lawsuits are already surfacing. Liang Xuguang, a lawyer based in Wuhan, has filed a lawsuit against U.S. government agencies over the suspected intentional spread of misinformation over COVID-19 [the Chinese coronavirus]. Liang urged the U.S. to publicize the number of ‘influenza deaths’ that were caused by the novel coronavirus,” the state propaganda outlet reported. The Times blamed the United States for spearheading “abusive” lawsuits against China linked to the pandemic around the world, but only named the United States among those entertaining the lawsuits. In reality, courts around the world have allowed lawsuits against the Chinese state or Communist Party in relation to China’s negligence in containing the virus. Among the evidence cited in many of these lawsuits is the fact that China destroyed early samples of the virus from Wuhan, detained doctors and others sharing safety information on contagious diseases on social media, and reports that dictator Xi Jinping personally urged W.H.O. head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to downplay how contagious the virus is. Among the nations that have seen lawsuits against China are Egypt, Turkey, Italy, Nigeria, and India, totally in the trillions of dollars in damages sought. In the United States, the states of Missouri and Mississippi have sued China officially. Missouri’s attorney general sued the Communist Party in an attempt to avoid sovereign immunity barriers, arguing that the party is a corporate entity separate from the state of China. Lawyers in Florida, New York, and Texas have also filed lawsuits. Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.  

Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak announced Tuesday night the state’s casinos will be allowed to reopen next Thursday after more than two months of being shut down due to the coronavirus pandemic. Sisolak highlighted “positive trends” in the state’s data regarding the coronavirus and insisted he would work with the Gaming Control Board to ensure safety conditions are met in casinos. “We continue to see a consistent and sustainable downward trajectory of percentage of positive COVID-19 cases and a decrease in the trend of COVID-19 hospitalizations,” Sisolak said. “The Board was briefed on how these various entities have worked with the gaming industry to ensure that there is a comprehensive plan in place to respond to and mitigate the effects of positive cases of COVID-19 that present themselves in the State’s resort corridors,” Sisolak added. Sisolak also stated it was “critical” to guard the health and safety of employees, residents, and visitors first. “It is critical to put the health and safety of employees, residents and visitors first through proactive measures, coupled with the Health and Safety Policies issued by the Gaming Control Board,” Sisolak said. “This is what will help ensure that Nevada can safely reopen its gaming industry on June 4.” In his remarks, Sisolak recommended customers wear face masks or coverings “like a badge of honor.” “As always, I encourage Nevadans to stay vigilant and protect themselves against this virus,” Sisolak stated. “Our goal is to prevent a surge in cases that our health care system cannot handle. We cannot do this without each of you accepting the personal responsibility to follow the social distancing guidelines in professional and personal decisions.” With casinos set to reopen in Nevada, the state will receive a much needed economic boost. Last month, Nevada had the highest unemployment rate of any state in the country, with 28.2 percent of residents jobless. That is almost more than double the national unemployment average of 14.7 percent. According to the Center for Gaming Research, 24 casinos located on the Las Vegas strip earned over $72 million in fiscal year 2017. In addition to announcing that casinos could reopen next week, Sisolak also said religious gatherings of up to 50 people could begin on Friday and gyms, shopping malls, theaters, and bars could open with restrictions.

New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D) bought jewelry in April from a non-essential business which had been closed by her own lockdown order, according to a local report. KRQE News reports: KRQE News 13 has learned in April, when she ordered non-essential businesses to shut down and lectured all New Mexicans to stay home, a non-essential business opened up so she could buy jewelry and have it delivered to her. … [J]ust days after the April 3rd news conference and a week before Easter, KRQE News 13 has learned that Gov. Lujan Grisham called an employee at Lilly Barrack on Paseo to buy expensive jewelry. The jewelry was bought over the phone, but the employee went to the store, got the jewelry and placed it outside the door of the store where someone who knew the governor picked it up. This is according to the person who runs Lilly Barrack stores. She says she didn’t know about it until after it happened. She also said no one was allowed in the stores at that time due to the public health order. In a statement to KRQE News 13, a spokesperson for Lujan Grisham provided a different version of events described above: “Lujan Grisham did call an employee, saying they had a longstanding personal relationship. The employee came here [Lilly Barrack], got the jewelry and took it home, left it outside their home and then someone came and picked it up.” On April 30, Lujan Grisham extended her state’s stay-at-home order to May 15 but eased restrictions, allowing non-essential retailers, state parks, and golf courses to operate with strict guidelines. The report comes after Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s (D) husband is said to have urged a dock company to place his boat in the water ahead of Memorial Day weekend, despite pandemic guidelines. Detroit News reported: The owner of a Northern Michigan dock company says Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s husband wanted his boat placed in the water before the Memorial Day weekend as Whitmer urged residents not to rush to the region. No longer visible to the public, Facebook posts from NorthShore Dock LLC and its owner, Tad Dowker, focused on what Dowker said was a request last week by Whitmer’s husband, Marc Mallory. The posts have drawn the attention of Republican state lawmakers, who said the Democratic governor’s family may not be following her guidance for the rest of the state. Whitmer’s spokeswoman, Tiffany Brown, didn’t confirm or deny Monday the assertions by the marina company or its owner. Brown said the administration wouldn’t address “every rumor that is spread online.” In a Tuesday press conference, Whitmer attempted to blame her husband’s “failed attempt at humor” for the reported request. “Knowing it wouldn’t make a difference, he jokingly asked if being married to me might move him up in the queue,” the Michigan governor said. “Obviously with the motorized boating prohibition in our early days of COVID-19, he thought it might get a laugh. It didn’t.” Earlier May, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) admitted his wife recently traveled to their South Florida estate despite the state’s stay-at-home order. “My wife and daughter were down in Florida in early March and, in fact even a little before that, and you know, they sheltered in place when the stay-at-home order came up,” he said at the time.

As the country grapples with the coronavirus pandemic, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has proceeded with a change to House rules that will allow for so-called proxy voting by members, a move opposed by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA). Such a move would allow for votes to take place without some members of Congress being physically present. However, according to McCarthy, the effort is unconstitutional and being instituted by Pelosi to ensure she maintains a stranglehold on power. “This is endangering the Constitution to ensure Pelosi has more power,” McCarthy said on Wednesday’s broadcast of Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends.” “Look, our Constitution, our country expects us to convene. For 231 years, that’s what Congress has done — from the yellow fever of 17 — in the 1700s, to the Civil War, to the burning of a building during the — in the 1900s. Then you had Spanish flu. You had the 9/11 — we still convened.” “But all this does is empower Pelosi more,” he continued. “Sixty-three Democrats will not show up for work today but still be paid. You cannot read the Constitution without clearly seeing that our founders believed we should meet together, from Article 1, section four, five, or six. There is no way to read the Constitution any other way. The only reason the Democrats are doing this, it empowers Pelosi to even be stronger. Watch what she was able to do just a couple of weeks ago — passed $3 trillion with never going through a committee, no one seeing the bill. She wrote it herself and brought it to the floor. The largest bill ever in the history of the United States.” McCarthy acknowledged Democrats in charge of the U.S. House of Representatives could make rule changes, but such changes had to be within the parameters of the Constitution. “Congress can make any rule, but they cannot — they cannot go against the Constitution,” he explained. “If that is true, then Congress can make a rule that only women can vote, that only California can vote, that Republican votes only count half a percent. They cannot do something unconstitutional. That’s why what they are doing has not been done in 231 years.” “When the — when the Capitol was burnt down during the War of 1812, when we had the Spanish flu in 1918, when we had 9/11 we still were able to convene,” McCarthy added. “We are going to space today, we are opening up California, but 63 Democrats are not coming to work, and they’re still being paid. They were able to come to work a couple of weeks ago but now they can’t. Why? Because it empowers Nancy Pelosi to have all the power. Only 20 members can hold all the proxies to be able to pass bills they want on the floor — unheard of. And it is not what the founders believed this country should do.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor

The Oakland Athletics are placing their scouts and a significant number of other front office employees on furlough, suspending pay for minor leaguers and cutting the salaries of other executives as part of a cost-cutting move in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. A’s owner John Fisher announced the moves Tuesday in a rare public statement on what he called a “tremendously difficult day.” “Baseball is more than a job — it is a way of life,” Fisher wrote in a letter to fans and staff. “People who work for our team are our family — our very foundation — and they work tirelessly to help the A’s compete in this most precious game. COVID-19 has brought a tragic loss of life and sickness to so many in our community, and it has impacted us all in ways we could have never imagined. Our organization, like so many others across the country, has had to make tough and painful decisions.” The furloughs for the scouts and other front office personnel will begin next week, although the team’s amateur scouts are expected to stay on through the draft on June 10-11. Minor leaguers will stop receiving $400 weekly stipdends next week. The A’s will continue to pay the health care, 401k and pension costs for their employees.
The team also will cut pay for all front office employees making more than $60,000, with the biggest cuts coming to the highest-paid employees. “I know that many of you will wonder why the A’s are cutting costs now,” Fisher wrote. “Nobody knows how this pandemic will evolve over the long term. What is clear is that our revenues will be dramatically reduced this year. None of this diminishes the pain of today’s actions, but it is an honest acknowledgement of the circumstances of the moment.” Fisher, whose family founded the clothing retailer the Gap, is worth more than $2 billion, according to Forbes. The Los Angeles Dodgers are reducing pay for team employees who make over $75,000 because of the coronavirus pandemic. A team spokesman confirmed multiple media reports that said cuts range from 15% to 35% on salaries above $75,000. There will be no cuts for employees making less than that. “This plan allows us to avoid organization-wide furloughs and to preserve hundreds of jobs,” the team said later in a statement. “Over the last several weeks, we have considered every way to better withstand the challenges presented by the virus. Today — while we remain very hopeful that there will be a 2020 season — we are implementing a number of measures to reduce our costs. We remain ready to play as soon as that becomes feasible.” The baseball season has been put on hold since March because of the coronavirus pandemic. Owners and players are in negotiations about playing an abbreviated 82-game schedule, likely without fans.

Cases of online sexual abuse of children in the Philippines have risen by as much as 260 percent since the country’s coronavirus lockdown measures were imposed in March, Philippine news outlet Coconuts Manila reported on Tuesday. The Philippines Department of Justice [DOJ] announced the alarming statistic on Monday, citing data from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children [NCMEC], a non-profit organization. From March 1 to May 24, The NCMEC reported a total of 279,166 child abuse cases to the DOJ, compared to 76,561 cases for the same period in 2019. According to the report, the majority of child abuse cases reported to the DOJ included “possession, manufacture, and distribution of child porn; enticing kids to perform sexual acts online; trafficking minors for sex; and sexual molestation.” In a statement, the DOJ attributed the increase in cases to the Philippines’ stringent coronavirus lockdown measures: “[A] strict home quarantine is observed in all households, and internet usage surges as people stay home.” Out of the thousands of cases, just 22 have been referred to the National Bureau of Investigation, according to the report. The DOJ said this was due, in part, to the referral of some cases to the Philippine National Police. So far, authorities have arrested ten people in connection with the reported cases and have detained seven suspects, according to Coconuts Manila. State authorities rescued 34 minors in response to the reports. Two cases connected to the reports are currently on federal trial in the Philippines. Other cases have been filed in the prosecutors’ offices of four different cities: Butuan, Taguig, Caloocan, and Angeles City. DOJ Undersecretary Markk Perete said that the high number of cases may be due to “misreporting,” explaining that there were “identical materials reported by many people” as well as people reporting nude photos of children which were posted by relatives to social media “in good faith.” He also said there had been “inaccurate reports forwarded by internet service providers.” In a statement, the DOJ said that Philippine internet service providers [ISPs] should install technologies to prevent pedophiles from accessing webpages advertising child pornography. It is unfortunate that eleven years after the law that prohibits any form of child pornography was passed, the ISPs have continued to be remiss of [their] duty to install blocking or filtering technology that would have greatly reduced the amount of time necessary to identify perpetrators and victims. Last week, the International Justice Mission, a non-profit organization combating the sexual abuse of minors, published a seven-year study that found that “endemic poverty” was responsible for making the Philippines a “global hotspot” for child abuse and pornography.

Ian Blackford, leader of the left-separatist Scottish National Party (SNP) contingent in the British parliament, made a journey of over 600 miles from London to the Isle of Skye during lockdown. Blackford, a wealthy former investment banker from Edinburgh, has been relentless in his calls for Dominic Cummings, Boris’s Johnson’s chief adviser and a key figure in the Vote Leave campaign during the EU referendum, to be sacked for travelling to his family farm in Durham during the coronavirus lockdown. Cummings has contended that he was within his rights to do so given the rules allow for travel to meet particular childcare needs, which he believes he had. He has received the backing of the Attorney-General and — so far — the Prime Minister. Blackford, who perhaps not coincidentally is a staunch EU loyalist bitterly opposed to Brexit, has been pressuring the Prime Minister to withdraw this support from Mr Cummings, claiming it is “One rule for them and another for the rest of us” — but he himself made a journey of well over 600 miles from London to his Skye estate in his home constituency after the lockdown was announced; far further than Cummings travelled. Returned to Skye from Westminster but into isolation as a precaution away from Ann and everyone else given the prevalence of the virus in London. The right thing to do but hard not seeing Ann. #StayHomeSaveLives — Ian Blackford (@Ianblackford_MP) March 26, 2020  Blackford made the journey after the lockdown was announced despite the fact that, like most MPs, he has a home in London, claiming a remarkable £22,775.73 from the taxpayer in accommodation rent and Council Tax costs in 2018-19, and his own repeated calls from people not to travel from coronavirus epicentres like London to remote and sparsely populated areas like Skye, where acute healthcare infrastructure is weak. His defenders have argued that he was within his rights, under the rules, to travel to his primary residence in his home constituency after the parliamentary recess was announced — even though he did not need to do so — and that MPs have additional leeway to travel as so-called “key workers”. His detractors, however, argue that Cummings also believes his movements were permissible under the rules, and that Blackford therefore has no moral high ground to demand Cummings’ termination for leaving London when he did the same thing. Remainer Tory Who Resigned Over Cummings Made Even Longer Cross-Country Trip as Home Internet Too Slow https://t.co/llotQLpB7l — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 27, 2020  It is true that Blackford was by no means the only MP to have travelled to their home constituency from London during the lockdown — another was Douglas Ross, the Tory Remainer who travelled to his home constituency and back again due to its merely “adequate” Internet services. Ross has, somewhat inexplicably, now resigned from his junior government position over Cummings’ movements, despite the fact they were less extensive than his own.

Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has denied breaking the lockdown rules after he was pictured attending a topless barbeque in a sunny Dublin park with his partner and two other friends. On Monday, a spokesman said that that the Europhile Irish leader “broke no laws, breached no regulations and observed public health guidance” while gathering in Phoenix Park on Sunday. “The Taoiseach [Prime Minister] was in the Phoenix Park with his partner Matt and two friends on Sunday afternoon, in line with public health guidance,” the spokesperson added. The denial of any wrongdoing came after images were circulated on social media of Mr Varadkar, his partner Matthew Barrett, and two other friends lounging while having a barbeque in public, according to the Irish Independent. The gathering did, however, appear to contradict the advice that was given by the assistant secretary of the Department of the Taoiseach, Liz Caravan, who said last week that: “If you’re visiting a public amenity try not to stay too long at the site or have picnics. Please do your exercise and then go home.” Despite Mr Varadkar apparently breaking the national lockdown rules that he imposed upon Irish citizens, there has been comparatively little backlash in the mainstream media, particularly when viewed alongside the media storm surrounding UK political advisor Dominic Cummings. Farage: Remainers Want Cummings out as Excuse to Delay Brexit https://t.co/PG6ERzdWCC — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 26, 2020  Brendan O’Neill, a columnist for Spiked Online observed while discussing the differential noted that he was not particularly bothered by either supposed scandal, but asserted that the double standard in media coverage of the two incidents was a result of the different political positions the two men hold. While Varadkar has enjoyed prominence and favourable over to his position as a media darling as the anti-Brexit, first openly homosexual PM of the Republic of Ireland, Mr Cummings has long been a target for the media establishment for his role in the Vote Leave campaign in 2016, which helped secure the Brexit referendum. “They loathe him [Dominic Cummings], and their weird, obsessive, creepy focus on where he went during lockdown is transparently an extension of that loathing,” O’Neill wrote. “It’s so clear now that the Cummings fuss has nothing to do with car journeys, Durham, Barnard Castle or any of the other crap,” he added. O’Neil said that the disparity is a form of “Remoaner Revenge”, saying that is the reason why “Varadkar is forgiven for having a shirtless picnic while Cummings is demonised for driving north to protect his wife and child from media intrusion”. “How about this: we forgive them both and move the hell on,” O’Neill suggested.

ROME — The overwhelming majority of deaths with coronavirus in Italy have occurred in the presence of two or more serious chronic illnesses, according to a report from the country’s national health authority (ISS). Italian health authorities announced in a recent report that only 4.1 percent of fatalities testing positive for Wuhan coronavirus happened in the absence of serious comorbidities, while the average age of the deceased was over 80 years. The average number of comorbidities among all Italian deaths with the coronavirus was 3.1, ISS revealed. Just 15 percent of fatalities occurred with the presence of just one other serious pathology, while 21.4 percent died with two other pathologies, and 59.6 percent with three or more pathologies. The most common comorbidities were arterial hypertension (in 68.3 percent of cases), type-2 diabetes (30.1 percent of cases), ischemic heart disease (in 28.2 percent), atrial fibrillation (22.5 percent), chronic renal failure (20.4 percent). Most common comorbidities among Italy deaths with coronavirus. The report also revealed an average age of 81 among those who have died with coronavirus in Italy. One of the most astonishing findings of the report was that only 1.1 percent of all coronavirus deaths in the country happened to people below the age of 50, while more than 57 percent were over 80. “The latest numbers show that new cases and fatalities have a common profile: mostly elderly people with previous illnesses,” said ISS president Silvio Brusaferro at a news conference Friday. As of May 26, the number of active cases of coronavirus in Italy had fallen to 52,942. The total number of deaths with the disease have been 32,955, while total recorded cases stands at 230,555. This week Spain had to revise down its official death count for the coronavirus by nearly 2,000 after discovering a series of reporting errors and duplications. The Spanish Health Ministry announced Monday that it removed 1,918 spurious deaths from the official death toll, representing a seven percent drop in the total deaths reported.

Deaths have soared among the homeless population in San Francisco during the coronavirus, but not due to the virus directly. The San Francisco Chronicle reported Tuesday: “Forty-eight homeless people — an average of six per week — died in San Francisco between March 30 and May 24, according to Dr. Barry Zevin, director of the Department of Public Health’s Street Medicine Team. For comparison, 14 people died in the same time period last year.” The causes, pending official confirmation, may have more to do with the lockdown than the coronavirus itself, as many homeless people had less access to medical services and other needs. An even more important factor may simply have been drug overdoses, as there was an “explosion of fentanyl on San Francisco’s streets” over the past two years, the Chronicle notes. San Francisco, like other cities in California, initially sought to move homeless people indoors to avoid the coronavirus. But as evidence emerged that the virus was more easily spread among people sharing space indoors, the city began encouraging people to stay outside, where they could practice “social distancing” more easily. The Chronicle notes: “The number of tents and makeshift structures throughout the Tenderloin neighborhood exploded by 285% between January and May, according to city data. The city as a whole saw a 71% increase in tents and structures during that period.” In Los Angeles, officials recently reversed a policy of moving homeless people indoors to recreation centers in residential areas. The policy had faced local opposition, especially as it appeared to conflict with guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. San Francisco also opened its first officially-sanctioned homeless camp near City Hall earlier this week, with tents spaced widely. Joel B.

Swedish climate worrier Greta Thunberg restarted her global campaign against all manner of “climate sins” on Wednesday by lashing the Danish capital Copenhagen for channeling waste water overflow into the sea. According to AP, for the last six years the city has pumped large amounts of waste water into the seaway separating Sweden and Denmark during heavy rains. Since 2014, some 9.1 billion gallons of unfiltered sewer water has drained into the Oresund Strait during storms because Danish treatment plants simply could not handle the demand for treatment, according to Danish media citing the Danish Environmental Protection Agency. The city had planned to allow the Greater Copenhagen Utility HOFOR to flush 10 million cubic feet of unfiltered waste water into Oresund starting Sunday however that has been postponed until October, the London Times reports. This emergency measure, in a city of 602,481 which was designated the European Green Capital in 2014, has drawn a response by Thunberg: Denmark were about to dump 290mn liters of unfiltered toilet water into the Baltic Sea.Turns out Copenhagen has dumped over 35bn litres of such water straight into Öresund, since 2014. Yes, the same Copenhagen who claim they'll be "climate neutral" 2025.https://t.co/cbdY3yac59 — Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) May 27, 2020  Thunberg said on Facebook these actions are coming from “the same Copenhagen who claim they’ll be climate neutral by 2025,” doubtless a disappointment to her and her supporters who see global climate action as a necessity for the survival of the planet: Thunberg’s return to castigating the world for climate errors both real and perceived comes after an admission in March it’s “extremely likely” she contracted the Chinese coronavirus but subsequently “basically recovered” from it, as Breitbart News reported. The 17-year-old said she and father exhibited coronavirus-like symptoms at the time and chose to self-quarantine for two weeks following a trip through western Europe. Thunberg has urged other climate activists to opt for online protests — instead of large, public demonstrations — to combat the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. AP contributed to this story

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for an independent investigation into the origins of coronavirus, after reports that communist China misled the international community over the infectious nature of the Wuhan-origin virus. Mr Johnson made the demand while speaking to Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Tuesday, with the World Health Organization (WHO) director-general saying that he was in agreement, according to a Number 10 spokesman. “The prime minister and Dr Tedros agreed on the importance of an independent investigation into the origins of the coronavirus outbreak, so we can learn lessons to prevent future pandemics,” the spokesman said in comments reported by the Evening Standard. The WHO’s agreement to back the formal investigation perhaps came as a result of the President of the United States of America, Donald Trump, warning that the U.S. would pull financial support from the organisation unless it committed to “major substantive improvements within the next 30 days”. President Trump had called the WHO a “puppet of China” which had failed to handle the coronavirus pandemic. President Trump is entirely clear, however, of who is responsible for the deadly coronavirus that first appeared in the Chinese city of Wuhan last year. He said last week that the communist nation was guilty of “mass worldwide killing” through its “incompetence”. EU Stands in ‘Solidarity’ With China-Backing World Health Organization https://t.co/BMFGO3kdu7 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 20, 2020  In April, the British think tank the Henry Jackson Society said that Western nations should sue China if the communist country were found liable for allowing the deadly respiratory virus to spread around the world and for intentionally withholding information from the international community. The think tank’s report had found that China had provided the WHO with “erroneous information” in early January and allowed millions of people to leave Wuhan before locking it down, despite knowing of human-to-human transmission. This month, a leaked intelligence report by the Five Eyes — Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK, and the USA — found that the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had destroyed evidence on the outbreak of its virus, a result of which caused the “endangerment of other countries”. The dossier also revealed that the CCP “disappeared” whistle-blowing doctors and aggressively censored phrases such as “Wuhan Unknown Pneumonia”, “SARS variation”, and “Wuhan Seafood Market”, the latter related to the ‘wet’ live animal food market where the virus is suspected of having originated. “Despite evidence of human-human transmission from early December, PRC [People’s Republic of China] authorities deny it until January 20th,” the report stated. “The World Health Organization does the same. Yet officials in Taiwan raised concerns as early as December 31st, as did experts in Hong Kong on January 4th,” it added.

A poll revealed that the vast majority of Hungarians, 78 per cent, say they believe Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s Wuhan coronavirus response was better than other European countries. The nationwide telephone survey, which involved 1,000 participants, revealed that only five per cent of Hungarians thought that other European countries did a better job at stopping the spread of the Chinese virus. A total of 75 per cent said they were very or moderately satisfied with the government response overall, with just nine per cent said the measures undertaken by Prime Minister Orbán were excessive, newspaper Magyar Hírlap reported on Tuesday. Three-quarters of Hungarians say that the government acted in a timely manner in response to the outbreak opposed to 13 per cent who said the government did not act quickly enough. The Hungarian response to the coronavirus, which saw Orbán and his government enact emergency measures, was widely criticised by leftists, liberals, and the establishment media. Members of the European People’s Party, a European parliamentary group of which Orbán’s party Fidesz is a member, went as far as to demand Fidesz be kicked out of the group over the measures. Hungary’s Orban Prepares to Give Up Coronavirus Powers, Ready to Accept Apologies for ‘Dictator’ Accusations https://t.co/8kyhTEHPjf — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 16, 2020  “The fight against COVID-19 requires extensive measures, however, the virus cannot be used as a pretext to extend the state of emergency indefinitely. We fear that Prime Minister Orbán will use his newly achieved power to further extend the government’s grip on civil society,” members of the group said. Former United States UN ambassador Susan Rice went even further and called for Hungary to be kicked out of the European Union itself. Earlier this month, while many other European countries are still under emergency measures, Prime Minister Orbán announced that the emergency powers to fight coronavirus would end by the end of May. A bill to rescind power back to parliament was introduced on Tuesday after a cabinet meeting the day before which discussed details of ending the emergency powers period. Justice Minister Judit Varga commented on the opposition to Hungary’s coronavirus strategy, saying: “Instead of giving support… the opposition mounted an unprecedented disinformation campaign, together with the mainstream liberal media, in Hungary and internationally.”

Douglas Ross, the little-known former government minister who resigned from his junior position over Dominic Cummings’ movements during lockdown, made an even longer cross-country trip to London — because his home Internet was “adequate at best”. Mr Cummings, a key figure in the Vote Leave campaign during the EU referendum and widely despised by the mainstream media, left his London home for his family’s farm in Durham while his wife was ill with the coronavirus, because he feared no-one would be able to look after their young son if he also became sick — although he did not come in contact with his parents while he was there, staying in a separate building, even staying away from his uncle’s funeral. He contends that his movements were allowable within the lockdown rules, which make special provisions for people with particular childcare needs. Douglas Ross, on the other hand, made his journey of several hundred miles from rural Moray, in the Scottish Highlands, back to London because his home Internet connection was “adequate at best”. The Tory MP, who indicated that he was backing Remain in 2016 and backed Remainer leadership contender Mark Harper before Boris Johnson in 2019, resigned from his junior ministerial position in the Scotland Office, claiming Cummings’ interpretation of the rules was “not shared by the vast majority”. Today I’ve returned to London for the first time since restrictions were introduced and I’ve written this open letter to Moray residents to explain why. I don’t want to do anything to jeopardise the safety of my family or anyone in Moray so will take all the necessary precautions pic.twitter.com/3BrB89p3WK — Douglas Ross MP (@Douglas4Moray) May 18, 2020  Mr Ross made the long journey from northern Scotland to southern England after having managed in his home constituency for some eight weeks, claiming that, for him “home working has been successful to a point, but living in a rural part of Moray, my connection to the internet has been adequate at best.” He also complained of two occasions when his WiFi failed during a virtual Select Committee session, and some of his contributions having “broken audio”. Ross also said he was “required to take a small piece of legislation through the House of Commons” and answer parliamentary questions on behalf of the Scotland Office, claiming that, while arrangements have been put in place for parliamentarians to perform their roles remotely, the Speaker preferred that he was “physically in the House of Commons”. Politicians are, as “key workers”, permitted to travel during lockdown, although members of the public may question whether those who have travelled to and from London have the moral high ground to call for Mr Cummings’ head for doing the same thing. There is speculation that the particular ferociousness of the media and Remain-voting politicians in their pursuit of Cummings may have something to do with the fact that, on recovering from the coronavirus, he squashed a plan to extend the ongoing Brexit “transition period” — in which Britain remains an EU member in all but name — which had been “all but agreed at official level” while he and Prime Minister Johnson were out of action.

Charlene Doak-Gebauer, author and expert on digital safety for children and families, said that during the coronavirus outbreak, children who are sequestered inside homes and using devices more than usual are at higher risk for exposure to pornography and online predators. “Children are being given too much ownership for their decisions, particularly online,” Doak-Gebauer said in a report published on the EIN Presswire website. “An eight-year old has little choice as to what to have for dinner, and yet they are supposed to make the right choices while communicating online.”  “They lack the life skills and maturity to do so effectively,” Doak-Gebauer said. “We have to supervise on digital devices.” EIN Presswire reported on what Doak-Gebauer said about online safety: The Internet has provided a “virtual buffet” for predation, by unknowns, but also peers and “peer victimizers.” Peer victimizers are the fastest growing group of predators, and can be the most damaging. Too often children have sent nudes in confidence to a “friend,” only to find their pictures have been broadcast throughout a school and a community. This causes anxiety, depression, suicide, and other emotions.  “With today’s apps and digital devices, one nude picture in a school of 1,000 can circulate within minutes, less than an hour,” says Doak-Gebauer. “We are all fearful of COVID but we have to remember our children online. Police have warned they are listening to the chatter among predators. Predators are bragging about how easy it is to access their prey online – our children.” Therapists are seeing children as young as six years old who have pornography addiction issues. The pandemic crisis and the possible long-term effects of online negative experiences, has given Doak-Gebauer an even greater determination to help parents and caregivers in their challenges to protect children online.  Doak-Gebauer said her “theory of digital supervision is necessary for online child and family protection,” according to her website. She has written several books on the subject. “Too many adults are unaware their family is affected because of the sophistication of predators on the Internet with their children,” Doak-Gebauer said.

Tuesday on CNN, host Anderson Cooper criticized President Donald Trump for his messaging on masks and his tweets about MSNBC host Joe Scarborough. Cooper said, “Leadership today also apparently consists of spreading vile conspiracy theories on Twitter about a former staffer for then-Congressman Joe Scarborough and doing it over and over again. Traumatizing her family and her husband so deeply that he begged the company to take down the president’s tweets because they’re not true about his wife.” After playing a clip of Trump defending his Tweets at a press conference earlier, Cooper said, “What a little man. He’s just a little man. He’s the leader of the free world, and he is a little, little man. A self-proclaimed wartime leader — a leader in the midst, he says, of a transition to greatness for the country, spreading falsehoods about a dead woman, despite the pain and the pleas of her husband and family and doesn’t have the guts to say he doesn’t care about what they think. No, no, he doesn’t have the guts to say, ‘You know what, I don’t care what they think because this serves my political purposes.’ That’s why he’s doing it. He doesn’t have the guts to say that because he is just a little man despite his girth and size. He’s a little man inside, and he knows that. That, too, is now what leadership looks like. The president of the United States raising conspiracy theories about a dead woman, though her family is begging Twitter to take them down.” He added, “That’s where we are. In the midst of a pandemic, this is what we’re talking about, is what the president is talking about every single day. You think it’s normal. You start to think this is just normal. It’s not. Man, we are in trouble.” Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Democrat Charlotte City Councilman Larken Egleston said Monday there was “no way” the GOP convention scheduled to take place August 24 could go on as planned due to the coronavirus. “There’s no way for the governor at this point to say he could have an arena full of people or that Charlotte could have 50,000 people coming into town for any event. And frankly, I think the only thing you can say definitively is that wouldn’t be responsible three months from now,” Egleston said in an appearance on CNN’s New Day. “Mar-a-Lago might be willing to host the convention that has no safety precautions in place, but Charlotte, North Carolina, is not,” says Charlotte councilman Larken Egleston​ about President Trump threatening to pull GOP convention from the city.https://t.co/WUDk3Nt69U pic.twitter.com/uYnnXhKBKa — New Day (@NewDay) May 26, 2020  “So if we’re going to host this convention, it’s going to have to look very different than we thought it was going to, and the president should acknowledge that,” he added. President Donald Trump threatened to pull the GOP convention from Charlotte if North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper could not promise it could go on as planned. “Unfortunately, Democrat Governor Roy Cooper is still in Shutdown mood and unable to guarantee that by August we will be allowed full attendance in the arena … Plans are being made by many thousands of enthusiastic Republicans, and others, to head to beautiful North Carolina in August,” Trump wrote on Twitter. I love the Great State of North Carolina, so much so that I insisted on having the Republican National Convention in Charlotte at the end of August. Unfortunately, Democrat Governor, @RoyCooperNC is still in Shutdown mood & unable to guarantee that by August we will be allowed… — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 25, 2020  …full attendance in the Arena. In other words, we would be spending  millions of dollars building the Arena to a very high standard without even knowing if the Democrat Governor would allow the Republican Party to fully occupy the space. Plans are being…. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 25, 2020  Republicans insist that they are moving forward with plans for an in-person convention come August, despite all the uncertainty about the coronavirus and warnings from public health officials about avoiding large gatherings. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said officials from other states have offered to host the convention if things with North Carolina fall through. “We want to have it in North Carolina,” McDaniel said on Fox & Friends Monday. “The president loves North Carolina. It’s just the governor, and he’s got to work with us.” The Democrats, on the other hand, have already scaled back their convention plans in Milwaukee on August 17. Although plans have not been finalized, they plan to take key portions of the convention online.

With Loveland City Schools in Ohio closed due to the novel coronavirus pandemic, bus drivers bid farewell to the class of 2020 in their own way. “We’re the first face they see in the morning and the last one they see before they head home,” 23-year bus driver and district courier Lisa Moorhead told Good Morning America on Monday. “We share hugs, they tell us stories and make us laugh,” she added. “We share a lot with these kids — probably more than people realize.” And the dedicated workers were not going to let even a global pandemic stop them from saying farewell to the newest generation of graduates. They lined up 22 buses across the empty school parking lot in tribute to the 392 members of the graduating class, while art and photography teacher Jim Barrett used a drone to record footage. The video was posted to the school district’s official Facebook page. “Some of us have been around long enough to transport these kids since kindergarten and some of us have only been working with the district for a few years, but the one thing we all have in common is the love for our students,” driver Jennifer Bloom Bowman said. “This is a huge accomplishment and anyway we can show them some love, we will do it. So here’s to the class of 2020. Your bus drivers are proud of all of you.”

Skateboarders took matters into their own hands on Memorial Day, clearing sand from the skate park on Venice Beach that Mayor Eric Garcetti’s administration had filled in over a month ago to enforce coronavirus “social distancing.” Garcetti closed the skate parks in March. As Breitbart News reported, several skate parks were filled in with sand by local authorities in Southern California in mid-April. Local surf magazine Shacked happened to be on the scene at Venice Beach when L.A. Parks and Recreation employees began shoveling and bulldozing sand into the skate park there, too. Others also posted photos and videos:  But on Monday, with state restrictions easing and the beach itself reopened for recreation, the skaters struck back. Wielding pickaxes and shovels, brooms and buckets, skaters hauled the sand out of the park themselves. Young and old, men and women, black and white, the volunteers were a picture of Los Angeles — as they defied the city’s orders. “By mid-afternoon on Memorial Day, the park had been completely cleared of the sand … and boarders performed tricks in the bowls well into the evening,” TMZ reported. Police officers reportedly stood by, and did not interfere. Photos captured by Getty Images appeared to show skateboarders making earlier, short-lived attempts at removing the sand.

Gavin Newsom for filling in the skate parks; it was local authorities that did so, though he supported closing the beaches): California skaters are taking back the skate parks that Newsom filled with sand.

Tuesday on CNN’s “Situation Room,” presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden said President Donald Trump not wearing a mask in public amid the coronavirus pandemic was because he is an “absolute fool.” Dana Bash said, “You mentioned the mask, that you wore a mask yesterday. President Trump went to a Memorial Day service. He did not wear a mask. It’s not just some people making fun of you. He did. He went on Twitter, retweeted a photo of you wearing it, he’s trying to belittle you for wearing a mask, making it seem like a sign of weakness. Is it?” Biden said, “He’s a fool, an absolute fool to talk that way. Every leading doc in the world is saying you should wear a mask when you’re in a crowd, and especially when you know you’re going to be in a position where you’re going to inadvertently get closer than 12 feet to somebody. I know we’re 12 feet apart, I get that. But it’s just absolutely —this macho stuff, for a guy — I shouldn’t get going, but it’s cost people lives. It’s costing people’s lives. Like I said, we’re almost 100,000 dead today. 100,000 people. Columbia study showing, if he had just started a week earlier, we would have saved thousands of lives. I mean, this is a tragedy.” Bash said, “Wearing a mask has become a cultural and political flashpoint. The president is involved in that, even stoking that.” Biden said, “Sure he is, and he’s stoking deaths. That’s not going to increase the likelihood that people are going to be better off.” Bash said, “Do you think wearing a mask projects strength or weakness?” Biden said, “Leadership. What it projects is leadership. Presidents are supposed to lead, not engage in folly, and be falsely masculine. It reminds me of the guys that I grew up with playing ball. They would walk around with a ball in their hand, but they didn’t like to hit very much.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

NEW YORK (AP) — A rookie at the major league minimum would make a higher percentage of his salary than multimillionaire stars like Mike Trout or Gerrit Cole under a sliding-scale proposal by big league teams that players found “extremely disappointing.” Major League Baseball made the proposal to the players’ union on Tuesday during a digital meeting rather than the 50-50 revenue-sharing plan that owners initially approved for their negotiators on May 11, two people familiar with the plan told The Associated Press. The people spoke on condition of anonymity because the details were not announced. In addition, the union said “the sides also remain far apart on health and safety protocols” aimed at starting the pandemic-delayed season around the Fourth of July. “We made a proposal to the union that is completely consistent with the economic realities facing our sport,” MLB said in a statement. “We look forward to a responsive proposal from the MLBPA.” The revenue-sharing plan earlier this month was met with immediately hostility from the union the day owners gave their negotiators the go-ahead. That plan was not presented to players when talks began the following day.
During that session, MLB gave the union a presentation claiming billions of dollars of anticipated losses and held off making a proposal for two weeks. Salaries in the major leagues range from $563,500 at the minimum to $36 million each for Trout, the three-time MVP outfielder on the Los Angeles Angels, and Cole, the pitcher signed by the New York Yankees as a free agent. According to a study by the AP, 369 of 899 players have salaries of $600,000 or less, according to the rosters frozen in March. Under MLB’s proposal, the playoffs would expand from 10 teams to 14 and players would receive more money if the postseason is played. Usually, salaries are earned during the regular season only and players receive money from the postseason pool, a maximum of about $382,000 last year for a full share on World Series champion Washington. Players agreed March 26 to a deal in which they would receive prorated shares of their salaries based on what percentage of each team’s 162-game schedule is played. In exchange, players were guaranteed that if no games are played they would receive service time for 2020 matching what they accrued earned in 2019. MLB told the union on May 12 it hoped to play a season with an 82-game schedule that would have teams play 13 games against each division rival and six against every club in the corresponding division in the other league: AL East vs. NL East, for example. Several governors have said teams are welcome to play in their regular-season ballparks but without fans due to the new coronavirus and mandates for social distancing. MLB told the union during the May 12 presentation if teams paid players prorated salaries the clubs would combine to have negative $3.58 billion earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Players were scheduled to earn about $4 billion in salary this year. Many players and union leadership have said the March 26 agreement would stand and no additional salary should be given up. Tampa Bay Rays All-Star pitcher Blake Snell , the 2018 AL Cy Young Award winner, said he would not take the mound this year if his pay is cut further, proclaiming: “I’m not playing unless I get mine.” Teams are worried about being at risk if a second wave of the virus causes cancellation of the postseason, which results in MLB receiving $787 million in broadcast revenue this year. There is room for maneuvering in the economic negotiations, but no commitment on what areas to delve into.
Players could propose a longer regular season, which would result in receiving a higher percentage of their salary in the initial calculation of cuts. For instance, increasing to 94 games would reduce the initial cut from 49.4% to 42%. That could be accomplished by adding a week, inserting a few additional doubleheaders and eliminating a couple of off-days. In addition, the sides could start to address next offseason’s market for spending on free agents and players eligible for arbitration. The union could propose suspending the luxury tax for 2020 and 2021, which in theory would give the higher-revenue teams more money to spend, and to eliminate the loss of amateur draft picks for clubs signing qualified free agents. Lower-revenue clubs would want something in return. One possibility would be to give them additional competitive balance-round picks in amateur drafts, where a pick in the 42-52 range overall yields prospects with slot values of $1.4 million to $1.8 million who have a better chance historically of becoming big leaguers. As protection to teams against a lost postseason, salaries could be deferred with interest.

President Donald Trump said he was puzzled that former Vice President Joe Biden wore a mask on Monday during an outdoor Memorial Day event during the coronavirus pandemic, but Trump denied making fun of him. “Biden can wear a mask, but he was standing outside with his wife, perfect conditions, perfect weather,” Trump said when asked about it. Biden and his wife, Jill Biden, arrived at a Memorial Day event wearing black masks as they laid a wreath in honor of soldiers who gave their lives in service to the United States. Trump noted that he had not seen Biden and his wife not wearing masks with each other when they were indoors. “They’re inside, they don’t wear masks, and so I thought it was very unusual that he had one on,” he said. Trump denied mocking Biden by retweeting a photo of the former vice president in a mask posted by Fox News host Brit Hume. This might help explain why Trump doesn’t like to wear a mask in public. Biden today. pic.twitter.com/9l1gw1ljBE — Brit Hume (@brithume) May 25, 2020  “I thought it was fine, I wasn’t criticizing him at all. Why would I do a thing like that?” Trump asked. Trump responded to a question from Reuters reporter Jeff Mason about Biden and masks during the coronavirus pandemic. When Mason asked a second question, Trump urged him to remove his mask so he could understand him. Can you take it off, because I can’t hear you,” Trump said. “I’ll just speak louder sir,” Mason replied. “Because you want to be politically correct, go ahead,” Trump said. “No sir, it’s just because I want to wear the mask,” Mason replied.

President Donald Trump criticized governors on Tuesday who ordered that coronavirus patients be sent to nursing homes, placing the lives of elderly residents at risk. Older adults are particularly vulnerable to the effects of the disease. “We are using every tool at our disposal to protect our nursing homes from outbreaks,” the president said, speaking at a press briefing in the Rose Garden at the White House. “You saw the disaster of how badly some of the governors handled nursing homes. “It is a disgrace what they have done. What some of the governors have done is a disgrace.” Trump did not refer to any governors by name, but he was referring to states like New York, New Jersey, and others that required nursing homes to accept COVID-19 patients, despite knowing the elevated risk to the elderly. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo issued a directive on March 25 that even prevented nursing homes from testing new arrivals for coronavirus. (The only early coverage came from conservative radio host Mark Levin and the Wall Street Journal.) More than one third of all coronavirus deaths in the U.S. happened in nursing homes, and more than one half in some states. California issued a similar directive, but reversed it after early public criticism. Cuomo waited until May 10 to change his order. Other states took early action to protect nursing homes. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) notably set nursing homes apart from the rest of the community, even as he took heavy criticism from the national media for declining to shut down his state’s economy until after most other states had done so. Trump noted Tuesday that he expects to meet with Gov. Cuomo, at Cuomo’s request, later this week. He has typically pointed to his good working relations with governors of both parties during the crisis. Joel B.

America’s economy has consistently taken a hit ever since the coronavirus pandemic began and Democrats around the country have made it clear that they do not want to see President Donald Trump revive it. A newly published piece from Politico, titled The general election scenario that Democrats are dreading, provided insight and reports by former top Obama administration economist Jason Furman. In his calculations, Furman concluded, “We are about to see the best economic data we’ve seen in the history of this country.” Upon making his remarks during a Zoom call, Furman said the former Cabinet secretaries and Federal Reserve chairs looked “puzzled.” “Everyone looked puzzled and thought I had misspoken,” Furman stated. According to Politico, “Furman’s counterintuitive pitch has caused some Democrats, especially Obama alumni, around Washington to panic.” “This is my big worry,” said a former Obama White House official, who added that concern among top party officials is “high, high, high, high.” An informal adviser to Joe Biden said his campaign is “very much aware” that a roaring economy could soon be on its way before the November presidential election. In his prediction, Furman said the economic bounce-back “can be very very fast because people go back to their original job, they get called back from furlough, you put the lights back on in your business. Given how many people were furloughed and how many businesses were closed you can get a big jump out of that. It will look like a V.” “I totally agree,” Larry Kudlow, head of the White House National Economic Council, said in regards to Furman’s analysis. “Q3 may be the single best GDP quarter since regular data. 2nd half super big growth, transitioning to 4 percent or more in 2021.” “Even today when we are at over 20 million unemployed Trump gets high marks on the economy, so I can’t imagine what it looks like when things go in the other direction,” said another former Obama White House official. “I don’t think this is a challenge for the Biden campaign. This is the challenge for the Biden campaign. If they can’t figure this out they should all just go home.” Follow Kyle on Twitter @RealKyleMorris and Facebook.

On Memorial Day, while reporting from Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, MSNBC’s Cal Perry said people were not wearing masks. Host Katy Tur said, “Cal Perry, you’re in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, I’ve been following you on Twitter. I’ve seen you out there today. It seems like you might be one of the only people wearing a mask and practicing social distancing, tell me what it’s like to be there.” Perry said, “Trying to. Here’s the beachside here, Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, only a couple of hours from Chicago. This place fills up seasonally from Chicago. I walked through town yesterday, shooting some video, and it was really weird. I spent a few months in lockdown in London, a place where you don’t even go grocery shopping, you have it delivered. I think that is the case in most places in this country. Here, it’s as if it’s as any other Memorial Day, totally packed, thousands of people. I have to tell you the social distancing measures that these restaurants are putting into practice, they’re not working, they’re forcing some people outside, and then those people are standing in lines.” “As you said, not a lot of face coverings,” Perry continued. “In Illinois, about an hour away, they’re required. If here in Wisconsin, they will not. As you know, the governor put restrictions here in Wisconsin. Those were overturned by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, which has led to all this. You talked to businesses here. They say sure we’re grateful for the business, but it’s their employees who are worried about their health, the health of their families. No one knows how this is going to play out. They say they’re brave. This is way of getting out. This is their freedom from Illinois. They are telling us to go home. Doesn’t seem to be any social distancing and not a lot of care when it comes to coronavirus, Katy.” Tur said, “So the people there just not worried about it, they’re not worried about their own personal safety?” Perry said, “I haven’t met anybody who is. I met some folks from Lake Geneva. They said they’re worried about it that the second spike. They are worried about those folks coming from Chicago. At the same time, they’ll add, this is place that relies on that business. People here want a little bit more funding to these programs so that they could stay closed. Again, I think they felt the Supreme Court made the decision it’s time to open up. You can see here just around, wearing them. Katy. A man walking by said,  “Including the cameraman.” Perry agreed saying, “Yeah, including the cameraman.” Tur said, “Striking images. Kyle, thank you very much. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

The NHL will abandon the rest of the regular season and go straight into the playoffs with 24 teams instead of 16 — if it is able to resume play. The decision, announced Tuedsay by Commissioner Gary Bettman, is no guarantee that games are coming back. The NHL and the NHL Players’ Association must still figure out health and safety protocols and solve other issues. Still, ironing out the format and narrowing down its two potential playoff host cities to a list of 10 represents significant progress since global sports were largely shut down in March as the coronavirus outbreak turned into a pandemic. Play could resume in late July, with the Stanley Cup Final decided in September or even later. Groups of 12 teams representing each of the two conferences will be limited to playing in two cities, yet to be determined, with three-week training camps opening no earlier than July 1. Bettman said voluntary workouts could begin in early June. “We hope this is a step back toward normalcy,” Bettman said. Earlier this week, the league and NHLPA issued extensive protocols once players are allowed to return to their facilities. They include a maximum of six players on the ice at a time, no contact and no coaches for voluntary workouts. Instead of limiting the Cup chase to the usual 16 teams that qualify for the playoffs, the league and players agreed to expand the field to 24 of its 31 teams because of the unusual circumstances. That means the likes of the Montreal Canadiens are still alive despite being nine points out of a playoff spot when hockey was halted March 12. But not all teams will have the same path to hockey’s storied trophy. The top four teams in each conference ranked by points percentage — Boston, Tampa Bay, Washington and Philadelphia in the East and St. Louis, Colorado, Vegas and Dallas in the West — will play separate round-robin tournaments to determine seeding. The remaining 16 teams will be seeded by conference, setting up best-of-five series in the East of No. 5 Pittsburgh vs. No. 12 Montreal, No. 6 Carolina vs. No. 11 New York Rangers, No. 7 New York Islanders vs. No. 10 Florida and No. 8 Toronto vs. No. 9 Columbus. In the West, it would be No. 5 Edmonton vs. No. 12 Chicago, No. 6 Nashville vs. No. 11 Arizona, No. 7 Vancouver vs. No. 10 Minnesota and No. 8 Calgary vs. No. 9 Winnipeg. “Any plan for the resumption of play by definition cannot be perfect,” Bettman said. “But we believe we have constructed an overall plan that includes all teams that as a practical matter might have had a chance of qualifying for the playoffs when the season was paused, and this plan will produce a worthy Stanley Cup champion who will have run the postseason gauntlet that is unique to the NHL.” Games are expected to be played in two hub cities and Bettman said 10 are in the running: Chicago, Columbus, Ohio, Dallas, Las Veas, Pittsburgh and Minneapolis/St. Paul in the U.S. and Edmonton, Toronto and Vancouver in Canada. While there are still details to work out, including whether the first two rounds are best of five or seven, Bettman said he expects the best-of-seven Stanley Cup Final to be played in full in one of the two hub cities. Each team would be limited to a total of 50 people in the city it plays in. “It’s not easy getting everybody on board with all the different countries, the players, the teams that were in the playoffs, teams that may not be in the playoffs and getting that all agreed upon with the union,” Buffalo Sabres owner Kim Pegula told The Associated Press. “For us to even finish the season and award (the Stanley Cup), I know a lot of work went into it. But I know how important it was for our players, our fans, our league to make sure that we conclude it.” The decision to call off the 189 regular-season games that were not played ends the season for Buffalo, New Jersey, Anaheim, Los Angeles, San Jose, Ottawa and Detroit. Those seven teams will now prepare for one of potentially two draft lotteries to determine the top 15 selections. The lottery will be held June 26, with another scheduled later depending on which of the remaining eight teams qualify for the 16-team playoff.

Chinese officials have said they will continue to invest heavily in Africa in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic as a means of supporting the continent’s increasing debt to Beijing, according to an article published in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) newspaper Global Times on Monday. In April, the G20 agreed to a deal in which its wealthiest member nations were asked to suspend debt payments to the end of the year for the world’s poorest, most indebted nations — most in Africa — as they struggle through the global recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Beijing has hesitated to comply with the proposal, insisting it will deal with African nations on a “case-by-case” basis, but refusing to write off African debts, as the G20 suggests. As the single largest creditor to Africa, China’s reluctance to comply with the measures significantly hinders the deal. In the CCP report published on Monday, the article’s author — “a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation under the Chinese Ministry of Commerce” — reiterated Beijing’s belief that suspending Africa’s debts would not be helpful, an argument it made last month shortly after the G20 deal was announced.  “The purpose of the loans was to facilitate African development, and China aims to solve debt problems through development. Simply offering write-offs would not be in accordance with African countries’ long-term development interests,” the article read. Instead, China offered examples of what it deemed an appropriate response to the African debt problem: For countries facing extreme challenges, China may increase grants which do not need to be paid back, among other supportive measures. China’s support of projects concerning people’s livelihoods, like constructing schools and hospitals, may be enhanced so as to speed up the resumption of production. From a long-term perspective, China will continue to support infrastructure construction in African countries to help their industrialization and modernization, the essential direction of China-Africa cooperation. Through its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China expands its global reach by recruiting developing nations throughout Asia, Europe, Africa and Latin America to develop various infrastructure projects. The projects are financed through predatory loans, which Beijing uses to encourage the foreign nation’s dependence on China. Between 2000 and 2017, “China advanced more than $143 billion to 49 ­African governments and their state-owned companies,” according to data from the China Africa Research Initiative at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies.

The segment begins with MSNBC anchor Katy Tur asking Perry whether people are concerned for their safety despite the ongoing Chinese coronavirus pandemic. “I haven’t met anybody who he,” Perry replied. “I met some folks actually from Lake Geneva who lived in the area and staying a few miles outside of town and they said they are worried about it.” INSTANT CLASSIC FROM @MSNBC: ANCHOR: "Are the people there just not worried about it?

You shouldn’t have to breathe somebody else’s secondhand smoke. I shouldn’t have to breathe exhaled COVID-19 in somebody’s breath,” Gupta said. “Nobody should. We should institute mandatory masks in public when you can’t guarantee social distancing. That means retail stores, public transportation, workplaces. That’s absolutely where we should be heading.” On Tuesday, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) announced residents will be required to wear a mask inside public places as of Friday — after he was caught taking a selfie without one.

Rory McIlroy does not have encouraging news about the upcoming 2020 Ryder Cup in September: He doesn’t think it’s going to happen. Speaking to BBC Sports, McIlroy said that he does not see how the tournament can be played in this coronavirus era. “My personal hunch is that I don’t see how it is going to happen, so I do not think that it will happen,” he told the British newser. “I think the majority of players would like to see it pushed back until 2021 so that they can play in front of crowds and have the atmosphere that makes the Ryder Cup so special,” McIlroy added. “The players are the ones that make the Ryder Cup. If they are not on board with it and don’t want to play, then there is no Ryder Cup. “I see it being pushed back until 2021, and, honestly, I think that will be the right call,” McIlroy concluded. The world’s top golfer, whose caddy recently tested positive for COVID-19, joined a broadcast of the first live golf since the coronavirus threat began with a round of golf live on TV last week in a charitable match at Seminole Golf Club, in Florida. NBC Sports claimed that the game, also featuring players Dustin Johnson, Rickie Fowler, and Matthew Wolff, earned 2.35 million viewers. The PGA Tour is scheduled to restart reglar play without fans in attendance on June 11 at the Charles Schwab Colonial tournament in Texas.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer blamed her husband’s “failed attempt at humor” for the controversy surrounding his request to get preferential treatment to get his boat in the in the water just before the holiday weekend. Whitmer addressed reporters in Lansing on Tuesday and tried to preempt their questions with a statement about the matter. After lamenting the amount of alleged negative and threatening comments she receives on social media, she said, “My husband made a failed attempt at humor last week when checking with the small business that helps with our boat and dock up north.” “Knowing it wouldn’t make a difference, he jokingly asked if being married to me might move him up in the queue,” she said. “Obviously with the motorized boating prohibition in our early days of COVID-19, he thought it might get a laugh. It didn’t,” Whitmer continued. “And to be honest, I wasn’t laughing either when it was relayed to me, because I knew how it would be perceived. He regrets it. I wish it wouldn’t have happened, and that’s really all we have to say about it,” she said. A reporter asked Whitmer a question about her and her husband’s whereabouts during Memorial Day weekend and if they have visited northern Michigan. “My husband did go up to our place in Antrim County and rake some leaves and came home,” she said, not specifying when that roughly 400-mile, six-hour round trip took place. “So he was there. We did not all pile in the car to go enjoy our second home, although that would have been permitted if we had,” Whitmer said. “But the fact of the matters is, he was there briefly for a night, I think, one or two nights, and came right back home after he raked our leaves,” the governor claimed.

The Chinese city of Hangzhou is considering proposals to make the smartphone-based coronavirus health tracking system permanent, expanding it to include factors such as how much sleep citizens are getting, how much alcohol they drink, and how frequently they exercise. China’s health tracking system uses a smartphone app that became, in effect, mandatory for all citizens to carry. The app generated a QR barcode that can be scanned by various officials to determine if an individual is healthy enough to travel or enter a particular facility. There are some variations in how the app works across China, but most versions of it generate a green, yellow, or red health rating for each citizen. Use of the health-tracking app is winding down as the Chinese government claims to have the coronavirus under control, but Hangzhou – a city of about ten million that sits about an hour away from Shanghai by train and prides itself on tech innovations, serving as the headquarters for the immense Alibaba corporation – may keep the system online permanently as a means of tracking and controlling the health of every resident. CNBC explained the proposal on Tuesday, asking some unsettling questions about where the tremendous amount of data needed to micromanage the health of ten million people will come from, how carefully their privacy will be safeguarded, and precisely what will happen to those unfortunate souls with poor health ratings: In Hangzhou, the government’s proposals involve giving a person a health score. This will be based on various factors including electronic medical records, results of physical examinations and lifestyle choices. In a screenshot of the barcode-based system, a person’s health score can be seen going down because they drank alcohol and smoked cigarettes. Meanwhile, a good amount of sleep plus exercise increases a person’s score.  It is unclear how the government would collect such information or whether this app will come to fruition.  The health code that Hangzhou residents are currently using related to the coronavirus is run via Alipay, the mobile payments platform owned by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial. When asked about the new app, the company told CNBC it has “not been contacted by any party with respect to this project.” A spokesperson reiterated that protecting the privacy of users is “a strict requirement for all third party service providers on our platform.” Nervous Hangzhou residents will not be reassured by the example of China’s infamous social credit system, which began as an effort to crack down on crime and terrorism, but quickly evolved into a system that denies “bad citizens” the right to climb aboard a train. Indeed, Technode noted on Tuesday that the Hangzhou proposals already make the health code system far more complex than the traffic-light ratings employed during the pandemic, giving each citizen a “sliding-scale numerical score” whose calculations will not be entirely transparent to the general population. “How much you’ve drunk, smoked, exercised and slept on any given day can all affect your points total, boosting or lowering your ranking,” CNN noted, observing that the system will also be able to track the movement of individuals around Hangzhou because the QR code appearing on each citizen’s phone will be constantly scanned at the entrance to buildings and before boarding public transportation. CNN included a few examples of how the system would work, as proposed by Hangzhou Municipal Health Commission director Sun Yongrong: The score can be affected by your daily activities: 15,000 steps of daily exercise will increase your score by 5 points, 200 milliliters of baijiu — a sorghum-based Chinese liquor known for its high alcohol content — will lower your score by 1.5 points, five cigarettes will cost you 3 points, and 7.5 hours of sleep will add one point to your score, the demonstration shows. There might also be a “group health score” for companies and residential committees, Sun said. A demonstration shows the health score for a company can be based on factors such as how much its employees exercise and sleep per day, how many employees have conducted annual health checkups, and how well chronic disease are controlled among its employees. Sun did not give details on how the data will be collected, whether the app will be compulsory, or how the score will affect people’s daily life and business operations. According to CNN, Chinese social media users are apprehensive about the Hangzhou proposal, voicing concerns about privacy and the potential for unfair treatment by the system. Some worried that data from the system could be obtained by everyone from marketing operations to potential employers. “Points will be deducted for smoking, drinking and not sleeping enough, does this mean our lives will be completely monitored?” asked one user, evidently getting the hang of what life will be like under the increasingly aggressive high-tech tyranny that rules his country.

Thousands of people across cities in Ecuador defied Chinese coronavirus social distancing advice on Monday to protest against economic cuts passed by President Lenin Moreno aimed at tackling the crisis. Last week, Moreno announced aggressive public spending cuts including the closure of state companies and embassies around the world. The move infuriated leftist trade unions, who complain that they are paying for the austerity rather than Ecuador’s elite. He also confirmed the liquidation of the TAME airline, a state-run carrier that has lost over $400 million in the last five years. Public sector working hours have been reduced by 25 percent and civil servants are facing a hefty 16 percent pay cut. Around 150,000 people have lost their jobs as a result of the lockdown. The government claims the current cost to the economy stands at $8 billion. Around 2,000 people marched in the capital Quito, waving flags and banners and shouting anti-government slogans calling for a restoration of the education budget and opposition to police repression. Demonstrations also took place in other major cities, including Guayaquil, the epicenter of Ecuador’s coronavirus outbreak, where union leaders claimed that hundreds marched through the city. “If the coronavirus doesn’t kill us, the government will,” one trader union leader in Guayaquil told Reuters news agency.

Several protesters were injured. Police also attacked journalists who were covering the demostration, according to Diario Expreso. Police also arbitrarily detained four human rights defenders during the protest, according to the Alliance of Human Rights Organizations and CDH. For several hours, neither CDH staff nor the Ombudsperson’s Office were able to contact those arrested. According to CDH, the police report said the four detainees had verbally assaulted police officers. Vivanco added that at a court hearing the following day, a judge ruled that the police had failed to provide evidence of a crime and dropped all charges against them. Similar left-wing demonstrations broke out across Ecuador last October after Moreno proposed an end to a decades-old gasoline subsidy introduced under Rafael Correa’s former socialist administration. As part of the pushback, leftist groups began burning roadblocks and looting businesses to pressure the government into scrapping the policy, which they eventually did. There were also reports of organizers employing foreigners, particularly struggling Venezuelans, to participate in the violence in return for payment. Ecuador remains the South American country most severely affected by the coronavirus pandemic. According to the latest figures, at least 3,203 have died as a result of the virus, equivalent to 187.48 per million people, placing it just behind the United States in terms of severity. At one point, the situation became so severe that corpses were being left in the street, forcing the government to construct a mass grave for their disposal.

If you liked the XFL, there’s good news for you. If you did not like XFL founder Vince McMahon, there’s also good news for you. First, the good news for the league. According to a report from Sports Business Journal’s Ben Schriver, there are twenty different bidders vying for the XFL’s assets. All of whom, reportedly, plan on the league playing in the 2021 season. The XFL's investment banker says 20 possible bidders have already entered into confidentiality agreements as they consider buying its assets from bankruptcy. All hope to execute a 2021 season, per court filings. — Ben Fischer (@BenFischerSBJ) May 26, 2020  Also, according to the court filings, Vince McMahon will not be among those attempting to purchase the assets. "I'm not going to be a bidder," McMahon said in a deposition. The filing called the claims "inflammatory rhetoric and unsubstantiated accusations." — Kevin Seifert (@SeifertESPN) May 26, 2020  According to Pro Football Talk: The prospect of Vince McMahon trying to buy the league came up when Daniel Kaplan of TheAthletic.com noted objections raised by the league’s creditors last week. Those creditors objected to a proposals made in bankruptcy proceedings because they believed McMahon was moving to position himself ‘to acquire the debtor at a fire-sale price’ after the league’s return season came to a halt due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The XFL delivered solid ratings, averaging more than a million viewers per game. Those numbers put the league above what most English Premier League games were getting on NBC Sports Network, and more than most college basketball games were earning on ESPN. The league got through five weeks of action before having to shut down due to the coronavirus. Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn

White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany confirmed to reporters that both Katie Miller and her husband Stephen Miller had returned to work at the White House on Tuesday. Katie Miller, the press secretary for Vice President Mike Pence, tested positive for the coronavirus on May 8th, sending both she and Stephen Miller into quarantine. Katie Miller confirmed her return to the White House on Twitter. “Back at work today after three NEGATIVE COVID tests,” she wrote. “Thank you to all my amazing doctors and everyone who reached out with support.” Miller also revealed publicly that she was pregnant, thanking her husband for taking care of her. “I couldn’t have done it without my amazing husband who took great care of his pregnant wife,” she wrote.

Tuesday on MSNBC, network political commentator former Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO) accused President Donald Trump of not being a “real man” because of his refusal to be photographed wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. McCaskill said, “Yeah, you know, Peter’s reporting and many other great reporters in this country have revealed the truth of the matter and that is that Donald Trump thinks he’s the victim of this virus. That somehow, this has been done to him. And he’s never seen his role as someone to protect, to empathize, to be aggressive in terms of safety. Only Donald Trump could make wearing a mask political. And what he has done is he has basically convinced people that if you’re wearing a mask, you’re somehow not manly. Well, real men wear masks. Donald Trump is not a real man. Joe Biden was over the weekend.” Discussing Gov. Doug Burgum (R-ND) getting emotional while urging his residents to wear masks, McCaskill said, “Yeah, it’s hard not and maybe because I can cry at commercials, you know, I’m not ashamed of the fact I cry easily —when I watched that video for the first time, I choked up. And maybe it’s because I’ve got people in my family I worry about. And when I think of their safety, I realize that how others are viewing this impacts how healthy they can remain. And so it is one of these things where that governor was really kind of showing an ethos of being what Tim McGraw would say, humble and kind. He was speaking from his heart. He was talking about kindness as a value. But how long has it been since the president of the United States conveyed anything close to humble or kind? I mean, this is a braggart, this is a liar, this is somebody who is mean and mean-spirited and has done terrible things to people unfairly, through the pinnacle of power in this world. This virus hasn’t been done to him. He has done bad in relation to this virus.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

A newly-released Arizona poll shows former Vice President Joe Biden holds a slim lead over President Donald Trump for November’s presidential election in the swing state. The HighGround Public Affairs survey found Biden, the presumptive Democrat nominee, at 47 percent support among respondents, with President Trump at 45.3 percent. The “some other candidate” option garnered 4.3 percent, and 3.5 percent said they didn’t know which candidate they support, the poll shows. The poll, conducted between May 18 and May 22, comprised of 400 likely voters, and has a 4.9 percent margin of error. “The partisan advantage was set at +4% GOP based on previous election trends and expected Presidential Election turnout,” HighGround Public Affairs notes. “In the wake of the most challenging and arguably worst three months of his term, President Trump has shown that he can remain competitive in Arizona,” said HighGround, Inc. Senior Vice President of Research and Strategy Paul Bentz. He said the virtual tie will be decided by the performance of the candidates’ “turnout game”: Despite several key swing constituencies not going in his favor and a deficit in Maricopa County, the state remains a ‘toss up’ because of his team’s laser focus on his key audiences.  Plus, there is still an additional 4 to 8% of the electorate up for grabs. As this boils down to a turnout game, we will need to keep our eyes on voter registration and enthusiasm during the primary over the next few months. One question on the survey asked: “If you blame anyone for the spread of the Coronavirus in the United States, who do you think is most to blame?” The question was open-ended; it did not give any answer choices. President Trump received the most blame, from 29.3% of respondents. In second was the response “Don’t Know/No One” at 25.3%, and then China, with 20.3%. In a separate poll published last week, figures show Biden leads President Trump by seven points in Arizona. The OH Predictive Insights (OHPI) survey found Biden at 50 percent and the president at 43 percent. A Democrat presidential nominee has not won Arizona since former President Clinton did in 1996. President Trump won Arizona in the 2016 election against Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton.

A report that the NFL could open minicamps for their players in June, had cold water thrown on it by none other than the players themselves. In response to a report from Yahoo which said that coaches could report to facilities next week and players would return after that for minicamps from June 15 to June 27, NFL Players Association (NFLPA) President JC Tretter noted that the current offseason programs are set to end on June 26, and the players have not agreed to any reopening plan. Players: our union has not agreed to any reopening plan. Any reports about coming back to work are hypothetical. You will hear from the NFLPA when there are new developments. — JC Tretter (@JCTretter) May 26, 2020  NFL Spokesman Brian McCarthy responded by making it clear that the league was not putting any dates on a “potential return.” Here’s ⁦@NFLprguy⁩ on the potential return of players to team facilities. pic.twitter.com/XnKh8pVLPA — Albert Breer (@AlbertBreer) May 26, 2020  In all likelihood, the Yahoo report was entirely accurate in terms of what the NFL is likely to propose to the players, it just got out before the NFL had actually proposed it to the players. Nonetheless, with severe quarantine states like New York, New Jersey, and California, all giving approval for their pro sports teams to get going, it’s very likely that minicamps will open soon.

White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany questioned Tuesday why former Vice President Joe Biden was wearing a mask outside on Memorial Day. One White House reporter questioned why President Trump retweeted a message on Twitter from Fox News host Brit Hume about Biden’s mask. This might help explain why Trump doesn’t like to wear a mask in public. Biden today. pic.twitter.com/9l1gw1ljBE — Brit Hume (@brithume) May 25, 2020  “The president’s excited to see that Joe emerged from the basement,” McEnany said. “It is a bit peculiar that in his basement right next to his wife he’s not wearing a mask, but he’s wearing one outdoors when he’s socially distanced.” Biden made a splash online after he emerged from his home quarantine for the first time in two months to lay a wreath at a military memorial in Delaware. McEnany said that President Trump “was not shaming anybody” for wearing a mask but noted that the CDC’s guidelines only recommend and do not mandate masks for people outside.

When the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic hit its peak, the Chinese government was quick to make use of smartphones to track citizens’ movements and isolate those who might be infected. Now, privacy experts are warning that these surveillance measures may stay in place once the pandemic has ended. One communist party official claims that Chinese people want to be surveilled, saying the app is “loved so much that you cannot bear to part with it.” The New York Times reports that when the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic was in full force in China, the government was quick to use citizens’ cell phones to identify and isolate people who could potentially be spreading the virus. Now, China claims that the virus is largely under control in the country, yet the government’s monitoring apps are slowly moving towards being a permanent part of Chinese peoples’ lives. The tracking software has reportedly been collecting information such as location data on people in hundreds of cities across China, but no limits have been set by authorities on how that data can be used. Zhou Jiangyong, the Communist Party secretary of the eastern tech hub of Hangzhou, has stated that the app should be an “intimate health guardian” for residents that is used often and “loved so much that you cannot bear to part with it.” Li Sihui, a researcher at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, wrote in a recent commentary: “Epidemic prevention and control needs the support of big data technology, but this does not mean agencies and individuals can randomly collect citizens’ information by borrowing the name of prevention and control.” Wang Xin, a novelist with 2.5 million followers on the Chinese social platform Weibo, wrote: “Doesn’t this brazenly violate privacy to surveil and discriminate against unhealthy people?” Another author, Shen Jiake, wrote: “I know that in this age of big data, it’s so easy for those who control data to check and use personal information in a matter of minutes,” but Jiake added that Hangzhou’s plan “crosses a line.” Other Chinese cities are no working on ways to continue using the apps, Shanghai reportedly wants to transform the app into a digital assistant for accessing local services of all kinds. The city of Xining uses the software to unlock coupons to local stores as a way to boost the economy. Authorities in Hangzhou began linking the city’s app to citizens’ medical records in April, enabling residents to schedule hospital visits via the app. A document from eh city government also outlines situations in which people’s codes could be scanned to receive a readout of their overall health. One user on the Chinese social media app Weibo commented: “Medical history and health checkup reports are personal privacy, why should they be included in health codes to show others?” They added: “Points will be deducted for smoking, drinking and not sleeping enough, does this mean our lives will be completely monitored?” Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) announced Tuesday that residents will be required to wear a mask inside public places beginning Friday as part of an effort to combat further spread of the Chinese coronavirus. Northam said in a press conference that people must wear masks “anywhere people can congregate” inside, including retail spaces, government facilities, and public transportation. Masks will also be required in restaurants, except while patrons are eating. Residents won’t have to wear a mask during exercise, and children 9-years-old and younger are exempt from the rule. “I am taking this step because science increasingly shows us that the virus spreads less easily when everyone is wearing face coverings,” said the governor. The new mask mandate will not be enforced by police, but by Virginia’s health department, explained Northam. “I’m not sure we need to get into specifics of what authority, at this stage,” he responded when pressed on how the state health officials will enforce the rules. “The criminal code is not the place you want this enforced, there are tremendous equity issues with enforcing this that we’re cognizant of,” added Clark Mercer, Northam’s chief of staff. During another part of his press conference, Northam acknowledged that he takes “full responsibility” for failing to wear a mask while visiting Virginia Beach over the weekend, saying he forgot his mask in his vehicle. “People held me accountable and I appreciate that,” he added. Critics on social media chided Northam, a physician, for not practicing what he has preached. “Physician, heal thyself,” tweeted Todd Gilbert, a Republican who is Virginia’s House Minority Leader. Northam posed for a selfie with a woman who said she knows the governor. She gave him a pat on the shoulder. “We just have to continue to remind people that we want to keep the social distance of 6 feet apart,” he said, when asked about the touch later. “That’s a challenge for a lot of folks because they’re just not used to doing that.” Virginia has more than 34,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 1,135 confirmed deaths as of Sunday, according to the state health department. The AP contributed to this report. 

Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser confirmed Tuesday there were no Chinese coronavirus-related deaths reported in the nation’s capital over the last 24 hours, marking the first day without fatalities since the numbers began to accumulate in late March. D.C. confirmed its first case of COVID-19, the disease produced by the virus, on March 7. “Today, we report that no D.C. resident lost their life to COVID on May 25, which is a good thing,” Bowser told reporters on Tuesday. Data provided by Bowser’s office showed that D.C. marked its first day with no deaths since March on Monday. LIVE: Updates on coronavirus (COVID-19) response in the District. Learn more: https://t.co/MEWs6uPfsI https://t.co/tt9MIIBalj — Mayor Muriel Bowser #StayHomeDC (@MayorBowser) May 26, 2020  After seeing a slight increase in new cases over the weekend, Bowser indicated that the city is back on track to begin a gradual reopening on Friday, “barring any new spikes.” “Tomorrow, we hope that the [downward] trends will continue, and we will be able to provide next steps on Phased One opening to be effective on this Friday, May 29,” Bowser said. However, the mayor suggested that the target date for reopening could change if conditions on the ground call for it. “We will continue to follow the science and begin our phased reopening when the data suggests that we can,” she said on Tuesday. Bowser announced that the district stands one day away from the 14-day sustained decline in the community spread — based on a five-day moving average — it needs to begin reopening non-essential businesses shut down to stem the spread of the highly contagious disease. “If the trend holds, we will be able to report 14 days of decline tomorrow,” she proclaimed. “We, of course, track community spread to understand whether we are able to manage and rapidly respond to any new increases.” D.C. also has sufficient healthcare capacity, data unveiled by the mayor showed. The district was reportedly operating at a bed occupancy rate of over 70 percent as of Sunday, which means hundreds of beds were still available, independent and city government assessments showed. The hospital bed occupancy rate has been below 80 percent for over 14 days, double the amount of days needed for reopening, Bowser’s data noted. In D.C., the COVID-19 transmission rate has also been low for 14 days, well beyond the three days required for a phased reopening, the mayor’s data further revealed. Currently, the nation’s capital can test all priority groups, as mandated by the district’s reopening guidelines. D.C. also has a “sufficient” capacity to contact trace all new cases and their close contacts, information from the mayor’s office showed. As of noon on Tuesday, 8,334 D.C. residents had tested positive for coronavirus, about 20 percent of the people tested, and 440 had lost their lives. The cumulative number of new cases is still increasing.

Aircraft manufacturers Boeing and Airbus announced this week that they are conducting tests to determine how the Chinese virus behaves on airplanes in flight. Their efforts, along with work by the FAA and CDC, are concentrated on ensuring safe flights as the public returns to the skies. According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, Boeing and Airbus are working to expedite the return to normal for commercial air travel. Both manufacturers are using computer modeling to simulate how the Chinese virus might travel during flight, along with collaborating with experts and academics in the United States and Europe. The report claims that the Federal Aviation Administration is working with aircraft manufacturers on strategies that will help them mitigate the spread of the virus during commercial flights. Stay tuned to Breitbart News for more updates on this story.

Officials from China’s province of Guangdong said on Monday they are planning to build dozens of high-level biosafety laboratories that should be able to safely handle infectious diseases, including at least one capable of handling Ebola. The South China Morning Post quoted Guangdong Department of Science and Technology director Wang Ruijun admitting his province has a dangerous shortage of top-level biosafety facilities, which is somewhat curious given that Guangdong was the source of the SARS outbreak in 2003.  The plan to remedy this shortage involves building as many as 30 labs rated at Bio-Safety Level (BSL) 3 and at least one BSL-4 lab, which would be qualified to handle deadly diseases like Ebola. The Chinese national government wants to build at least one BSL-3 lab in every province. Of course, another deadly disease is currently occupying the attention of the world and the news about Chinese biosafety labs in that case is mixed. The SCMP noted that China currently has two BSL-4 labs and one of them is the now-infamous Wuhan Institute of Virology, from which many critics of the Chinese government believe the coronavirus escaped. Wang pointed out that since much of China’s commerce and travel to the outside world pass through Guangdong’s Greater Bay Area, it makes sense to have “platforms and infrastructure and be equipped with the ability to diagnose, recognise and research, as well as the ability to respond to emergencies.” “The U.S. has close to 1,500 BSL-3 labs, and almost all medical organizations or medical schools have them. But, China lacks high-level biosafety labs, especially in Guangdong,” he said. Building more BSL-3 and BSL-4 labs, many of which would be located in or near existing hospital facilities, would help doctors diagnose new diseases more quickly while minimizing the risks of handling dangerous diseases at insecure facilities or transporting them to distant laboratories for analysis.  The Chinese government still insists the Wuhan Institute of Virology played no role in unleashing the coronavirus pandemic, but it seems willing to acknowledge that shipping dangerous viruses cross-country is a risky endeavor. Two weeks ago, Chinese officials admitted that laboratories were instructed to destroy valuable coronavirus samples but insisted this was done purely for safety reasons, not because the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) wanted to eliminate evidence that it knew the virus was highly communicable and dangerous long before it conceded as much to the rest of the world. Shi Zhengli, deputy director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology and a researcher known as the “Bat Woman” for her focus on coronaviruses in bats, warned in an interview with Chinese state television on Monday that “the viruses we have discovered are just the tip of the iceberg” and more pandemics are probably on the way. Shi’s interview, timed to coincide with the beginning of the CCP’s National People’s Congress session, repeated the standard government lines that international cooperation is crucial, efforts to blame China for the pandemic are “very regrettable,” and her institute had nothing to do with the origins of the Wuhan coronavirus.

Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage has said that Remainers want the prime minister’s adviser, Dominic Cummings, fired, in order to have an excuse to extend the transition period. “It is clear that there are many — not all, but many, in the Remain camp particularly — who would like to see the back of him, who think Cummings going now may well aid them in getting us to extend beyond the end of this year,” Mr Farage said during his LBC show on Monday. Yesterday, Mr Cummings gave a press conference where he defended taking his family to Durham to be near relatives over concerns that both he and his wife would be incapacitated and unable to look after their four-year-old son. Mr Cummings has been under extreme scrutiny from the mainstream media, with Brexit backers criticising reporters and photojournalists for the hypocrisy of accusing him of breaching lockdown rules while breaking social distancing themselves as they huddled outside of his family home, pushing cameras into his face. They’re a bunch of shameless hypocrites.

Mr Cummings also criticised the media for reporting what he said were “false” stories about his travels during the lockdown, which he said contributed to the public outrage and calls for his resignation. Durham Police also admitted on Monday that earlier statements they had given about them speaking to the aide’s family had been misleading. The force had said previously that it had spoken to Mr Cummings’ father on April 1st to reiterate government advice on social distancing and essential travel — suggesting to the media and the public that the police suspected him of breaking lockdown rules — but backtracked to say that no such conversation was had. A police spokesman said: “We can further confirm that our officer gave no specific advice on coronavirus to any members of the family… Durham constabulary deemed that no further action was required in that regard. Our officer did, however, provide the family with advice on security issues.” Brexit Proxy Wars: Remain-Supporting Junior Minister Resigns from Boris Government https://t.co/6WmkOjIkaW — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 26, 2020  Breitbart London reported last week that while he and Prime Minister Boris Johnson were sick with coronavirus, they were working to stop a plan by Remainers to extend the transition period beyond December 31st, 2020, which would have delayed the UK finally leaving the EU’s institutions and halted the implementation of any new trade deals. A deal to extend the transition period had reportedly been “all but agreed”, but media described that Mr Cummings had returned to work “and the plan, concocted by underlings while he and Boris Johnson were laid out on their sickbeds, was scuppered”.

New Jersey’s Democrat Governor, Phil Murphy, has given the go-ahead for sports to restart in the Garden State. Murphy has given the OK for pro sports to restart, giving the NFL’s New York Giants, and New York Jets — both of which play in Jersey — the green light to open training facilities for the coming 2020 NFL season. In addition, when the NHL is ready to restart, the New Jersey Devils would also be allowed to resume play. “We have been in constant discussions with teams about necessary protocols to protect the health and safety of players, coaches, and personnel.” Murphy said in a Twitter post. UPDATE: Professional sports teams in NJ may return to training and even competition – if their leagues choose to move in that direction. We have been in constant discussions with teams about necessary protocols to protect the health and safety of players, coaches, and personnel. pic.twitter.com/yMrCFtSyqY — Governor Phil Murphy (@GovMurphy) May 26, 2020  Tellingly, Murphy also put some of the onus on the various leagues, including the NFL, to make their own decisions on how to proceed in the coronavirus era. The Jets released a message noting that the team is working closely with the governor’s office. “We are working closely with Governor Murphy’s office, the league and our medical staff to establish prudent, health and safety measures for our staff and players,” the Jets said in a statement, according to the New York Post. “Based on those guidelines, we will begin to open our facility using a phased approach at a time that is the most practical for our operations.” For their part, the Giants said, “Governor Murphy and his administration continue to guide New Jerseyans through this very difficult time. We have been in close contact with Governor Murphy’s staff to comply with the state’s protocols throughout. With (Monday’s) announcement by the governor, we are finalizing our plans to reopen the Quest Diagnostics Training Center. “We will continue to have as many employees as possible working remotely. For employees who need to return to work at our facility, we expect to begin that process next week, and we will do so in a systematic and safe way that adheres to the state’s guidelines and NFL protocols,” the Giants statement concluded. To date, the NFL has not announced a plan for going forward with the 2020 season, though a long list of ideas and proposals have been floated.

According to a recent report from the Wall Street Journal, teens across the United States are becoming almost nocturnal during the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic. Teenagers have adopted “vampire schedules” of staying up all night gaming and watching videos, then sleeping well into the day as they aren’t required to attend school in the morning. According to a recent report from the Wall Street Journal titled “Locked-Down Teens Stay Up All Night, Sleep All Day,” teens across the United States are increasingly reversing their sleep cycled during the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic. While some schools are requiring students to attend live classes, many are instead assigning work for students to complete in their own time. As a result, many teens are choosing to stay up all night and sleep during the day. Zach Zimmerman, a high-school senior in Mansfield, Texas, commented “I feel more relaxed, honestly,” explaining that he was in the habit of going to bed around 10:00 a.m. and waking in the late afternoon. Zach began taking online college classes that start at 1:00 p.m. recently, requiring him to be awake during the daytime. “When my college classes are over,” he said, “I’ll probably go back.” The WSJ writes: Some parents welcome the daytime peace and quiet. They say it isn’t worth arguing over bedtimes when teens are stuck at home and have no compelling reason to rise early. Gabrielle Powell, a 17-year-old in Escondido, Calif., spends her nights on Snapchat and video calls with friends. She plows through TV shows like “Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness” and “All American,” she said, and makes macaroni and cheese. Her post-dawn bedtime varies. She recently broke her routine for the Advanced Placement calculus exam, at the ungodly late 11 a.m. Gabrielle stayed awake the rest of the day before going to sleep, but she soon returned to the night shift. The father of another student named Cole Cancellieri commented: “It’s almost like being a crime scene investigator. I’ll find the wrappers from some snacks that he had, there will be dishes in the sink from what he ate. Sometimes he’ll leave the TV on to what he was watching….It’s like having a raccoon that came through my house in the night.” Some parents are becoming so worried about the issue that they’re seeking professional advice about the issue. Laura Sterni, director of the Johns Hopkins Pediatric Sleep Center, commented on the phenomenon stating: “If it keeps going, it really gets hard to shift back to a normal schedule. We’re really telling people, our young patients, please try and stay on as normal a schedule as possible.” Dr. Sterni explained why so many teens often switch their sleep schedules, stating that this is part of a natural transition from childhood. Teenagers’ internal clock tends to shift about two hours later than when they were children, however, they still require between eight and ten hours of sleep. As a result, many sleep scientists have campaigned for high schools to start later in the day. Read more at the Wall Street Journal here.

Tuesday on ABC’s “The View,” co-host Joy Behar said President Donald Trump’s supporters did not realize they were “pawns” in his “political game” to get reelected by making wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic a political choice instead of a health directive. On wearing masks, Behar said, “There’s certain rules that you have to follow, you know, you can’t drive if you’re drunk. You have to wear a seatbelt. You’re not allowed to smoke in public, things like that, that you sign away your freedom in a way to be restricted in your car. And if you don’t abide by this, you go to jail, or you’re fined. The rules being distorted by Trump and his enablers in the Congress, in particular, the leaders in Congress who are enabling him, he’s playing a political game with people’s lives. And these people do not realize that they are pawns in his game. He only wants to be reelected. He doesn’t really care if you live or die.” She continued, “I mean, witness the fact that he went golfing on Memorial Day when the names are being printed in The New York Times about how many people have died. He couldn’t care less. He wants to turn people against each other so that he gets reelected. Let’s take the example of the church. Does anybody really believe that he’s so religious and cares so much about people going to church? No, he doesn’t. He only wants to turn you against each other, religion against other religion. ” She added, “One of the priests I know is saying you can really basically worship the Lord from anywhere. I believe in Islam. It is a fact that you could pray in your living room, in your bathroom, in your kitchen, anywhere you want. If you are in touch with God, you can pray wherever you are. No, he has to say go and open the churches. Why does he fiddle with people’s lives, is what I want to know?” She concluded, “School children are now forced to wear bulletproof backpacks. Why is it that their freedoms are being impinged upon, but yours are not because you don’t want to wear a mask? Why are you more important than those children?” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Democrat New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told a group of reporters Monday that coronavirus projections from the experts were all misleading, and that he is no longer speculating because of it. Cuomo said he could not predict when the death rate and hospitalization numbers will drop to the necessary standards required for reopening certain parts of the state, because he said all the experts “failed at predicting.” “Now, people can speculate. People can guess. I think next week, I think two weeks, I think a month,” Cuomo told reporters on Memorial Day. “I’m out of that business because we all failed at that business. Right? All the early national experts. Here’s my projection model. Here’s my projection model. They were all wrong. They were all wrong.” Cuomo’s remark came at a press conference at the Intrepid Sea, Air, and Space Museum in New York City when the Democrat New York governor was asked when New York City might reopen. Cuomo mentioned some statewide criteria that regions needed to meet before reopening, including a 14-day downswing in deaths and hospitalizations. But the governor said he did not want to guess when New York City could hit that benchmark because past projections have been wrong. Cuomo said Saturday that New York’s one-day death toll fell below 100 for the first time since March, and Long Island and the mid-Hudson areas could open as soon as this week. In order to reopen, state regions must have a decline in the number of deaths and hospitalizations and meet standards for testing and contact tracing. New York state has seen more than 362,000 coronavirus cases, with more than 23,000 deaths, according to the latest data.

Spain has revised down its official death count for the Chinese coronavirus after a series of reporting errors and duplications were found in the tally. On Monday, the Spanish Health Ministry announced that it removed 1,918 spurious deaths from the official death toll, representing a seven per cent drop in the total deaths reported. The number of victims of the Chinese virus being reported by the government now stands at 26,834 compared to the 28,752 that were reported on Sunday. The director of the Health Ministry’s Coordination Centre for Health Alerts, Fernando Simón, said that the disparity in the figures came as a result of “several factors”, such as the “elimination of duplicates” and that regional health officials attributed deaths to the Wuhan virus without supposed victims being tested for COVID-19, according to El País. “The information is more precise to assess what is happening now. Before this, the data did not correspond to what was happening,” Mr Simón said. The region of Catalonia saw the sharpest decline in the number of deaths, with 59 per cent of fatalities being removed from the count. The revision in the numbers has thrown the government’s ability to accurately track the rate of infection into turmoil, as the Health Ministry will need to reconstruct the entire data series before being able to track the virus accurately. Spain to Introduce Mandatory Mask Wearing on Public Transport https://t.co/WKGNNX9uSi — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 3, 2020  In response to the initial outbreak, the Spanish government introduced some of the most draconian lockdown measures in Europe. On Saturday, a demonstration organised by the right-wing populist party Vox shut down the capital city of Madrid, as some 6,000 cars flooded the streets to protest against the socialist government’s handling of coronavirus. “Spaniards always turn out at decisive moments. We are here to defend our freedom. The threat to the freedom of Spain is being led by an illegitimate government that has become a criminal government, one that is incapable of protecting its people and is directly responsible for the worst management of this crisis on the whole planet,” said Vox leader Santiago Abascal. “Have no doubt that we will take them to the courts. They know it and they are afraid of your freedom, which is why they are trying to intimidate us,” Abascal added. The socialist government has pledged to introduce a €3 billion (£2.67bn/$3.29bn) per year universal basic income scheme that will result in an estimated 850,000 Spanish households being paid by the government. “Neither the government nor Spanish society is going to look the other way while our compatriots queue up to eat, something we are sadly seeing now in some parts of the country,” said Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez.

The Cal State University system announced this week that it will not lower tuition for students across its 23 campuses this fall despite its decision to keep classes online. A majority of college students claim that the quality of their education declined when their courses moved online in March. Cal State Students will even be expected to pay campus-based fees for the fall semester. According to a report by the College Fix, California State University will not lower its tuition for the fall semester despite its announcement that classes will continue online for the remainder of the calendar year. The university system claims that the decision to keep classes online was made to mitigate the spread of the Chinese virus. Cal State spokesperson Toni Molle told the College Fix this week that the university system will not lower tuition. Molle even suggested that students will still be required to pay “campus-based mandatory fees” even though they will be taking their classes from home. “There are no plans to reduce tuition and campus-based mandatory fees at this time,” Molle said. “One of the benefits of announcing our planning now is to allow for additional professional development opportunities for faculty and staff over the summer which lead to the best possible learning experience that we can provide for students.” Breitbart News reported in April that 77 percent of college students believe that the quality of their education declined when their courses moved online in March. Breitbart News reported last week that New York University Professor Scott Galloway’s prediction about the future of higher education. Galloway, who had previously predicted that Amazon would purchase Whole Foods, argues that a few elite universities will monopolize higher education. Galloway argues that many universities and colleges are in a period of “hallucination” about their tuition prices. “At universities, we’re having constant meetings, and we’ve all adopted this narrative of ‘This is unprecedented, and we’re in this together,’ which is Latin for ‘We’re not lowering our prices, bitches,’” Galloway said. “Universities are still in a period of consensual hallucination with each saying, ‘We’re going to maintain these prices for what has become, overnight, a dramatically less compelling product offering.’”

Michigan state Rep. Karen Whitsett (D-Detroit) has filed a federal lawsuit against Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) after the Democrat Party censured Whitsett over praising President Trump. The 13th Congressional District Democrat Party committee passed a resolution in April reprimanding Whitsett for being critical of Whitmer and appearing alongside Trump at the White House. The suit accuses Whitmer and the Democrats of “violations of free speech and defamation,” MLive reported. Whitsett visited the White House earlier this month to thank Trump.  “Thank you for everything that you have done,” Whitsett told Trump. “I didn’t know that saying thank you had a political line,” she said. “I thought just saying thank you meant thank you.” According to the suit, Whitmer texted Whitsett after the White House meeting and said, “You’re entitled to your opinion, I’m just disappointed you’d take your theories public without seeking to get answers first. Take care.” The resolution read in part, according to Gongwer: State Representative Karen Whitsett has repeatedly and publicly praised the president’s delayed and misguided COVID-19 response efforts in contradiction with the scientifically based and action-oriented response from Michigan’s duly election Democratic leadership … endangering the health, safety and welfare of her constituents, the city of Detroit, and the state of Michigan. Whitsett alleged the resolution was brought up at Whitmer’s “prompting,” according to MLive. “Folks in the 13th were complaining about why is she attacking, why can’t she just sit down, she’s always acting like a fool up their in Lansing,” 13th District Democrat Party Chairman Jonathan Kinloch told Breitbart News in April. MLive reported: The suit accuses Whitmer of being aware of a conspiracy to publicly shame, defame and humiliate Whitsett. Whitmer did not try to stop the scheme and actually prompted it, making her liable for damages, the lawsuit claims. The lawsuit seeks an unspecified amount of money for damages, reimbursement for all court fees, lawyers fees and other costs related to the case and any further relief the court deems appropriate.

Few sports figures have done more winning than Tom Brady, Phil Mickelson, Peyton Manning, and Tiger Woods. Therefore, it shouldn’t surprise that their recent charity golf match smashed the all-time TV golf ratings record. The Match II: Champions for Charity, which pitted Woods/Manning vs. Brady/Mickelson, drew an average of 5.8 million viewers on Sunday. Those numbers were drawn from TBS, TNT, TRUTV and HLN. Peak viewership for the event came in at 6.3 million, and the event raised $20 million for coronavirus related charities.

The previous ratings title holder for a televised golf event was the 2010 Masters, which drew an average of 4.9 million viewers. Of course, there was no lockdown or quarantine in 2010, which definitely played a part in the historic numbers for the Match II. “A golf event held one week prior featuring Rory McIlroy, Dustin Johnson, Rickie Fowler and amateur champion Matthew Wolff also drew exceptional viewership well for a charity exhibition, delivering 2.35 million viewers for NBC,” the Hill reported. The PGA Tour will return on June 11th for the Charles Schwab Challenge in Fort Worth, Texas. Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn

Twitter is reportedly having trouble using AI tools to accurately label “misleading” tweets about the Wuhan coronavirus, raising concerns about the use of artificial intelligence to accurately label content on the site. As one expert explained: “Arguably, labeling incorrectly does more harm than not labeling because then people come to rely on that and they come to trust it. Once you get it wrong, a couple hours go by and it’s over.” CNET reports that social media website Twitter is having problems automatically labeling tweets that contain alleged misinformation about the Wuhan coronavirus. The firm announced on May 11 that it would be labeling tweets that spread conspiracy theories such as the virus being caused by 5G cell towers. Twitter also stated that it will be removing tweets encouraging people to engage in behavior such as damaging 5G cell towers, other tweets which also include false or dispute claims would receive a label directing users to trusted information. The label reads: “Get the facts about COVID-19” and directs users towards a page of curated tweets debunking the 5G conspiracy theories. However, Twitter’s automatics labeling has made a number of mistakes applying labels to tweets refuting conspiracy theories and providing accurate information. Tweets that have linked to reports from Reuters, BBC News, Wired, and Voice of America about the 5G conspiracy theories have received warning labels. Experts believe that the mislabeled tweets could actually confuse Twitter users, especially if they don’t click on the label.  Hany Farid, a computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley, commented: “Arguably, labeling incorrectly does more harm than not labeling because then people come to rely on that and they come to trust it. Once you get it wrong, a couple hours go by and it’s over.” Twitter has not stated how many 5G-coronavirus tweets have been labeled or an estimate of how many labels have been incorrectly applied. The firm did state that its automated systems are new and will improve in time, with a spokesperson saying: We are building and testing new tools so we can scale our application of these labels appropriately. There will be mistakes along the way. We appreciate your patience as we work to get this right, but this is why we are taking an iterative approach, so that we can learn and make adjustments along the way. Twitter faces a huge task in moderating its platform with 166 million daily active users browsing and posting on the platform. The company has employed automatic tools to help workers review reports more efficiently but this has led to a new set of issues. Some researchers have found that about half of all accounts tweeting about the Chinese virus are bots,  instead of actual users. Farid stated that he isn’t surprised that Twitter’s automated systems are marking errors, stating: “The difference between a headline with a conspiracy theory and one debunking it is very subtle. It’s literally the word ‘not’ and you need full blown language understanding, which we don’t have today.” Read more at CNET here.

Gee, I’m old enough to remember when the “experts” told us masks weren’t helpful when it comes to preventing the coronavirus. In fact, we were told masks were actually bad for us. Yes, it was all the way back in the Year of our Lord 2020 when the CDC said it “does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19.” What’s more, masks made it more likely we would catch the coronavirus: “If it’s not fitted right, you’re going to fumble with it,” Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar testified in March. “You’re going to be touching your face, which is the No. 1 way you’re going to get disease, is unclean hands touching your face.” Remember this…? Seriously people- STOP BUYING MASKS!   They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus, but if healthcare providers can’t get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk!  https://t.co/UxZRwxxKL9 — U.S. Surgeon General (@Surgeon_General) February 29, 2020  — Like, “seriously people, STOP BUYING MASKS,” like, what’s wrong with you people buying all those masks… That was the Surgeon General then, a whole 11 weeks ago… Here’s our Surgeon General today: (1/6) A #SaturdayMorning thread this #MemorialDayWeekend to clarify some of the confusion on masks and face coverings. Follow along to get the facts & remember – I wear my mask to protect you, and you wear yours to protect me. 👇 pic.twitter.com/sHLtJCxutU — U.S. Surgeon General (@Surgeon_General) May 23, 2020  — Let me tell you a secret… A few weeks ago, when the “experts” were telling us masks don’t help, I didn’t believe them. Did it make any sense to you? Doctors and nurses have been wearing paper masks for decades to protect themselves and their patients from infection  — and suddenly we’re supposed to believe they’re useless? Come on. I didn’t believe the MASKS DON’T WORK propaganda then, and to protect my wife, who checks off a number of risk factors with the coronavirus, I immediately started wearing a mask every time I went out, as does she. And, thankfully, because I do a lot of drywall work, I was lucky enough to have a stock of those N95 masks, which are supposed to be especially effective. But less than three months ago, if you were seen wearing a mask, you were an evildoer, a selfish bastard stealing precious PPE from first responders. Thanks to the media and government, wearing a mask, then — most especially an N95 mask, served as a Scarlet Letter of sorts. How dare you, sir! How dare you! To which I would happily respond: Yeah, well, we’ve had 13 cases of coronavirus in my county, so how about you dare to kiss my ass. And even if we got wiped out by the coronavirus here, my wife comes before your wife, so you can dare to kiss my ass again. But look at what a difference a few weeks makes… Today’s Scarlet Letter is *not* wearing a mask. Now you’re a monster for not wearing a mask, you’re a serial killer for not wearing a mask… There are people who consider themselves Americans who are applauding the following mob behavior: If you don’t wear a mask on Staten Island you will be publicly shamed pic.twitter.com/6pRl33C0vU — Barstool Sports (@barstoolsports) May 26, 2020  Granted, we don’t know the full context of the video. It might be that the person not wearing the mask was obnoxious. We’ve certainly seen enough videos of maskless jerks coughing on those politely asking them to wear a mask. So the video itself is not my point. It’s the social media reaction to the video I find troubling, the “right on” aspect of it, the cheering on and celebration of mob mentality… First off, if you’re wearing a mask, what the hell do you care if someone else is not? You’re protected. If you’re worried about your eyes, put on sunglasses. This is not difficult, y’all… Unless, of course, you’re a bossypants type who loves any excuse to tell others what to do. Secondly, we now know that if you are under 50 years of age, the coronavirus has a fatality rate of just 0.1 percent, or 1 in 1,000 — which is the exact same fatality rate as the everyday flu. So why are we stuffing people under the age of 50 into masks for no valid medical reason? It should be the elderly we train our protective focus on. Instead, we’re spreading our focus out among everyone, which was the mistake that led to completely unnecessary nursing home catastrophes in Democrat-run states like New York, New Jersey, and Michigan. But this is the world in which we now live — a world where science and facts no longer matter, where bad people are looking for any excuse to feel superior and to publicly lord their superiority over others, looking for any excuse to embrace the warmth of the fascist mob knowing social media and the corporate media will cheer them on as virtuous. This is a sick, sick culture we live in; a fascist and anti-freedom culture, a theocracy built on the empty religion of pious and self-righteous moral posturing. We saw this once before in the 60s. The good news is that the result of the 60s was the 70s, where the little brothers and sisters of the self-righteous hippies threw off that self-seriousness and embraced the joys of youth and freedom.  The 70s were the freest decade of my lifetime. Let’s hope the 2020s are just as shackle free.  Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.

President Donald Trump attacked Rep. Conor Lamb (D-PA) on Tuesday as an “American fraud” and a “puppet” for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). Trump voiced support for Sean Parnell — a Cranberry, Pennsylvania, Republican and combat veteran — to take on swing district Democrat Lamb. Parnell received a Purple Heart for injuries in battle in Afghanistan. The president said Lamb has not served as an independent voice in Pennsylvania’s 17th congressional district. “Sean Parnell is an American Hero. Conor Lamb has proven to be an American fraud, and a puppet for Crazy Nancy Pelosi,” Trump wrote. “He said he would NOT vote for her for Speaker, and did. Will kill 2A. Voted to impeach (on nothing). A TOTAL & COMPLETE Sean Parnell Endorsement!” Sean Parnell is an American Hero. Conor Lamb has proven to be an American fraud, and a puppet for Crazy Nancy Pelosi. He said he would NOT vote for her for Speaker, and did. Will kill 2A. Voted to impeach (on nothing). A TOTAL & COMPLETE Sean Parnell Endorsement! https://t.co/v1OnY0MI8m — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 26, 2020  Lamb was one of the 15 Democrats that did not vote for Pelosi to become speaker in January 2019. Parnell noted on Monday that Trump attacked Lamb for “pretending to be a pro-Trump moderate in a Trump district to get elected.” “Truth is, Lamb votes Speaker Pelosi 90+% of the time & voted for both charges of impeachment,” Parnell added. The POTUS didn’t attack @ConorLambPA’s military service as a lawyer. @realDonaldTrump went after Lamb for pretending to be a pro Trump moderate in a Trump district to get elected. Truth is, Lamb votes with @SpeakerPelosi 90+% of the time & voted for both charges of impeachment. https://t.co/0de6pFBQ48 — Sean Parnell (@SeanParnellUSA) May 25, 2020  Lamb claimed in December the evidence for impeachment was “strong.” “The facts show the president abused his office and compromised our national security. I can’t think of anything more serious than that,” Lamb said. Lamb also served as one of the several Pennsylvania Democrats that ignored Breitbart News’ request for comments over his thoughts on Gov. Tom Wolf’s decision to put coronavirus patients in nursing homes. Pennsylvania reportedly has one of the highest coronavirus-related death rates in nursing homes. Parnell noted Lamb did not “have a record when” he first became a candidate, meaning that he could “lie” about being a moderate. You didn’t have a record when you first became a candidate. Which is why you could lie about being a moderate.Thing is, you have a record now & it aligns with The Sqaud 90% of the time.Maybe if you’re nice they’ll let you be the 5th member for the next couple months. https://t.co/cJMDtKY8Hb — Sean Parnell (@SeanParnellUSA) May 25, 2020  Sean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News.

Optimism is rising in the U.S. as an unseasonably cold spring weather fades and lockdowns have lifted, allowing more Americans to venture out of homes into much warmer weather. The Conference Board said Tuesday that its confidence index climbed up to a reading of 86.6 in May from 85.7 in April, in line with the expectations of economic forecasters.
“Following two months of rapid decline, the free-fall in Confidence stopped in May,” said Lynn Franco, Senior Director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board. Although still near 6-year lows, May’s stabilization is the latest sign that the worst of the economic crash from the coronavirus is past and some of the weight on the U.S. economy is lifting. The May survey also showed that the virus has not depressed the consumer outlook in recent weeks as much as it had in early spring. The share of consumers who expect business conditions to improve over the next six months rose from 39.8 percent to 43.3 percent. Those who foresee business conditions worsening declined from 25.1 percent to 21.4 percent. “Short-term expectations moderately increased as the gradual re-opening of the economy helped improve consumers’ spirits. However, consumers remain concerned about their financial prospects,” Franco said.   The gauge of present conditions declined slightly from 73 to 71.1. The share of consumers who said business conditions are “good” dropped from 19.9 percent to 16.3 percent, while those who said business conditions are “bad” rose from 45.3 percent to 52.1 percent. Consumers’ outlook for the labor market was mixed. On the one hand, the slice of Americans expecting more jobs in the months ahead declined from 41.2 percent to 39.3 percent. On the other hand, those anticipating fewer jobs in the months ahead also fell, from 21.2 percent to 20.2 percent. Regarding their short-term income prospects, the percentage of consumers expecting an increase declined from 17.2 percent to 14.0 percent. But the share expecting a decrease declined from 18.4 percent to 15.0 percent, an indication that economic anxiety is waning.  

A page on WeChat, a Chinese social media site, claimed American officials have been “processing dead bodies” of Chinese coronavirus victims into burgers and feeding them to the masses, the South China Morning Post revealed on Tuesday, claiming Beijing had shut the page down. Prior to its deletion, however, the page – the “Scholar Forum for Ultimate Truth” – had attracted 1.7 million page views, according to the Post. China has built an extensive online censorship apparatus that has successfully shut down a wide variety of factual information detrimental to the regime or simply commentary by dissidents on the failures of the Communist Party. Yet when faced with outrageous false information that disparages America or other foreign nations, China’s censors suddenly struggle to keep up with the volume of material. The Post noted that one of the most outrageous posts on the “Scholar Forum for Ultimate Truth” page, a pro-communist conspiracy WeChat account, accused Americans of eating those killed by the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. “The US has been processing dead bodies from Covid-19 [Chinese coronavirus] diseases into hamburgers,” the page reportedly claimed, adding that the bodies “were very likely of being processed into frozen meat, fake beef or pork, or processed into cooked meat as hamburgers and hot dogs.” The page offered as evidence of this claim the unsubstantiated allegation that “cannibalism has existed in the U.S. before … and only a few dozen years ago, Americans ate blacks, Indians and Chinese.” The offending post was published last month and garnered 100,000 readers as well as nearly 1,000 financial contributors to the page. The Post reported that its content was not unusual for the page, which regularly posted anti-Western, anti-American conspiracy theories and insults. The page was reportedly only taken down this week.  “While China has the world’s most sophisticated censorship system, misinformation and sensational content still runs wild on the internet. There are about 30 million social media accounts on WeChat alone,” the Post observed. There is little evidence that China is interested in shutting down anti-American conspiracy theories, especially given that the Chinese Foreign Ministry has peddled them officially. The most regularly touted conspiracy theory about the Chinese coronavirus pandemic is the claim that the virus did not originate in Wuhan, China, where the first cases were reported, but in a U.S. Army laboratory in Maryland. “It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian accused in March. “Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!” The Chinese state media outlet Global Times, which regularly uses unnamed “Chinese netizens” as a metric of public opinion, later added the claim that the Fort Detrick, Maryland U.S. Army lab was the alleged source of the virus. Neither Zhao nor the propaganda newspaper have offered any evidence for this claim, nor have any independent investigators or journalists revealed evidence for the theory. Another Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, suggested the possibility this month that respiratory illness cases in the United States related to the use of e-cigarettes, or vapes, identified last year were actually misdiagnosed Chinese coronavirus cases. Hua offered no evidence for this theory and did not explain how that was possible given the vaping illness cases were not contagious, while the Chinese coronavirus is believed to spread To explain the fact that no cases of Chinese coronavirus have been diagnosed outside of Wuhan earlier than the first known cases, Beijing offered another explanation: that American military personnel participating in the Military World Games in October, held in Wuhan, brought the virus into China. According to Vice, the conspiracy theory originated in the West, “but the Communist Party of China has promoted it so aggressively within China that it has become accepted knowledge among the Chinese populace that the U.S. military imported the coronavirus to Wuhan.” Vice quoted one Chinese-American who said that she found “most Chinese people really believe the U.S. brought the virus to China and they call it ‘USA virus.'” Chinese state media identified one American servicewoman in particular, Maatje Benassi, as the original carrier of the disease. There is no evidence tying Benassi to the pandemic, and the U.S. Army reservist told CNN that the conspiracy theory has largely destroyed her life. “I want everybody to stop harassing me, because this is cyberbullying to me and it’s gone way out of hand,” Maajte said in an interview in April. China was disqualified from the 2019 Military World Games, which it was hosting, for “extensive cheating.” Other information China has allowed to freely propagate behind its “great firewall” include claims “the coronavirus was created as a bioweapon or was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to further vaccine sales … [or] that the virus can be cured by eating garlic or drinking a bleach concoction.” The false information promoted by China’s official channels contrasts significantly with what its censors act decisively to remove from venues like WeChat. Perhaps the most outrageous example of censored content in the past year is the medical information posted on WeChat by Dr. Li Wenliang, a Wuhan doctor. Li was among the first doctors to identify and diagnose the Chinese coronavirus infection and shared tips with other doctors on WeChat on how to prevent the spread of contagious diseases – tips like washing hands and wearing protective gear. WeChat rapidly censored his tips, even though he shared them only with other doctors and not the public, and detained Li, forcing him to issue a humiliating public apology for the information. Li died in February of Chinese coronavirus infection. He was 34. Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.  

If you’re looking for optimism that the NFL season will happen, maybe even with fans, then Dolphins Owner Stephen Ross is your man. During a Tuesday morning interview on CNBC, Ross stated clearly that the NFL season will happen, the only question is whether fans will be in attendance. “I think there definitely will be a football season this year,” Ross said. “Real question is, will there be fans in the stadium? Right now — today — we’re planning to have fans in the stadium.” The Dolphins have been reportedly experimenting with the idea of social distancing inside the stadium. So, just because teams may be planning to have fans, doesn’t necessarily mean that stadiums will be filled to capacity. It’s not surprising that this level of optimism has come from a sports executive in Florida. The Sunshine State, along with Georgia, has been at the forefront of the country’s reopening and recovery effort. Florida in particular has become a symbol of the sports world’s reopening, as Governor DeSantis has moved to make the state a refuge for sports leagues and sports entertainment organizations such as the UFC and WWE, in their bid to resume holding events. “The NFL hasn’t made any firm decisions on whether to allow fans into stadiums during the 2020 season, but the league released its schedule earlier this month and plans to play its full 16-game slate on time, starting Sept. 10,” Cameron Wolfe of ESPN reported. “We all miss our sports,” Ross said. “The NFL, I think, will be ready to go. I know we’re all looking forward to it. I know I am.” Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn

ROME — The Wuhan coronavirus will suffer a significant decline in activity as temperatures rise this summer, according to an Italian report published Tuesday on the relationship between the virus and temperature. “Like all coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is influenced in a decisive manner by the climate,” said Mario Bacco, a researcher at Meleam, which specializes in occupational medicine. “In the laboratory we have seen that by increasing the temperature of the culture by a few degrees centigrade, bringing it to the range of 25-30 degrees C [77-86º F], approximately 53 percent of the strains do not survive and the rest show about 12 times less activity,” he said. While Bacco and his team feel certain that the virus will diminish substantially during the summer months, they are less convinced that it will disappear altogether. “In the summer, the virus is expected to exhibit limited activity with very slight aggressiveness, but since it manages to survive, it will probably reappear as temperatures drop,” Bacco notes. “In short, it will not go away entirely.” “My idea is that it will not disappear, as SARS did,” he proposes. Being “sensitive to the climate, SARS-CoV-2 will always manifest itself more incisively in the colder areas of Italy.” In the case of the 2003 SARS epidemic, researchers found that on days with a lower air temperature, the risk of increased daily incidence was 18-times higher than on days with a higher temperature, according to a study published by the NIH, a finding corroborated by other studies. “Our observations show that the virus manifests some perceptible mutations, brought about in a short time,” Bacco said, in reference to COVID-19. “This makes us think more and more that the possibility of making a vaccine that can be objectively effective for a time worthy of consideration is scarce.” “The observed mutations mainly concern genomic areas defined as introns, which are by definition noncoding,” he added. “Finally, we are finding, with increasing frequency, viral protein strands in biological liquids. At the moment, this observation, while interesting, does not seem to have important repercussions on the evolution of the microorganism,” he said. Bacco’s findings on the coronavirus’ sensitivity to heat replicate the results of earlier studies. As a flu-like disease — contagious viruses that cause respiratory illness — coronavirus has shown itself to be much more aggressive and contagious in colder climates. Follow @tdwilliamsrome

President Donald Trump warned Tuesday the 2020 election would be “rigged” thanks to Democrats pushing mail-in ballots during the coronavirus pandemic. “This will be a Rigged Election. No way!” Trump wrote on Twitter and Facebook. The president predicted mass voter fraud in 2020, thanks to Democrat officials using the pandemic to institute mail-in voting. “There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent,” he wrote. The president pointed to California’s governor Gavin Newsom who signed an executive order to mail ballots to all voters in the November 3 general election. “Mail boxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged and even illegally printed out and fraudulently signed,” Trump said. The Republican National Committee, National Republican Congressional Committee, and California Republican Party have filed a lawsuit to block the action, arguing that it is unconstitutional. Trump warned that Democrat activists would use the mail-in vote option to generate more votes for their party. “That will be followed up with professionals telling all of these people, many of whom have never even thought of voting before, how, and for whom, to vote,” he wrote. ….living in the state, no matter who they are or how they got there, will get one. That will be followed up with professionals telling all of these people, many of whom have never even thought of voting before, how, and for whom, to vote. This will be a Rigged Election. No way! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 26, 2020   

Security experts from the Council of Europe have warned of the possibility of biological terror in the wake of the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic, saying the outbreak has revealed societal vulnerabilities. Council of Europe Committee on Counter-Terrorism experts said that terrorist groups could be incentivised to look into creating and deploying biological weapons after seeing the dramatic effects of the coronavirus pandemic. “The Covid-19 pandemic has shown how vulnerable modern societies are to viral infections and their shock potential,” the committee said on Monday, German newspaper Die Welt reports. “The damage is quick and potentially global,” the experts added and said that a biological attack could have a far greater impact on people and the economy than traditional terror attacks have in the past. Tunisian Migrant in Court over ‘Ricin Attack Plot’ Against ‘Unbelievers’ https://t.co/S0fLhHaK2o — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 7, 2019  Germany’s Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, the country’s domestic security agency, said that it had not seen “concrete or abstract plans” regarding bioweapon terror attacks so far, but said a well-organised group such as Islamic State would likely be behind what they determined to be an “unlikely” attack. While biological weapons are rare compared to attacks using explosives, firearms, and knives, Germany has seen at least one foiled biological terror attack in recent years. In August of 2018, Tunisian migrant Sief Allah H. was arrested in the city of Cologne after authorities discovered he had planned a terrorist attack using the deadly biological compound known as ricin in what was considered Germany’s first bioterrorism plot. A year later, both he and his 43-year-old Muslim convert wife Yasmin were brought up on terrorism charges with both believed to be sympathisers of Islamic State. The Tunisian migrant was found guilty of manufacturing a biological weapon and preparing a terrorist attack in March and sentenced to ten years in a German prison.

China will “actively expand” public health projects in its Belt and Road (BRI) partner countries amid the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Sunday, according to the South China Morning Post. Speaking at a press conference on Sunday, Wang said: China will actively expand international cooperation on public health and establish pandemic control mechanisms with more nations. There will be more such cooperation along the Belt and Road [BRI]. China will work with the countries along the route to vigorously promote the construction of the ‘Healthy Silk Road.’ The “Health Silk Road” is China’s term for the system of public health projects it promotes within BRI-partner countries. So far, China has used the BRI to focus largely on trade and infrastructure partnerships with developing nations across Asia, Europe, Africa, and Latin America. Beijing advertises BRI projects as lucrative endeavors, but they ultimately force host nations to become massively indebted to China. Now, amid increased healthcare needs caused by the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic, Beijing aims to expand its BRI to include public health projects. “The potential of the Belt and Road comes from constantly opening up new areas of cooperation. After the [Wuhan coronavirus] epidemic, the desire of countries to develop the economy and protect people’s livelihoods will be stronger, and the demand for cooperation in the field of public health will also increase significantly,” Wang said. Beijing first announced the launch of its Health Silk Road initiative this year as “a new approach for perfecting global public health governance.” In April, China’s ambassador to Iran promoted the Health Silk Road in an op-ed published by an Iranian-state newspaper. At the time, Iran’s support of the initiative was criticized by many Iranians as evidence that their country was “capitulating” to China. Beijing’s public health initiative is widely considered a way for China to capitalize on the vulnerabilities caused by the devastating Wuhan coronavirus pandemic, which has killed hundreds of thousands of people worldwide and exhausted nations’ healthcare systems. By offering to support a public healthcare system in a struggling foreign nation, China paints itself as a global humanitarian. Just as with the predatory BRI projects, the Health Silk Road provides China potential access to host nations’ sensitive government health data, opening up access to foreign governments’ health-related technology and intellectual property. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) may then, in turn, use this valuable information to further expand its influence: over the host nation, throughout the region, and across the globe.

The far-left Politico admitted Tuesday that Democrats are “dreading” the idea of a fast economic boom as America reopens, which explains the anti-science push among many Democrat governors to extend their pointless coronavirus lockdowns. Thanks to these lockdowns, some 40 million people are unemployed, some 40 million lives have been shattered; lines at food pantries seem to go on forever; countless small businesses are in danger of closing or already have… Nevertheless, what America’s oh-so compassionate Democrats dread most is a quick economic rebound that might undermine their grasping desire to hold on to and obtain power. “The general election scenario that Democrats are dreading,” the Politico headline reads.  And what is that scenario? “We are about to see the best economic data we’ve seen in the history of this country,” a former economic adviser to Barack Obama told a bunch of bigwigs from both parties last month. His name is Jason Furman and Politico says he “laid out a detailed case for why the months preceding the November election could offer Trump the chance to brag — truthfully — about the most explosive monthly employment numbers and GDP growth ever.” Furman’s counterintuitive pitch has caused some Democrats, especially Obama alumni, around Washington to panic. “This is my big worry,” said a former Obama White House official who is still close to the former president. Asked about the level of concern among top party officials, he said, “It’s high — high, high, high, high.” And top policy officials on the Biden campaign are preparing for a fall economic debate that might look very different than the one predicted at the start of the pandemic in March. “They are very much aware of this,” said an informal adviser. What Furman already sees are signs of what’s known as a “V” recovery, as a opposed to a slower or gradual  recovery,  or a recovery that takes a while to get back to where we were before these stupid lockdowns began. Furman sees an economy that’s already unleashed. Consumption and hiring started to tick up “in gross terms, not in net terms,” Furman said, describing the phenomenon as a “partial rebound.” The bounce back “can be very very fast, because people go back to their original job, they get called back from furlough, you put the lights back on in your business. Given how many people were furloughed and how many businesses were closed you can get a big jump out of that. It will look like a V.” Furman’s argument is not that different from the one made by White House economic advisers and Trump, who have predicted an explosive third quarter, and senior adviser Jared Kushner, who said in late April that “the hope is that by July the country’s really rocking again.” White House officials were thrilled to hear that some of their views have been endorsed by prominent Democrats. While no one expects the second quarter numbers — the numbers that will tell us the GDP between April 1 and June 30 — to be anything but terrible, if we can come to our senses nationwide and get these absurd lockdowns behind us, the third quarter numbers (that will be released at the end of September) could show real growth. This would be good for the incumbent president, especially since that incumbent president has been predicting a “pent up” desire within the American people to get back to normal. Good news for America and Americans would, of course, be terrible news for Joe Biden, who is desperate to strangle our economy with record high taxes and an obscene amount of regulations. Biden’s policies would hurt a flourishing economy, but they would kill a post-lockdown recovery in the same way the Obama-Biden economic policies of 2009 killed any hope of a real rebound after the 2008 economic crash. It’s no accident the Obama-Biden administration oversaw the worst “recovery” since the Great Depression. Their taxes, regulations, and constant threats of more kept a boot firmly on the neck of our economy for eight long years. Plus, no matter how much Biden might crybaby about Trump’s Twitter account, his golf game, and his violation of the establishment’s “precious norms,” the American people tend not to fire a president when the economy is humming — especially if we are coming out of a downturn. But what does it say about Democrats that with nearly 40 million lives shattered, they “dread” a fast comeback for those 40 million people? Obviously, that’s a rhetorical question, but it does answer the question as to why — and for no valid scientific or medical reasons, a number of mercenary Democrat governors are desperate to push these pointless lockdowns as far into next month as possible (especially in swing states like Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania). It is all about doing whatever damage they can to those third quarter GDP numbers; even if that means more pain for those who cannot work from home — primarily the working class.

MSNBC staffer Andrea Mitchell accused President Donald Trump of “endangering the troops” while attending two separate Memorial Day events on Monday. The far-left Mitchell opened her criticism of Trump by gushing over presumptive Democrat nominee Joe Biden, who left his home for the first time in two months Monday to lay a wreath at a Delaware war memorial. “Joe Biden and Dr. Jill Biden emerged for the first time from their home since March 15th, I believe. And it showed they were both wearing masks. They went to a war memorial in New Castle, Delaware,” Mitchell said. “This is also almost the fifth anniversary of their son, a veteran, Beau Biden’s death. So these are really touching — a touching war memorial visit.” She added this is “the first time that he is coming out of his home, and I guess testing whether there were other safe ways that he can emerge, given his age, given the restrictions, and the fact that he is modeling what the government is saying to model, in contrast to the president, who’s going against his own government.” Jennifer Palmieri, the former White House communications director for Barack Obama, then did some wish-casting about what this Memorial Day might have looked like if Joe Biden or Barack Obama were president. Mitchell then jumped back in to accuse Trump of putting the American troops at risk for not wearing a mask. “Clearly, [Rapey Joe Biden’s] numbers have gone up as he’s been campaigning from home, virtually, and the president,” Mitchell said, and then harrumphed: “arguably, is endangering the troops, the people who have to travel with him, as well as the people that he meets along the way, and he has not been socially distancing or wearing a mask when he’s around them, so, obviously time will tell.” How is Trump endangering anyone if he doesn’t have the coronavirus? If anything, he is putting himself at risk, an angle hacks like Mitchell would certainly take if her precious Rapey Joe and Barry were still in office: Oh, how selfless and honorable for Barry and Rapey Joe to expose themselves in this way to America’s fighting men and women. How brave they are. But what if they get sick? That would be disastrous for democracy! And why is Biden wearing a mask while laying a wreath at a war memorial? It was just him and his wife. Why not remove the mask after getting out of the car with the Secret Service agents? He looked ridiculous. Like a balding, enfeebled Bane. There was no need to wear a mask, other than to virtue signal and make shallow liars and rape deniers like Andrea Mitchell gush. Honestly, Biden’s been quarantined in his home for weeks, who is he going to infect? The whole thing is ridiculous, as is our corrupt media. As far as endangering the troops, with the latest fatality rates from the CDC, we know now that if you’re under 50, your chances of dying of the coronavirus are 1 in a 1,000 — and that’s only if you’re infected to begin with.  That’s the same as the common flu.

The latest proxy-battle over Brexit has seen a junior minister resign from Boris Johnson’s government, as Remainers move against the prime minister’s enforcer-in-chief Dominic Cummings. Douglas Ross, Boris Johnson’s junior minister for Scotland, resigned on Tuesday morning, citing his opposition to Boris Johnson’s Brexit-focussed enforcer Dominic Cummings in his public letter to the prime minister. Telegraph: Rogue Civil Servant Tweets a Reminder Why Anti-Swamp Boris Govt was Elected https://t.co/FMPA8GAA9U — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 25, 2020  Getting Mr Cummings — variously described as either a political genius or a Svengali-type figure — out of Downing Street has become a matter of some urgency, with all major UK newspapers and the Westminster political establishment united in seeing his demise. Perhaps confounding expectations, the prime minister has so far stood by his top adviser, and at a polite but firm press conference, Monday afternoon Mr Cummings himself defended his record and said he had not offered his resignation. As Breitbart London noted on Sunday, Dominic Cummings is likely to have intensified ill-feeling towards him of late, as he was able to scotch a plan to delay Brexit concocted while he and his boss the prime minister were away from work, ill with coronavirus. Between his dogged determination to deliver Brexit — the mandated will of the British people — and his dogmatic hatred of the embedded power of the British Deep State, Mr Cummings has become public enemy number one for the theoretically-impartial Civil Service. Boris Adviser Cummings Squashed Plan to Delay Real Brexit Concocted While He and PM Had Covid https://t.co/OW7YXEm7Mb — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 24, 2020  Tuesday’s resignation is a timely reminder that, while Boris Johnson’s government is the most pro-Brexit — perhaps the only pro-Brexit — government in history, and the present Parliament is the most pro-Brexit ever, the fact remains that the majority of the cabinet were Remain-supporters at the time of the referendum. This is in part a reflection of how few thoroughly pro-Brexit politicians there are in Westminster. Strangely, British newspaper the Daily Telegraph — the UK title closest to the governing Conservative Party — appears to be providing covering fire for Ross, citing an unnamed “former minister” in their daily politics blog which offered that the Scottish MP is “a big Boris fan from the get-go and a Brexiter.” This position appears to reflect a revised view of Douglas Ross, who by his own account in earlier times declared himself in favour of Remain, and opposed Mr Johnson in the first round of the leadership vote.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Monday that all ‘non-essential’ shops can reopen in England on June 15th, with retailers planning on quarantining items touched by customers. “I want people to be confident that they can shop safely, provided they follow the social distancing rules for all premises,” Prime Minister Johnson said, outlining that shops will be obliged also to enforce new hygiene standards. Retailers have been told to maintain social distancing, make available hand sanitation for staff and customers, limit the number of people in premises, and restrict human contact wherever possible. The government guidelines also advise shops to “limit[] customer handling of merchandise” including the “rotation of high-touch stock”. In effect reducing Britons to children by telling them not to touch things in shops, cabinet minister Michael Gove told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday that the shopping habits that “people may have grown used to in pre-Covid days” have to end. “So when it comes to touching and testing goods, when it comes to trying on clothing, when it comes to trying make-up and so on, that all of us exercise restraint in not doing that and recognise that as these stores reopen, it is a new normal,” Mr Gove said. One guideline has resulted in plans for a peculiar New Normal in Coronavirus UK: quarantining items touched by people. Shop keepers are advised to store items that have been returned or tried on “in a container or separate room for 72 hours”. Kurt Geiger has said that it will quarantine shoes tried on for 24 hours before another customer can try them on, while they have told staff to wear gloves and masks at all times, with cash registers behind perspex screens. Coronavirus ‘Fashion Masks’ Set to Become ‘Essential’ Pandemic Accessory in UK https://t.co/Og6HG4BVQh — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 20, 2020  Before the measures were outlined, major British book retailer Waterstones announced that it would quarantine for three days any unbought books that had come into human contact. The government had previously advised that the virus cannot survive on post and packages — which, like books, are mostly made of paper — and Waterstones was likewise advised the same, but said in late-May that it would still quarantine their books for 72 hours. James Daunt, head of Waterstones, said this month that “book customers are very nice people who behave well”, so will likely follow the rules. “We will still have tables displaying books, but we will have systems in place to ensure books that are browsed do not remain on sale. We will ask customers that pick up a book to put it down on a trolley that we can then wheel away,” Mr Daunt said. Britain is just the latest country in Europe to introduce bizarre shopping rituals under the New Normal. The Dutch have reopened cafes with customers eating in greenhouses, while Italian shops take clients’ temperatures upon entry. And only in Germany could getting stuck in traffic become a party, after organisers staged a drive-in rave to maintain social distancing.

Across the world, the mainstream media are dying a death. Here are the latest newspaper circulation figures from the United Kingdom. Daily Mail: 944,981 (1.13million) Express: 234,373 (289,393) Mirror: 363,082 (442,610) Star: 219,275 (276,453) i paper: 134,553 (215,640) Guardian: 106,003 (129,961) Financial Times: 88,756 (146,373) Neither the Telegraph nor the Times group will disclose their latest figures but we can safely assume they are grim. It’s the same story in the U.S. where, even a month ago, newspapers were reporting an “extinction-level crisis” as advertising began to dry up. So why, having spent a large part of my journalistic career writing for national newspapers, am I so strangely reluctant to give a damn? Simple. I believe the newspapers — and all those TV news channels suffering similar collapse — have brought about their own destruction. The mainstream media have failed in their most basic duty to report on the news. Instead, what they have served up increasingly is politically-driven advertorial and propaganda. Never has this been more painfully obvious than during the coronavirus crisis. Cummings Hits Back at Mainstream Media: If People Are Upset, It’s Your Fault https://t.co/8hfopmg3Qd — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 25, 2020  One day, I believe, in the not too distant future, some very hard questions are going to be asked about the evidence on which governments across the world elected to shut down their economies and put their people under house arrest in what may well turn out to be the most catastrophic collective political misjudgement in history. Traditionally, you might have hoped, the media would have been on hand to query those governments’ decisions at every stage of the process. But they have done nothing of the kind. On the contrary, instead of attempting to sift the available evidence with cool reason, the MSM have done little else but ramp up the hysteria; and instead of holding the political Establishment’s lockdown policies to account, the media have instead acted like its cheerleaders. In the United Kingdom, the media’s performance has been dismal. There was a time, really not so long ago, when British newspapers — tabloids especially — were famed for their fearlessness, robustness, and cussed untameability. But throughout the pandemic, the entirety of Britain’s print media — both left-leaning and right-leaning — has not just pandered to Project Coronavirus Fear but stoked it with such demented enthusiasm it has managed to frighten almost the whole country into a state of abject, bed-wetting terror, spiked with a nasty hint of Stasi-style snitching, handwringing disapproval and nervy paranoia. Sure, there’s a case to be made that lockdown policies are proportionate and sensible a response to an unfamiliar virus. What has been all but absent from the MSM is the increasingly plausible counter-argument: that it has all been a massive overreaction which has done far more damage than the supposed problem. Yes, sometimes, it’s true, various maverick commentators in the op-ed sections have been permitted to make the case for liberty, rationalism, and prosperity. But almost invariably the actual news stories — the main body of the paper, in other words — have a) relentlessly promoted the scare narrative that Covid-19 is an almost unprecedentedly serious threat, and b) relentlessly promoted the official government line that the lockdown is necessary, important and scientifically justified — and also a great national moral endeavour akin to World War II. Stories that contradict the official narratives have either been played down, ignored, or reported very late in the day. Stories that promote the official narrative have been hammered home. One example of this is hydroxychloroquine, which is invariably reported in the MSM as something scary, maverick, hazardous — and which President Trump was quite irresponsible to promote as a potential solution. There are few if any countervailing stories about medics who claim to be using it successfully, and if these run they are always heavily caveated. UK Follows Trump’s Lead, 10,000 Health Workers to Trial Hydroxychloroquine as Preventative https://t.co/YUdcybwZHh — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 21, 2020  The same is true of the reporting on Sweden. There’s an argument that Sweden’s laissez-faire policy towards lockdown — with people left largely free to make up their own minds whether they want to self-isolate or not — will ultimately prove the most sensible and least economically damaging. Yet while you’ll read columnists saying this in the comment sections you’ll almost never see it reported in the news pages. Instead what you get is heavily biased reports like this recent one in the Telegraph: Sweden has now overtaken the UK, Italy and Belgium to have the highest coronavirus per capita death rate in the world, throwing its decision to avoid a strict lockdown into further doubt. According to figures collated by the Our World in Data website, Sweden had 6.08 deaths per million inhabitants per day on a rolling seven-day average between May 13 and May 20. This is the highest in the world, above the UK, Belgium and the US, which have 5.57, 4.28 and 4.11 respectively. However, Sweden has only had the highest death rate over the past week, with Belgium, Spain, Italy, the UK and France, still ahead over the entire course of the pandemic. You’d almost think that the mainstream media do not want Sweden to be proved a success because then it would embarrass those governments which have adopted more draconian policies. And you’d be right, too. The British MSM’s relentless propagandising on behalf to the official government line initially puzzled me. Normally, after all, as happened with Brexit, you might have expected a range of views — some newspapers pro-, some anti-. So why the unanimity on coronavirus? Part of the answer can be found in this government strategy document from March 22nd. It was put together by the behaviour experts who advise the government on how to nudge the public in a particular direction. Perceived threat: A substantial number of people still do not feel sufficiently personally threatened; it could be that they are reassured by the low death rate in their demographic group (8), although levels of concern may be rising (9). Having a good understanding of the risk has been found to be positively associated with adoption of COVID-19 social distancing measures in Hong Kong (10). The perceived level of personal threat needs to be increased among those who are complacent, using hard-hitting emotional messaging. To be effective this must also empower people by making clear the actions they can take to reduce the threat. But how could the government recruit Britain’s diverse and — hitherto — famously intractable media into pushing its propaganda message? Simple. Here is a report from April 20th in the publishing trade press: The UK government has aired a coronavirus public information campaign across print, TV, radio, digital and outdoor since March. The latest iteration of the campaign, which was created by the National Health Service’s ad agency MullenLowe, features frontline health workers and the tagline, “Stay home. Protect the NHS. Save lives.”  Wavemaker is the media agency leading the push. “We recognize the vital role that media organizations, including local newspapers, play in ensuring the provision of reliable, high-quality information during this time,” said a U.K. government spokeswoman. “We also understand the acute pressures newspapers are facing financially due to the steep drop in advertising revenues and the implications of the lockdown on print circulation.” Total government spend? £35 million. Admittedly this is dwarfed by the estimated losses expected to be borne by the British print media this year: Analysts at Enders analysis predict the pandemic will cause the UK newspaper and magazine sector to lose £750 million ($933 million) in ad revenue and £150 million ($187 million) in print sales this year. But in desperate times you’ll accept any lifeline, however flimsy, and it would seem that the flailing, drowning MSM has grabbed it with both hands. The supposedly independent MSM is in fact bought and paid for by the government. (And by other vested interests. Let’s not overlook the many millions the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has given to the BBC.) The British public, it’s true, are still largely in favour of the lockdown and fearful of the coronavirus — so it’s arguable that the MSM is doing no more than being led by its market. But it’s equally arguable that the reason the public remains so cowed and compliant is that the MSM so terrified them with its one-sided reporting that propaganda ended up being mistaken for real news — with devastating consequences for the economy. Could the reason for the collapse in the MSM’s sales partly be that the public are finally waking up to the fact that what they’ve been hearing from the MSM cannot be trusted? And if the result of this failure of trust is the destruction of the MSM, it would be a kind of poetic justice, would it not?

Riyadh (AFP) — Saudi Arabia will end its nationwide coronavirus curfew from June 21, except in the holy city of Mecca, the interior ministry said Tuesday, after more than two months of stringent curbs. Prayers will also be allowed to resume in all mosques outside Mecca from May 31, the ministry said in a series of measures announced on the official Saudi Press Agency. The kingdom, which has reported the highest number of virus cases in the Gulf, imposed a full nationwide curfew during Eid al-Fitr, the Muslim holiday that marks the end of the fasting month of Ramadan. The ministry said it will begin easing restrictions in a phased manner this week, with the curfew relaxed between 6 am and 3 pm between Thursday and Saturday. From Sunday until June 20, the curfew will be further eased until 8 pm, the ministry added. The kingdom will lift the lockdown entirely from June 21. “Starting from Thursday, the kingdom will enter a new phase (in dealing with the pandemic) and will gradually return to normal based on the rules of social distancing,” Health Minister Tawfiq Al-Rabiah said on Monday. Saudi Arabia has reported around 75,000 coronavirus infections and some 400 deaths from COVID-19. In March, Saudi Arabia suspended the year-round “umrah” pilgrimage over fears of the disease spreading in Islam’s holiest cities. That suspension will remain in place, the interior ministry said. Authorities are yet to announce whether they will proceed with this year’s hajj — scheduled for late July — but they have urged Muslims to temporarily defer preparations for the annual pilgrimage. Last year, some 2.5 million faithful travelled to Saudi Arabia from around the world to participate in the hajj, which Muslims are obliged to perform at least once during their lifetime.

The Detroit News reported Monday that Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s (D) husband exploited her position to urge a dock company to put his boat in the water before Memorial Day weekend, despite strict coronavirus guidelines. The paper reported: The owner of a Northern Michigan dock company says Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s husband wanted his boat placed in the water before the Memorial Day weekend as Whitmer urged residents not to rush to the region. No longer visible to the public, Facebook posts from NorthShore Dock LLC and its owner, Tad Dowker, focused on what Dowker said was a request last week by Whitmer’s husband, Marc Mallory. The posts have drawn the attention of Republican state lawmakers, who said the Democratic governor’s family may not be following her guidance for the rest of the state. Whitmer’s spokeswoman, Tiffany Brown, didn’t confirm or deny Monday the assertions by the marina company or its owner. Brown said the administration wouldn’t address “every rumor that is spread online.” When told that there was no way to rush his boat into the water, given that the governor had only recently started lifting restrictions, giving the company little time to handle a crush of requests, her husband reportedly said: ‘I am the husband to the governor, will this make a difference?'” Whitmer has earned praise from the left — and criticism from the right — for her severe, statewide restrictions on a wide variety of economic activities during the coronavirus pandemic, including landscaping and construction (which are permitted even in California). However, she — or her husband — would now appear to have joined the long list of politicians, mostly Democrats, who cannot obey the constraints they seek to impose on others. Joel B.

On Monday’s broadcast of CNN’s “Situation Room,” Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R) stated that while his state has seen a “second spike” of cases, it is difficult to know “exactly where these projections are going.” Because projections and modeling have lost a significant amount of credibility. He also stated the spike is “fairly modest compared to where we are in a lot of other hot spots.” Hutchinson stated, “Well, we’re taking significant action in both opening up our economy, which we never shut down, but also gradually lifting restrictions so we can measure where there is an outbreak or a problem that we have to address. And so, when I said that there’s a second spike that we’re seeing, it’s really hard to know exactly where these projections are going. The projections and modeling [have] lost a lot of credibility. And so, we’re having to dig deep into the data. We’re having to dig deep as to where these cases are, what’s causing those, and that’s what we’re concentrating on. And whenever you look at our numbers, our numbers are very modest, low death rate, compared to other states. We have — our hospitalizations are still less than 100. And so, even though we saw a second spike, it’s fairly modest compared to where we are in a lot of other hot spots. But we have a lot of work to do left. And I know there’s been a lot of coverage, Wolf, about the summer and everybody getting out. It is Memorial Day. We had a service today in Arkansas, socially distanced, wearing masks, the right-sized crowds.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, justified his slow reopening of the state on Monday after President Trump threatened to move the location of the Republican National Convention, currently scheduled to be held in Charlotte from August 24 to August 27, if the governor fails to move more quickly. “North Carolina is relying on data and science to protect our state’s public health,” Cooper said in a statement made in response to the president’s comments on Monday. But a look at the science and the data suggest that a complete reopening of the state is in order now. Protesters who gathered in several locations on Monday calling to “ReOpen NC” agreed. Cooper announced on Wednesday that the state would move to Phase 2 of reopening–which still prohibits bars and gyms from reopening and limits gatherings to ten or fewer–on Friday. Cooper said his Phase 2 “Safer at Home” executive order will remain in effect until at least June 26. “After two weeks in Phase 1, the state’s overall key indicators remain stable but the continued increases in daily case counts signal a need to take a more modest step forward in Phase 2 than originally envisioned,” the governor and North Carolina Health and Human Services Secretary Dr.Mandy Cohen said in Wednesday’s statement. The governor conceded that the data for all major criteria for reopening, except for total number of new cases, have either leveled or decreased. The number of new daily cases has increased, but so too has the number of daily tests administered. The percentage of those tested for COVID-19 who are positive declined from 13 percent on April 26, to eight percent on May 20, the day he made his announcement, and current hospitalizations have remained level: From April 29 to May 18, the number of patients currently hospitalized with COVID-19 declined from 551 to 487, according to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCHHS). In the intervening week, it increased back up to 554 as of May 20, when Gov. Cooper made his announcement. While the number of cases that have tested positive for COVID-19 on a daily basis increased from 380 when 5,688 were tested on April 29 to 422 when 12,595 were tested on May 20, even Gov. Cooper admits the number of those who have been tested for COVID-19 has increased dramatically over that same time period. “North Carolina has more than doubled the daily testing rate with more than 8,000 tests completed daily on average. More than 300 testing sites across North Carolina are posted on the DHHS testing information website,” Cooper acknowledged on Wednesday. WSOC TV reported on Monday’s developments: Cooper allowed the state to enter a second phase of gradual reopening Friday with some further loosening of restrictions on hair salons, barbers and restaurants. But he said the state must continue to closely watch virus trends and has ordered entertainment venues, gyms and bars to remain closed. On Monday, Cooper responded to Trump’s tweet, saying, “State health officials are working with the RNC and will review its plan as they make decisions about how to hold the convention in Charlotte. North Carolina is relying on data and science to protect our state’s public health and safety.” At noon, Mecklenburg County and the city of Charlotte released a joint statement, saying, “We are in constant communication with our local and federal counterparts to plan and prepare for a safe Republican National Convention (RNC). The City of Charlotte, Mecklenburg County and other local stakeholders will continue to plan for the RNC while respecting national and state guidance regarding the pandemic. We are working with stakeholders to develop guidelines for several large events planned for Charlotte in the coming months including the RNC and anticipate providing that guidance in June.” Gov. Cooper has consistently slow walked the reopening of North Carolina, as Breitbart News reported back on April 29 when the governor refused to move the state to Phase 1 before May 8, even though the guidelines for Phase 1 reopening had been met more than a week earlier. Cooper did not directly address the state’s apparently expanding problem of COVID-19 nursing home deaths in either his statement on Wednesday announcing Phase 2, or in his responses to the president on Monday. As of April 29, there were 187 deaths from long term care facilities (nursing homes and residential care facilities) in North Carolina, or 49 percent of all COVID-19 deaths, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. In the subsequent four weeks, deaths from long-term care facilities have increased as a percentage of all COVID-19 deaths in North Carolina. According to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, data provided by NCHHS showed that, as of Tuesday May 19, the state had 436 COVID-19 nursing home deaths, or 63 percent of the total COVID-19 related deaths in the state. The NCHHS website reported that as of Friday, nursing homes and residential care facility COVID-19 deaths totaled 458, or 63 percent of the state’s 728 COVID-19 deaths as of that time. (Total COVID-19 deaths in North Carolina as of Monday had increased to 754.)

The net worth of the United States’ billionaire class has increased by $434 billion during lockdown orders implemented by most states to slow the spread of the Chinese coronavirus. Between March 18 and May 19, the nation’s more than 600 billionaires have increased their net wealth by 15 percent from $2.9 trillion in March to now nearly $3.4 trillion, even as more than 36 million Americans are jobless. The analysis of Forbes data, conducted by researchers with the left-leaning Americans for Tax Fairness group, detailed how the wealth of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Microsoft Co-Founder Bill Gates, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffet, and Oracle CEO Larry Ellison has increased by $75.5 billion since the nation’s coronavirus lockdowns began in March. These five billionaires’ growth in net wealth, alone, accounted for 21 percent of all the wealth growth over the last two months among the more than 600 billionaires in the U.S. (Americans for Tax Fairness) (Americans for Tax Fairness) Jeff Bezos, alone, has increased his net wealth by almost $35 billion, or 30.6 percent, since the beginning of the coronavirus lockdowns that forced small and medium-sized businesses to close while big businesses like Wal-Mart, Target, Amazon and Amazon-owned Whole Foods, and Walgreens were allowed to remain open as they were deemed “essential.” While Bezos has grown his wealth, whistleblowers at Amazon have been fired after they revealed outbreaks of the coronavirus at their warehouses. In an exclusive interview with Breitbart News, a whistleblower said he was fired after he exposed a coronavirus outbreak. “We all should have been quarantined with pay,” said former Amazon worker Chris Smalls said. “The building should have been shut down immediately. But that didn’t happen. By the end of the week, Saturday, March 28th, they decided to quarantine me and only me, none of the employees, not even the person I ride to work with every day. So that tells you right there, they put a target on my back to silence me, but what I did was I mobilized a walkout on March 30th that resulted in my termination.” Economists have noted that the wealthiest of Americans, members of the top one percent, are paying a lower tax rate than all other Americans. In 2018, the richest Americans paid a 23 percent tax rate — a 47 percent drop since 1950, when their tax rate was 70 percent. House Democrats’ coronavirus relief package offered the rich even more of a bailout with a provision that would eliminate the cap on the little-known SALT tax deduction. In short, the provision would give millionaires and billionaires more than $100,000 in tax windfalls for the next two years. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

The coronavirus pandemic led to the closure of schools across the United States, leaving districts scrambling to arrange online learning. In Florida that included catering to minors who say it is upsetting that their birth name instead of their chosen name is used when logging in and, in some cases, “outing” those students who have not revealed they are “transgender.” A school district in Jacksonville, Florida, is tweaking its log on protocol to allow students to change their name, according to USA Today: When students log on to Duval HomeRoom — the Duval County school district’s online hub for distance learning — their school-assigned email account or a Microsoft TEAMS video session with their teacher, their legal name is displayed for all to see. For transgender students who go by a different name, it’s a constant sting. “Each and every time I log on to the website to complete my daily assignments, seeing my birth name makes me uncomfortable,” said one student, whom The Florida Times-Union did not name for privacy. “It also makes me uncomfortable to interact with other students, as well as my teachers because I don’t want people to see my birth name on the screen, I want them to see my true one instead, that I plan to go by for the rest of my life.” The student said the practice makes day-to-day tasks like attendance a nuisance because they don’t want teachers and classmates to perceive them differently. “Some of my classmates don’t even know that I am transgender,” a Duval County student said in the USA Today report. “Seeing my birth name is a dead giveaway to that.” “When home learning was launched due to the pandemic, the district developed a process to provide support in the virtual-learning environment,” Duval Schools spokeswoman Sonya Duke-Bolden said in the USA Today report. “The district has been actively providing support to students whenever issues, concerns or challenges arise.” The article noted that the policy has nothing to do with making a legal name change but only applies to the school’s online login system. “No school districts in Florida are changing or removing a student’s legal name without a court order,” said Ian Siljestrom, the associate director of the Safe and Healthy Schools program at Equality Florida. He went on: School districts are simply adding an affirmed name within their existing student information system to ensure that legal names are not a barrier to student success. When an affirmed name is used, a student’s mental and emotional health improves, positively impacting their grades and attendance. Duke-Bolden said in the USA Today article that other schools in Florida are also putting these kinds of measures in place but that it various from school to school, including one that requires a note from parents if the student is a minor — something LGBT activists say is a “red flag” and that children know themselves better than their parents. “According to Trinity Baker, student support coordinator at JASMYN — Jacksonville’s LGBTQ youth center — a parent sign-off is a red flag,’” USA Today reported. She added: That would be an issue in outing students who we know don’t know the safety of their home environments. I can see where we might see some pushback and negative responses to this, but we must trust our children to know themselves better than anyone else. USA Today cites a report from the discredited Southern Poverty Law Center that claimed LGBT students are suffering being away from social clubs backed by Gay Straight Alliance, an organization that has pushed its agenda in U.S. public schools for decades.

Monday on MSNBC, former Rep. Donna Edwards (D-MD) accused President Donald Trump of being “incompetent” and “incoherent” in his messaging. On political conventions amid the coronavirus pandemic, Edwards said, “I think it’s really good for the base to gin up their energy to go back to their states and be enthusiastic and excited going back to help the candidate, help the nominee. But the reality is, Democrats are trying to figure out how to have either a safe convention or ways in which their delegates can engage that keep them healthy. I don’t know what Republicans are doing. I think Governor Cooper to his credit is really trying to look out for the health and safety of North Carolinians, and also, all of those who would come and go, maybe carrying this virus.” Edwards added, “But look, this is a referendum on Donald Trump. And I think the Biden campaign and Democrats understand that and let the president be out there all he wants. And every day, he looks more incompetent and more incoherent in terms of the message he wants to send to the American people.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Three-time Olympic gold medalist Shaun White granted a special request from some small but enthusiastic fans on Wednesday.     When you drive by a request like this you can’t say no. Definitely brought back some memories seeing these kids killing it on their starter ramp in the neighborhood, so I stopped to skate with them from a safe distance. Hard to see cuz the masks but I was stoked to put smiles on some young faces during these tough times and these kids definitely brightened my day… thanks for the session 😷🏻 A post shared by  Shaun White (@shaunwhite) on May 19, 2020 at 5:13pm PDT In an undeniably adorable video posted to Instagram on May 20, legendary snowboarder and skateboarder Shaun White stops his car to grant a special request. White, wearing a mask and carefully distant from the children amid the global COVID-19 pandemic, can be seen pulling some basic tricks on small wooden ramps set up for the children, who eagerly watched. In between his own miniature runs, White can be seen clapping and cheering the children on as they make heroic attempts to imitate the extreme sports star. The post has already garnered more than 200,000 likes as of the time of this writing. “When you drive by a request like this you can’t say no.

Monday on MSNBC, Rep. Bobby Rush (D-IL) discussed the Trump administration supporting Republican State Rep. Darren Bailey’s lawsuit challenging Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s (D-IL) stay-at-home order. Host Katy Tur said, “I want to get your reaction to the DOJ’s lawsuit, and here’s what they say in a statement, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. ‘The governor of Illinois has over the past two months sought to rely on authority under the Illinois emergency management agency to impose sweeping limitations on nearly all aspects of life for citizens of Illinois, Significantly impairing in some instances their ability to maintain their economic livelihoods.’ What’s your response to that?” Rush said, “I think that that suit is insane. Not only insane, but it’s an inane suit. The governor of Illinois has done an outstanding job in terms of trying to keep Illinois safe, keep us healthy, keep this disease contained. We’re all uncomfortable, but at least we’re alive, some of us.” He added, “I think the governor has done an outstanding job leading this state to put us in a position where we can contain this dreaded disease. So I applaud the governor. I stand behind him. I’ll certainly advocate for the measures that he’s taking. It’s inconvenient. What is inconvenient when you’re talking about lives? Particularly for our senior citizens, for those who are poor, those who are sitting on the sideline. The governor is doing a fantastic job. A very courageous job. I absolutely, beyond a shadow of a doubt, stand shoulder to shoulder with him, no matter what arises from the suit. What misguided people — whatever actions they may take.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

The U.S. economy is on the mend. The coronavirus and shutdown orders were devastating for the U.S. economy, sending unemployment to record highs and output crashing at the fastest pace in modern history. But there are several signs that the worst hits from the shutdowns are in the rearview mirror and that the economy has begun to recover. It’s not exactly off to the races, however. We were laid low and now we’re up again, limping but moving ahead. Forget the debate over what alphabetical symbol or piece of athletic equipment the recovery will resemble. Unlike a V or a W or even hockey stick, the economy is a process without an end. The gauges we use to measure the economy, such as gross domestic product, are at best rough outlines that attempt to describe conditions created through an endless series of exchanges of products and services through the mediums of currencies and credit. But by looking at various measures of activity, we can get a sense for whether our economic activity is contracting further, stagnating, or expanding. And many of those available to us as “high frequency” or “real-time” data suggest recovery has already begun. Rail traffic, for instance, has been climbing for five weeks after tumbling dramatically in mid-February and then falling through the following 10 weeks. The upswing has not been anywhere near as sharp as the downturn, however, which suggests the recovery is proceeding slowly and, perhaps, deliberately. Data on driving and walking provided by Apple, based on requests for directions from its map application, also indicates increased activity. A week ago or so, requests for driving routes moved up beyond the mid-January baseline Apple uses to represent pre-coronavirus America. It dropped off again, below the baseline, and returned this weekend. What’s more, walking directions are up above the baseline for the first time. Transit requests are still below the norm. Some of this recovery is seasonal. More people are out driving and walking because the weather has turned far nicer in much of the country. People are not sheltering in place, staying home, as much as they did in March and April, when it was unseasonable cool in much of the country. But seeing some regular seasonal behavior is a sign that the economy is on the mend.  We still do not know if warmer weather will temper the rate of coronavirus infections but we do know it has decreased the propensity for Americans to avoid venturing out. That’s very important. It suggests that many Americans will be willing to return to work and return to other forms of economic activity, such as shopping in non-essential stores, even if we do not have a vaccine or certainty on how to treat the virus. Hotel reservations have been rising for a few weeks now. And there is evidence that this is more than a seasonal effect. All forms of mobility requests from Apple maps are now 16 percent above the January baseline in the U.S. But that is not true everywhere else we would expect to see a similar seasonal boost. Germany is down 8 percent. Italy is down 25 percent. The U.K. is down 35 percent. Air travel is up. The daily tracking of people passing through TSA checkpoints rose to 348,673 on Friday, the highest point since the outbreak hit. A month earlier, less than 100,000 people flew. The latest figures are still far below the 2.7 million who flew a year ago. Restaurant reservations have picked up from almost non-existent in early May, according to data from OpenTable. As the month opened, reservation volumes were down 99.9 percent compared with a year prior. Now they are down 87.8 percent. That’s better than Canada, U.K., Ireland, an Australia. Germany, however, has seen a massive recovery from 100 percent in early May to a 54 percent decline this weekend. Home sales tumbled in April but did not melt away completely as some expected. Applications for building permits were well above expectations in April, as were housing starts. There will be an avalanche of negative news in the weeks to come. Jobless numbers are likely to show layoffs continue, with millions losing their jobs every week. But the pace of layoffs has slowed, with each week coming in lower the last. But the official unemployment rate, already at a record, will likely climb higher before it begins to moderate. Most forecasters seeing it remaining elevated into early next year. And the GDP numbers for the second quarter will likely confirm that we are in a deep recession. Most forecasters think the economy will shrink at an annualized rate of 40 percent in the second quarter after contracting at a 4.8 percent rate in the first quarter. But it is expected to bounce back in the third and fourth quarters, although the economy will likely end the year 6 to 7 percent smaller than it was at the end of 2019. But those quaterly figures can conceal the fact that the real economy doesn’t really have quarters. It has months, weeks, days, and moments. And while April and May were horrendous in many ways, the second half of May looks better than the first half and June looks even more promising.      

The popular Theodore Roosevelt Park located on an island in the Potomac River in Washington, DC, is not accessible by car because the parking lot is closed, but walking trails are still open, according to local radio station WTOP. An article listing outdoor venues where people can get out of the house and stay safe included Theodore Roosevelt Park, which is also a popular spot for watching planes take off and land at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.. “Over on Theodore Roosevelt Island, get a good workout in and then take a stroll along one of the three walking trails,” WTOP reported. The National Park Service’s web page on Theodore Roosevelt Park has a coronavirus banner: Following guidance from the White House, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and state and local public health authorities, we are increasing access and services in a phased approach across all units of the National Park System. Before visiting a park, please check the park website to determine its operating status. Updates about the overall NPS response to COVID-19, including safety information, are posted on www.nps.gov/coronavirus. Two bullets points on the website homepage state: • In an effort to slow the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) and encourage social distancing, the parking lot at Theodore Roosevelt Island is closed. • Public restrooms are currently unavailable on Theodore Roosevelt Island, so please plan your visit accordingly. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has announced that the nation’s capital will start Stage 1 reopening on Friday, May 29. The park authorities could not be reached to ask about the parking lot decision due to the national holiday. Follow Penny Starr on Twitter.

A historic Massachusetts drive-in cinema reopened on Memorial Day to sold-out screenings after the state lifted coronavirus restrictions on certain businesses as part of its phased approach to restarting its economy. The Mendon Twin Drive-In cinema kicked off the holiday with midnight screenings of Jurassic Park and The Rocky Horror Picture Show, with both movies selling out, according to multiple reports. The cinema, located in Worcester County, first opened in 1954 and is regarded as one of the best drive-in theaters in the country. Watch below:   Drive-in’s have seen a resurgence in popularity in several states during the coronavirus era, offering moviegoers the communal cinematic experience with natural social distancing. In Florida, two new drive-in movie theaters are coming soon to the Miami area. In New York, moviegoers will be able to watch the big screen in Yankee Stadium’s parking lot as part of the “Uptown Drive-In Experience,” a festival that will take place each weekend this summer. Demand is also strong in states including Texas and New Jersey as most regular cinemas remain closed due to the Chinese coronavirus. But in New Mexico, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D) has reportedly halted the reopening of a popular drive-in movie theater despite local city officials believing it would be legal. Massachusetts began its phase one reopening last week, allowing a limited number of businesses to resume operations and to welcome back customers. Businesses including construction, manufacturing, and real estate were allowed to reopen May 18 while drive-ins, barbershops, and others were allowed to resume on Memorial Day.

Appearing Monday on MSNBC, network contributor Dr. Vin Gupta suggested that lawmakers should mandate mask usage to combat further spread of Chinese coronavirus, comparing the proposal to the ban on smoking inside public facilities. MSNBC’s Dr. Vin Gupta: “We should make masks mandatory in public. Just like we ban indoor smoking, because you know what? You shouldn’t have to breathe somebody else’s secondhand smoke. I shouldn’t have to breathe exhaled Covid-19 in somebody’s breath.” pic.twitter.com/9N61Pjf2uw — Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) May 25, 2020  A partial transcript is as follows:  CRAIG MELVIN: Would requiring masks across the board help? Is that feasible? DR. VIN GUPTA: I’m going to say this for the benefit of your family — I know you have young kids — for my family, and for all Americans, we should make masks mandatory in public, just like we ban indoor smoking, because you know what? You shouldn’t have to breathe somebody else’s secondhand smoke. I shouldn’t have to breathe exhaled COVID-19 in somebody’s breath. Nobody should. We should institute mandatory masks in public when you can’t guarantee social distancing. That means retail stores, public transportation, workplaces. That’s absolutely where we should be heading. It makes no sense we’re not already there. People are flouting the rules. A security guard at a retail outlet in Michigan died trying to encourage a customer to wear a mask. They shot him because they didn’t like the way it was trying to be enforced, that policy. We need to not put the onus on security guards at local outlets to enforce this policy or to encourage Americans to abide by it. It’s all in our interests that we wear masks. The evidence is overwhelming. We just need governors to do their job.

Monday on CNN’s “Newsroom,” network host and political commentator S.E. Cupp accused President Donald Trump of being “not healthy and not well,” amid the coronavirus pandemic. On Trump’s coronavirus response, Cupp said, “I think we should say, this has long gone past offensive, and distasteful. I think what we’re seeing is the president losing it. I don’t think the president’s behavior is that of a healthy, stable, balanced person, that he can’t spend all of his energy, efforts and attention on this global pandemic, on securing the physical and economic safety and health of this country is very alarming. Instead, devolving down these rabbit holes of conspiracy theories, baseless conspiracy theories as you pointed out, attacking women for their looks and their weight, you know, threatening governors, one in Michigan for mail-in voting, another in North Carolina for not guaranteeing a full house at the RNC. This is not how a healthy controlled person would behave at all, let alone during a pandemic, and on a weekend meant to honor the memories of our fallen soldiers. I think it’s time for us to just call this what it is. The president is not well.” On Trump’s tweets over the weekend, Cupp said, “I say this is beyond offensive, because of course it’s offensive, it’s grotesque, it’s not healthy behavior to do that. It’s not helping him. It’s not helping his own cause politically. I saw some members of his own party in Congress tweeting at him. Please stop doing this. This is not helpful. This is not productive. So there’s no good reason why he’s acting this way, which leads me to believe, I think what anyone can plainly see is obvious, that he’s not healthy and not well and at the worst possible time for our country to have someone in charge who cannot master basic control and discipline to focus on this incredibly serious task at hand.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

A World War II veteran about to turn 100 years old in June has made it his quest to walk 100 miles to raise money for those suffering financially from the coronavirus pandemic. Mickey Nelson, who turns 100 this June, is calling his quest “Walking to 100,” and chose the Salvation Army to receive the donations he receives from his endeavor, according to a statement from the Salvation Army. Nelson said he was inspired by a British army veteran who did 100 laps in his garden to raise millions of pounds for the United Kingdom’s National Health Service. “I know that people are struggling, either from the illness or a job loss from all the businesses shutting down,” said Nelson, who lives in Clarks Grove, Minnesota. “I just thought there was something I could do to help.” Nelson has lived in Clarks Grove — a small city 90 miles away from Minneapolis — his entire life, with the exception of when he went off to fight in World War II. He still lives in the same house he was born in back in 1920, according to the Salvation Army. Nelson maintained tanks during World War II, owned a thriving bus business for 58 years, as well as a successful sand and gravel company. Since mid-March, nearly 22 percent of Minnesotans, or 700,000 people, have filed for unemployment. The state’s unemployment rate skyrocketed to 8.1 percent in April, marking the highest its been since 1983. Nelson selected the Salvation Army Northern Division to receive the proceeds he gets from his walk. The charity provides food and emergency assistance to North Dakota and Minnesota. “We have been working very hard to help those in need since mid-March. Our staff is working overtime and our resources are being stretched like never before,” said Lt. Colonel Lonneal Richardson, commander of The Salvation Army Northern Division. “But this effort being made by Mickey is truly selfless, and we are grateful for and inspired by his efforts.” Those who wish to donate to Mickey’s cause can do so by going to SalvationArmyNorth.org/mickey.

Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro once again joined a large crowd of supporters on the streets on Sunday, this time in Brasilia, hugging children and shaking hands in defiance of medical advice to engage in social distancing. Bolsonaro’s display – he flew a helicopter to the rally and took his mask off before engaging the crowd – occurred hours before President Donald Trump announced a ban on entry into America of non-U.S. citizens who have been in Brazil in the last 14 days. Trump has imposed similar measures, most famously his ban on Chinese nationals and visitors to China, in response to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. Brazil has currently documented more coronavirus cases than any nation on earth except America, not counting suspected fraudulent numbers from hard-hit nations such as China and Iran. Sunday’s rally congregated outside of the presidential palace in Brasilia, the nation’s capital, in support of Bolsonaro amid mounting potential scandals, most prominently accusations by former Minister of Justice Sergio Moro that Bolsonaro’s administration was not committed to fighting corruption in the government. Bolsonaro, a conservative, won the presidency largely by campaigning against the widespread corruption of socialist politicians. Moro joined the administration after leading an investigation that led to the conviction and imprisonment of former socialist President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Brazilian newspaper O Globo reported that Bolsonaro donned a mask to get on a Brazilian Air Force helicopter to visit his supporters, flanked by several cabinet members, but took the mask off once he approached the crowd. Video from the event shows the crowd yelling supportive slogans at the president, including referring to him by their nickname for him, “the legend,” and seeking to shake hands. The crowd appears tightly packed together and many wore soccer shirts display the yellow and green of the Brazilian flag. In several videos, Bolsonaro can be seen, without a mask, embracing a small girl and giving a boy in a Neymar shirt a piggyback ride. O Globo noted that the state government that controls Brasilia has made it illegal to be out in public without a mask. Bolsonaro described the event in one video as a “spontaneous rally by the people” and a sign of the health of Brazil’s democracy.   As in the United States, Brazil’s governments have the power of calling for specific public health measures if they deem necessary. Many have done so, often against open challenges from Bolsonaro, who has dismissed the pandemic as a “little flu” and warned against collapsing Brazil’s economy in the name of protecting citizens from infection. In addition to criticism from governors, who imposed regulations to prevent mass gatherings and encourage mask use, reports began to surface in April that Brazil’s criminal drug gangs had begun hiring doctors to go into the nation’s favelas, or slums, to care for the poor who live there and showed symptoms of the Chinese coronavirus. “The virus is here, we’re going to have to confront it. Confront it like a man, not a boy,” Bolsonaro told supporters at another rally in Brasilia in March. “We’re all going to die one day.” Bolsonaro has challenged lockdown measures by going out in public and encouraging crowds to form, urging Brazilians to patronize local businesses and engage in normal daily life. “What I have said from the beginning is that ‘we are going to be careful, the over-65s stay at home.’ We just can’t stand still, there is fear because if you don’t die of the disease, you starve,” Bolsonaro said during a public appearance in March. Bolsonaro is 65 years old. “Brazil cannot stop or we’ll turn into Venezuela,” he said in another public appearance against the lockdown. As a candidate, Bolsonaro campaigned on curbing growing Chinese Communist Party influence in the country, warning that “the Chinese are not buying in Brazil. They are buying Brazil.” As president, however, Bolsonaro has actively encouraged communist investment, traveling to Beijing in October and signing eight economic agreements with dictator Xi Jinping. Bolsonaro also gifted Xi a soccer shirt. The Communist Party actively discouraged measures to contain the Chinese coronavirus during the early days of the outbreak, most prominently opposing travel bans on Chinese citizens. On Sunday, President Donald Trump announced a travel ban on non-U.S. citizens who have been present in Brazil in the past 14 days – the believed incubation period of the Chinese coronavirus – taking effect on May 28. The ban mirrors similar, and widely criticized, action Trump took regarding travel to China at the peak of the outbreak there. Bolsonaro’s administration, which has enjoyed friendly relations with Washington since the president took over in 2019, has urged against perceiving the ban as a slight against Brazil in particular, noting that Trump imposed similar travel limitations on other countries with high numbers of coronavirus cases. At press time, Brazil has documented 363,211 cases of Chinese coronavirus and 22,666 deaths. Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.

Monday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Sen. Gary Peters (D-MI) accused President Donald Trump of extreme “hypocrisy” over his objections to mass vote by mail in light of the coronavirus pandemic. Host Joe Scarborough asked, “The president has been attacking Michigan repeatedly, attacking the governor. Now claiming that Michigan’s doing something inappropriate as it relates to absentee ballots. Tell us what’s going on there. Is Michigan doing anything differently now than it’s done in the past under Republican governorships? Peters said, “Well, it’s outrageous what the president has been saying about absentee voting and the ability for folks in Michigan to request an absentee ballot. In 2018, we had a proposal on the ballot, and the folks here in the state voted by a very large majority to have the right to request an absentee ballot for no reason. Prior to that, you had to be a senior citizen or verify that you were going to be out of town. Now anybody can ask to have a ballot sent to their home and vote. The president apparently doesn’t like that. And yet it is the constitutional right of everybody here in Michigan to be able to exercise their right to vote, to have the ballot on their kitchen table to be able to take time to think through the various issues and to vote.” “And yet this president is saying that that is wrong,” he continued. “And the amount of hypocrisy is extreme given the fact that my understanding is that the president nearly every time he has voted, he votes by mail. Everybody in Michigan should have the right to be able to vote by mail as well. And it is all we’re seeing from the secretary of state now. She’s mailing out applications to folks here in the state asking whether or not they would like to vote by mail. It is their right and to threaten holding back funding for that is simply outrageous.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

The coronavirus-era phenomenon of weekly public applause for medical workers has taken a less positive turn, as opponents of Britain’s Conservative government have called on followers to indulge in a public shaming ceremony. Plans to give opponents of the government a chance to vent their frustration in a united public show of “hate” — an emotion invoked by many in their writings about the plan online — has metastasised on social media, apparently in response to the prime minister’s decision to stand by the pro-Brexit special adviser Dominic Cummings. Mr Cummings acting as a flashpoint for anti-government “hate” underlines the way attitudes towards the 2016 Brexit referendum still acts as the greatest faultline in British politics — even during coronavirus. As a guarantor within the government for Brexit being delivered as promised — and having only recently thwarted a plan to delay Brexit again, cooked up while he and Mr Johnson were incapacitated with the virus — Mr Cummings has made himself plenty of enemies. Twitter blue-tick anti-Brexit musician-comedian Vikki Stone — cited by local news media as instrumental in setting up the idea of launching a ‘Boo for Boris’ — told the Derby Telegraph that the fact Mr Cummings was not resigning was “beyond what is acceptable”. This is getting a lot of online traction #booforboris https://t.co/M2C2YFhAH8 — Owen Jones says join a union🌹 (@OwenJones84) May 25, 2020  Calling the planned nationwide expression of hate “cathartic”, Stone said opponents of the government should tell “those in power that we are angry”. The concept since been shared or promoted by such luminaries as The Guardian‘s Owen Jones, and sometimes of the BBC John Sweeney. Just in case the nature of the present feeling against the prime minister and his adviser Dominic Cummings was not clear enough, the Orwellian mood music was underlined Saturday when an enormous television screen was parked outside Cummings’ house. Footage from journalists camped outside the property hoping for a glimpse of the special adviser showed part of the video was a close up on the prime minister’s face discussing the lockdown.

What started out as a voluntary expression of support for carers quickly took on more authoritarian tones in some neighbourhoods, however, with one notable incident reflecting the leverage of social shame to punish individuals not turning out to applaud. As Breitbart London reported in April, a hard-worked British mother found herself too tired to take part and was subsequently named and shamed by an online mob. Explaining she had had a “rough night” with her child, the woman said at the time of her community turning against her: “I was mortified. The post said everyone else turned out and I showed the street up and if I can’t spend a minute showing my appreciation I don’t deserve to use the NHS if I or my family get ill… It’s really disturbing how quickly people are ready to turn on each other and ‘report’ each other.” Online Mob 'Names and Shames' British Mother for Not Clapping for NHS https://t.co/38uAiZHpMo — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 25, 2020 

Reports from across the Middle East, Africa, and Asia this weekend described Muslims ignoring coronavirus lockdown bans on large gatherings to celebrate Eid al-Fitr, the end of the Ramadan holiday season, usually celebrated in a highly social manner. A lockdown was imposed in Iraq for the duration of the Eid holiday, for example, and while some Muslims used social media to celebrate without meeting in person, others insisted on gathering at homes and in mosques. The Palestinian Authority felt obliged to ease its coronavirus restrictions after large numbers of Palestinians ignored them to fill the streets and demand the right to hold Eid prayers and celebrations.  After a throng of demonstrators marched to PA security headquarters in Hebron chanting “Allahu Akbar! We want to celebrate Eid al-Fitr!” officials announced that mosques in nearly a dozen towns would be allowed to open for Eid prayers.  In parts of the West Bank where the lockdown remained in effect, Muslims ignored the restrictions to stage large prayer services on streets and in sports arenas, leading to some clashes with security officers and several reports of injury from gunfire. Many business owners also defied the lockdown to open their shops, since Eid is one of their most important shopping holidays. “What we saw in the past 24 hours was a mini-intifada against the harsh restrictions imposed by the Palestinian government. The people feel that these measures are exaggerated. If people are allowed to go to shopping malls, why can’t they pray at their mosques?” one resident of Hebron told the Jerusalem Post. In Egypt, the staff of an isolation hospital in Alexandria defied a government ban to hold a large Eid prayer service. They also handed out balloons, snacks, and toys to their patients. The hospital director noted that in consideration for especially sick patients who need their rest, prayer chants were only broadcast over the public address system a few times. Defiance of the lockdown was widespread in Kabul, Afghanistan, as people filled the streets to buy traditional Eid treats and gifts. The Afghan government urged citizens to respect the lockdown because coronavirus cases spiked over the past ten days, raising fears that Eid celebrations will cause a new outbreak. “We are concerned that if the lockdown is not imposed properly, the number of cases will get out of control and beyond our capacity to treat or test them. We want a strict lockdown,” said Deputy Health Minister Waheed Majroh at a press conference on Saturday. Packed mosques were reported in Indonesia despite the coronavirus pandemic:  Muslims were also seen defying pandemic controls to celebrate Eid in Africa, with crowds gathering to pray at mosques in Cameroon and Nigeria.  Nigerian officials lifted most of the pandemic restrictions and attended large prayer services themselves, along with top religious officials. One Eid prayer service was held in an open field large enough to accommodate tens of thousands of people. Hundreds crowded into numerous mosques across the country, with very little attention paid to social distancing protocols, although a few imams reported lower-than-normal attendance due to coronavirus concerns. “We are here to pray, so I don’t think it is necessary to wear a nose mask or leave a space between myself and the next person,” one mosque attendee explained. Public officials were said to be dismayed that one of the few restrictions they left in place, a ban on women and children attending Eid services, was widely ignored. Cameroon saw thousands of Muslims gather for Eid prayers despite a strict ban on such assemblies. The police used force to disperse several gatherings during the Ramadan season and shuttered at least 13 mosques for defying lockdown orders. Government officials expressed surprise that so many citizens were ignoring their safety instructions, while defiant citizens explained it would have been disrespectful to the Quran if they failed to perform Eid prayers in public with other worshipers. Some Cameroonian Muslim leaders urged their followers to at least observe social distancing practices if they insisted on holding Eid group prayers and celebrations.

Dominic Cummings has criticised the establishment media for making false reports about his lockdown while suffering from coronavirus, claims which he said resulted in threats of violence against him and his family. Mr Cummings had rejected media claims that he had driven from London to Durham simply to stay with his parents, rather that he had stayed at an isolated cottage on his father’s farm, “worried if my wife and I were ill, there was no one in London that we could reasonably ask to look after my child”. He said had arranged for two nieces aged 17 and 20, whom he said were old enough to look after a child but young enough to be out of the danger zone, to be on standby if both he and his wife Mary were incapacitated by Chinese coronavirus. He added that he did not interact with people while ill, did not visit or stay with his parents, and food was brought to his family by relatives and left outside of the property. The activist media has been giving wall-to-wall reporting of claims that Mr Cummings had repeatedly broken the lockdown laws, echoing calls for the prime minister’s trusted adviser — a Vote Leave alumnus who seeks to drain the Westminster swamp and purge the Remain-backing Civil Service (at times referred to as the British “Deep State”) — to be fired. Mr Cummings told reporters in the gardens of Downing Street on Monday evening: “I think there is understandable [public] anger, but a lot of that anger is based on reports in the media that have not been true. It’s extremely regrettable, but the media that were reporting some of these things that were wrong were told they were wrong, but they reported them anyway. “And that has caused a lot of anger. I know. People have shouted at me in the street: ‘Why did you go back? Why did you go back to see your parents just because you wanted to?’ But I did not do that.” He added that due to the intense scrutiny by the media, “I was subjected to threats of violence. People came to my house shouting threats. There were posts on social media encouraging attacks.” Boris Adviser Cummings Squashed Plan to Delay Real Brexit Concocted While He and PM Had Covid https://t.co/OW7YXEm7Mb — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 24, 2020  “Stories that I returned to Durham on April 13th are false and that I returned on April 19th. Data on my phone, such as texts and pictures, can prove this,” he added. “I don’t regret what I did. I think reasonable people may well disagree about how I thought about what to do in the circumstances, but I think what I did was actually reasonable in these circumstances. The rules made clear that if you are dealing with small children, that can be exceptional circumstances. “And I think that the situation that I was in was exceptional circumstances and the way that I dealt with it was the least risk to everybody concerned if my wife and I had both been unable to look after our four-year-old,” he rationalised. “I would stress to people that they should not believe everything they read in the newspapers and everything they see on TV. Because lots of things that are reported are not, in fact, the case,” he urged the British public. Breitbart London reported on Sunday that while he and the prime minister were “laid out on their sickbeds” with coronavirus, they were working to squash a plan by Remainers to extend the transition period, delaying a clean-break from the EU.

Actress Rosanna Arquette says removing “fascist” lawmakers from government will be one outcome from the Chinese coronavirus pandemic in the U.S., where she says the death toll will eventually rise to millions. “We’ve handled this so poorly in America, the pandemic — we didn’t have an incredible president like (Prime Minister Jacinda) Ardern in New Zealand. We handled this in such a terrible way that now it will spread and kill, I think, millions. It’s terrifying,” the Pulp Fiction and The Whole Nine Yards actress said in an interview with AFP. Deaths in the U.S from COVID-19 (at press time) were just over 98,000. “Women are powerful. They’re smart. And they’re mothers. And so they have a natural instinct to protect, and immediately take care.” Arquette — a hardcore #MeToo activist, who proudly says “I’m voting for Biden,” despite Biden facing sexual assault allegations — also told the outlet that one solution to the pandemic will be riding the U.S. government of fascists. “And I believe that the young people that are coming up are going to be voting. And we’re going to get rid of these people that are so fascist (in) government,” she said, without naming who the fascists in government needing removing are. Actress Rosanna Arquette kneels in front of American flags. Arquette captioned her now-deleted tweet: “I’ll never stand for the flag again.” “We’re seeing that big money rules everything, and that very well may continue,” Arquette, whose net worth is estimated at about $9 million, said. “But so many human beings are seeing that this is just not fair. It’s unfair on every level.” (Does Rosanna Arquette know or care to know that her candidate Joe Biden was raking in “big money” with the help of a top Amazon leader six months ago… and now he’s bashing… wait for it… Amazon)?  .@JoeBiden We pay every cent owed. You spent 3 decades in the Senate & know that Congress wrote these tax laws to encourage companies to invest in the US economy. We have. 500k jobs w/ a min wage of $15/hr across 40 states.

ROME — Two and a half months of forced lockdown has pushed many married couples into crisis, Italian media report, and divorce filings have seen a whopping 30 percent increase since the outbreak began. Marriage counselors took to Skype and WhatsApp to help struggling couples cope with the stress of lost jobs and extended co-confinement during the 67 days of national lockdown but this did not stop the surge in requests for divorce, Corriere della Sera reported last week. According to accounts related by counselors, the irritation caused by everything from badly squeezed toothpaste tubes, socks left on the floor, suspicious phone calls, and tight shared spaces has been magnified by the extended lockdown, resulting in a run on the divorce courts. The occasional relief of home tensions from a dip in the sea or a walk in the woods was no longer an option, resulting in homes becoming virtual pressure cookers, with prolonged silence alternating with outbreaks of angry shouting, recriminations, and even domestic violence. For this reason Italy’s National Lawyers Council made the decision to allow couples in certain regions to request divorce by email, to be followed by an online hearing to be conducted virtually by the lawyers, without the participation of the parties. One marriage counselor, Annamaria Bernardini de Pace, says she received no less than sixty emails after the lockdown began and when phase 2 was launched on May 4, twelve couples initiated divorce proceedings. “One client of mine kicked her husband out of the house, who had to go back and live with his mother,” she said. “In the auto-certification, he wrote that he needed to take care of her because she was sick.” According to Gian Ettore Gassani, president of the Italian association of marriage counselors, a number of marriages fell apart because affairs were discovered. “One husband hoped to get away with the excuse of the mile-long line at the supermarket,” Gassani said. “In reality he was visiting his lover, who was also the next-door neighbor, and he sent another person to the supermarket in his place.” “The problem was that his wife became suspicious and followed him,” Gassani added. “The result was that they called me at one o’clock in the morning and I don’t know who was screaming more, the wife or the husband.” In just two days he saw 8 couples looking to end things, he said, an outcome he expected after weeks of consulting via Skype, telephone, and WhatsApp. Valeria De Vellis, a well-known divorce lawyer, said that her usual practice is to send troubled couples to therapy if they are still talking to each other, especially if they have children, but that is not working these days. “Of the cases arriving on my desk these days, there is little to salvage,” she said, “since the situation, which exploded during isolation, has had too much time to fester.” She also described unprecedented divorce hearings with judges via video-conferencing, which lacked the opportunity for reconciliation that occasionally happens when the meetings take place face to face. As some media have suggested, the health crisis caused by coronavirus has turned out to be just the tip of the iceberg, now being rapidly overshadowed by the economic crisis, the suicide crisis, the marriage crisis, and the loan-sharking crisis.

China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi urged the world in remarks Sunday to “champion” global governance and globalization in light of the ongoing Chinese coronavirus pandemic. “Globalization, multilateralism and global governance should be championed and optimized in the post COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] pandemic world,” Chinese state media quoted Wang as saying, speaking to reporters in an extended session. In a rare admission, Wang also said that globalization creates some problems, including “unbalanced” development on a worldwide scale. He offered a novel solution for these issues. “We need to mitigate the unbalanced regional developmental issues and inequality created by globalization, but the issue of globalization needs to be solved with globalization,” Wang reportedly said. “The most important lesson that can be learned from the [Chinese coronavirus] pandemic is that people’s lives and health are closely connected with each other’s and that all countries are in the same global village.” Wang’s remarks are part of a greater campaign on the part of the Chinese Communist Party to diminish the power of state governments and expand the scope of international governing venues, particularly those it controls in bodies like the United Nations. Chinese dictator Xi Jinping has made multiple remarks in the past two months urging the world to develop global public health hubs – and establish them in China – and supporting maintaining centralized Chinese control of global supply chains. Xi has mentioned expanding global governance regularly during public remarks in recent memory. “Whether it is domestic governance or global governance, we must have people’s sense of fulfillment as the objective and continue to provide confidence and expectations of stability for the people,” Xi said after meeting with United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Gutérres in April 2018. “We need to keep pushing for and improving global governance to deal with this challenge.” At that year’s BRICS summit – an economic coalition uniting China with Brazil, India, South Africa, and Russia – Xi announced “the next decade will see a profound reshaping of the global governance system.” More recently, Xi has promised to expand China’s control of global supply chains and its pharmaceutical production capacity, nominally in an attempt to help the world fight the pandemic it created. At the World Health Assembly last week, Xi announced that China would develop a vaccine against the Chinese coronavirus and offer it for free, effectively dissuading the world’s pharmaceutical companies from conducting competing research. Xi also announced that China would build a “global humanitarian response depot and hub” in China that would hoard medical supplies to more efficiently distribute them worldwide in the event of another pandemic. While dismissing concerns that trends towards globalization weaken national sovereignty on Sunday, Wang also insisted in the defense of China’s sovereignty, including over territories it does not have legal sovereignty over, like in the South China Sea. “China will be firmer in its determination and take much stronger measures to safeguard its national sovereignty, security and development interests and resolutely prevent the external forces from interfering in its domestic affairs,” Wang said, referring to what the official newspaper of the Communist Party, the People’s Daily, described “the tasks of Chinese diplomacy in 2020.” China claims nearly the entire South China Sea, including the sovereign territory of the Philippines, Vietnam, Brunei, Taiwan, and Malaysia. A 2016 ruling from the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague declared Beijing’s claims illegal, but the Communist Party has disregarded that ruling. Last week, satellite evidence revealed that the People’s Liberation Army had flooded Fiery Cross Reef, a Philippine territory China has turned into a military base, with a fleet of fighter jets. Wang called the situation in the South China Sea “more stabilized and better.” Wang also reportedly defended Chinese “sovereignty” in the face of a growing number of lawsuits against the Chinese state around the world, including in places like the United States, Egypt, Nigeria, and Italy. At least one of the American lawsuits, brought by the state of Missouri, specifically identifies the Communist Party of China as the defendant, not the state of the People’s Republic of China, in an attempt to bypass sovereign immunity. Missouri Senator Josh Hawley (R) has also proposed a law to allow an exception to sovereign immunity – which prevents lawsuits against state persons – in cases of coronavirus victims suing China. “Beijing will not accept lawsuits from other countries on losses from COVID-19 and such attempts to infringe on China’s sovereignty and dignity are doomed to failure,” Wang asserted. Leaked Chinese documents show that the government was aware of cases of Chinese coronavirus as early as November 2019, yet waited until late January to alert the world to an outbreak in the central city of Wuhan. By the time the outbreak was made public, five million people had left Wuhan for the Lunar New Year holiday, according to the city’s mayor, Zhou Xianwang. Chinese officials also admitted this month that they destroyed early samples of the virus, making it impossible for scientists to study them and trace the pathogen’s evolution. In addition to “safeguarding” China’s sovereignty, Wang listed in his remarks Sunday among his goals the safeguarding of several economic realities that grant China dominance over world trade: “Wang said the country will also strive to maintain the stability of the global industrial chains, promote trade liberalization and facilitation to counter the downward pressure on the world economy.” Wang’s remarks suggest an expansion of Xi’s promise in March to ensure that China continues to control global manufacturing.

University of Michigan President Mark Schlissel has nixed the return of football, unless on-campus classes have also restarted. Some thought that the Wolverines could return whether the rest of the campus had reopened or not, but Schlissel shot that idea down, the Detroit News reported. “If there is no on-campus instruction then there won’t be intercollegiate athletics, at least for Michigan,” Schlissel told the Wall Street Journal. He later added he has “some degree of doubt as to whether there will be college athletics (anywhere), at least in the fall.” Schlissel also noted that however they decide to reopen the campus, that plan will stay intact for the rest of the school year. The school’s announcement seemed to run contrary to plans floated by the NCAA Division I Council, which was working for an early college football return. The sport’s governing body voted to approve the re-opening of college football and women’s basketball beginning on June 1. Some colleges, including Ohio State, have already told athletes that they can begin using training facilities in the first week of June. Still, Schlissel says he imagines that on-campus classes might resume for the fall semester. “We’re hoping to have a fall semester,” he told the Detroit News. “What I am calling it is a public-health-informed fall semester.” Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh recently said he would be okay with playing in an empty stadium. “Heck yeah I’d be comfortable coaching a game without any fans,” Harbaugh said. “If the choice were, play in front of no fans or not play, then I would choose to play in front of no fans. And darn near every guy I’ve talked to on our team, that’s the way they feel about it.” Harbaugh also noted that it is probably unrealistic to assume that a stadium full of fans could be tested and determined to be free of the coronavirus.

Then they can think about games. “Eventually, you look at playing games. Is that possible? That’s the No. 1 question that our players have, and we have,” he said. “But you can see the path that you could play with players being tested, coaches being tested. Referees, that if you test negative, you can participate in the game.” “So, let the kids play. Hopefully, we’ll get some more good news as the summer progresses,” he concluded.

Former NFL wide receiver Dennis McKinnon questioned arbitrary government determinations of “essential” and “non-essential” businesses on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Sunday with host Joel B. Pollak. “Government has put a price on your head,” said McKinnon. “They’re determining what your value is. “What’s essential to me is not what’s essential to Joel.” “How does the government determine what’s essential for you to survive?” asked McKinnon. “Americans, taxpayers, citizens, you have more value than what has been exercised since this virus.” LISTEN:  McKinnon addressed furloughs during the coronavirus outbreak. “Too many executives — especially CEOs — get way too much money when things go bad,” McKinnon stated. Many executives overlook the “blood, sweat, and tears” of employees while treating employees’ sacrifices as an “afterthought,” he added. McKinnon said, “I don’t believe in furloughs. Furloughs mean, ‘You know, what? You can be out for awhile, but chances are we’re not going to bring you back.’ It’s just allowing you to have a few more weeks of misery.'” Americans constitutional rights are being violate during the viral outbreak, determined McKinnon. “This country was built on democracy,” McKinnon remarked. “We fought for the Constitution, for the First, Second, and Fifth amendments, which have been violated every day, right now.” Federal aid money is not being appropriately distributed, assessed McKinnon. “The ones who really did not need any money were the first in line,” McKinnon said. “They should have never been in front of the line in the first place. There’s always some excuse when those who really need the most [are not helped.] ‘Oh, we’re sorry. We had a glitch.’ No, it wasn’t a glitch. It was predetermined.” Pollak asked about resuming NFL games. “I’m really biased when it comes to sports,” replied McKinnon. “Basketball, baseball, soccer, wrestling, nothing moves the needle like football. Football is in our DNA, and I think from that perspective, we have to have it.” McKinnon continued, “Moving forward in 2020 without fans might be the only way that we can get back to work and getting back to our game. Maybe 2021 will be different once there’s a vaccine, but now we’ve got to be careful. We’ve got to be smart. We are going into uncharted territory.’ “There is no perfect way of doing anything,” added McKinnon. “The most important thing is safety first, and if we come out of the gate and things don’t go well, we stop it.

During Monday’s “New Day” on CNN, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D) sounded off on people in his state pushing to reopen businesses and the beaches by staging protests and being critical of him via aerial advertising. “New Jerseyians have been incredibly responsible throughout this entire crisis, and I have no reason to believe they won’t continue to be,” Murphy said. When it comes to the criticism of how he is handling the lockdown, Murphy said he is not swayed by protesters demanding to reopen the state. Instead, he told “New Day” host Alisyn Camerota he is swayed by “the facts and the data and the science.” “I don’t begrudge their right to protest, but they don’t sway me,” he stated. “The only thing that sways me are the facts and the data and the science. And listen, I want to open salons and gyms as much as anybody, but I think folks know this, but when you talk about indoors, lack of ventilation, close proximity, sedentary — you saw that hairstylist or salon worker in Missouri in the spread that she engendered, that’s real. So, gyms … I want to get them opened as much as the next guy, but we’re not there yet. I want to do it responsibly, and I don’t want to kill anybody.” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent

France has announced that it will be imposing “reciprocal” quarantine measures on British arrivals after the UK said that international travellers will be required to self-quarantine for two weeks upon entering the country in order to prevent a second wave of the Chinese coronavirus. French ministers said that the quarantine would be set in place from June 8th, the same day in which the UK will begin quarantining airport arrivals. “We take note of the British government’s decision and we regret it. France is ready to put in place reciprocal measures as soon as the system comes into force on the British side,” a spokesman for the French interior ministry said, according to The Times. “For travellers arriving from European countries whose authorities have decided, in an uncoordinated fashion, to apply 14-day quarantine measures to travellers entering their territory from European countries, a voluntary 14-day quarantine period will be reciprocally requested,” the French Embassy website announced. “Travellers arriving from the United Kingdom, whatever their nationality, will be asked to go into a 14-day quarantine period when the British 14-day quarantine measure actually comes into force,” the statement added. ‘Too Late’: Farage Criticises Open Borders While Britons Locked Down in Coronavirus Crisis https://t.co/M2By5p6V6F — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 23, 2020  Last week, home secretary Priti Patel announced that those entering the country through the nation’s airports will be required to fill out an online form stating where they plan to spend the 14-day quarantine. People will be subject to random spot checks from health officials to determine if they are abiding by the quarantine and will face a fine of up to £1,000 for failing to comply. Notable exceptions to the quarantine rules will include the arrival of foreign workers who have been shipped in from Eastern European countries like Romania and Bulgaria to pick vegetables and fruit. Freight industry and haulage workers will also be exempt from the quarantine in order to keep the flow of goods coming into the country. “As the world begins to emerge from what we hope is the worst of the coronavirus pandemic, we must look to the future and protect the British public by reducing the risk of cases crossing our border,” Ms Patel said. “We are introducing these new measures now to keep the transmission rate down and prevent a devastating second wave,” she added. Over 1,800 Private Planes Arrived in UK During the National ‘Lockdown’ https://t.co/BCUWfNs56z — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 19, 2020  As opposed to most countries in the world, the British government refused to shut down entry for foreign travellers, allowing an estimated 100,000 unscreened airport arrivals to pour into the country per week, despite a nationwide lockdown being imposed on the British public. The government has claimed that because of the speed at which the virus was spreading, any restrictions on airport travel would have been ineffective at slowing the spread of the Wuhan virus. However, the decision to impose quarantines starting in June suggests that this was not the case. The move to introduce quarantines at this stage of the pandemic, instead of the early stages of the outbreak, has been widely criticised by members of the aviation and tourism industries, who fear that it would have dire consequences for the already struggling British economy. “Introducing a quarantine at this stage makes no sense and will mean very limited international aviation at best. It is just about the worst thing government could do if their aim is to restart the economy,” the chief executive of industry body Airlines UK, Tim Alderslade, said.

President Donald Trump has taken criticism from his opponents and the media for golfing on Memorial Day weekend. But his predecessor, President Barack Obama, golfed on seven of the eight Memorial Day weekends of his presidency. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic Party nominee to challenge Trump in the fall, tweeted a criticism that Trump was golfing on Saturday, in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic: Nearly 100,000 lives have been lost, and tens of millions are out of work. Meanwhile, the president spent his day golfing. pic.twitter.com/H1BVNtgVjA — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) May 24, 2020  The media echoed that criticism. However, President Obama was notorious for golfing — even when the country was at war, or in mid-crisis. And he golfed on Memorial Day weekend every year but one. According to the tally at trumpgolfoutings.com, Obama golfed: The only exception was in 2010, when Obama went back to visit Chicago — and drew criticism from conservatives for failing to lay a wreath at Arlington National Cemetery on Memorial Day to mark the occasion. (He laid a wreath at Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery near Chicago, instead.) In a series of tweets, President Trump responded to the criticism, noting it was the first time he had golfed in months — and that Obama had infamously golfed after speaking briefly about the beheading of American James Foley by ISIS: Some stories about the fact that in order to get outside and perhaps, even a little exercise, I played golf over the weekend.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 25, 2020  ….3 months and, if I waited 3 years, they would do their usual “hit” pieces anyway. They are sick with hatred and dishonesty. They are truly deranged!

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 25, 2020  Trump also returned to the golf course as several states began opening public amenities for recreation, and after Dr. Deborah Birx of his coronavirus task force told Americans to enjoy the outdoors while observing “social distancing.” Before Saturday’s outing, Trump last golfed on March 8, 2020.

Several thousand race fans flocked to a North Carolina speedway on Saturday and watched a race. However, while fans were in abundance, there were very few masks or gloves to be seen. According to reports, only about one in ten fans wore either gloves or masks, as 4,000 racing fans sat in the stands at the Ace Speedway. “They’ve been locked up,” Gene Yarboro, 64, told the Charlotte Observer. “They want to go somewhere, and this is the only place, really, legal to come around.” According to the Observer: All week, that had been a point of contention — the legality of this gathering. When North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper announced that the state would enter Phase Two of its gradual reopening amid the pandemic, the news came with limits. Cooper’s executive order, for one, prohibited mass gatherings, and those had been defined as any gathering of more than 10 people indoors, or more than 25 outdoors. Within about 10 feet on either side of Yarboro, there were more than 25 people. He didn’t mind. Nobody here minded, and whatever concerns anyone had were outweighed by the desire to be a part of the mutual experience. Only a few people wore any kind of coverings over their face and Bare, the man checking the bags at the gate, was among them. ‘It’s been years since we had this many people,’ he said. NASCAR returned to the racetrack on May 17th, but did so without fans. Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn

The British government will make plans to reduce the United Kingdom’s reliance on imports from foreign countries like China after a study revealed that the UK is reliant on the communist country for the supply of 71 “critical goods” including pharmaceuticals, personal protective equipment (PPE), and electronics. Headed by Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Dominic Raab, codename “Project Defend” will examine the resilience of the UK’s economy and supply chain vulnerabilities of “essential supplies” strategic for national security. One of the two Whitehall groups conducting the review will look into what the UK needs to do to bolster “onshore” supplies production, such as chemical components for drugs, with the government even considering intervening to “repatriate” essential manufacturing. “The way China has been acting has really alarmed people in Downing Street,” one source told The Times.  Another insider told the newspaper of record: “We’re seeing resilience as a national security issue. If we are reliant on other states for particular things that is, in effect, a national security concern. The question is how can you mitigate that? You’ve got an awful lot of national security people working into these kinds of things.” The UK struggled to obtain coronavirus testing kits for the Chinese virus, as well as ventilators and personal protective equipment (PPE), with the production of these items being outsourced overseas in recent decades, including to China. Even with purchasing the desperately-needed items from China, many European nations found the Chinese imports faulty and even potentially deadly. Conservative MPs Urge Govt to Reduce ‘Dangerous’ Dependence on Communist China https://t.co/uIS6kiId9t — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 14, 2020  Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, who takes a hard line on Chinese dominance, warned in March that coronavirus exposes Western countries’ reliance on the oppressive communist country for their strategic supply chains. Earlier this month, a report by the Henry Jackson Society revealed that the UK is dependent on China in its supply chains for 71 “critical goods” categories including electronics, chemicals, and drugs essential for producing anti-viral drugs and antibiotics. Between 80 and 90 per cent of the UK’s drugs production relies on foreign imports. The government has been coming under mounting pressure from its own MPs to reduce dependence on China as well as to cut ties with Chinese government-backed firm Huawei, which Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in January could be involved in developing the UK’s 5G network. The move was condemned by intelligence partners and British politicians who warned it could threaten security and even endanger relations between the Five Eyes (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America) and trading partners. Conservative MPs have also warned that China is going to use the economic crisis caused by its coronavirus to swoop in and buy struggling British technology companies. Senior Tories Accuse Chinese Interests of Exploiting Coronavirus Crisis to Dominate UK Tech https://t.co/VyI8f6dM6E — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 15, 2020  On Wednesday during Prime Minister’s Questions, Tory MP for South Dorset Richard Drax asked Mr Johnson if the UK would follow France and conduct a “root and branch review” of the defence supply chain, following French concerns that China is buying up defence-rated companies that are going bust during the pandemic. Mr Drax also asked whether the prime minister is considering rowing back on his Huawei decision. While failing to answer the question on the Chinese tech giant directly, Mr Johnson said: “We are certainly bringing forward measures to ensure that we protect our technological base. [The defence committee will] be hearing a lot more about that in the next few weeks.” A YouGov poll from May 19th found that nearly half, 47 per cent, of Britons saw the prospect of China becoming a superpower “more of a threat” to Britain, with just 11 per cent thinking it could represent an “opportunity” (22 per cent responded “neither”, 20 per cent “don’t know”). While Britons, on the whole, appear sceptical of China’s motives on the world stage, they also in the majority back the communist country facing a lawsuit for covering up the dangers presented by the Wuhan-born COVID-19 in the early weeks of the outbreak. When the Henry Jackson Society said in April that Western countries should sue China for compensation, 71 per cent of Britons agreed with 74 per cent blaming China for the spread of the deadly virus.

Despite assurances by officials, Mexico continues to see a steady increase in deaths from the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). Health leaders are also seeing a daily escalation in confirmed cases. During the daily news conference, Mexico’s Undersecretary of Health Hugo Lopez Gatell revealed that Mexico reached 7,394 fatalities and 68,620 confirmed cases. In recent days, Mexico has been saw a spike in confirmed cases despite official claims about a flattened curve. Al 24 de mayo de 2020 hay 68,620 casos confirmados, 14,247 confirmados activos y 28,931 sospechosos por #COVID19. Se han registrado 121,613 negativos, 7,394 defunciones confirmadas, 595 defunciones sospechosas y fueron estudiadas 219,164 personas. 1/3 pic.twitter.com/KTpIAyRAog — Hugo López-Gatell Ramírez (@HLGatell) May 25, 2020  Mexican health officials have only carried out 219,164 tests, while the U.S. leads with nearly 15 million. Mexico ranks 10th globally for deaths and 52nd in testing. Federal health officials are roundly criticized for only estimating the impact of the virus and artificially deflating numbers. Lopez Gatell previously admitted that some of his figures only account for government hospitals. Several states now release their own statistics. In recent days, an NGO claimed that figures for Mexico City only account for one-third of the total Coronavirus deaths. The organization accessed death certificates for their study.

Sunday, Fox News Channel’s Steve Hilton opened his “The Next Revolution” program with a call for policymakers to reopen schools. which he said was a needed part of the recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. Hilton pointed to other nations, which have already begun opening their schools up, and argued there were consequences from a prolonged shutdown of the school system “Get on with it and reopen schools now before you do even more needless damage,” Hilton said. Partial transcript as follows: HILTON: There won’t be a recovery unless we reopen schools now. If children can’t go to school, parents can’t go to work. We’re told schools must be closed to keep kids safe, but they’re not in danger. According to CDC data, children under 18 make up only two percent of cases and 0.6 percent of hospitalizations, children under 14 make up just 0.02 percent of deaths. Now, the media misinformation machine is fear-mongering about a new mystery disease that affects children. Dr. Fauci cited this when pushing back on Rand Paul’s demand to reopen schools this year. But we’re talking about a handful of cases which are almost always treatable. How offensive to try and frighten parents about the safety of their children? A more serious argument for school closures is that while children may not get sick themselves, they can infect others. Do they? We are constantly told to follow the science and the data, well, here it is. One study found, quote, “Even if children do get infected, they are less likely to transmit the disease to others than adults. We have not found a single instance of a child infecting parents.” They lecture us about contact tracing while they did it for a boy with coronavirus. They found that even though he came into contact with 172 classmates and teachers while symptomatic, he didn’t transmit the disease to any of them, not one out of 172 people. In Switzerland, the country’s head of infectious disease says scientists, quote, ” … now no young children don’t transmit the virus.” And because of all of this, France, Israel, Germany, Greece, Portugal, South Korea and many other countries have already begun letting their children back into schools. Two weeks after Denmark reopened their schools, a scientist in the Department of Infectious Diseases at Aarhus University said, “There are no signs whatsoever that the partial reopening has caused the biggest spread of infection.” Yet still, the schools here are closed, even in states where bars and restaurants are reopening. Where in all of this is our own CDC, by the way? Why do we have to rely on scientists from Switzerland, Denmark, Iceland? Yet another reason for the bungler in chief, useless Dr. Robert Redfield to go. Meanwhile, the mental health toll on children grows by the day, as does the loss of learning — all of it hurting the poorest areas most, especially those in remote parts of the country, with unreliable internet and the poorest families. Any leader anywhere in America who is not planning to reopen schools now, not in the next few months, not in the fall, but now is a data denier and a science denier. Get on with it and reopen schools now before you do even more needless damage. But once we reopen schools and businesses, we can’t have stupid regulations stifling the recovery. Masks, fine. But what’s this unscientific nonsense about compulsory temperature checks? Totally pointless. You’ll miss most people with coronavirus and catch many who don’t have it. These completely arbitrary social distancing rules, 25 percent occupancy, 33 percent, 50 percent. What’s it even based on? Only one or two people allowed in an elevator at one time? Good luck trying to reopen New York like that, or any downtown business district frankly. This over-prescriptive regulation is typical of the infantilizing mindset of our technocratic ruling elite. If you boss people around with arbitrary rules, they’ll resist, but ask people to behave responsibly with commonsense, and they will. Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor

Chinese dictator Xi Jinping once again made public remarks admitting major shortcomings in Communist Party public health management, telling a delegation from Hubei province on Sunday to make “prompt efforts” to fix “weak links” in the system. Hubei’s capital is Wuhan, the city where the Chinese coronavirus pandemic began. The delegates are in Beijing as part of what the Communist Party calls its “Two Sessions,” the annual meetings of its two federal lawmaking bodies, the National People’s Congress (NPC) and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). China’s Xinhua news agency quoted Xi discussing public health during a meeting Sunday with Hubei deputies at an NPC session. Xi’s remarks were the first about public health since his speech at the World Health Assembly last week, where he announced that China would be developing a Chinese coronavirus vaccine and distributing it globally for free. Xinhua published photos of the occasion on Sunday, showed Xi at the center of a high table sitting about six feet apart from other deputies, as doctors have recommended adhering to social distancing guidelines. Xi is the only one seen in the photo not wearing a mask:  The photos are notably different from those of the CPPCC, where hundreds of representatives were apparently forced to sit in tightly packed quarters; Xi was not in attendance for their session last week: China’s “Two Sessions” legislative meeting on May 21, 2020. “China’s public health and medical service systems have played their key roles in dealing with the epidemic, but some weak links and inadequacies were also exposed, urging prompt efforts to fix them,” Xinhua paraphrased Xi as telling the Hubei delegation. (State media often eschew quotes, opting for paraphrasing.) Xi reportedly “emphasized more targeted and effective prevention and the fulfillment of responsibilities for reporting infectious disease epidemics and public health emergencies.” Regarding any specific reforms, the Xinhua coverage only quoted Xi as specifying small work items such as “wearing masks, sorting garbage, social distancing and online reservation for hospital visits.” He urged the construction of more public health centers at the national and regional levels but did not details what those centers would do. Xi also “called for adopting the philosophy of full life cycle management.” The Chinese dictator did not reportedly mention any specific weak links or shortcomings in how Hubei handed the local outbreak, instead applauding Hubei Communist Party officials for the “enormous sacrifices” they allegedly made. Xi’s lack of criticism did not reflect what many at the national level have done outside of Chinese media since the outbreak began in Wuhan last year: turn on local Wuhan officials and blame them for allowing the virus to get out of control. “The local authorities didn’t like to tell the truth at that time,” Zhong Nanshan, China’s top respiratory illness doctor, told CNN last week of the pandemic. “At the very beginning, they just kept silent.” In January, Zhou Xianwang, the mayor of Wuhan, admitted that his government kept the outbreak secret but blamed convoluted Communist Party law for preventing him from making public health emergency information public. Since Beijing made it illegal to warn his residents, Zhou said at the time, five million left Wuhan before the Communist Party alerted the world to a novel coronavirus outbreak. Zhou has been notably absent from media appearances since those statements, though he appears to remain mayor of Wuhan at press time. This month, China admitted that, in addition to hiding pivotal epidemic information from the public, local officials also destroyed early samples of the Chinese coronavirus taken from infected patients and from an open-air meat market Chinese officials initially claimed was the likely source of the outbreak. By “disinfecting” the market and destroying the samples, Communist Party officials made it impossible for scientists to compare the virus’s features in currently infected patients to its early iterations, thus making it less likely that they will be able to trace the virus’s evolution or find its original source. Prior to admitting this, Chinese officials had dropped the wet market origin theory for the virus and had begun spreading the conspiracy theory that the U.S. Army was the true source of the pandemic. Xi’s praise for Wuhan officials on Sunday echoes his remarks at the World Health Assembly, where he once again claimed that the pandemic had stopped being a problem for China. “In China, after making painstaking efforts and enormous sacrifice, we have turned the tide on the virus and protected the life and health of our people,” Xi told the global public health body. “All along, we have acted with openness, transparency, and responsibility. We have provided information to the W.H.O. [World Health Organization] and the relevant countries in the most timely fashion. … We have done everything in our power to support and assist countries in need.” Just a week prior, Xi told the steering group of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee – the most powerful communists in the country – that “huge uncertainties still linger over the pandemic … and the country is still seeing infections among clusters of people in certain areas.” There is no evidence that the shift from “the country is still seeing infections” to “we have turned the tide” was a truthful reflection of a major change in the pandemic’s effects in one week’s time. Multiple reports suggest that Wuhan continues to see infection clusters, many potentially hidden by local officials not counting patients likely infected. Xi’s remarks to the “steering group” also appear to contradict his declarations from Wuhan in March that the outbreak had been contained and the nation could return to normal business activities.

California Secretary of State Alex Padilla (D) responded Sunday evening to Republicans’ lawsuit against the state to block Gov. Gavin Newsom’s (D) recent vote-by-mail order, suggesting the move is a “political smear campaign” by President Donald Trump, designed to use the Chinese coronavirus pandemic for voter suppression. “Expanding vote-by-mail during a pandemic is not a partisan issue — it’s a moral imperative to protect voting rights and public safety. Vote-by-mail has been used safely and effectively in red, blue, and purple states for years,” Padilla wrote on social media. “This lawsuit is just another part of Trump’s political smear campaign against voting by mail. We will not let this virus be exploited for voter suppression.” Earlier Sunday, the Republican National Committee (RNC), National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), and California Republican Party (CRP) sued Newsom and Padilla, alleging an executive order mandating that all state registered voters receive mail-in ballots is an “illegal power grab.” “In a direct usurpation of the legislature’s authority, Governor Newsom issued an executive order purporting to rewrite the entire election code for the November 2020 election cycle,” the lawsuit reads. “This brazen power grab was not authorized by state law and violates both the Elections Clause and Electors Clause of the U.S. Constitution.” The complaint alleges that Newsom has “created a recipe for disaster” that could possibly invite voter fraud. The suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California. “Democrats continue to use this pandemic as a ploy to implement their partisan election agenda, and Governor Newsom’s executive order is the latest direct assault on the integrity of our elections,” RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said of the suit. “Newsom’s illegal power grab is a recipe for disaster that would destroy the confidence Californians deserve to have in the security of their vote.” The suit was filed hours before President Trump accused Democrats of attempting to use the pandemic to push mail-in ballot plans for the November election, warning the move will lead to “the greatest Rigged Election in history.” “The United States cannot have all Mail In Ballots. It will be the greatest Rigged Election in history. People grab them from mailboxes, print thousands of forgeries and “force” people to sign,” the president tweeted. “Also, forge names. Some absentee OK, when necessary. Trying to use Covid for this Scam.”

According to a recent report, American billionaires have enjoyed a huge boost in net worth in the first two months of the Chinese virus pandemic, earning around $434 billion since March 19, when many states went into lockdown.
 According to a new report published by left-leaning think tanks Americans for Tax Fairness and the Institute for Policy Studies, as many Americans struggle with financial hardship due to the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic, U.S. billionaires have actually seen an increase in their net worth by approximately $434 billion, Business Insider reports. Forbes reports that 623 billionaires live in the United States, this includes Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, investor Warren Buffett, Oracle founder Larry Ellison, and Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg. The report from the think tanks alleges that just those five billionaires alone saw their wealth increase by 19 percent, or approximately $75.5 billion. Approximately 600 U.S. billionaires saw their wealth from $2.948 trillion to $3.382 trillion within just two months. Americans for Tax Fairness executive director Frank Clemente said in the report: “The pandemic has revealed the deadly consequences of America’s yawning wealth gap, and billionaires are the glaring symbol of that economic inequality.” Clemente added: “Post-pandemic, the rich and corporations must begin to pay their fair share of taxes so we can build a society that works for everyone, not just billionaires and others at the top.” This week, U.S. weekly jobless claims reached 2.4 million bringing the nine-week total to nearly 39 million.

PRAGUE – A coal mine in the north-eastern Czech Republic near the border with Poland has halted work after a major Covid-19 outbreak among the miners. In recent days, tests of some 2,400 people revealed a total of 212 positive for coronavirus, mostly miners from the Darkov mine in the town of Karvina and their family members. It´s currently the biggest local outbreak in the country. Ivo Vondrak, the head of the regional government, said Monday that only workers who are necessary to deal with ventilation and water pumping remain in the mine. Local health authorities have limited public gatherings in Karvina county to 100, while it is 300 in the rest of the country. Visits to nursing homes and hospitals are banned The daily increase of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the entire Czech Republic was 65 on Sunday. A total of 8,957 people have tested positive in the country, while 315 have died.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz told reporters this weekend it is not clear that worship constitutes something essential, challenging President Trump’s assertion it is. “I think the case that the president is making and that may be up for debate in this country of deeming houses of worship essential, essential services and that’s one that we take into consideration,” the Democrat governor said during an hour-long briefing on opening up religious services during the coronavirus lockdown. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> During the briefing, in which he was joined by state Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm, Gov. Walz announced new guidelines for religious services, saying he would allow houses of worship to reopen at 25 percent occupancy. The governor’s decision came on the heels of confrontation with the Catholic Bishops of Minnesota, who announced last week that public Masses would resume as of May 26, in defiance of the governor’s restrictions. Many people of faith “were disappointed in Governor Walz’s May 13 announcement that he would end the Stay-at-Home order to allow more commerce but prohibit religious gatherings of more than ten people,” an order that “defies reason,” declared the bishops in a May 20 letter. Insisting that the life of faith is “essential,” the bishops declared that they have given Catholic parishes “permission for the resumption of the public celebration of Mass on Tuesday, May 26, which will give us time to be ready for the celebration of Pentecost on May 31.” “Parishes will be required to follow the strict protocols we have published for sanitation and social distancing and will have to limit attendance to one-third of the seating capacity of the church,” they said. “No one will be obliged to attend, as the bishops of Minnesota will continue to dispense from the obligation to attend Sunday Mass.” The bishops insisted that they have striven to work collaboratively with the Walz Administration as well as highlighting their overarching concern for the spiritual and physical well-being of their flock. They also noted the injustice of the governor’s arbitrary targeting of religious practice for especially strict regulation. The letter said that both the Catholic hierarchy and “some Lutheran colleagues” had submitted a joint plan to the Governor on May 8 detailing their sanitation measures and proposing a cap on church attendance limited to 33 percent of building capacity, a plan that the governor rejected. “Given our willingness to coordinate with the Governor, we are especially disappointed that his most recent order (20-56) does not address both the vital importance that faith plays in the lives of Americans, especially in this time of pandemic, and the fundamental religious freedom possessed by houses of worship that allows our country to thrive,” the bishops declared. “The Governor’s remarks today further underscored a failure to appreciate the role of our Church and other faith groups in serving the community,” they said. “The human cost to this pandemic has been extraordinary, not just in terms of lives lost to the virus but the rapidly growing problems of job loss, depression, crime and violence, and substance abuse.” The bishops affirm their unanimous “conviction” that they can safely resume public Masses in accordance with both our religious duties and with accepted public health and safety standards. The bishops also stated that they had suspended the public celebration of Mass “not because we were compelled to do so, but because we judged that the circumstances required it.” “We are blessed to live in a nation that guarantees the free exercise of religion,” they said. “This right can only be abridged for a compelling governmental interest, and only in a way that is narrowly tailored to be the least restrictive means of achieving the desired end.” “We think that the executive order issued last Wednesday fails this test. An order that sweeps so broadly that it prohibits, for example, a gathering of 11 people in a Cathedral with a seating capacity of several thousand defies reason,” they add. Following the governor’s press conference on Saturday, St. Paul & Minneapolis Archbishop Bernard Hebda said he was pleased with Walz’s change of heart. “I am so thankful for the honest, open, and fast-paced dialogue we had over these past days and am pleased we could come to a consensus about a reasonable and safe path forward that allows a greater number of people to safely return to worship,” Hebda wrote.

Former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair has airily dismissed U.S. President Donald Trump’s leadership during the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, instead harking back to his work alongside Bill Clinton and Barack Obama as examples of how global inter-governmental cooperation can win the day. His remarks in an interview with NBC News last Friday followed an earlier intervention in the crisis when his own globalist think tank claimed it is “embedded in governments around the world,” as Breitbart News reported. In his most recent observations, he told NBC News he was worried about the lack of global coordination in tackling the crisis. “The worry I have that an absence of global coordination and global leadership that’s necessary for it is a huge problem,” he said. “When I think back to the times when I’m dealing with American presidents whether it’s Bill Clinton or George Bush, Barack Obama as well, the most important thing at a time like this is to say, ‘How do you bring the world together?”‘ <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> By building more and bigger global government, Blair believes leaders could find a vaccine together, accelerate the development of therapeutics and testing capability, while keeping the international economy afloat. “It’s that global coordination, the absence of which means that each individual country’s less effective at dealing with the disease. That’s the thing that worries me,” he stated. The left-wing former Labour leader was asked his opinion on Trump’s suggestions on fighting the epidemic, he said: “I think most people would understand what I would think, but it’s probably better sometimes not to say it.” Earlier this month the Tony Blair Institute announced it has “teams” advising world governments “to keep their people safe during this pandemic — not just in respect of Covid-19 itself but also the political and economic collateral damage.” It also echoed his own personal call for more resources to be poured into the World Health Organization: Our teams are now embedded in governments around the world, helping them to keep their people safe during this pandemic – not just in respect of Covid-19 itself but also the political and economic collateral damage.

Bush. Under his leadership, the U.K. joined the U.S.-led coalition fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq. In comments made after the release of a 2016 report on the UK’s entry into the Iraq conflict, John Chilcot said he did not believe Tony Blair was “straight with the nation” over the issue. Speaking to BBC News, the chairman of the public inquiry into the 2003 military engagement said Blair pinned his account of events leading up to the war on belief rather than fact.

ATHENS, Greece (AP) – Greece restarted regular ferry services to its islands Monday and cafes and restaurants were also back open for business as the country accelerated efforts to salvage its tourism season. Travel to the islands had been generally off-limits since a lockdown was imposed in late March to halt the spread of the coronavirus, with only goods suppliers and permanent residents allowed access. But the country’s low infection rate in the Covid-19 pandemic prompted the government to start the holiday season three weeks earlier than the expected June 15th date, as other Mediterranean countries – including Italy, Spain, and Turkey — are grappling with deadlier virus outbreaks. Greek Locals Angered over Migrant Camp for 3,000 Placed in Village of 500 https://t.co/qX2IPTATh7 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 19, 2020  Greece has had nearly 2,900 infections and 171 deaths from the virus. Italy has seen nearly 33,000 coronavirus patients die, Spain has had nearly 29,000 dead ,and Turkey has had 4,340 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Social distancing regulations and passenger limits have been imposed on ferries and at restaurants to ward off new infections. State-run health services to combat the coronavirus are being expanded to the islands, with intensive care units being placed on five islands: Lesbos, Samos, Rhodes, Zakynthos, and Corfu, along with existing ICU facilities on the island of Crete. Tourism is a vital part of the Greek economy, directly contributing more than 10 per cent of the country’s GDP. More than 34 million visitors travelled to Greece last year, spending 18.2 billion euros ($19.5 billion), according to government data.

Tom Brady delivered the shot of the match that made it easy to forget the rest of his swings. Tiger Woods didn’t miss a fairway and earned a small measure of revenge against Phil Mickelson. The PGA Tour is set to return in just over two weeks, and it has a tough act to follow.
In the second and final charity match that brought live golf to TV, this exhibition was as entertaining as the real thing. Woods lagged a long birdie putt close enough that his partner, Peyton Manning, didn’t have to putt. That secured a 1-up victory over Mickelson and Brady in “The Match: Champions for Charity.” The goal was to raise $10 million or more for COVID-19 relief funds, and online donations sent money climbing toward about twice that much. This made-for-TV exhibition would have have worth pay-per-view, the model Woods and Mickelson used for a $9 million winner-take-all match in Las Vegas over Thanksgiving weekend in 2018 that Mickelson won in a playoff under lights. It felt forced, lacked banter and turned out to free because of technical issues. Throw in two NFL greats in Brady and Manning, and this allowed viewers to ride along for 18 holes at Medalist Golf Club among four of the biggest stars in sport. Justin Thomas pitched in as an on-course reporter, bringing a mixture of humor and insight with the right amount of words. Woods and Manning took the lead on the third hole and never trailed, building a 3-up lead in fourballs on the front nine, with Manning making two birdies (one was a net par). Brady, whose six Super Bowl titles are more than any NFL quarterback in history, took a beating on social media and in the broadcast booth from Charles Barkley, who twice offered $50,000 of his own money toward charity if Brady just hit the green on a par 3. He missed so far right it would be comparable to a pass that landed three rows into the stands. New Orleans Saints coach Sean Payton weighed in on Twitter, noting Brady signing as a free agent with Tampa Bay by saying he liked the “Florida” Brady much better. Brooks Koepka offered $100,000 if Brady could just make a par. One shot shut everyone up. Never mind that Brady had to take a penalty drop before getting back to the fairway on the par-5 seventh. With his fourth shot, with Barkley needling him relentlessly, Brady’s shot landed beyond the pin and spun back into the cup. “Shut your mouth, Chuck,” said Brady, whose microphone piece dangled off the back of his pants. Woods still thought he won the hole with a 25-foot eagle putt that instead spun hard off the back of the lip. All that, and they ended up halving the hole. Donations for COVID-19 relief funds kept piling up, and the entertainment didn’t stop even as the rain returned. It caused a 45-minute delay at the start, and as Woods said on the practice range, “I don’t normally play in conditions like this.” Mickelson brought out his “Tiger Slayer” putter that he used to shoot 64 at Pebble Beach in 2012, the last time they were in the final group on the PGA Tour. Woods shot 75 that day. It didn’t help Lefty with a few critical birdie putts to square the match, though he rolled in a 15-foot par putt to stay 1 down with two to play.
The back nine was modified alternate shot — all players hit tee shots, and it was alternate shot from there. It was key for the quarterbacks to find the fairway for the pros to hit shots into the green, and Brady came through until the 18th. Woods was playing for the first time since Feb. 16 when he finished last at Riviera in Los Angeles. He chose not to play the next four weeks with his back not feeling just right, and then the pandemic shut down golf and sports worldwide. Woods looked sharp for the most part, with his game and his words. Mickelson on the fifth hole asked Woods to mark his ball from some 80 yards away. “You want me to mark with a U.S. Open medal,” said Woods, a three-time champion of the only major Mickelson hasn’t won. “Do you have one? I have some silver ones,” Mickelson said, referring to his record six runner-up finishes.
Mickelson boasted about taking Woods down on his home course at Medalist, and now their TV matches are tied at 1, even with each getting a little help. Mickelson says he was a little nervous on the front nine until he found his groove, driving the green on the par-4 11th with Brady making a 20-footer for eagle that began their rally. “Phil said he was nervous. I know Tom and I were comparing notes,” Manning said. “To be behind the ropes in these guys’ worlds, to be in the arena with them, it was really a special experience. I was not comfortable the entire time. Knowing $20 million was raised and helping people going through tough times, it was an honor to be invited. “It’s something I’ll always remember.”  

During an appearance on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures,” Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar weighed in on the possibility of a COVID-19 vaccine by the end of 2020 after the CEO of pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca voiced his confidence the company could deliver 100 million doses of coronavirus vaccine in October. Azar noted it is “a very credible objective” for the United States to have “100 million doses” of a coronavirus vaccine as early as October and triple that amount by the early part of next year. “This is a very credible objective,” Azar said to a question about the White House’s optimism of a vaccine by the end of the year. “You know, we just signed a deal with AstraZeneca for the Oxford vaccine, where by October we could have 100 million doses of vaccine and 300 million doses by early next year. And we’re going to place multiple bets like this and drive operation warp speed because President Trump said he demands that we reduce inefficiency in that system when we get these kind of results if at all possible.” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent

On Sunday, Chicago’s first openly gay mayor, Lori Lightfoot, mounted a raid on a black South Side church for holding services in defiance of her coronavirus lockdown orders. Lightfoot reportedly sent three marked squad cars and two unmarked cars full of officers to the Chicago Cornerstone Baptist Church in the South Side’s Woodlawn neighborhood. Woodlawn is just south of Hyde Park, the area in which the Obamas lived for a short time before Barack became president. Who’s growing tired of this lunacy?https://t.co/LXfabUIdBB — Prov356🇺🇸 (@cujo_14) May 24, 2020  The pastor of the mostly black congregation, Courtney Lewis, reportedly shut and locked the doors and refused to allow the officers to gain entry to the building, Todd Starnes reported. Pastor Lewis told Starnes that he felt like he was confronting “the Soviet-style KGB” as the officers pounded on his doors and demanded entry to shut the church down. “Thankfully, our doors were locked as a normal safety precaution we take each service to protect our members from the escalating gun violence in Chicago,” Lewis said. A sentry that is usually posted outside the sanctuary to monitor the street during service also reported seeing occupants of a dark car with tinted windows filming the incident through one opened window. “All we are seeking is the same consideration and trust that is being tendered toward the liquor stores, abortion clinics, and Walmart,” Lewis told Starnes. Lewis is also seeking help from U.S. Attorney John Lausch. “We are trying to follow the laws of man as much as reasonably possible, but when the laws of man conflict with the laws of God, I, as a pastor, have a duty to follow the laws of God,” Lewis wrote in a recent letter to Lausch. “We will not be intimidated by this overhanded government bully, but we are requesting the assistance of our president and our Justice Department in correcting this grave miscarriage of the law.” Lightfoot, Chicago’s Mayor since May of last year, has been targeting the city’s churches for several weeks as houses of worship have begun balking at her draconian lockdown orders. Late last week, Lightfoot excoriated the city’s churches, saying that their desire to re-open is “dangerous and foolish.” Also last week, the city began fining churches that Lightfoot thinks are violating her coronavirus lockdown orders. After some churches started holding services on the second weekend of May, fines were handed out to churches, including Philadelphia Romanian Church of God, Elim Romanian Pentecostal Church, Metro Praise International, and others. Law service Liberty Counsel reported on May 23 that Elim Pentecostal Church and other Romanian churches in the city received letters from the Chicago Department of Public Health, invoking emergency orders and deeming churches a danger to society. The letters also invoked “summary abatement,” which gives the city the power to forcibly enter properties without a judge’s orders and impose the mayor’s will on occupants. On Friday, President Donald Trump updated federal guidelines for re-opening the economy and added that churches are essential institutions and should be allowed to re-open without government opposition. “Today, I am identifying houses of worship, churches, synagogues, and mosques as essential places that provide essential services,” Trump said on Friday, announcing the release of new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. A similar flurry of harsh orders has come from the state’s governor, as well. Illinois’s recently elected Gov. J.B. Pritzker, heir to the billion-dollar Hyatt Hotel chain, continues to maintain that Illinois must remain on near-total lockdown as a measure to stave off the coronavirus. Pritzker, who has instituted the most draconian lockdown in the country, recently decreed that churches must not allow more than 50 worshippers inside at a time, “until there is a vaccine” for the coronavirus. Meanwhile, Pritzker took criticism for demanding that everyone stay at home even as he allowed his wife to fly off to their Florida estate where lockdowns are not as strict. He was also caught ordering construction crews from Illinois to travel to Wisconsin to work on his property there despite those strict stay-at-home orders he was doling out to his constituents. But Pritzker is facing mounting pressure to roll back his authoritarian coronavirus policies. Last Wednesday, the governor succumbed to pressure to cancel his order to criminally charge businesses that opened their doors in defiance of his coronavirus orders. Illinoisans are becoming increasingly restive under Pritzker’s rule. Multiple lawsuits have been filed against the state’s coronavirus decrees, and many county governments are shying away from the lockdowns. A growing number of county sheriffs and board members are refusing to enforce the governor’s orders. Follow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston.

President Donald Trump suspended travel from Brazil to the United States on Sunday as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to worsen in South America. The order, which will take effect on May 28 at 11:59 p.m. ET, denies entry to “all aliens” who were in Brazil two weeks prior to their attempt to gain entry into the United States. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany released the following statement regarding the president’s decision: Today, the President has taken decisive action to protect our country by suspending the entry of aliens who have been in Brazil during the 14-day period before seeking admittance to the United States. As of May 23, 2020, Brazil had 310,087 confirmed cases of COVID-19, which is the third-highest number of confirmed cases in the world. Today’s action will help ensure foreign nationals who have been in Brazil do not become a source of additional infections in our country. These new restrictions do not apply to the flow of commerce between the United States and Brazil. The World Health Organization (W.H.O.) has warned that the epicenter of the deadly coronavirus has shifted from Europe and the United States to South America as Brazil has quickly become one of the hardest-hit countries. “We’ve seen many South American countries with increasing numbers of cases and clearly there’s a concern across many of those countries, but certainly the most affected is Brazil at this point,” said Mike Ryan, executive director of the W.H.O.’s emergencies program. The latest data from Johns Hopkins University revealed Brazil to have more than 347,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus with at least 22,013 deaths. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has continuously downplayed the pandemic within his country and referred to the virus as a “little flu” and the global reaction to it as a form of “hysteria.” Bolsonaro also warned those who contract the virus to take it “like a man” and return to their normal lives. Bolsonaro’s press secretary tested positive for the virus in March after a gathering with President Trump and Bolsonaro at Mar-a-Lago. Both President Trump and Bolsonaro tested negative for the virus afterward. Follow Kyle on Twitter @RealKyleMorris and Facebook.

Up to 94 percent of American voters say they want an economic nationalist overhaul of the United States’ economy in the wake of the Chinese coronavirus crisis, a survey reveals. A survey conducted by FTI Consulting finds that American voters overwhelmingly want economic nationalist policies implemented — including more tariffs on foreign imports, mandatory country-of-origin labeling, and a requirement that goods be made in the U.S. In total, about 66 percent of Americans support increasing tariffs on foreign imports while only 34 percent want more free trade agreements between the U.S. and other countries. Likewise, 76 percent of Americans said they are willing to pay 5 percent to 100 percent more for U.S.-made products over products made overseas. Just 24 percent said they are not willing to pay more money for U.S.-made products. The poll shows that Americans are increasingly growing tired of their goods being made in China. Today, about 4-in-10 Americans say they will not buy products imported from China. A plurality of about 34 percent of the 60 percent of Americans who said they will still buy products from China said they will do so but do not like the fact that they are made in China. Americans are most supportive of economic nationalist policies that mandate country-of-origin labeling so consumers are fully aware of where products are made and imported from, as well as requirements that key supplies, goods, and products be manufactured in the U.S. About 94 percent of Americans said they support requiring labels on each product that indicates all of the countries where the product was designed, manufactured, and assembled and indicates what percentage of the product was made in each country. Only six percent oppose the requirement. A petition asking President Trump’s administration to require country-of-origin labeling for beef, pork, and dairy products has gained traction online while Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Rick Scott (R-FL) have filed legislation to require products sold online to disclose where they are made and manufactured. Americans, the survey finds, by large majorities want the U.S. to mandate that medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, products bought by the Defense Department, airplanes, and airplane parts be made in America. On medical supplies, 88 percent of Americans support a requirement that it be made in the U.S. Only 12 percent oppose such a requirement. For pharmaceuticals, products bought by the Defense Department, airplanes, and airplane parts, 81 percent to 87 percent of Americans support requiring they be made in the U.S. As Breitbart News has chronicled, the U.S. has suffered from a shortage of vital drugs, rubber gloves, and plastic bottles due to decades-long free trade policies. The plurality of these basic necessities are made in China. Similarly, about 95 percent of ibuprofen and 70 percent of acetaminophen imported to the U.S. arrive from China. Since the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was enacted and China entered the World Trade Organization (WTO), five million American manufacturing jobs have been eliminated from the U.S. economy — 3.4 million of which are due to U.S. free trade with China — and 50,000 manufacturing plants have shuttered. The mass elimination of working and middle class jobs, as a result, have coincided with a more than 600 percent increase in trade deficits. American manufacturing is vital to the U.S. economy, as every one manufacturing job supports an additional 7.4 American jobs in other industries. The FTI Consulting was conducted from May 12 to 14. The poll has a margin of error of +/- 3.09 percent. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter at @JxhnBinder.

Boris Johnson’s under-fire chief adviser Dominic Cummings squashed a plan to delay Britain’s true Brexit day which was “all but agreed” while he and the Prime Minister were “laid out on their sickbeds”. Cummings, resented by much of the media establishment and the “deep state” for his role in the Vote Leave campaign and open disdain for journalists and bureaucrats, is currently the subject of a media circus over allegations he broke lockdown rules by travelling from London to Durham so his family could look after his young child if he and his wife were incapacitated by their coronavirus infections. Much to journalists’ chagrin, Boris Johnson has elected to stand by Cummings, saying he acted “responsibly, legally, and with integrity” — causing anti-Cummings commentators such as Piers Morgan of Good Morning Britain to demand that state officials scour his personal data for evidence of potential wrongdoing: Check the CCTV. Check his phone. Check his car GPS. #cummings pic.twitter.com/TLdvF2Le0T — Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) May 24, 2020  Less extensively reported is the fact that, on recovering from the Chinese virus, one of Cummings’ first was to squash a plan “concocted by underlings” while he and the Prime Minister were laid low to delay Britain’s true Brexit day. Technically, the United Kingdom has already left the European Union, but it remains in a so-called “transition period” in which it remains subject to the bloc’s laws, trade policy, judges, and migration regime — effectively EU membership in all but name, but minus representation in EU institutions such as the Commission and the Court of Justice. Remainers had seen the coronavirus as an opportunity to extend this “transition”, currently due to expire in December 2020, and apparently a plan to do so had been “all but agreed at official level” while Johnson and his adviser were out of action. "Is it one rule for you, Mr Cummings, and another rule for everybody else?" … ask journalists, tightly huddling around his car, hilariously in contravention of social distancing rules. This whole thing is absurd and everyone knows it. pic.twitter.com/J44RHSfOHa — Ben Goldsmith (@BenGoldsmith) May 24, 2020  “A deal to extend the transition in light of the [pandemic] had been all but agreed at official level,” reported Jeremy Warner, the Remain-voting assistant editor of The Daily Telegraph, in an article published earlier in May. “The EU was to have spared the UK’s blushes by proposing it, rather than the other way around. This would have allowed the UK government to present the concession as a favour to the EU, rather than a climbdown,” he explained. “But then Dominic Cummings, the Prime Minister’s chief adviser, returned and the plan, concocted by underlings while he and Boris Johnson were laid out on their sickbeds, was scuppered,” he lamented. They’re a bunch of shameless hypocrites.

For example, social media users have observed that reporters hounding him for the alleged dangerousness of his journey to Durham were crowding him and each other in large numbers while making no effort to observe social distancing and not even wearing masks outside his house. A sign with an electronic billboard playing official “stay at home” messaging driven to Cummings’ home by the anti-Brexit activist group Led by Donkeys may also have been flouting the lockdown rules the adviser is alleged to have broken.

A $21 million field hospital in Brooklyn, New York, authorized by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration at the peak of the coronavirus pandemic opened and closed without seeing any patients. The Brooklyn Cruise Terminal in Red Hook was one of several makeshift hospital sites throughout the city intended to relieve the city’s overcrowded hospitals brimming with coronavirus patients, the New York Post reported. De Blasio announced plans for the 750-bed $20.8 million field hospital in Red Hook on March 31, one day after the USNS Comfort hospital ship arrived in New York to aid in the fight against coronavirus. WABC reported that the USNS Comfort treated 182 patients over three and a half weeks before it departed at the end of April. The makeshift hospital in Brooklyn was slated to open in April, but it was not ready for use until May 4, and the site is now being disbanded after not being used, the City reported. “As part of our hospital surge, we expanded capacity at a breakneck speed, ensuring our hospital infrastructure would be prepared to handle the very worst. We did so only with a single-minded focus: saving lives,” de Blasio spokeswoman Avery Cohen told the Post Friday. “Over the past few months, social distancing, face coverings, and other precautionary measures have flattened the curve drastically, and we remain squarely on focused [sic] taking that progress even further,” Cohen added. The funding for the Red Hook makeshift hospital is expected to be reimbursed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

Several Democrats who have insisted on strict stay-at-home orders — including the wearing of face masks when out of doors — have been caught violating the rules that they wish to impose on others for fear of spreading the coronavirus. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D), who has suggested he might make wearing face masks mandatory, was spotted on the boardwalk in Virginia Beach on Saturday — without a mask. The Daily Beast quoted a spokesperson for the governor, who tried to help him save face: Alena Yarmosky, a spokeswoman for the Democratic governor—a physician who has repeatedly urged Virginians to wear face coverings in public—said he was “outside yesterday and not expecting to be within six feet of anyone. This is an important reminder to always have face coverings in case situations change,” adding, “we are all learning how to operate in this new normal, and it’s important to be prepared.” However, the governor was pictured taking selfies with beachgoers — at far closer range than six feet: A day after teasing that he’s making masks mandatory, Northam is out taking selfies? I didn’t believe the pictures were real, but they are…https://t.co/UFXyU8daaf pic.twitter.com/wXHyLZXBHG — Brent Scher (@BrentScher) May 24, 2020  The spokseperson also said that Northam simply wanted to make sure his social distancing rules were being enforced.

Pritzker noted that construction is an essential industry, though he did not explain why the workers’ cross-border travel was essential. Pritzker’s wife has also traveled to the family horse farm in Florida; when caught, Pritzker demanded reporters respect his family’s privacy. Earlier this month, photographs emerged of first-term Rep. Harley Rouda (D-CA) on a private beach in Orange County, California, after he said that it was “reckless” for local authorities to allow ordinary people to go to public beaches. Joel B.

An Ohio judge deemed the state’s lockdown in response to the Chinese coronavirus illegal, and stated that the state’s top health director “acted in an impermissibly arbitrary, unreasonable, and oppressive manner.” Lake County Common Pleas Judge Eugene Lucci ruled that Amy Acton, the director of the Ohio Department of Health, is prohibited from punishing nonessential businesses that defy Ohio’s orders to stay closed in response to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, Cleveland 19 News reported. The report added that the Lake County General Health District, police officers, prosecutors, and the Ohio Attorney General are also prohibited from punishing so-called “nonessential” businesses, as the companies already operate in compliance with standard safety regulations. Moreover, Lucci declared that Acton “has acted in an impermissibly arbitrary, unreasonable, and oppressive manner,” reported the Columbus Dispatch. Lucci’s ruling was in response to a May 8 lawsuit filed by 1851 Center for Constitution law on behalf of Rock House Fitness Inc, and 34 other gyms, which have been deemed nonessential businesses and thus told to stay closed under Ohio’s statewide “Stay Safe Ohio” order. “Constitutions are written to prevent governments from arbitrarily interfering in citizens’ lives and businesses,” said 1851 Center Executive Director Maurice Thompson, according to Cleveland 19 News. “On that front, the call to action is clear,” he added. “The Governor and health director may no longer impose their own closures and regulations and write their own criminal penalties to enforce those regulations and closures.” In issuing her orders, Acton relied on a statute that grants her department “ultimate authority in matters of quarantine and isolation.” Lucci, however, says that Ohio law only permits Acton to “isolate” the sick and “quarantine” those who have been exposed to an illness during the period of incubation for the disease, and that in the case of the Wuhan coronavirus, the incubation period is 14 days. Therefore, Judge Lucci has concluded that Acton’s powers are to stop after 14 days. “The director has quarantined the entire people of the state of Ohio, for much more than 14 days,” wrote Lucci. “The director has no statutory authority to close all businesses — which she deems non-essential for a period of two months.” You can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo, and on Instagram.

Sunday on MSNBC, former Housing Secretary Julian Castro called President Donald Trump’s coronavirus response “one of the worst failures in the history of our country.” When asked about the Trump administration pointing to China initially covering up the severity of the coronavirus, Castro said, “The Trump administration and this president is looking for any way that they can distract Americans from the fact that at the very moment when we needed strong leadership, when we needed a president and administration that was prepared to keep Americans safe, Trump and his administration failed, and they failed spectacularly.” He added, “To look at The New York Times cover today, to think that we’re closing in on 100,000 deaths in this country, so many of those deaths that did not have to happen that happened because this administration was unprepared. And so they could try and blame other countries, they could, you know, talk about anything they want, what they can’t do is avoid the fact that they were unprepared and because of that so many Americans have died.

NORCROSS, Georgia — Vice President Mike Pence told Breitbart News exclusively that China “let the world down” on the coronavirus pandemic, and that the Trump administration is developing plans to hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable for its actions. In an interview that aired on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel on this weekend, conducted here on Friday at Waffle House corporate headquarters outside Atlanta, Pence said that China and the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) hurt the world’s ability to prepare and respond to the pandemic by misleading and withholding “vital information.” “China let the world down, and the World Health Organization was their willing partner in withholding from the United States and the wider world vital information about the coronavirus that would have made it possible for us to stand up a national response sooner,” Pence, the chairman of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said. “It’s remarkable to think that China didn’t even let American CDC personnel in on the ground until mid-February to see what was going on.” The W.H.O., in response to Pence’s comments in this Breitbart News exclusive interview, issued a lengthy statement to Newsweek. “WHO works with 194 member states to promote health, China and the U.S. among them, to keep the world safe and serve the vulnerable,” W.H.O. said in response to Pence’s Breitbart News interview. “WHO’s work with China is identical to its work with any other member state. Moreover, its work with governments across the globe is science-based, with the aim of tackling disease outbreaks. WHO coordinates the international COVID-19 response in a transparent way and publishes on its website guidance, recommendations, reports and any other information that can help countries and individuals.” The statement from W.H.O. continued: WHO will initiate an independent evaluation at the earliest appropriate moment to review experience gained and lessons learned, and to make recommendations to improve national and global pandemic preparedness and response. We call on all nations to invest in strengthening and implementing the many tools at our disposal – especially the International Health Regulations. To be successful, we must all commit to mutual ownership and accountability. WHO is committed to constantly refining its actions. WHO undertakes internal operational reviews during emergencies, to course correct during the response, and after-action reviews to capture and build on lessons learnt during emergency responses. Newsweek also noted that the Chinese embassy in Washington, DC, did not respond to Pence’s comments. “The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not return Newsweek’s requests for comment before publication,” Newsweek wrote. Pence in his exclusive interview added that President Donald Trump’s decision to ban travel from China to the United States in late January bought the U.S. time in standing up its response to the pandemic, but also that the United States is preparing actions to ensure China is “held accountable” for the coronavirus. Pence also said that the administration is going to push for major “reforms” at the W.H.O. “The fact that the president suspended all travel from China at the end of January is a real testament to this president’s judgment. But make no mistake about it, China will be held accountable for what the world has gone through because of their lack of transparency. We’re going to continue to demand that the World Health Organization enact the kind of reforms going forward that if the world needs to know about any potential health threat, that we’ll know in the future,” Pence said. Pence’s comments confirming that the United States will hold China accountable come just a week after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Breitbart News that President Trump is “committed” to holding China accountable for the pandemic. “I don’t want to get out in front of what President Trump will ultimately decide, but I think we all know in this administration that we have to make sure that something like this can never happen again,” Pompeo said last weekend on Breitbart News Saturday. “That means deterrence. That means setting up processes. The president has already stopped funding to the W.H.O. so that we can evaluate that and figure out which pieces of the W.H.O. might actually work and which pieces don’t, so that we can deliver good outcomes and keep Americans safe and make sure this doesn’t happen again. Then, there will come a time, there will come a day when we evaluate what it is that needs to be done to convince the Chinese Communist Party that there are real costs—real costs—connected to this kind of misbehavior. You know this—we say this all the time inside the United States, but around the world too, we have to hold nations accountable. I’m talking with many of my counterparts around the world. We have to hold nations accountable for the things and actions that they undertake which create risk, and in this case created enormous loss of life here in the United States. President Trump is committed to doing that. The precise mechanisms we will choose. I want to make sure he gets fully briefed to make those decisions.” It also comes as President Trump wrote in a letter to W.H.O. Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus where he maintained the U.S. will continue to entirely cut off W.H.O. funding until such time as there are systemic reforms at the organization. Trump also told Tedros in the letter that the U.S. is considering altogether withdrawing from the W.H.O. This is the letter sent to Dr. Tedros of the World Health Organization. It is self-explanatory! pic.twitter.com/pF2kzPUpDv — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 19, 2020  Meanwhile, Australia is leading a group of 122 countries in seeking an investigation into how the pandemic began. The Australian effort approved by the W.H.O. member countries last week does not mention China, but Chinese Communist Party officials have expressed opposition to it. Trump confirmed that the United States is part of that push. The Chinese Communist Party leadership in Beijing has not been happy.about western efforts to push for transparency and accountability on this matter, whether it be the United States efforts or Australia’s or others’—and has launched a series of attacks through state-controlled propaganda media to attack western leaders. Pompeo, in his exclusive interview last weekend with Breitbart News Saturday, denounced such attacks. “I think this shows that the Chinese Communist Party understands the risk that they’ve put on top of their own nation,” Pompeo said, also noting that the state media attacks from China hit him as well as U.S. lawmakers and American media outlets. “Those attacks demonstrate weakness, not resolve, by the Chinese Communist Party. You and I are both old enough to remember how Communist regimes, how autocracies behave. Once they know they have done things that are wrong, they strike out. They try to blame others. I think that’s what you’re seeing. They also try to maneuver around the world through disinformation. We have been clear—President Trump, myself, the State Department—have been clear about making sure that everyone understands the facts surrounding the Chinese Communist Party.” LISTEN TO VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE ON BREITBART NEWS SATURDAY: 

Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) said he believes states can conduct mail-in voting for the November election amid the coronavirus pandemic safely. Scott said, “Well, what I’ve always believed is, I want people to go vote, and we’ve got to do it where there’s no fraud, so 100%, zero percent fraud. We have absentee ballots in Florida. We figured out how to do it in a safe manner. Now, I think what a lot of the Democrats want to do is do only mail-in ballots, and I don’t think that’s right. I think as long as you can do it safely, and as long as you can make sure there’s no fraud, we ought to be able to do absentee ballots like we do it in Florida.” He continued, “If you follow the law, and you enforce the law, and you set up the laws the right way, you can do it.” On President Donald Trump’s objections to mail-in voting, Scott said, “Well, I think what he’s saying is that it’s only, they’re talking about only doing mail-in ballots. I believe you can do it safely and you have the laws, and everybody follows the laws, I think that’s the key,” Scott responded. “I’m fine with absentee ballots the way we do it in Florida, with early voting the way we do it in Florida, with Election Day voting, which is clearly the safest.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

ROME — The Italian government announced Sunday it is recruiting 60,000 volunteer “civic assistants” as informants to report on anyone violating norms concerning the use of masks and social distancing. The government is recruiting unemployed citizens, especially those who receive social security or unemployment income, as an extension of its uniformed security services during the second phase of the coronavirus lockdown, Italian media reported. The plainclothes informants have received instructions to watch for abuses of state-mandated safety norms and to report on violators. The new measure is meant to prevent citizens from being tempted to slack off in compliance with government norms just because no uniformed police are present, since anyone could be an informant. The deployment of the army of “civic assistants” is reminiscent of measures taken by Italian mayors, such as Rome mayor Virginia Raggi, during the first phase of the lockdown. Ms. Raggi set up a special website where Italians could snitch on their neighbors if they saw them failing to comply with the established norms. The measure met with considerable opposition, with some suggesting that the move typical of the dark days of national fascism. The new measure was announced Sunday in a joint statement signed by the Minister for Regional Affairs and Autonomies Francesco Boccia and the Mayor of Bari (Puglia), Antonio Decaro, who serves as the President of the National Association of Italian Municipalities. Mr. Decaro rose to national prominence after a video went viral showing the mayor personally harassing citizens on the streets during phase one of the lockdown. Along with threatening them with police action, the mayor is seen shouting that he is the boss and that all are required to return to their homes. Sunday’s statement noted the difficulty of controlling citizen compliance with the lockdown norms since they are no longer confined to their own homes but can no visit shops and restaurants. “We are gradually entering a new normal where there is a gradual recovery of productive activities and citizens are returning to populate cities day after day,” the statement reads. Municipalities “will be able to take advantage of the contribution of ‘civic assistants’ to enforce all the measures put in place to counter and contain the spread of the virus, beginning with social distancing.” “Now is the time to recruit all those citizens who want to help the country, demonstrating a great civic sense,” it states. The authorities said that they expect to have their new army of informants ready for deployment by the end of next week. Follow @tdwilliamsrome

New England Patriots Owner Robert Kraft’s charity auction of his 2017 Super Bowl ring brought a winning bid of more than one million dollars on Thursday. Two weeks ago, Kraft announced that he would put his Super Bowl LI ring up for auction to benefit a charity that feeds needy Americans. The ring is forever a part of NFL history and memorializes the Patriots’ 34-28 come-from-behind victory over the Atlanta Falcons at Super Bowl LI on Feb. 5, 2017. With a starting bid of $75,000, the diamond-encrusted, 5.1-carat ring finally sold for $1.025 million, with 35 bids over the 12-day auction. “What could I do that would be special? I’ve been thinking about it for weeks,” Kraft said in a video posted to ESPN’s Twitter feed on May 10. “I finally thought about our experience in Super Bowl 51 against the Atlanta Falcons. We were down 28-3 [in the third quarter] and had 99.6% [odds] to lose. And we came back, and we won. “And I thought about what is going on at this time and wanted to give something of extreme value in support of our health care workers. So, I thought it would be good to give this ring, our fifth Super Bowl win because it showed how we came back,” Kraft added. Kraft’s auction will benefit the All-In Challenge, a movement to help multiple charities that fight food insecurity during the coronavirus pandemic, including Feeding America, Meals On Wheels, World Central Kitchen, and No Kid Hungry. “More than ever before, families will struggle to provide food as tens of millions are out of work, kids are out of school, many are at risk of losing their income, and our most vulnerable are self-isolating,” the group explains on the All-In Challenge website. Thus far, the All-In Challenge has raised more than $4.5 million for coronavirus relief. Follow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston.

Sunday on  ABC’s “This Week,” White House coronavirus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx said it is difficult to tell if the country will close again in the fall because of the coronavirus pandemic. Brix said, “I want to be very clear to the American people – we are preparing for that potential fall issue.” Guest host Martha Raddatz asked, “But you don’t see the country closing down again?” Birx answered, “It’s difficult to tell. I really am data-driven, so I’m collecting data right now about whether governors and whether states and whether communities are able to open safely. What do I mean by that? We have to do much better with proactive testing. Not just count the number of tests we’ve done. That’s great, but really ensure those tests are being applied in a way that we find the asymptomatic cases. It’s much easier to find symptomatic cases because people are sick. And when people are sick, they’re often not out and about, particularly if a severe case of COVID with a fever. What I’m worried about is, what are we putting in place to find asymptomatic cases? That’s why we’ve asked for proactive, 100% testing of all residents and workers and then proactive ongoing testing of workers in nursing homes, proactive testing where people are living together in large groups, whether they’re living together to serve a meatpacking plant or agricultural workers. I really want to call them events rather than targeting individuals because individuals are unknowingly spreading the virus. Let’s talk about events. All of this proactive testing needs to be in place and needs to continue to be in place because that will determine safely remaining open in the fall.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Hungarian-American plutocrat George Soros attacked populist Italian senator Matteo Salvini, claiming the League (Lega) leader wants to get Italy out of the European Union and the euro currency. The left-liberal billionaire launched his attack on the former Italian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior because he was worried about Italy leaving the European Union as Britain has done, saying: “I am particularly worried about Italy. Matteo Salvini, leader of the League, is working to get the country out of the euro and the EU.” While claiming that Salvini has lost some support since his time as Interior Minister, Soros was wary of the fact that “support for his positions is gaining momentum. What would Europe be without Italy? Italy was the most pro-European country. The Italians had more confidence in Europe than in their own governments, for excellent reasons, but they were mistreated during the refugee emergency of 2015.” He went on to add that during the Chinese coronavirus pandemic Italy has also been badly treated, saying EU aid rules have favoured countries like Germany rather than countries like Italy which were hardest hit by the virus, Il Giornale reports. 40 Per Cent of Italians Want to Leave The Euro and the European Union https://t.co/trFhJ4yOxB — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 24, 2020  While support for Salvini’s League has diminished slightly in the last several months, polls still consistently show the party to be the most popular in the country. A Euromedia Research survey published on Friday showed the League with 24.9 per cent of the vote and the centre-right coalition Salvini is a member with 47.6 per cent, ahead of the current leftist government coalition with 41.5 per cent. Anti-EU sentiment has risen dramatically in Italy over the last several months of the Wuhan virus crisis due to the lack of solidarity between EU member-states. A survey published in late April revealed that as many as 40 per cent of Italians want to leave the EU and the euro currency.

The purpose is to raise $10 million or more for COVID-19 relief efforts, and provide entertainment with four of the biggest stars from the PGA Tour and NFL. Another appeal to the Sunday made-for-TV exhibition, “The Match: Champions for Charity,” is a chance to see Tiger Woods swing a golf club for the first time in 98 days. Live golf is on television for the second straight Sunday, this one with the game’s biggest headliner. Woods was last seen on television Feb. 16 at the Genesis Invitational, where he moved cautiously in California’s chilly late winter weather and posted weekend rounds of 76-77 to finish last among the 68 players who made the cut at Riviera. He skipped a World Golf Championship in Mexico City, and said his surgically repaired back wasn’t quite ready in sitting out the opening three weeks of the Florida swing. And then the pandemic took over, and there has been no place to play. This is a reasonable start. Woods and retired NFL quarterback Peyton Manning will face Phil Mickelson and Tom Brady, who won six Super Bowls with the New England Patriots and signed this year with Tampa Bay. The match will be at Medalist Golf Club in Hobe Sound, Florida. It is Woods’ home course and about 20 minutes from Seminole, where last week Rory McIlroy, Dustin Johnson, Rickie Fowler and Matthew Wolff ushered golf’s return to live television. What to make of Woods? His only interviews were with GolfTV, the Discovery-owned channel with whom Woods has a financial deal, and a playful Zoom call with the other match participants hosted by Ernie Johnson of Turner Sports, which is televising the match. He described his health in the April 9 interview with GolfTV as “night and day.” “I feel a lot better than I did then,” Woods said. “I’ve been able to turn a negative into a positive and been able to train a lot and get my body to where I think it should be.” Mickelson has missed the cut in four of his five tournaments this year — the exception was third place at Pebble Beach, where he started the final round one shot behind Nick Taylor and closed with a 75. Just like last week, rust is to be expected for players who haven’t competed in two months — three, in the case of Woods. Manning, meanwhile, is retired and is a golf junkie. Brady remains employed, and this week got in some informal work with his new teammates in Tampa Bay. No fans will be allowed, just like last week at Seminole. One difference is the players will be in their own carts, whereas the four PGA Tour players last week carried their bags. But this is as much about entertainment as competition. It’s the second edition of a match between Woods and Mickelson, the dominant players of their generation and rivals by name, but not necessarily by record. Woods has 82 career victories to 44 for Mickelson, leads 15-5 in major championships and 11-0 in winning PGA Tour player of the year. Mickelson won their first made-for-TV match over Thanksgiving weekend in 2018, a pay-per-view event that ran into technical problems and was free for all. Lefty won in a playoff under the lights for $9 million in a winner-take-all match. He also has a 5-3-1 advantage over Woods in the nine times they have played in the final round on the PGA Tour, most recently in the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am in 2012 when Mickelson shot 64 to a 75 for Woods. He also stopped two streaks. Woods was going for his seventh straight PGA Tour victory when Mickelson beat him at Torrey Pines in 2000. Later that year, Woods had won 19 consecutive times on the PGA Tour when he had at least a share of the 54-hole lead until Mickelson beat him at the Tour Championship. Woods, however, captured the streak that mattered, holding off Mickelson in the final group at the Masters in 2001 to hold all four professional majors at the same time. The banter was lacking in Las Vegas, and perhaps having Manning and Brady will change the dynamics. The broadcast includes Charles Barkley providing commentary and Justin Thomas, whom Woods has embraced, on the course as a reporter in his television debut. After this exhibition, golf has two weeks before the PGA Tour is set to return at Colonial in Fort Worth, Texas. Mickelson plans to play. Woods has not said when he will return.  

Universities are beginning to cut sports programs as budgets continue to be devastated by the coronavirus. However, one professor thinks that those schools are using the pandemic as an excuse to cut sports programs they wanted to get rid of anyway. B. David Ridpath, associate professor of sports business at Ohio University and interim president of the Drake Group, a national nonprofit advocacy organization, blasted the schools looking to cut sports to make up for budget holes. “There’s a lot of fat that can be cut before sports being dropped,” Ridpath said. “I think dropping sports is basically a knee-jerk reaction, and many of the schools are using the pandemic as an excuse for something they already wanted to do. There may come a time where dropping a sport is a viable solution, but it should be the last one and based on many different things. “Dropping a sport and saying you are doing it for gender equity, I think, is an excuse,” the professor exclaimed. Looking a the programs that have been cut, it does appear that men’s programs have been hardest hit. “All but three of the 15 programs that have reportedly been eliminated at Division I colleges,” the paper notes, “including Cincinnati, Old Dominion, Akron, Central Michigan, East Carolina, and Florida International are men’s sports, which are often the first to be trimmed as schools, especially those with football programs, strive to comply with Title IX, the federal law requiring gender equity for participation and scholarship opportunities.” There are reportedly 499,217 student-athletes in the U.S. system of higher education, the more programs that are cut, the more of these students who will not be paying tuition, the paper reminds readers. “Dropping these sports, you’re likely losing bodies, and that counts against your overall enrollment,” Ridpath noted. “Enrollment is going down nationwide, and (colleges cutting sports) are not really looking at the whole picture here.” The cuts seen already including four sports cut at Akron, the elimination of baseball at Bowling Green, an end to the men’s indoor and outdoor track and field programs in Central Michigan, and the suspension of men’s and women’s tennis at Green Bay, the paper said.

Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell said it was “horrifying” President Donald Trump is making wearing a mask a political issue. Host Chuck Todd said, “One of the things that I think is already a theme from just this show this morning is how, very gently, whether it’s Republican governor Mike DeWine or the national security adviser,  they want to make the point that, let’s not politicize the mask debate.” Mitchell said, “But the president has politicized the mask debate. The president is the one who is fighting his own medical guidelines from the CDC and others, sidelining the medical advisers. We haven’t seen very much of them with the one exception of Dr. Birx the other night briefly, and she was in a very ambiguous situation at that last briefing. So, the president is fighting his own government, and his rebellion tweets. I mean, he is the one who has made this red state/blue state, and it is really horrifying in a pandemic to be making it a political issue. It should be a medical issue, a health issue, not a political issue.” Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” White House senior economic adviser Kevin Hassett warmed the unemployment rate would soon be “north of 20%.” Guest host Dana Bash said, “Do you think the worst effects of the coronavirus pandemic behind us or is the worst still to come?” Hassett said, “I think we’ll still see more bad data because the data tend to be in the rearview mirror. If you look at employment or businesses or percentage of businesses that are open or even the credit card data which we get a peek at, then you can see things pretty much inflicted in early May. So my expectation is since there’s still initial claims for unemployment insurance in may, that the unemployment rate will be higher in June than in May, but then after that it should start to trend down. So I think we’re very, very close to an inflection point in terms of business activity and probably a month away in terms of employment.” Bash asked, “You think unemployment is going to be even higher?” Hassett said, “Yeah, it’s going to be quite a bit higher. And there were some technical things that kind of messed up, it could be an economics lecture if we go into them, but if they fix the things from last time, you’ll end up with a number north of 20%.” Bash asked if “it’s possible that unemployment will be in double digits in November.” Hassett replied, “Yes, I do. But I think that all the signs of economic recovery are going to be raging everywhere.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Three “youths” in the notorious radical Islamist hotbed municipality of Molenbeek in Brussels were arrested after spitting on police vehicle door handles in an effort to spread the Chinese coronavirus. The three individuals arrested were members of the so-called “White Vests”. The group wear white vests while supposedly trying to raise awareness among the youths of Molenbeek about the dangers of coronavirus, advising people to abide by social distancing rules, wash their hands, and engage in other helpful actions such as redistributing food. A police source told Flemish newspaper Het Nieuwsblad on Wednesday that the three arrested White Vests were spitting on the police vehicles hoping “that they themselves were infected with corona and that they, in turn, could make police officers sick”. The incident is not the first to discredit the work of the White Vests group, as they are also under investigation for allegedly holding a party in contravention of the Belgian coronavirus lockdown measures currently in place. Woman Claiming to Have Virus Jailed for Spitting on Police She Called 'Dirty Whites' https://t.co/1pxCfmh02x — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 30, 2020  Spitting attacks have been seen in multiple countries since the start of the coronavirus outbreak in Europe, leading to arrests and imprisonment in some cases. In France, a woman was handed a prison term of seven months after she spat at police officers while calling them “dirty whites” and saying: “I hope you will all die of Covid.” She also remarked “I have the coronavirus, you’re all going to die” as she was being detained. A month later in the city of Montauban, a 39-year-old homeless migration-background man was sentenced to two years in prison after robbing other homeless people at knifepoint and later spitting on police while telling them he had tested positive for coronavirus. Police in Vienna, Austria, were also attacked last month, with three spitting attacks taking place in a single day in the city. One of the attackers was later confirmed to be infected with coronavirus.

The Chinese coronavirus has killed more than 342,000 people around the globe, decimated economies and laid waste to the hopes and dream of millions of people, yet the bungled response of World Health Organization (W.H.O.) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to the crisis was warmly applauded Sunday by China’s Communist government. Beijing’s top diplomat Wang Yi said the Ethiopian bureaucrat has done a good job and countries “with decency” will support him and the W.H.O. in its future work. Speaking at a press conference on the sidelines of the Chinese Communist Party’s annual People’s Congress in Beijing, Wang claimed the W.H.O. was beyond reproach, although he declined the opportunity to offer a single fact to back his claim. “We hope all countries will realize that humanity is a community with a shared future. We must render each other more support and cooperation, and there should be less accusation and confrontation. We call on all nations to come together and build a better world for all,” he said. “As for W.H.O.’s international standing and its place in history, I’m sure clear-eyed people the world over will reach a fair conclusion, one that will not be altered just because some country doesn’t like it,” Wang added. Those who throw mud at the W.H.O. will only leave a stain on themselves, said Wang, in defiance of a host of countries who see nothing but hopeless mismanagement almost from the first day the virus was isolated. U.S. health secretary Alex Azar has already blamed the W.H.O. for not obtaining or providing the information needed to stem the pandemic. “We must be frank about one of the primary reasons this outbreak spun out of control: there was a failure by this organisation to obtain the information that the world needed, and that failure cost many lives,” he said earlier this month. The evidence backs that assertion. As far back as January 14, two months after health officials are believed to have detected the first case of the virus in China on November 17 of last year, the W.H.O. was promoting a Chinese claim via Twitter that there was “no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.” Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in #Wuhan, #China🇳. pic.twitter.com/Fnl5P877VG — World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) January 14, 2020  Meanwhile, the disease was spiraling out of control. The W.H.O. tweet came a day before the first case to reach the United States reportedly flew from Wuhan to the state of Washington. At the same time, the W.H.O. explicitly warned against travel restrictions for those coming from Wuhan or elsewhere in China, despite the fact that these restrictions could could have saved the lives of tens of thousands of people who have since succumbed to the deadly virus. Tedros’ visit to Beijing was, in part, a vote of confidence in favor of keeping global travel ties to China. “The W.H.O. noted that some countries are planning to evacuate their citizens from China, saying there is no need to overact and the W.H.O. is fully confident that the Chinese government can bring the spread of the disease under control,” Chinese state media reported while Tedros was in Beijing on January 28. In the months since, the W.H.O. has delivered other mixed messages about the Chinese coronavirus and even had its U.S. finances cut off, such is the level of frustration with its inability to carry out the most simple of tasks in warning the world of an approaching pandemic. It has done nothing to dismiss allegations it speaks solely for the Chinese Communist Party, a point noted in Washington: For his part, Tedros said on Friday his organization “worked day and night to coordinate the global response” to the coronavirus , “providing technical advice, catalysing political solidarity, mobilising resources, coordinating resources and much more.” “So far almost $800 million has been pledged or received towards W.H.O.’s appeal for COVID-19 programs, leaving a gap of just over $900 million,” Tedros told the 34 members of the W.H.O. Executive Board in a three-hour teleconference, stressing the need – again – for more funding.

ROME — The long-term cost of Italy’s nationwide coronavirus lockdown is slowly emerging as media report that nearly a third of the country’s businesses will not reopen and millions remain without work or income. The Italian newspaper Il Giornale reported Sunday that one in three stores in Rome and Milan will not reopen their doors and many are not applying for state-guaranteed loans. Moreover, a significant percentage of those who have accepted loans are not expected to be able to repay them. A study carried out by Confesercenti also found that after Italy’s unprecedented 67-day lockdown, a mere 26 per cent of Italians have resumed shopping for “non-essential” items. Of the establishments that have reopened, 68 per cent acknowledge to be working so far at a loss, and more than a third (37 per cent) report more that sales are only half of their normal level, with only 17 per cent saying they have maintained revenue levels equal to the pre-virus period. Italy: Illegal Migrant Labourers Threaten General Strike If Not Given Amnesty https://t.co/n82NM6wnqy — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 14, 2020  Italy’s fashion industry has been particularly hard hit, and those who reopened faced stockpiled inventories of Fall-Winter collections, according to Francesca Venturi, founder at Rome-based luxury fashion consultancy Elevate. Reduced demand for products “Made in Italy” has negatively impacted a long list of fashion and luxury brands including Prada, Dolce & Gabbana, Versace, and Armani, Venturi said. And while established luxury brands certainly suffered during the pandemic, the smaller, family-run fashion enterprises have borne the brunt of the damage, she said. Venturi added that the majority of retailers are not immediately rehiring furloughed employees but are waiting to see whether demand takes off again before committing to paying wages. The tourist industry, on the other hand, which accounts for some 13 per cent of the country’s GDP, has lost all revenue over the past three months and will only recover slowly. Italy will reopen to international travel on June 3rd, but for many, strict regulations on hotels and restaurants will keep numbers below the required profit margin to stay open. Italy’s service sector risks losing some 4 billion euros of added value in 2020 with the disappearance of about 30 thousand companies and almost 90 thousand jobs, according to a study carried out by Asseprim Confcommercio, a federation of professional services, in collaboration with Format Research.

Saturday on Fox News Channel’s “Justice,” host Jeanine Pirro took aim at what she deemed “authoritarian governors” and other elected officials who are insisting a prolonged shutdown as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Pirro recognized the Memorial Day holiday, calling it the quintessential American holiday, but noted the actions of some elected officials contradicted American ideals. “[A]uthoritarian governors and local officials looking to flex their pathetic muscles to keep us on lockdown are another story,” she said. “New York City and L.A. Are still on lockdown. Democratic Mayor Garcetti says la will not fully open until there is a vaccine. And schools probably will not re-open until kids can get tested weekly. Democrat Gov. Gavin Newsom in line with him. Democrat Gov. Andrew Cuomo never figured out seniors needed to be isolated and protected.” “And he did nothing when complaints were made, and people begged that COVID-infected patients not be put into nursing homes and long-term care facilities where 5,800 seniors died,” she continued. “Curious, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in Florida, with 2 million more people than New York, criticized by the left mercilessly for not doing enough early on, only lost 1,000 seniors, although one is too many. But he knew to protect and isolate the seniors.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor

The New York Times has devoted the entire front page of its Sunday edition to a list of names of those who have died from the coronavirus. The front page of The New York Times for May 24, 2020 pic.twitter.com/d14JhFp4CP — The New York Times (@nytimes) May 24, 2020  The Times deleted an earlier tweet of the image of its front page because of an error, as it explained: Correction: Earlier editions of Sunday’s front page included at least one name in error. Our original tweet containing an image of that front page has been deleted and replaced with an image of the late edition. — The New York Times (@nytimes) May 24, 2020  Though the Times used the number “100,000,” the actual death count on the newspaper’s own running count is just above 97,000 as of early Sunday morning. President Donald Trump ordered flags lowered to half-staff over Memorial Day weekend to commemorate the victims of the coronavirus. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) had asked him to lower the flags on the date the U.S. hit 100,000 deaths, but Trump chose to use Memorial Day as the focus instead. The impact of the pandemic shocked leaders around the world and took many scientists and observers by surprise — including the Times itself, which reported Jan. 8: “The new coronavirus doesn’t appear to be readily spread by humans.” Joel B.

During Friday’s Democratic Weekly Address, Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) stated that passing another coronavirus relief package is urgent, and that Congress can help to honor the sacrifices of America’s fallen veterans by ensuring that veterans, and all other Americans, can stay safe. Duckworth also touted legislation she introduced to cut healthcare costs for veterans. Transcript as Follows: “Hi, I’m Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois. Before serving in Congress, I spent 23 years in the military, serving with some of the bravest men and women our nation has to offer. Men and women who placed the values of our country, the liberty and ideas on which we stand, before their very own well-being. Who understood that we are all stronger when we work together to achieve a common good—and when we refuse to leave anyone behind. I’m going to spend this Memorial Day thinking of all those warriors who sacrificed everything for the nation they loved. I’m going to be thinking about my friends who never made it home from war. I’m going to be thinking about the stories they told about their families and the hopes they shared about their futures. We can never begin to repay the debt we owe them and their loved ones. But it’s on us to try. That doesn’t mean just spending 24 hours once every May reflecting on their memories. It means spending every day trying to lead the lives that actually honor sacrifices that they made in the way that they deserve. Right now, those of us in Congress can begin to do that by ensuring that our Veterans, along with all other Americans, have what they need to stay as safe as possible during this global pandemic. Because even while Mitch McConnell is trying to slow-walk the next relief package, claiming that he hasn’t yet, quote, ‘felt the urgency of acting immediately,’ the reality is that the folks I’m hearing from aren’t having any trouble feeling that urgency. And I don’t know McConnell’s definition, but when more than 90,000 Americans, including more than 1,000 Veterans, have died in just three months, that certainly qualifies as urgent in my book. The fact that countless Veterans are more vulnerable to COVID-19 because of their service, because they were exposed to Agent Orange when serving in Vietnam or exposed to burn pits in Iraq or suffering from Gulf War Syndrome, boy that sure seems urgent to me. That’s why I just introduced a bill to slash Veterans’ healthcare costs and ensure they don’t have to pay more for vaccines or COVID-19 preventive services than any other insured American. That’s why we Democrats have been fighting to expand testing and contact tracing, to get hospitals the resources that they need, to boost grant funding for small businesses, including those that are owned by Veterans, and to funnel more support into hunger prevention programs like SNAP, which more than a million Veterans rely on to survive. And it’s why we’re working so hard to ensure that every eligible American can register to vote safely, securely, accessibly, and as conveniently as possible. After all, it’s unthinkable that Republicans like McConnell and Trump might refuse to do so—forcing our Veterans to choose between protecting their health and exercising a Constitutional right their brothers and sisters in arms gave up their lives defending. Towards the end of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln said that we must always strive to ‘care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow, and his orphan…’ This Memorial Day weekend, as our nation faces a very different crisis, let’s recommit to heeding President Lincoln’s words, for there is no better way to honor the sacrifices of our fallen heroes than by acting in service of others. Thank you. God bless all of our troops in harm’s way right now. God bless all of our Veterans. God bless each and every one of you and of course, as always, God bless the United States of America. Be well.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

Harvard psychology professor Steven Pinker said Thursday that the push for reopening society from lockdowns comes from Christianity’s “malignant delusion” of belief in an afterlife. Atheists who believe in this life alone are more concerned with health and safety, Professor Pinker suggested in a Tweet, while Christians tend to devalue “actual lives” and live a riskier existence. Belief in an afterlife is a malignant delusion, since it devalues actual lives and discourages action that would make them longer, safer, and happier. Exhibit A: What’s really behind Republicans wanting a swift reopening? Evangelicals. https://t.co/ppo2bwiVGn — Steven Pinker (@sapinker) May 21, 2020  Pinker was responding to an article this week in the Washington Post, which examined findings that Democrats take the virus “more seriously” than Republicans and are more willing to support restrictive government edicts in response to the pandemic. In that article, contributing columnist Gary Abernathy declares that a “literal belief in eternal salvation — eternal life — helps explain the different reactions to life-threatening events like a coronavirus outbreak.” He states: Evangelicals take it to heart when James reminds them, ‘What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes,’ or when Paul writes, ‘I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us,’ or when Jesus asks, rhetorically, ‘Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life?’ It should be no surprise that a person’s deepest beliefs about the world influence how they measure the risks they’re willing to take. So, when ruminating over why there are millions of people who don’t seem to panic over a global pandemic or other life-threatening event, critics should remember that, right or wrong, it often involves a belief in something even bigger than people named Trump, Hannity or Limbaugh. Historically, Christian belief in eternal life has rarely resulted in disengagement from the common task of bettering the world and looking out for the needs of others. Nor is belief in the afterlife the exclusive domain of evangelicals, but forms part of the common creed of all orthodox Christians. To take just one example, the Catholic Church asserts explicitly that belief in eternity should spur Christians on to work for the good of human society in this life. “While rejecting atheism, root and branch, the Church sincerely professes that all men, believers and unbelievers alike, ought to work for the rightful betterment of this world in which all alike live,” states the pastoral constitution Gaudium et Spes from the Second Vatican Council. The text states: Therefore, while we are warned that it profits a man nothing if he gain the whole world and lose himself, the expectation of a new earth must not weaken but rather stimulate our concern for cultivating this one. For here grows the body of a new human family, a body which even now is able to give some kind of foreshadowing of the new age. Study after study has found that such “theory” is borne out in practice as well, with religious people proving far more generous with their time and money than atheists. In one of the largest studies of its kind, the massive Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey in 2000 found that religious people are 25 percentage points more likely than secularists to donate money and 23 points more likely to volunteer their time.

Georgia is moving faster than California in its effort to re-start Hollywood production, with Gov. Brian Kemp (R) issuing COVID-19 guidelines on Friday to help ensure that cast and crew members remain safe when they eventually return to work. While studios will ultimately decide when they will resume shooting on movies and TV shows, individual states serve as a key component by providing health guidelines that serve as a common benchmark for all studios and production companies. Georgia is the first state to issue COVID-19 recommendations covering nearly every aspect of production, including casting, shooting, and even the food catering process. California is expected to release a similar document on Monday. Best practices for film & TV in Georgia are available as planning continues & additional industry protocol is issued. The same elements that have made Georgia attractive to film remain in place. We look forward to a safe return when productions are ready! https://t.co/8gIHjtu3zo pic.twitter.com/6opGaC1xxv — Georgia, USA (@gdecd) May 22, 2020  Gov. Kemp praised Georgia’s production industry for weathering the coronavirus crisis. “We are so grateful to the hardworking people who make up and contribute to Georgia’s incredibly successful film and TV industry, and we thank them for all the ways they have given back throughout the state’s response to COVID-19,” he said in a statement on Friday. “The Georgia Film Office has maintained their close work with industry executives to develop these outlines for how productions can help protect cast and crew members. ” The major Hollywood studios, as well as Netflix and Amazon, have yet to indicate when they will resume domestic production. The studios are currently working with the Hollywood trade unions to develop a white paper that will provide industry-wide standards to keep people safe while working on sets. Norman Reedus, Melissa McBride, Khary Payton, Lauren Cohan, Danai Gurira, Sydney ParkPhoto by Jackson Lee Davis/AMC Filmmaker and producer Tyler Perry has already leap-frogged ahead of others by announcing that he will resume production on a limited basis at his Atlanta studio on July 7. His studio will start shooting two BET series — The Oval and Sistas — over a two week period. Natalia Dyer, Caleb McLaughlin, Sadie Sink, Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, Charlie Heaton, and Noah Schnapp in Stranger Things (Netflix, 2016) This week, Perry put out his own comprehensive safety plan outlining the testing and quarantine procedures all personnel will have to follow. Georgia is one of Hollywood’s favorite filming locations thanks to generous financial incentives that include a 20 percent tax credit for certain productions. When shooting came to a halt in late March, the state had five feature films and 29 series in production, with many more in pre-production. For the most recent fiscal year, the state saw 391 film and television shoots, with $9.2 billion in total wages. The popular Netflix series Stranger Things and Ozark shoot in Georgia. Disney has filmed many of its Marvel movies at the Pinewood Atlanta Studios, including Black Panther and The Guardians of the Galaxy movies. Georgia’s new set of best practices recommends masks to be worn at all times, except when actors are in front of cameras. It also calls for social distancing, COVID-19 testing, and limiting personnel on set.
The state’s film office is asking studios to use the Georgia recommendations together with the industry-wide labor standards when they are eventually released. Follow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg. Have a tip? Contact me at dng@breitbart.com

Several casinos in the greater Los Angeles area have reopened for Memorial Day weekend after nearly two months of being shut down due to the deadly coronavirus. On Friday, Morongo Casino in Cabazon, located near Palm Springs in Riverside County, reopened at 2:00 p.m. Additional casinos Tortoise Rock, Agua Calient, and others located in Coachella Valley opened earlier on Friday.

In addition to their reopening efforts, representatives for the casinos have stated that certain safety precautions and measures have been implemented. A few of those measures include limiting the number of customers inside at one time, temperature checks at entranceways, and a modified cleaning schedule. Those using table games and slot machines will also be spread out so that social distancing guidelines are met. Certain slot machines will also feature modified barriers. Certain casinos that have chosen to reopen have prohibited smoking and require all customers and employees to wear face masks. Some restaurants within the casinos will also reopen, including Tortoise Rock and nearby Spotlight 29 casino.

Gavin Newsom warned casinos against reopening their doors. Tribal land, which is federally protected, is not required to adhere to local guidelines. Last week, Newsom sent a letter to tribal leaders urging them to follow the state’s plan to reopen. It said: I cannot stress enough that the risk of COVID-19 transmission remains a serious threat for all Californians. In the spirit of sovereign-to-sovereign engagement I respectfully request that until a surrounding or neighboring local jurisdiction has legally progressed into Stage 3, your tribal casinos remain closed. Other counties, including Ventura, Santa Barbara, and San Diego, have also begun efforts to reopen amid California’s strict stay-at-home mandates. Riverside County officials have stated that they will no longer enforce stay-at-home orders.

The founder and CEO of Ad Astra, a company using data mining technology to help colleges and universities improve their quality for students, suggested that colleges redesign schedules so that more students are able to enroll in the courses they need to graduate and get a job. In a recent piece published in Inside Higher Ed, founder and CEO of Ad Astra Tom Shaver recommends that institutions of higher learning make it easier for students to “get the courses they need to continue to move toward graduation and ultimately employment,” as many students face unprecedented problems in the wake of the Chinese virus pandemic. “With incoming students, it’s unclear whether the crisis will scare them off or if enrollment will grow in the fall, as it typically does during a recession when millions of jobless Americans suddenly find themselves searching for new skills,” writes Shaver, adding that schedule building and registration “must be rethought in this environment.” The CEO goes on to suggest that this is especially important because if life were to quickly change for students — and they suddenly find themselves homeschooling children or stocking shelves at a grocery store during a pandemic — they should be able to “move more quickly” through their degree program “and into a new job.” “Institutions should focus on providing access to courses based on need, not credits,” writes Shaver. “This can help reduce the impact of bottleneck courses — which can be a massive barrier to degree completion.” According to the California State University system, “bottleneck” courses are defined as “anything that limits students’ ability to make progress toward graduation,” which might be considered core curriculum — classes that students typically take in their first year of college, which are considered basic — or more advanced courses. Shaver also describes bottleneck courses as necessary classes that are harder for students to get into because there is a high demand and limited capacity. “Our research shows that nearly a quarter of all courses are overloaded, signaling they may be bottlenecked,” writes Shaver. “And those percentages may grow as COVID-19’s disruption pushes students toward certain courses at the same time that budget cuts force colleges to cut sections.” “With better data, institutions could redesign their operations to focus more on helping students whose lives have been disrupted or were already complicated prior to this crisis,” he adds. “They can do so, in part, by ensuring that early access to classes is given to students based on need, not arbitrary credit or year thresholds.” Shaver argues that if this does not become a priority, students raising children or who otherwise live “complex” lives, then “being shut out of a required course can mean an additional semester or year in college.” “It can mean more debt,” adds Shaver. “It can mean they never graduate.” You can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo, and on Instagram.

A Brooklyn field hospital closed without seeing any patients, city officials confirmed this week. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) announced the construction of the multimillion-dollar field hospital at the end of March — the day after the USNS Comfort docked at Manhattan’s Pier 90. “They are going to set it up rapidly and we’re then going to go to the next site, the next site, the next site to meet our goal,” de Blasio said, detailing the 670-bed plus site at the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal in Red Hook. He also announced another overflow facility at the Billie Jean King Tennis Center in Flushing. That 350-bed facility only saw 79 patients, according to THE CITY. However, the Red Hook facility never saw a single patient, and both locations ended up costing over $40 million combined. THE CITY reported: Earlier this month, the makeshift hospital at the tennis center closed after taking in 79 patients, according to City Hall officials. It cost $19.8 million to construct and revert back, the officials said. The lower-profile Red Hook terminal hospital was slated to open in mid-April but wasn’t ready for service until May 4. By then, citywide hospital utilization had already fallen by half its April 12 highpoint, to about 6,000 patients. City officials say the $20.8 million site, constructed by Texas-based contractor SLSCO under a no-bid emergency contract, is now being demobilized after seeing no medical activity. Similarly, the USNS Comfort, which was originally slated to take pressure off New York hospitals by taking non-coronavirus patients, departed after seeing just 182 patients over its month-long stay. Even though ship agreed to designate 500 of its 1,000 beds for coronavirus patients, it never came close to reaching capacity. The 1,000 bed USNS Mercy, which docked at Los Angeles Harbor March 27, departed May 15 after treating just 77 patients. It came prepared with 800 crew members “12 fully-equipped operating rooms, laboratories, a pharmacy, [and] radiological equipment … becoming the largest hospital in the city,” KTLA reported. Similar occurrences have been reported in other areas of the country, as many of the doomsday scenarios touted by experts never came to fruition. As Breitbart News reported: Other areas of the country are telling similar stories — preparing for a surge that never came. A 250-bed field hospital set up by the Army in Seattle’s CenturyLink Field Event Center, for example, shut down in April after just three days. It never saw a single patient. Gov. Jay Inslee (D) said they requested the hospital “before our physical distancing strategies were fully implemented and we had considerable concerns that our hospitals would be overloaded with Covid-19 cases.” The McCormick Place field hospital in Chicago, Illinois, is also gradually reducing its presence, taking down half of its 1,000 hospital beds as medical centers in the region did not reach capacity. “As part of our hospital surge, we expanded capacity at a breakneck speed, ensuring our hospital infrastructure would be prepared to handle the very worst. We did so only with a single-minded focus: saving lives,”  City Hall spokesperson Avery Cohen said, according to THE CITY. “Over the past few months, social distancing, face coverings, and other precautionary measures have flattened the curve drastically, and we remain squarely focused on taking that progress even further,” Cohen added. The news comes as the country slowly begins to reopen, state by state, following the peak of the Chinese coronavirus. It virtually halted the U.S. economy, resulting in 38.6 million of Americans reporting jobless claims in the last nine weeks.

The Department of the Interior announced earlier this month that it will begin to restore access to national parks to the American people. Many of the 419 parks managed by the National Park Service have remained open in some capacity since the virus hit the United States in March. The DOI website listed some of those parks and the Trump administration’s effort to reopen them: The health and safety of visitors, volunteers, partners, and federal employees continues to be paramount as the Department restores public access to public lands again.  President Trump recognizes the magnificence and grandeur of our National Park System and public lands and the incredible benefits of the great outdoors. Access to public lands continues to be evaluated in accordance with federal, state, and local public health guidance with some notable locations beginning to welcome visitors back this week: ABC reported on the parks on the first unofficial summer holiday weekend: Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, whose department oversees the park service, said he’s confident Americans will be safe in national parks this summer. “We feel that we can play an important role in the moving forward picture. And I think a lot of people will be out utilizing us this summer,” Bernhardt said in an interview with ABC’s Aaron Katersky. Bernhardt said he’s encouraged by events like the Thunderbirds and Blue Angels flyover in Washington, D.C., earlier this month, when he said visitors to the National Mall naturally spaced themselves out to respect social distancing in what he called “social clumping.” “I’m frankly encouraged by this,” Bernhardt said. “And what I saw was what I’m gonna call clumping. And that’s not a scientific term.” He continued: It’s my belief that groups of people have decided that that – they’re colleagues and maybe they’re a family member, maybe it’s a cohort of workers – but whatever it is, they’ve decided in some way that they are comfortable with social distancing with them in a very narrow space, so maybe like three feet. But what you saw is clumps, so like family units or groups that were together, and then space and then individual and space and another clump and space. National Park Service spokesperson Alexandra Picavet said in the ABC report that visitors should have any supplies they need and recognize that trash cans and restrooms may be less accessible. “Every Memorial Day weekend is a busy Memorial Day weekend in a national park,” Picavet said. “What we want to do is try and help people find their way of honoring people who have lost their lives in service to our nation which is what memorial day is about.” “That’s why we have really worked hard to try and find a way to help people continue to have that connection with our American history and what Memorial Day is about,” Picavet said. “Several national park locations are hosting live stream events, including demonstrations, tributes, and virtual campouts, to commemorate the weekend,” ABC reported. “The National Park Service has created a website to search virtual events at different parks.” Follow Penny Starr on Twitter

Democrat New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said New York’s one-day coronavirus death toll has fallen below 100 for the first time in weeks. Eighty-four people died in New York from the coronavirus on Friday, down from 109 the previous day, CBS News reported. “Eighty-four is still a tragedy, no doubt,” he said. “But the fact that it’s down as low as it is is really, overall, good news”: We lost 84 New Yorkers to COVID-19 yesterday. By any normal standard this is a hideous number. But we are thankful this number has fallen below 100 for the first time since late March. — Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) May 23, 2020  At its peak, the single-day death toll for coronavirus in New York hit close to 800 in one day. New York City, the center of the state’s outbreak, hit its peak number of fatalities on April 7, when 590 people died in one day. Deaths and hospitalizations in the city have also fallen in line with recent trends, with the city reporting 15 deaths from the coronavirus on Thursday — the most recently available data from the city’s health department. Cuomo said Saturday that New York’s Long Island and Mid-Hudson regions, which border New York City, could reopen as soon as next week if deaths continue to decline and residents continue to practice social distancing. According to data from Johns Hopkins University, 28,853 people have died of the coronavirus in New York state since the pandemic began and has had more deaths than every state in the country. However, more than 63,000 New Yorkers have survived and recovered after contracting the virus.

A leading conservative national public interest law firm has defended President Trump’s call for the reopening of churches, insisting they provide “essential” services. “We appreciate and fully endorse the President’s call to reopen the churches,” said attorney Stephen Crampton, special counsel at the Thomas More Society. “Churches are essential organizations; they provide essential services that are desperately needed during these desperate times.” “As President Trump said, ‘We need more prayer in America, not less,’” Crampton noted in a statement sent to Breitbart News Saturday. “The discriminatory labeling of churches as nonessential by many governors across the nation has infringed our rights and injured our recovery from this terrible pandemic.” “It is high time to reopen the churches,” he said. The Chicago-based Thomas More Society provides pro bono legal services in defense of life, family, and religious liberty, and is currently involved in fighting for the rights of churches in various states, including Illinois, California, Mississippi, New Jersey, among others. In one such case, the South Bay United Pentecostal Church in Chula Vista is heading to the Ninth Circuit Federal Court of Appeals after filing a lawsuit claiming that the state’s governor issued unconstitutional orders during the coronavirus pandemic in violation of religious rights. The Thomas More Society filed an Urgent Motion for an Injunction Pending Appeal on May 16, 2020, with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which the court has set on the fast track for a quick decision. In a separate federal lawsuit in the Southern District of California, the Thomas More Society noted that California is one of only eight states “whose response to the COVID-19 pandemic has included no accommodation for — hardly even a mention of — the religious rights of its citizens.” “After weeks of government suppression of their religious freedoms, our clients have said enough is enough,” said Charles LiMandri, special counsel for the Thomas More Society. “The First Amendment still protects their right to freely exercise their faith, even during a pandemic.” Follow @tdwilliamsrome

NORCROSS, Georgia — Vice President Mike Pence told Breitbart News he believes any fourth phase coronavirus relief package from Congress must focus on directly supporting American families and workers. Pence, who sat for an exclusive with Breitbart News at Waffle House corporate headquarters after a roundtable with business leaders and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp about reopening America as the pandemic recedes, met this week with House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to discuss a pathway forward. In the Friday interview that aired on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel on Saturday, Pence said such discussions are “very preliminary” at this stage. “I would characterize the discussions as very preliminary because we’re still moving a lot of the resources that Congress has already approved out and literally hundreds of millions of dollars—billions of dollars—of support directly to families, directly to small businesses, resources to states not only to support state services, but first responders, as well as unemployment benefits and a whole range of resources we’ve made available to hospitals and healthcare facilities,” Pence said. “But I think as we go forward, the focus is going to be on the American people, on American families. President Trump said it plainly: we’re going to do whatever it takes to get the American people through this. That’s the reason why the core of the CARES Act was direct payments to Americans, to every American family. The average family of four would receive $3,400 in a direct payment from the federal government, supporting people who were at risk of losing their job, or had lost their job, through Paycheck Protection and, of course, the unemployment benefits. But we really do believe that whatever else might be necessary to get the American people and families and small businesses through his time, we’ve got to have provisions that will promote economic growth and accelerate this recovery in the second half of this year and in 2021.” The House Democrats, under the leadership of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, passed a $3 trillion spending bill last week meant to be an opening bid from Democrats. But that bill is dead-on-arrival in the Senate because it did not address coronavirus relief and, instead, was packed to the brim with Democrat political wish list priorities. Republicans have just begun discussions about a phase four deal, one that would actually address the pandemic, unlike the Democrats’ political bill. It is unclear if there will actually be a phase four deal, but if there is one, Pence said the White House and Republicans have certain priorities they think would truly help the country turn a corner past coronavirus. Pence specifically said a payroll tax cut is a must in whatever deal may be in the works, as it would increase workers’ take-home pay by more than seven percent immediately. He also said the Trump administration is looking at other possible tax cuts and deductions, such as a capital gains tax cut and certain deductions to incentivize economic activity in certain arenas — restaurants and entertainment, for example. “The president believes that a payroll tax cut, which would increase the take-home pay of working Americans by 7.6 percent immediately and puts money in the pocket of working Americans, would have an enormously beneficial effect on generating economic growth,” Pence said. “It would help Americans have more money in their pocket, it would create more demand in the market, and combining that with continuing the payroll tax relief for businesses, we believe, is a prescription for going forward. We’re also looking at a capital gains tax reduction, we’re looking at restoring a business deduction for dining out or restaurants and entertainment; we think that would also stimulate people being back out. It’s amazing to think that one out of four of the jobs lost during the coronavirus lockdowns in states across the country were in the restaurant industry. The president, having spent a lot of time in the hotel industry and resorts, really believes that one of the ways we could encourage people to go back—encourage working people to go back into restaurants and getting people to take advantage of entertainment options—is restoring the deductions.”
McConnell, the Senate leader, has made clear that any future package must have liability protection for businesses as they reopen to prevent frivolous lawsuits from trial lawyers trying to make a buck off the pandemic. As Breitbart News reported this week, trial lawyers are chomping at the bit to unleash a wave of lawsuits on the country—and Pence told Breitbart News that such “liability protection” from those trial lawyers is also important for the reopening of the country. Pence said the government will aim to provide a “legal shield” to prevent frivolous lawsuits that could stall reopening measures. “So we’re looking at all those things—and liability protection. What we want to do is make it possible if businesses or professional sports reopen and begin to operate consistent with CDC guidelines that they can do that with confidence and that they will have liability protection,” Pence said. “What we don’t want, in the midst of a recovering economy, we don’t want it to be saddled down with thousands of frivolous lawsuits filed all over the country. We want to give people a safe harbor where they do like businesses here in Georgia are doing and that is implement the CDC guidance for safe and healthy practices in operating their restaurants or operating their sporting events, that they can do so with confidence, and they can have that legal shield and umbrella while we bring this country all the way back.” LISTEN TO VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE ON BREITBART NEWS SATURDAY: 

Brazil’s federal government tried to alter the label on chloroquine packaging to include a recommendation for its use to treat the Wuhan coronavirus, the country’s former health minister said in an interview with Brazil’s Globo news network, published on Thursday. The revelation comes as Brazil’s Health Ministry approved new guidelines on Wednesday recommending the widespread use of the anti-malarial drug chloroquine and a less toxic derivative, hydroxychloroquine, to treat coronavirus cases. In a May 20 interview, Brazil’s former health minister, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, said: The president advised himself by or surrounded himself with other medical professionals. I remember when, at the end of a day of ministerial council meetings, I was asked to enter a room and there was an anesthesiologist and an immunologist, who were [in possession of] a draft of a probable or future, or something like that, a presidential decree … And the idea they had was to change the package insert for ANVISA, putting the indication for Covid-19  [Wuhan coronavirus] in the package insert. Mandetta said members of Brazil’s Attorney General’s Office (AGU), the president of Brazil’s Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA), and other government ministers were present at the meeting in which President Jair Bolsonaro proposed altering the label on chloroquine packaging for use as a coronavirus treatment, according to the report. Bolsonaro has been a proponent of the anti-malarial drug to treat coronavirus, although some health authorities say its use may cause dangerous side effects and refrain from recommending its use in coronavirus treatment. In April, Mandetta was fired from his post after clashing with the president over the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat cases of coronavirus. He was replaced by Nelson Teich, who reportedly resigned last week, also over disagreements with the president about expanding the use of chloroquine to treat coronavirus, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported. On Wednesday, Teich’s replacement, Interim Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello, signed new hydroxychloroquine guidelines recommending chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat the coronavirus, including mild cases. According to AFP, after Pazuello approved the new treatment guidelines, Bolsonaro said he planned to keep him in the health minister post for “a very long time.” On Tuesday, Bolsonaro said he keeps an emergency stash of hydroxychloroquine at home for his 93-year-old mother in case she contracts the coronavirus.

President Donald Trump went golfing on Saturday, the first time he has hit the links since the height of the coronavirus outbreak. Trump has spent the past weeks urging the country to reopen and return to normal despite fears of the virus. On Sunday, Trump called in to the NBC Sports broadcast of a golf tournament for coronavirus relief efforts and discussed the importance of sports. “We want to get sports back. We miss sports,” Trump said. “We need sports in terms of the psyche, the psyche of our country.” Trump also spoke Sunday about missing the game, as the last time he golfed was on March 8 at his course in West Palm Beach, Florida. “I do miss it. I haven’t played, really, since this problem that we have started. I haven’t been able to play golf for a while. I’ve been very busy,” Trump said. The president traveled via motorcade to the Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia, on Saturday morning. Golf courses in the Washington, DC, metro area have largely been reopened. Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House Coronavirus Task Force coordinator, said Friday that it is fine for Americans to be outdoors for the Memorial Day weekend, citing golf, tennis, and visits to the beach among approved activities.

In an act of what he calls “economic disobedience,” Erik Kiilunen is posting “All Business is Essential” billboards around Michigan to protest Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s shutdown orders. Billboards will be appearing in Grand Rapids, Detroit, and Howell, and Kiilunen said it’s only the beginning. “All business is essential, and the government, and state governors, do not have the legal authority to pick and choose who has the right to work and feed their families, and who doesn’t,” he said. Kiilunen appeared on The Kyle Olson Show and said, “What I want to do with this campaign is 1. Eliminate fear, 2. Educate the public, and 3. Restart the economy.”  He said he doesn’t fear contracting the coronavirus after looking at the data, but something he does fear is “doing this another 2-3 months, taking $5-6 billion out of the state’s economy and saying, ‘okay, now what do we do with 3-4 million unemployed people?'” Kiilunen said when the state shutdown, his manufacturing business “lost $600,000 overnight. I had a 10-man contracting company, I laid everybody off. There was just nothing to do.” He said as the lockdown dragged on, “You cannot just stop and start a business. It just doesn’t work that way.” So he decided to launch the effort posting billboards around the state with the “All Business is Essential” message. “When your government’s busy throwing rocks at each other and doing nothing productive for the country, it’s up to us to stand up and straighten it out,” he said. “Michigan’s on life support and if we don’t fix it now, we’re going to have a problem of colossal proportions coming down the pike,” he told The Kyle Olson Show. Kiilunen started a GoFundMe to help finance his efforts and has raised over $31,000 so far. “If we all just get up and go to work, there’s nothing they can do to us,” he said.

AAA Mid-Atlantic is not issuing a Memorial Day travel forecast for the first time in two decades but speculated on its website that due to the coronavirus this year’s holiday weekend could mark a record low number of Americans traveling. This comes after last year’s record-high number of more than one million Americans taking a trip on the three-day weekend. AAA Mid-Atlantic posted an article about the contrast of pre- and post-coronavirus travel plans: This Memorial Day, Americans may harken back to the “See the USA in a Chevrolet” halcyon “road trip” days of yore. For those who opt to venture out on a one-day road trip over the upcoming holiday weekend, they will experience the cheapest holiday gas prices around Memorial Day in two decades. Although “traveling in the age of COVID-19 can be tricky,” yet with gas prices this low, some Washingtonians may set out on shorter jaunts by car to vistas along the rolling northern Virginia countryside or the Shenandoah Valley, or to Civil War sites in Maryland, or to the peaks of West Virginia, or to a wide array of other venues. Locally, Washington D.C., remains under a stay at home order until Monday, June 8. In Maryland, Prince George’s County will remain under a stay at home order through June 1 and Montgomery County is under a stay at home order without a current end date. Several Northern Virginia counties also remain under a stay at home order until May 28. “Gas prices around Memorial Day have not been this cheap in nearly 20 years. However, as the country continues to practice social distancing, this year’s unofficial kick-off to summer is not going to drive the typical millions of Americans to travel,” John B. Townsend II, manager of public and government affairs for AAA Mid-Atlantic, said. “Despite inexpensive gas prices, AAA anticipates this year’s holiday will likely set a record low for travel volume.” The average price for gas nationally is $1.89, with the cheapest in the region at $1.70 in Virginia. CURRENT AND PAST GAS PRICE AVERAGES Regular Unleaded Gasoline (*indicates record high) Courtesy of AAA Mid-Atlantic The report noted that Memorial Day 2009 (toward the end of the Great Recession) currently holds the record for the lowest travel volume at nearly 31 million travelers.

The NBA is in talks with The Walt Disney Company on a single-site scenario for a resumption of play in Central Florida in late July, the clearest sign yet that the league believes the season can continue amid the coronavirus pandemic. The National Basketball Players Association is also part of the talks with Disney. Games would be held at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex, a massive campus on the Disney property near Orlando. NBA spokesman Mike Bass said the conversations were still “exploratory,” and that the site would be used not only for games but for practices and housing as well. “Our priority continues to be the health and safety of all involved, and we are working with public health experts and government officials on a comprehensive set of guidelines to ensure that appropriate medical protocols and protections are in place,” Bass said. The ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex is a 255-acre campus with multiple arenas that could host games simultaneously and has been home to, among other things, the Jr. NBA World Championship in recent years. ESPN is primarily owned by Disney, one of the NBA’s broadcast partners. Space won’t be an issue, even if Major League Soccer — which is also in talks to resume its season at Disney — is there at the same time as the NBA. The entire Disney complex is roughly 40 square miles, with nearly 24,000 hotel rooms owned or operated by Disney within the campus. The NBA suspended its season March 11, becoming the first of the U.S. major pro leagues to do so after it became known that All-Star center Rudy Gobert of the Utah Jazz tested positive for COVID-19. The list of NBA players who were known to test positive eventually grew to 10 — not all were identified — and Commissioner Adam Silver said last month that the actual total was even higher. But the league has been working on countless return-to-play scenarios for several weeks, all with the caveat that testing would be an integral part of any resumption of the season. Teams have been allowed to welcome players back to their training facilities for voluntary sessions since May 8, and more than half of the league’s franchises have taken advantage of that opportunity. The next steps would likely include a loosening of the restrictions for those voluntary workouts — no more than four players are currently allowed inside any facility at a time — and then a plan for when training camps could open. If the league plans to resume play in late July, then camps conceivably could open around the start of that month.

Several Swedish medical experts have slammed the government’s response to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, stating that the death toll is “catastrophically high” as a report reveals herd immunity is likely not on the horizon. The six academics, including Uppsala University Professor of Infectious Diseases Björn Olsen and Professor Emeritus of Clinical Virology at the Karolinska Institutet Anders Vahlne, compared Sweden to several other countries and noted that nearly all others had successfully decreased infections. “Other countries with high death rates are starting to get a curve that slopes downhill. This is as a result of the strict anti-infection measures implemented in almost all countries,” the experts said in an opinion article published in Aftonbladet on Thursday. They went on to add that while Sweden has a stable position in terms of deaths and new cases, the overall trend is bad compared to other countries which have reduced cases and deaths. “But that does not reflect that our situation from a global perspective must be considered disastrous. If the Public Health Authority does not address this fact, it is high time that the decision-makers in our country, government, and parliament do so,” they said. Results of the Swedish National Health Authority’s tests for coronavirus antibodies was also announced on Wednesday and showed that in Stockholm, the city hardest hit by the outbreak, just 7.3 per cent of candidates tested positive for antibodies with other areas of Sweden testing as low as 3.7 per cent. Danes Want to Re-open Land Borders to Everyone Except No-Lockdown Sweden https://t.co/A2nX8Gi4Xo — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 17, 2020  Anders Tegnell, Swedish state epidemiologist and head of the government’s coronavirus response, claimed the numbers were not accurate and Stockholm was probably at 20 per cent, not seven. But the numbers mean that so-called “herd immunity” will not be achieved in Sweden this month, as previously predicted by mathematics professor Tom Britton. The consequences of Sweden’s coronavirus policy is also set to impact the Swedish tourism sector and Swedish holidaymakers, as many countries around Sweden are opening their borders to each other — but not to Sweden. Mika Salminen, health safety manager at Finland’s Institute for Health and Welfare, said it was much riskier for Finland to allow Swedish tourists in as opposed to tourists from other countries that enacted lockdown measures, like Norway or Denmark. “It is a political decision, but the actual difference in the spread of infection is a fact, and I suppose the government, of course, takes that into account,” he said on Wednesday.

A physician in Sacramento, California, said this week the cancellation of regular medical care during the coronavirus pandemic could yield a “massive wave” of cancer patients in the future. In an interview with California Public Radio (CapRadio) Tuesday, Dignity Health thoracic surgeon Dr. Costanzo DiPerna said even though Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) announced in late April that hospitals and healthcare providers could resume some nonemergency medical care, many patients are still not scheduling appointments. “Many patients are concerned about coming to visit us, to be screened for cancer, to be surveilled for their previous cancers we’ve taken out,” DiPerna explained. From CapRadio: What I’m concerned about right now, not just for lung cancer but for all cancers, is are there patients out there that don’t want to come in because they’re afraid of getting COVID-19? And, so, they avoid mammograms, they avoid cat scans, they avoid colonoscopies … Then in two years we’re hit with this massive wave of patients that are all at a later stage of essentially incurable cancers. In California and many other states, medical visits governors decided are of a “nonemergency” variety have included routine mammograms, breast ultrasounds, and colonoscopies – which often detect cancers at their earliest stages, when they are most treatable. Similarly, heart valve replacements, angioplasty, and tumor removals have all been delayed because of the orders of many governors as they focused solely on the infections caused by the Chinese coronavirus and associated massive testing and contact tracing expansions. Hundreds of physicians, led by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS), signed a letter to Vice President Mike Pence and the White House Coronavirus Task Force Friday urging the reopening of the nation’s business and schools and warning that delay will show a negative impact on the health of millions of Americans. The physicians observed: Our patients have suffered needlessly in pain and physical decline with disease progression because of short-sighted government edicts to stop all non-emergency care that is unrelated to COVID19. Some patients now face inevitable death because the diagnosis and treatments were delayed too long. Too many of our patients have suffered far more from the psychological, physical, and economic effects of the shutdown of communities and businesses than the direct impact of COVID 19 itself. Hospitals and doctors’ offices are allowed to reopen for regular business after weeks of telling patients to stay home due to COVID-19.  But some doctors say people are not coming in. The potential long-term consequences of this trend.Read More ⤵️https://t.co/g8JCND7Ggy — CapRadio News (@CapRadioNews) May 20, 2020  Additional data published Friday by global public health experts warned millions of children under a year old could be at risk for diseases such as diphtheria and polio due to the delay of their routine immunization visits to pediatricians and family practice physicians during the pandemic. Delays in immunization efforts begun in the 1970s could have far-reaching effects. “The countries reported at least moderate interruptions to the programs, with some countries suspending their programs completely,” STAT News reported, adding that “27 countries have postponed campaigns of vaccinations that protect against measles, while more than a dozen have paused some polio vaccination programs.” DiPerna told CapRadio many patients are gripped by fear that they will be exposed to the coronavirus if they go into doctors’ offices for their regular medical care. He said he has a “frank discussion” with his cancer patients whose medical care has been disrupted due to executive orders for emergency care only. These patients, he said, “need to be screened,” “evaluated,” and “need to be having surgery for cure.” DiPerna added he is trying to reassure his patients “that the experience of seeing us, of going to the hospital, of having surgery … that experience really should not expose them, and most likely will not expose them, to COVID virus.”

Actress Mia Farrow took her hostility toward President Trump and his MAGA base up a notch on Friday, saying his is “gonna kill off” his supporters by urging governors to reopen places of worship across America. “Youre gonna kill off all your supporters,” the Great Gatsby actress said in response to President Trump announcing CDC guidelines to allow places of worship — including churches, synagogues, and mosques — to reopen during the coronavirus pandemic. Youre gonna kill off all your supporters — Mia Farrow (@MiaFarrow) May 23, 2020  “Today, I am identifying houses of worship, churches, synagogues, and mosques as essential places that provide essential services,” Trump said at Friday’s surprise briefing. “Some governors have deemed liquor stores and abortion clinics as essential but have left out churches and other houses of worship. That’s not right,” the president continued, adding that blue state governors, some of whom have tried to crack down on religious gatherings, can call him with questions. “If there’s any questions, they’re going to have to call me, but they will not be successful in that call,” Trump said. “Governors need to do the right thing and allow these very important essential places of faith to open right now — for this weekend,” he added. Farrow has taken aim at the president in recent weeks, experiencing a full blown meltdown before her 403k Twitter followers following Trump’s decision to halt funding to the World Health Organization (W.H.O.), which is suspected of playing a role in China’s efforts to keep the severity of the coronavirus outbreak under wraps. “This is deplorable and an OUTRAGE. We should give more to the WHO. My God. This vindictive little man knows how to deflect from his own failures,” she said in a now-deleted tweet. “I want a real president,” Mia Farrow added in another tweet, along with “I need a Xanax.” I want a real president — Mia Farrow (@MiaFarrow) April 14, 2020  I think i need a Xanax — Mia Farrow (@MiaFarrow) April 14, 2020 

An agri-business advertising for jobs under the government’s ‘Pick For Britain’ farm job scheme for furloughed workers required applicants to speak a foreign language to pick vegetables and fruit. A job opening for an Irrigation Assistant, advertised on the government’s website by the Kent-based food producer S&A, said that some applicants will need to speak Romanian and or Bulgarian to be hired, despite the fact that the job scheme is supposedly geared towards out of work Britons. “To apply for a skilled position, you will need to speak Romanian and/or Bulgarian fluently. English language is essential for some positions,” the advert said, according to a report in The Sun. Bosses keen on foreign labour and mass migration advocates in the political and media class have often claimed that Britons are “too lazy” to do farm work, and justified flying in migrant workers from overseas on crowded planes despite the coronavirus pandemic and mass lay-offs at home because locals will not take the jobs. However, the fact that British workers are not even being considered for at least some farm roles unless they speak obscure foreign languages would seem to lend credence to the claims of commentators such as Gawain Towler, a long-time colleague of Nigel Farage, that domestic recruitment schemes like ‘Pick for Britain’ have been “designed to fail”. Has Pick for Britain been deliberately designed to fail? Worth a read. By @GawainTowler https://t.co/E0VjvQ3YSw — James Crisp (@JamesCrisp6) May 21, 2020  On Tuesday, the Prince of Wales urged students and furloughed workers to apply for seasonal farm work, which would allow them to fill farm vacancies while continuing to receive 80 per cent of their paycheck from the government. It is estimated that some 7.5 million people are having their pay subsidised by the government during the national lockdown and, in April, it was revealed that of the 50,000 Britons that applied to pick fruit and vegetables. Just 112 were given positions. UK Economy Falls At Fastest Rate Since 2008 Crash, Massive Tax Rises Loom https://t.co/0jqGWrsz9O — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 13, 2020  The job openings, it seems, very often came with onerous requirements attached to them, seriously disadvantaging the typical Briton in the hiring process. For example, the Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) has listed requirements that workers must live on-site, whether or not they live nearby the farm — even though it was perfectly normal for British farmworkers to be picked up on minibuses or the like near their homes and returned at the end of their shift in the decades before they were displaced by EU migrant workers from poor countries. Workers that are hired by the farming firm Concordia, meanwhile, are required to spend two weeks in self-isolation, followed by another two weeks of training before being able to start work — requirements which seem almost deliberately designed to favour the lone, temporary migrant worker over the Briton with local connections and familial obligations. “Anyone who can’t work as part of a small team, or for the full length of the placement, increases the risk of infection to all those on the farm,” the company claimed. Agri-businesses are alleged by some to prefer hiring foreign workers required to live on-site in temporary accommodation in part because they can be made to pay rent for that accommodation, substantially reducing bosses’ effect wage costs.

The study’s researchers say this suggests that the rest of the world was slow to start research on the virus and that the “Chinese knew something that the rest of the world didn’t,” the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported on Friday. For the University of Oxford study – posted on Tuesday on Cornell University’s preprint website, “arXiv.org” – the researchers analyzed more than 3,000 peer-reviewed papers from a database called the Web of Science Core Collection, which contains research exclusively from leading scientific journals. The study found that seven of the ten most prolific institutes that also owned Wuhan coronavirus research in the database were from China. Further analysis led the researchers to conclude that a Chinese government agency is the single-largest funder of Wuhan coronavirus research in the world. According to Oxford’s non-peer reviewed paper, as of May 16, the National Natural Science Foundation of China – affiliated with China’s chief administrative authority, its State Council – had provided financial support to 124 studies on the Wuhan coronavirus published in top science journals. University of Oxford scientist Petar Radanliev, the paper’s lead researcher, said the number of studies was greater than the combined number of similar studies on the Wuhan coronavirus funded by the U.S. Department of Health and National Institutes of Health (NIH). According to the paper’s authors, this was unprecedented, as Chinese researches have not been at the forefront of this particular field of research on virology and epidemiology. The scientists said that since 1900, research on viruses and related diseases has been dominated by Western institutes such as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Oxford University, Harvard University, and Johns Hopkins University. This could suggest that “the world was slow in responding with scientific research on Covid-19 [coronavirus],” the Oxford scientists said. The researchers found that China, by comparison, was the “fastest” to act in studying the novel coronavirus, beginning its research as early as December 2019. The scientists cited thousands of research papers posted online since the first coronavirus cases were reported in Wuhan last December. In the paper, the authors question why the world’s leading research institutions were seemingly delayed in beginning their study of the virus: This triggers many questions on have the leading organisations on pandemic and epidemic management reacted at the appropriate speed? If so, why are they behind in the production of scientific journal? Has there been a gap in communications and data sharing? Leaving these organizations oblivious to what was happening? According to the SCMP, the scientists said the study’s surprising results elicited questions such as if the “Chinese knew something that the rest of the world didn’t,” adding that this was speculation. China has been accused of purposefully holding back information about its initial coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan late last year, hiding the extent and severity of the epidemic for at least several weeks before notifying global health authorities that a novel coronavirus had emerged in the country.

The NHL Players’ Association’s executive committee authorized moving forward in talks with the league on returning to play from the coronavirus suspension, approving 24 teams making the playoffs with other aspects still to be negotiated. The NHLPA did not provide a breakdown of the vote of its 31 player representatives in making the announcement Friday night, a day after the proposal was presented to the union’s executive board. In giving the format the green light, the NHLPA stressed several details still need to be negotiated before games can begin. The proposal will now go to the NHL board of governors, which is expected to approve the plan in the next few days. Once approved, the proposal effectively ends the season of the league’s bottom seven teams. Under the plan proposed by the NHL/NHLPA Return To Play committee, the top four teams in each conference would play each other in a mini-tournament for seeding while the remaining 16 teams face off in a best-of-five series play-in round to set the final 16 to compete for the Stanley Cup. Though the approval is considered significant, the task of establishing a path to getting players back on the ice remains challenging. The next step would have the Return To Play committee sort out a host of other issues, ranging from health and safety protocols to determining where games will be played, with the league preparing to group teams in a select number of hub cities. Las Vegas has become the city most mentioned as a potential site, particularly because of its large concentration of hotels that could house numerous teams. Other cities mentioned include Columbus, Ohio; Nashville, Tennessee; Raleigh, North Carolina; St. Paul, Minnesota; and Edmonton, Alberta. Numerous other questions remain unanswered, including when players can return to their respective teams and what non-playoff teams will be allowed to do during what could potentially become a 10-month break between games.
NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly said the league has a plan in place, but stopped short of providing details by saying it would be premature to do so at this time. “All good questions and all questions with answers. But not in a position to answer any of them at this point in time,” Daly wrote in an email. “If and when we are in a position to make an announcement, we will try to make sure they are answered in that context.” At the very least, the league has the framework of a plan on which to build off for the first time since the regular season was placed on pause on March 12. Games would likely be played without fans present. It’s unclear how the league will address players’ concerns over spending potentially lengthy stretches of time in self-isolation away from their families. Both sides agree there is no ideal plan, while acknowledging the limitations they face because of the uncertainty created by the pandemic. The NHL’s regular season was paused on March 12, with 189 games remaining and its 31 teams having played an uneven number of games. “Obviously, it’s not ideal, but I think in a time like this, how can anything be super traditional?” Toronto Maple Leafs defenseman Tyson Barrie said this week. “I think we all have to adapt and be willing to adapt and kind of realize that it’s not going to be this perfect, classic NHL playoffs. I think for the situation we’re in, for a year, I think that’s fine.” Under the proposed 24-team format, Montreal would be the final team to qualify in the East based on a slim points-percentage margin. With 71 points in 71 games (.500), the Canadiens edge out Buffalo, which had 68 points in 69 games (.493) and would extend the league’s longest active playoff drought to a ninth consecutive season. The difference in the West is much larger, with Chicago (.514) beating out Anaheim (.472). All three California teams would miss the playoffs for the first time since 1995-96. A person with what would be one of the seven non-playoff teams told The AP the performance staff is already preparing workout programs for players during what will be a long layoff. “Overall, I think players will be fine during the summer months,” the person said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the return to play format has not been approved. “Finding creative ways to keep them motivated in the fall will be the challenge.” The NHL is open to having the playoffs extend into September and pushing the start of the 2020-21 season as late as January — or when fans can begin attending games in some capacity. Whatever it takes, Winnipeg Jets forward Patrik Laine said Friday. “I just want to play, and I can do whatever format they decide,” Laine said. “It’s just still hockey, but I don’t mind the format. It’s not an issue for me.” Carolina Hurricanes player representative Jordan Martinook said finishing the season and awarding the Stanley Cup would be a considerable feat. “In a year of such negativity and uncertainty, for you to have that kind of celebration, I feel like it would be a big positive for you, your family, your team, your city,” Martinook said.

A majority of swing voters indicated that they will base their vote in November on the issues rather than “how they feel about President Trump,” a KFF Health Tracking Poll released on Friday showed. The survey, taken May 13 – 18, 2020, among 1,189 U.S. adults, asked respondents to indicate how they plan to base their vote in November’s presidential election. “Thinking ahead to November, do you think your vote for president will mostly be based on the candidates’ positions on the issues, or mostly be based on how you feel about President Trump?” it asked. Overall, a majority of voters, 57 percent, said they will base their vote on the issues, compared to the 39 percent who said President Trump. However, the percentage indicating that they will base their vote on issues rather than personal feelings regarding the president grew even higher among independents and swing voters, with 65 percent and 75 percent, respectively. Fifty-seven percent of Republicans indicated that will base their vote on issues rather than feelings toward the president, and Democrats remain split, with 48 percent choosing each option. The news comes as the establishment media and Biden allies continue in their efforts to demonize the president — from the Muller “witch hunt” to their failed impeachment attempt — and politicize the coronavirus pandemic. Thirty-percent of swing voters consider health care the “most important” issue when choosing a candidate, and 25 percent chose the economy. Climate change, one of the progressive left’s most prominent issues, remains a low-tier priority, with just five percent categorizing it as an “important” issue and central factor to casting their vote. According to the survey, the economy remains the “most important” issue among registered voters. President Trump is performing strongest in this area, with 57 percent approving of the way he is handling the economy, even amid the negative effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Fifty-nine percent of independents, specifically, indicated that they approve of the way the president is handling the economy as well. “Even among the largest job loss in recent history and economists’ warning about long-term unemployment, President Trump continues to receive positive ratings in his handling of the economy (+17 percentage points net approval),” the Kaiser Family Foundation noted. The margin of error for the survey’s full sample is +/- 3 percent. The tracking poll follows a Restoration PAC poll released Thursday, showing Trump trouncing Biden in the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania, 50.2 percent to 45.5 percent.

NORCROSS, Georgia — Vice President Mike Pence told Breitbart News that he and President Donald Trump are excited to get the United States reopened and moving again as the coronavirus pandemic recedes nationwide. Backstage after a roundtable with local business leaders here at Waffle House corporate headquarters, where Pence and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp appeared to encourage the continued reopening of the country, Pence told Breitbart News that Georgia’s efforts led by Kemp to reopen aggressively have been successful and are a model for the nation. All 50 states have begun reopening in one way or another, Pence noted in the interview that aired on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel, citing Georgia and Florida—where Pence visited earlier in the week with Gov. Ron DeSantis—as examples for the country. “It would be on April 15, 30 days into the mitigation efforts that we presented to the country—that the president directed the White House Coronavirus Task Force to publish guidelines for opening up America,” Pence said. “We believed because of what the American people were doing and continued to do over that 45 days that we would be in a position for some states and some counties around the country to begin to reopen and put America back to work. Nobody wants to reopen this country more than President Donald Trump. So we equipped governors around the country to be ready for when the 45 Days to Slow the Spread came to an end. Georgia and Florida and other states around the country evaluated the cases in their state, evaluated the data, and have been and have taken steps that are now demonstrating that we can safely and responsibly reopen our economy without putting the people of this country’s health and wellbeing at risk. I think Gov. Kemp also and Gov. DeSantis also recognize that this isn’t a choice between health and a growing economy. It really is a choice between health and health. There are serious health consequences if we were to continue indefinitely the lockdowns that we asked the American people to embrace for 45 days. I must tell you, I know the president is as grateful as I am that as we sit here today, 50 states—all 50 states—have begun the process of reopening their economies. But Georgia is leading the way and demonstrating that you can safely and responsibly reopen your businesses, reopen your restaurants, and put the people of your state back to work, and still, hospitalizations are declining, cases are declining, and, most importantly, fatalities are declining. The people of Georgia are doing it, and I couldn’t be more proud to be here.” Asked if some Democrat governors, such as Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer and Pennsylvania’s Tom Wolf, are moving fast enough, Pence cited his close relationship with governors and noted that every state is ready to reopen. He also praised the protesters nationwide pushing for a faster reopening of their states. “When the president tapped me to lead the White House Coronavirus Task Force, he directed me to forge a seamless partnership with governors around the country of both political parties. We’ve done that,” Pence said. “We continue to believe, whether it be on a statewide basis or a regional or county basis, that every state in America is in a position to begin the process of reopening. Fortunately, as of this week, all 50 states have begun that process. What we’re committed to doing, whether it be providing supplies for testing, whether it be providing personal protective equipment not just for healthcare workers, but for businesses that are beginning the process of reopening, we’re absolutely committed to being a full partner with states. But the president and I truly believe we [have] got to get this country open again. There are profound costs that go well beyond the economy to a prolonged shutdown. I’ve always believed this was a freedom-loving country. I’m very heartened to see people across the country letting their voice be heard, letting governors in every state know they want their freedom back. What Georgia is demonstrating is people are prepared to continue practicing the hygiene and social distancing necessary to protect their families and their neighbors and members of their community. We’ll continue to urge every state to look at the president’s guidelines to open up America again and look for ways, whether it be a portion of a state or the entire state, to get the economy moving again.” Pence, whom Trump appointed to lead the White House Coronavirus Task Force nearly three months ago, told Breitbart News that the country has learned a lot about the coronavirus since the beginning of this whole process as well. “It’s been a learning process every day,” Pence said. “We knew early on that the coronavirus was several times more contagious than the common flu. But there’s been hopeful developments as well. We’ve seen that because of what the American people have done and the sacrifices they’ve made that, despite the fact we’re dramatically increasing testing, cases are still going down. Positivity rates are declining. Today, more than 40 states are finding that less than ten percent of the people who are tested test positive for the coronavirus—and 22 states, less than five percent of those tested are testing positive. So we’ve learned a great deal about the impact of social distancing.” Pence also pointed to a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) scientific study that demonstrates the half-life of the virus drops off significantly with ultraviolet light, higher heat, and humidity. Such “summer conditions,” which are now here in most of the country, he said, will hopefully stop the spread of the virus even more. “We also, the Department of Homeland Security, did a study we published a month ago that found that ultraviolet light—sunlight—and humidity, summer conditions, actually have a profound impact on reducing what’s called the half life of the virus and reducing its potential threat,” Pence said. “But, finally, I think what we’ve also learned is that this is primarily conveyed through respiratory habits. It’s the reason social distancing and hygiene continue to be important. The CDC issued guidance reiterating the threat of transmission on hard surfaces is significantly less than conveyed through respiration. So we’re understanding a great deal more about it, but I can tell you what I think we’ve learned the most is the American people will rise to any challenge when called upon to do so—when families that have put loved ones, especially the elderly’s health first, they make great sacrifices — businesses large and small. We heard today from some small businesses before they learned there was going to be any federal assistance went out and a business owner borrowed against his home so he could keep people on the payroll. I’m very proud of the CARES Act and I’m very proud through Paycheck Protection that we found a way to keep people on the payroll of businesses that were shuttered through the 45 Days to Slow the Spread and through the course of this pandemic, but businesses responded with great charity and great generosity, and I think we’ve learned a lot about the virus, but I think we’ve reaffirmed everything we always knew about the goodness and common sense of the American people.” LISTEN TO VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE ON BREITBART NEWS SATURDAY: 

A greater share of registered voters trust President Trump over Joe Biden (D) when it comes to the country’s economic recovery following the coronavirus pandemic, a Morning Consult survey released this week revealed. When it comes to the nation’s economy — which suffered tremendously at the hands of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, seeing jobless claims topping 38.6 million over the last nine weeks — a greater share of registered voters trust Trump to handle the economic recovery moving forward. Forty-three percent of the 1,994 registered voters surveyed May 15-18, 2020, indicated that they trust Trump to oversee the economic recovery following the pandemic, compared to 40 percent who chose Biden, giving the president an advantage outside of the survey’s +/- 2 percent margin of error. Similarly, 44 percent trust Trump on the economy in a general sense, compared to 41 percent for Biden. Forty-four percent of registered voters also trust the president on the issue of jobs — a four percent advantage over Biden. While the survey showed the Democrat Party’s presumptive nominee leading on health care, uniting the country, leading during a crisis, and containing the spread of the coronavirus, several polls have shown voters listing the economy and jobs as top issues as they head to the polls in November, signaling an advantage for President Trump. “However, if the virus appears relatively under control by the fall and voters are more focused on rebuilding the economy, those conditions could be more favorable for Trump,” Morning Consult said of the results.

The number of suicides documented by a hospital in Northern California during the ongoing lockdown has exceeded the number of Chinese coronavirus deaths, doctors in the city of Walnut Creek revealed this week as they called for an end to the region’s lockdown order. In an interview with the Los Angeles-based ABC7 news outlet aired on Thursday, doctors from the John Muir Medical Center in Walnut Creek stressed that there had been an unprecedented rise in suicides, noting that there have been more attempts over the last month than in most full years. “We’ve never seen numbers like this, in such a short period of time,” Dr. Mike DeBoisblanc, the head of trauma at the Walnut Creek hospital, told the local ABC outlet. “I mean, we’ve seen a year’s worth of suicide attempts in the last four weeks.” “What I have seen recently, I have never seen before,” Kacey Hansen, a trauma nurse at the medical center for over three decades, added. “I have never seen so much intentional injury.” “Social isolation has a price and I know why we’ve done it,” she also said. “It just has a bigger price tag than I thought.” Hansen reportedly noted that the Walnut Creek hospital is unable to save as many patients as usual due to a near single-minded focus on coronavirus. Other doctors, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director Francis Collins, have acknowledged that there is a clear and present danger that lockdown measures may fuel mental health issues like suicide. Lockdowns have “not been necessary to save lives but instead inflicted devastating harm on tens of millions of people,” hundreds of doctors wrote in a letter to the White House. Contra Costa County’s Walnut Creek is in the eastern region of the San Francisco Bay area. Dr. DeBoisblanc and Tom Tamura, the executive director of the Contra Costa County Crisis Center, noted that most of the suicides involve young adults who are “worried about the stress that isolation and job loss can bring as this quarantine continues.” In a statement to ABC7 responding to the trauma team’s concerns about the rise in suicides amid the lockdowns, the county’s crisis center proclaimed: We strongly encourage everyone in distress to seek help from mental health professionals and local resources such as 211 (the Crisis Center). We understand that this is a very difficult time for many people, and it can feel very isolating to practice social distancing. We want to stress that the shelter-in-place order is saving lives at the same time. Noting that the region’s shutdown order is having a devastating impact on mental health, Dr. DeBoisblanc declared: Personally, I think it’s time. I think, originally, this [shelter-in-place order] was put in place to flatten the curve and to make sure hospitals have the resources to take care of COVID patients.We have the current resources to do that and our other community health is suffering. Nevertheless, the John Muir Medical Center stressed that it is supportive of the shelter-in-place order in the Bay Area, saying in a statement to ABC7: We realize there are a number of opinions on this topic, including within our medical staff, and John Muir Health encourages our physicians and staff to participate constructively in these discussions. We all share a concern for the health of our community, whether that is COVID-19, mental health, intentional violence, or other issues. The shelter-in-place order in the region will expire by May 31. Every state in America has begun a phased reopening process as conditions across the country improve, particularly a drop in COVID-19 hospitalizations and new cases.

Suspected members of Nigeria’s Boko Haram terror group currently await a trial date while in military detention, but the start date has been delayed indefinitely due to the country’s inadequate criminal justice system, Africa’s Institute for Security Studies (ISS Africa) asserted in an article published on Thursday. For several months, Nigeria has expected to conduct the fourth phase of mass trials of suspected members of the Boko Haram terror group, but the government has taken no concrete action to start the process. In October 2019, Netsanet Belay, Amnesty International’s Advocacy and Research Director said: It appears that the government of Nigeria has dumped further ‘information’ on the Office of the Prosecutor [OTP] in an attempt to delay the inevitable investigation. There is mounting evidence that the government of Nigeria is willingly unable to bring perpetrators to justice and it is past time that the OTP proceeds with an investigation into crimes committed by both Boko Haram and the Nigerian military. The delay has gone on for far too long and the OTP needs to do what is right for victims of these horrific crimes who have been waiting for justice for more than a decade. The [International Criminal Court] ICC should proceed to open an investigation into atrocities committed in the North-East of Nigeria. For more than ten years, Boko Haram’s jihadist terrorist campaign across northeast Nigeria and neighboring regions has caused Nigeria massive destabilization. Starting with a major uprising in July 2009, Boko Haram began a campaign of violence in Nigeria that, despite periodic lulls, continues to this day. Recent reports indicate that the terror group has capitalized on lockdowns caused by the ongoing Wuhan coronavirus pandemic to stage a formidable resurgence in the country. Boko Haram often clashes with Nigerian state security forces, which has led to mass arrests and the detention of suspected members. These mass arrests “began in 2009 and reached a peak in 2013,” ISS Africa reports. Although Nigeria has previously conducted mass trials for terrorism offenses in 2017 and 2018, these trials “exposed significant problems with Nigeria’s criminal justice system,” according to the report. “Weak investigations, arbitrary arrests, unlawful detention, and the absence of legal aid and evidence marred the cases,” the report said. The three mass trials conducted in 2017 and 2018 were considered the first three phases of trials, with the fourth phase currently awaiting a start date. According to ISS Africa, for the fourth phase of trials to finally start and be conducted fairly, Nigeria’s criminal justice system must first undergo significant “legislative reform” to “address the challenges of investigating, prosecuting, and adjudicating terrorism offenses.”

A state health official in Mexico claims federal health officials are ignoring confirmed coronavirus cases that are asymptomatic and only counts cases where patients need medical attention. The claim is the latest accusation that Mexico’s government is hiding the true reach of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in that nation. The new case of alleged undercount took place this week in the coastal state of Yucatan where state officials carried out a series of aleatory tests at two open-air markets in the city of Merida. According to information released by the Yucatan Health Department, they carried out the tests on both customers and shopkeepers alike. The tests yielded 47 positive tests for COVID-19 leading authorities to close down the markets on a temporary basis. During a news conference, Yucatan’s Health Secretary Mauricio Sauri Vivas said that of the 47 cases, only the five symptomatic cases were loaded the national database under definitions ordered by Mexico’s federal health officials. According to El Diario de Yucatan, Sauri Vivas claimed that they were following the guidelines set forth by Mexico’s Health Secretariat that only account for the “confirmed cases that present symptoms”. The allegations of undercounting come just days after an NGO in Mexico revealed that health officials in Mexico City were only accounting for one-third of the deaths that listed coronavirus as a cause of death. In addition to several allegations of undercounting, Mexico’s Undersecretary of Health Hugo Lopez Gatell admitted that some of his figures do not include coronavirus cases from private hospitals and only include the cases from government hospitals. The discrepancies several states to release their own figures that include both categories of cases. To reopen the markets in Yucatan after the imposed quarantine, shopkeepers would need to implement a series of increased safety protocols. Government officials claimed that during the closing, they would provide a stipend to shopkeepers to help them get through the closing.

LONDON (AP) – British researchers testing an experimental vaccine against the new coronavirus are moving into advanced studies and aim to immunize more than 10,000 people to determine if the shot works. Friday’s announcement came as Chinese scientists who are developing a similar vaccine reported promising results from their own first-step testing, seeing hoped-for immune reactions and no serious side effects in 108 vaccinated people. Last month, Oxford University researchers began vaccinating more than 1,000 volunteers in a preliminary study designed to test the shot’s safety. Those results aren’t in yet but the Oxford team announced they’re expanding to 10,260 people across Britain, including older people and children. If all goes smoothly, “it’s possible as early as the autumn or toward the end of the year, you could have results that allowed use of the vaccine on a wider scale,” predicted Andrew Pollard, head of the Oxford Vaccine Group. But Pollard acknowledged there were still many challenges ahead, including how long it will take to prove the vaccine works — particularly since transmission has dropped significantly in Britain — and any potential manufacturing complications. The Oxford shot is one of about a dozen experimental Covid-19 vaccines in early stages of human testing or poised to start, mostly in China, the U.S. and Europe. Scientists have never created vaccines from scratch this fast and it’s far from clear that any will ultimately prove safe and effective. So today I became a Lab Rat Ǵ volunteer and had my #COVID vaccine trial injection as part of the @UniofOxford @ImperialMed study.  Don’t know if I’ve had the new vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or MenACWY Vaccine. pic.twitter.com/saoKMjy0P0 — Andy Wigmore (@andywigmore) May 12, 2020  Moving on to such a huge late-scale test doesn’t guarantee Oxford will reach the finish line, either. Pollard couldn’t provide any data from the first tests, but said an oversight board hasn’t seen any indications of worrisome side effects. A small study in monkeys offers a note of caution: Teams from Oxford and the U.S. National Institutes of Health found the vaccine protected against pneumonia but didn’t eliminate the coronavirus in the nose. Pollard said it was still an open question whether the shot could make a dent in how the disease spreads. Likewise, Friday’s report about a similar vaccine being developed by China’s CanSino Biologics couldn’t address how protective the shot might be. All 108 test participants were quarantined in a hotel for 14 days after vaccination, to ensure they weren’t exposed to the coronavirus during a study meant to track safety. Most volunteers reported at least one reaction typical for vaccines such as pain at the injection site, fever or fatigue. But there were no serious side effects, researchers reported in the journal Lancet. A month after vaccination, researchers spotted important immune responses including antibodies needed to block infection. But those responses were lower in the small number of volunteers ages 45 to 60, the oldest tested. “The ability to trigger these immune responses does not necessarily indicate that the vaccine will protect humans from Covid-19,” lead researcher Wei Chen from the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology said in a statement provided by Lancet. “This result shows a promising vision for the development of Covid-19 vaccines, but we are still a long way from this vaccine being available to all,” Chen said. Both the CanSino and Oxford vaccines are made in a similar way: They use a harmless virus to carry genes for the “spike” protein that coats the coronavirus into the body, priming the immune system to react if the real infection comes along. CanSino uses a weakened common cold virus called an adenovirus – and Friday’s study showed people whose bodies recognized that cold virus didn’t get as much of the presumed Covid-19 benefit. To avoid that problem, the Oxford vaccine uses an adenovirus that normally infects chimpanzees. CanSino is awaiting results from 500 volunteers injected in a next-step study. In Britain’s soon-to-begin larger tests, researchers will address how Oxford’s shot will affect older adults, who are at high risk from Covid-19. Pollard noted that people over 70 often don’t get as much protection from vaccines as younger people. Earlier this week, drugmaker AstraZeneca said it had secured its first agreements to produce 400 million doses of the Oxford-developed vaccine, bolstered by a $1 billion investment from a U.S. government agency. The AstraZeneca investment hopefully will make the vaccine available globally, including in developing countries, said Lawrence Young of the University of Warwick. But he cautioned the shot’s effectiveness still is unclear, citing the monkey research. “This raises serious questions about the ability of this vaccine to protect against infection in humans and to prevent virus transmission,” he said in a statement. “We need to be urgently exploring other vaccine candidates.” Often, possible vaccines that look promising early fail after testing expands to thousands of people – one reason the crowded field is important. Many of the candidates work in different ways, and are made with different technologies, increasing the odds that at least one approach might succeed. Other leading candidates – including one from the NIH and Moderna Inc., and another by Inovio Pharmaceuticals – simply inject a piece of the coronavirus genetic code that instructs the body itself to produce spike protein that primes the immune system. Meanwhile, companies and governments are beginning to scale up production now, aiming for hundreds of millions of doses of the candidates they think might win the vaccine race. It’s a huge gamble that could waste a lot of money if their choices fail and must be thrown away. But if they get lucky and a stockpiled vaccine pans out, it could help mass vaccinations start a few months faster.

On Friday’s broadcast of CNBC’s “Halftime Report,” White House Coronavirus Task Force member Dr. Anthony Fauci said “staying locked down for a prolonged period of time” is not the right approach, and “most of the country” is reopening “in a prudent way.” Fauci said, “I don’t want people to think that any of us feel that staying locked down for a prolonged period of time is the way to go.” He continued that while locking down at the beginning was needed, “now is the time, depending upon where you are and what your situation is — is to begin to seriously [look] at reopening the economy, reopening the country to try and get back to some degree of normal. I’m totally in favor of that, if done in the proper way, in the appropriate setting.” Fauci added that he is concerned if places are reopening while cases are increasing and they’re not following the recommended benchmarks. He further stated, “[I]n general, I think most of the country is doing it in a prudent way. There are obviously some situations where people might be jumping over that. I just say please proceed with caution if you’re going to do that.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

Many Republicans have criticized House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) for her so-called HEROES Act, which is the latest effort from congressional Democrats to respond to the coronavirus pandemic. That includes Rep. Scott DesJarlais (R-TN), who labeled it “blatant political scammery” during an interview with Huntsville, AL radio’s WVNN. The bill, seen by Republicans as a messaging bill for the 2020 general election, would have a profound impact on the economy if passed according to DesJarlais. DesJarlais told WVNN’s “The Jeff Poor Show” that while the bill has perks for young voters, it would also stall the economic recovery from the coronavirus downturn, which would be used against President Donald Trump in his reelection bid. “I think things are getting better,” he said. “You can see it in the new cases and death rates, the flattening of the curve, and so on and so forth. Most states are going to be reopened by the end of this month. And we’re doing so with caution. But I find it interesting, for example, in this last HEROES Act that Pelosi tried to push through — in my opinion, it was just blatant political scammery at its best where they have this wish list that has very little to do with coronavirus. And it’s almost like they’re hoping for a slow financial recovery. We happened to have a presidential election in November. The economy often drives elections. President Trump was presiding over one of the best economic times of our nation’s history. Then this virus hits.” “He acted quickly,” DesJarlais continued. “He was criticized for doing too much, too soon. And then, ‘Oh, in hindsight, he should have done more.’  Governors were slow to respond and shut down the states quickly. There’s a study out of Columbia … that says that if we had just shut down a week or two early, we could have saved 36,000 lives. It’s easy to speculate that it is the president’s fault, that it is the governors’ fault. But this huge spending package dealt with postal workers and getting $10,000 off of student loans, even though they’ve suspended student loan payments for six months, is obviously targeting young voters, trying to do things that will woo voters to the Democratic side, extending the $600-per-week unemployment through January 2021, where people are being paid more not to work than they were when working.” “To me, it just seems like a Democratic ploy to stall the economy and somehow blame Trump in the fall,” he added.

White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx on Friday urged Americans to keep social distancing during Memorial Day weekend, even as she encouraged celebrations and going outside. “It’s very important to maintain that six-feet distance and very important to have your mask with you in case that six-feet distance cannot be maintained,” Dr. Birx said. She said that it was fine for Americans to go outside and play golf, tennis, or go to the beach, provided that they take steps to stay six feet apart from others. “Remember that is your space and that is the space you need to protect to ensure you are social distancing for others,” she said. Birx noted that some people under the age of 30 could have the virus without symptoms and shed it unwittingly and infect other people. “There are a lot of healthy people that look healthy with COVID,” she said. Birx also suggested Americans should maintain proper hygiene and use disposable utensils at parties. “I know you can do this,” she said. “I know the American people can do this.”

A new Reuters/Ipsos poll suggests that more than one-third of America would be less likely to get any vaccine that President Donald Trump endorsed. According to Reuters, “most respondents in the survey of 4,428 U.S. adults taken between May 13 and May 19 said they would be heavily influenced by guidance from the Food and Drug Administration or results of large-scale scientific studies showing that the vaccine was safe.” But even with the FDA’s support, 36 percent of Americans polled said that President Donald Trump telling them the vaccine was safe would make them more skeptical about taking it. Further, less than two-thirds of the people questioned are interested in a vaccine at all. In fact, 40 percent of respondents believe the vaccine could end up being more dangerous than the novel coronavirus itself. “It’s a little lower than I thought it would be with all the attention to COVID-19,” said Vanderbilt University Medical Center infectious disease and vaccine expert Dr. William Schaffner,  “I would have expected somewhere around 75 percent.” It is a dismal number, especially when you consider that studies estimate at least 70 percent of citizens need to be on board before vaccination will provide the needed herd immunity. Trump has claimed that there will be a vaccine available in 2020. While vaccines typically take over a decade to safely develop, testing is already underway.

Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) announced on Friday that all restrictions on summer and youth camps in Floriday will be lifted, effective immediately. “Our kids have been out of organized activities for a couple months now,” DeSantis said on Friday in Jacksonville. “We need to have a pathway to get it back.”  The governor did say that the Florida Department of Health would likely post a list of best practices to its website and that local leadership will be allowed to make independent decisions. “We believe that this makes sense based on the data and observed experience. We are not going to be instituting a lot of rules, or really any rules,” DeSantis said. “At the end of the day, we trust parents to be able to make decisions in conjunction with physicians.” Broward and Miami-Dade officials remain cautious. Broward County Spokesperson Margaret Stapleton reiterated that the county is “not offering any youth sports or summer camps at this time,” but “Parks and Recreation staff is assessing how programming can resume, with adherence to the requirements for social distancing, facial covering and sanitation.” Miami-Dade had a similar response: “We do not have a timetable as yet for any openings,” said Miami-Dade spokesperson Myriam Marquez. State pediatric authorities are also in disagreement about reopening summer camps — famous for their crowded throngs of children and lack of showering — so soon. “We still don’t know enough about the disease,” said Dr. Bruce Peters, a professor at the Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Osteopathic Medicine at Nova Southeastern University. “We don’t even have a vaccine. It’s way too early.” But Dr. Bonnie White, a pediatrician who attended DeSantis’s announcement, asserted that it was more important for children to “be able to laugh with their friends,” and parents should simply practice due diligence, keeping their kids from the activities if they are sick. Camps across Florida are looking carefully at how to manage reopening activities for children amid the global pandemic. Many are cutting enrollment in half, restricting larger group activities, and removing field trips from the schedule. “We are still assessing the issue and have not made a final determination yet,” said Kevin Pickard, director of the City of Sunrise Leisure Services. “In addition to the risks associated with COVID-19, the lack of school sites is a major concern for us. We would have to substantially lower our registration numbers if the determination is made to continue on with a camp program,” he added. Many parents remain skeptical. “I will absolutely not send my child to a camp this year,” Mayte Arteta-Martinez of Hollywood told Fox. “I do not feel it is safe because children do not understand the concepts of social distance, nor do I believe camp counselors/teachers are willing to take the time to constantly be watching over them to keep these parameters.”

Former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick will be released from prison early, according to a state representative in contact with Fox News. “State representative Karen Whitsett says President Trump told her Thursday that Kwame Kilpatrick would be one of 3000 prisoners released because of #coronavirus,” Fox 2’s Charlie Langton tweeted Saturday afternoon. Kilpatrick was convicted in 2013, currently serving a 28-year sentence on 24 corruption charges. Prosecutors said Kilpatrick ran a “private profit machine” from his office, manipulating public funds and contracting to enrich himself, his family, and friends. Kilpatrick was elected to office in 2001, then resigned in 2008 for a completely separate scandal, pleading guilty to obstruction of justice in an investigation regarding sexually explicit text messages and an extramarital affair with his chief of staff. #BREAKING State representative Karen Whitsett says President Trump told her Thursday that Kwame Kilpatrick would be one of 3000 prisoners released because of #coronavirus @FOX2News @WWJ950   @realDonaldTrump  @KayLyme — Charlie Langton (@charlielangton) May 22, 2020  Rep. Whitsett said that while President Trump told her Kilpatrick would be one of 3,000 Michigan prisoners to be released because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, he would remain under house arrest. Whitsett is primarily known for her break from the Democratic party to push for national unity during the crisis. She has been censured by the 13th Congressional District Democratic Party Organization — meaning they will not support her upcoming reelection campaign. When asked for comment during his Friday coronavirus briefing, current Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan said people who know him know his connection to Kilpatrick is “very personal.” “Known him since he was in high school. When he was teaching at Marcus Garvey and going to law school at night at DCL, he’d study in his father’s office which was next to mine and his twins would play on the floor in my office,” Duggan said, stressing that Kilpatrick was one of the most talented people he knows. “He has a lot to contribute and if, in fact, the reports [of his early release] are true, I’ll be doing anything I can to help him get a fresh start,” the mayor said.

Friday on MSNBC’s “The Beat,” liberal documentary filmmaker Michael Moore accused President Donald Trump of attempting to “rig” the 2020 presidential election said Democrats must fight “tooth and nail” with Trump for mail-in voting. Melber asked, “Your concern about that, and as someone who has always been tough and loud and clear about your politics in public, what do you think people like you, fellow liberals, should do if Trump is playing games with 2020 voting?” Moore said, “He has to be fought tooth and nail. There can be no compromise now. I can see, I think others can see what he is up to here. He is trying to do a number of things to make the election go in his favor by rigging it, by trying to make it uncomfortable or uneasy or, if the virus still going on in November.” He continued, “I don’t know why he would oppose this, because it seems like a lot of seniors, that was his strongest demographic, why he would oppose making it easier for them so that they don’t have to go to a polling place and maybe get the virus. A lot of stuff doesn’t make any sense right now.” He added, “But I’ve learned in terms of how we lost to him last time, how he won the White House by losing the election, to not take him for granted. Every move he is making, whether it’s getting rid of the inspector generals, so there is no watchdogs in the last six to nine months, whether it’s the business with the post office, whatever he is doing and whatever he is up to, suggesting maybe we postpone the election because of the virus. We must not postpone the election. We must make it easy for every American to vote. We must not be afraid of men carrying guns in our state capitols. They are the minority.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

World Health Organization (W.H.O.) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Friday that his organization “worked day and night to coordinate the global response” to the coronavirus pandemic, “providing technical advice, catalysing political solidarity, mobilising resources, coordinating resources and much more.”  “So far almost $800 million has been pledged or received towards W.H.O.’s appeal for COVID-19 programs, leaving a gap of just over $900 million,” Tedros told the 34 members of the W.H.O. Executive Board in a three-hour teleconference, stressing the need for additional funding. Voice of America News reported on the list of W.H.O. achievements by Tedros, who does not appear to have discussed criticisms of his performance in-depth but appeared conscious of charges that W.H.O. relayed too much misinformation from the Chinese Communist Party about the Wuhan coronavirus: In its first virtual meeting, the board and its newly-elected chairman, Indian Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, heard Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus say the WHO had worked “day and night” to coordinate a global response to the pandemic. Tedros said the WHO published its first comprehensive package of guidance on COVID-19 on January 10, and said it has since issued “almost 100 technical documents.” He said the organization has held more than 50 news briefings and worked with multiple high-tech platforms, including Facebook, Google and Instagram, to fight what he called the “info-demic” of misinformation about the coronavirus that has spread throughout the world. Since February, he said the WHO has convened more than 400 researchers worldwide to “identify research priorities,” and that they are tracking more than 700 clinical trials globally. The United States, which has frozen its disproportionately large share of W.H.O. funding pending a full investigation of the organization’s errors during the pandemic, told the Executive Board that it wants the review to begin “now.” The Associated Press on Friday described the message sent from the U.S. government to the overseers of the United Nations’ health organization: Adm. Brett Giroir, an assistant secretary in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, sent a letter to the U.N. health agency’s executive board meeting on Friday saying the United States believes the WHO can “immediately initiate” preparations such as bringing together independent health experts and setting up guidelines for the review. “This review will ensure we have a complete and transparent understanding of the source, timeline of events, and decision-making process for the WHO’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic,” wrote Giroir, who is one of the board’s 34 international members. Giroir did not deliver that statement in person, but did briefly participate in the board’s first-ever “virtual” meeting. Giroir alluded to a resolution passed Tuesday by the WHO’s assembly calling on Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to launch a “comprehensive evaluation” of the WHO-coordinated international response to the outbreak “at the earliest appropriate moment.” […] “As President Trump just made clear in his May 18 letter to Director-General Tedros, there is no time to waste to begin on the reforms needed to ensure such a pandemic never happens again,” Giroir added. “We applaud the call for an impartial, independent, and comprehensive review, to be undertaken in consultation with member states, and urge that work begin now.” The AP described Giroir’s letter as having “a decidedly more diplomatic tone” than the one sent to Tedros by President Donald Trump, but Giroir gently stressed the importance of the points Trump made. “We further appreciate the mandate given to the WHO in the resolution to investigate the origins of (the coronavirus), and we are confident that researchers and medical practitioners around the world will be empowered in the pursuit of vaccines and other countermeasures through this knowledge,” he wrote in one passage, a very polite way of reminding W.H.O. that it had better complete that investigation in a timely and comprehensive manner. Giroir also said that when W.H.O.’s governing body, the World Health Assembly (W.H.A.), reconvenes this autumn, it must address “the ability of Taiwan to participate as an observer.” Taiwanese participation has been blocked by Communist China for purely political reasons, at enormous cost to the rest of the world, since Taiwan provided vital early challenges to the false information fed to W.H.O. by China and devised the world’s most effective response to the pandemic.

House Democrats wrote to President Donald Trump on Friday, questioning his decision to send 200 ventilators to Russia to help coronavirus patients there. In a letter signed by three committee chairs (Oversight, Foreign Affairs, and Appropriations) and two subcommittee chairs (Coronavirus and National Security), Democrats objected to the donation, claiming that the president was “providing or selling ventilators to other countries as gifts or favors to serve your own political or personal interests without any meaningful strategic justification, thorough interagency process, or policy rationale for doing so.” While they claimed that they are not averse to being “part of the global solution to the coronavirus pandemic,” the Democrats added that “we must first ensure that cities and hospitals across the United States can address their own ventilator shortages.” The White House has repeatedly noted that every American who has needed a ventilator during the coronavirus pandemic has had one thanks to the administration’s guidance of private sector production. The president has begun calling the U.S. the “king” of ventilators. “With your help,” President Trump told employees at a Ford Motor Company plant in Michigan on Thursday, “not a single American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator. Not one.” In their letter, House Democrats wrote: “The use of American taxpayer dollars to purchase and deliver ventilators overseas cannot and should not be used as political favors.” But they provided no evidence that Trump has done so. Instead, Democrats demanded the White House preserve and provide documents, including “[c]omplete and unredacted flight manifests for U.S. ventilator shipments to foreign governments or entities” and “[f]ull summaries of any and all conversations between yourself and President Putin during which the shipment of ventilators was discussed.” Trump announced this week that the U.S. was sending 250 ventilators to Nigeria — more than the U.S. is sending to Russia. The administration has said that it will provide 8,000 ventilators to foreign countries by the end of July, since there will be an oversupply in the U.S. Joel B.

Chinese people voted the U.S. “the most disappointing country” in the world for its response to the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic, according to an opinion poll conducted by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) newspaper Global Times, which published a report on the findings on Friday. “1,568 respondents across ten Chinese cities, participated in the opinion poll themed ‘public anticipation of economic life after the pandemic,’ conducted by the poll center of the Global Times,” the article said. “An overwhelming 86.7 percent of the respondents deemed the U.S.’ [Wuhan corona]virus prevention measures as the most disappointed one; followed by the U.K. with 29 percent. Only a small minority of the participants, 4.9 percent, expressed their disappointment with China’s battle against [the Wuhan corona]virus,” the newspaper claimed. Beijing’s own response to the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak, which emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, has been widely condemned by world health authorities and national leaders. Studies have found the CCP’s coverup of China’s initial Wuhan coronavirus outbreak allowed the isolated epidemic to evolve into an ongoing global pandemic, responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. China’s poll follows shortly after the Pew Research Center found that Taiwanese nationals prefer the U.S. to China by a “nearly two-to-one margin” in a survey released on May 12. According to the poll: Overall, just 35 percent of adults give positive marks to mainland China, while about six in ten hold unfavorable views. There is widespread support for increased economic and political ties with Washington; enthusiasm for similar relations with mainland China is much more muted. According to Pew Research, the poll was representative of Taiwan’s adult population and carried out from October to November of last year. Although Taiwan has never been ruled by Beijing in its history, China considers the island a renegade province. Taiwan successfully functions as its own sovereign nation, commanding its own military and government. The U.S. has increased its support of Taiwan in recent months amid increased bullying by China. On May 19, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, along with other world leaders, congratulated Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, on her reelection to a second term, signaling America’s support of her ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). According to Pew’s report, the DPP asserts that Taiwanese national identity remains distinct from Chinese identity and supports increased political ties with the U.S. over China. The opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), prefers closer relations with mainland China. Among politically independent Taiwanese, meaning those who fail to identify strongly with either the DPP or the KMT, “positive feelings for the U.S. are much stronger than towards mainland China,” according to the report. Among those who identify solely as Taiwanese, favorable views of the U.S. are “three times higher than towards mainland China (75 percent versus 23 percent),” according to the report.

Friday on MSNBC’s “Deadline,” network host Al Sharpton reacted to presumptive Democratic nominee former Vice President Joe Biden’s telling radio host Charlamagne tha God that voters who have trouble deciding whether to support him or President Donald Trump “ain’t black.” Sharpton said, “I watched the interview that he did with Charlamagne tha God. First of all, Charlamagne tha God is respected as one can be in the black community and in general. There’s no way he’s pressing someone in an interview on behalf of Donald Trump. He presses everyone in interviews and ironically the questions he was raising about Vice President Biden, I raised, and others have raised in interviews. He presses me when I go on the show, and we’re friends. He is one that wants answers. So I think that his being something other than black is as ludicrous as saying that I’m going to be in the Rockettes when Radio City opens up again. I can dance, but I can’t do the Rockettes.” He continued, “But the other point is, I think whether it was said in jest by the vice president or not— I think Symone Sanders, who is also unquestionably black, said the vice president said it in jest if you have to decide between Trump and I — you’re not black. Whether you say it in jest or not, no one should qualify who’s going to be black or anything else. I think that’s inappropriate. I think that clearly, the vice president ought to deal with his record. Many of us questioned the Crime Bill. In fact, I marched on it then.” He added, “Eight years this man was vice president and did things that he can concretely point to, including helping President Obama reduce the federal population of inmates by 38,000. He was there. I sat next to him when they announced the whole thing around policing task force.” He concluded, “He has a concrete record to run against a man whose own aide Omarosa Manigault, was the spokesperson to the Black community for Donald Trump and was in the White House with him, she calls him a racist. So deal with the record. Don’t say things in jest that are inappropriate. People can be black and still make wrong political decisions, but Charlamagne tha God is not one of them.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Audio resurfaced Thursday in which Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) suggested that her husband, John Bessler, had taken hydroxychloroquine during his battle against coronavirus, from which he later recovered. The audio was cited by the Gateway Pundit blog, which in turn referred to P. J. Gladnick at the Citizen Free Press blog,  who cited an April 7 interview on the Michael Smerconish Program on Sirius XM Radio 124 (9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. ET, weekdays). Smerconish and Klobuchar discussed her husband’s recovery, and had the following exchange (here from 4:47 to 5:41): Smerconish: Has it influenced your thought process relative to the discussion or debate about hydroxychloroquine? Klobuchar: Well, I think that I listen to the science there. I believe he did briefly take that drug, I’d have to check with his doctors, because of course I wasn’t there. But I think that — or some drug like it — but I think that we have to listen to the science and you have to listen to your doctors, [about] what is going to work in each individual situation. Sometimes you might have other conditions that make it so you can’t take certain drugs, sometimes your own condition with the virus wouldn’t demand that, and so I think people have to look at what works. And I just believe in science, something this president has been not listening to. Curiously, Klobuchar mocked President Donald Trump on Wednesday for taking the drug (prescribed by his medical team at the White House, with zinc, as a prophylactic): They say that hydroxychloroquine can lead to hallucinations. https://t.co/jCfls8eZpf — Amy Klobuchar (@amyklobuchar) May 20, 2020  The Washington Examiner‘s Kerry Picket also flagged the Smerconish interview, and evidently tried to obtain comment from Klobuchar’s office, but did not receive a response.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) on Friday extended the state’s safer-at-home order to June 12. The order was slated to expire next week, on Thursday, May 28, but Whitmer warned residents that they are “not out of the woods yet,” citing the possibility of a second wave of the coronavirus. “If we’re going to lower the chance of a second wave and continue to protect our neighbors and loved ones from the spread of this virus, we must continue to do our part by staying safer at home,” she said, according to the Detroit Free Press: Whitmer’s announcement comes a day after she made several changes to further relax a sweeping stay-at-home order that has been in place since March, allowing social gatherings of 10 people or less immediately and telling retail businesses that sell goods they can reopen to customers for appointment-only shopping Tuesday. That change also allows for non-emergency dental and doctor services to resume next Friday and Whitmer said Thursday that she would continue to relax the order as warranted by the data. She had previously allowed some retail businesses, such as garden stores and bicycle repair shops to reopen, and at 12:01 a.m. Friday, bars, restaurants and other businesses and offices on the Upper Peninsula and in northern Michigan around Traverse City, could open to customers, provided they limited their customers, made sure people stayed six feet apart and required masks. “All of us know the importance of getting people back to work and the economy moving again,” Whitmer, who has faced a wave of scrutiny over her lockdown orders, said. “But the worst thing we can do is open up in a way that causes a second wave of infections and death, puts health care workers at further risk, and wipes out all the progress we’ve made,” she added. Michiganders gathered at the Michigan capitol lawn on Wednesday for “Operation Haircut” as part of a greater effort to “demonstrate the insanity still rampant in Lansing.” “Michigan needs to be reopened now to end the reign of Michigan’s power hungry bureaucrats. We are suffering from a #Whitmerdepression,” MCC co-founder Marian Sheridan said. Whitmer’s administration took a blow this week after a judge ruled that Karl Manke — a 77-year-old barber in Owosso, Michigan, who had his license suspended without a hearing — did not have to close his shop. As Breitbart News detailed: “(The attorney general) has not presented any studies underlying the doctor’s conclusion. (The attorney general) has not shown any nexus between the cutting of hair and an increased risk of transmission,” Stewart wrote, the Detroit Free Press reported. “(The attorney general’s) filings rest more on general facts about COVID-19 than specific practices or conditions at (Manke’s) business.” Nessel’s office said she would appeal the ruling. Whitmer has come under criticism for her heavy-handed approach to the coronavirus pandemic, initially issuing far-reaching lockdown orders that even barred neighbors from visiting each other.

On Friday, Georgetown university announced that one of its legendary basketball players and current head coach Patrick Ewing, has tested positive for the coronavirus. “I want to share that I have tested positive for COVID-19,” Ewing said in a statement. “This virus is serious and should not be taken lightly. I want to encourage everyone to stay safe and take care of yourselves and your loved ones. Now more than ever, I want to thank the healthcare workers and everyone on the front lines. I’ll be fine and we will all get through this.” The news comes in the same week that the NCAA gave schools the approval to hold on-campus voluntary workouts with their athletes beginning on June 1st. Ewing reportedly contracted the virus while away from the team, lowering the risk of infection to the rest of the team and staff. Ewing, 57, is currently receiving care at a local D.C. hospital.

The U.S. Census Bureau announced this week that each Wednesday it will post online a survey of American households to measure how people are doing during the coronavirus outbreak on a number of issues, including employment, “food security,” and access to health care. “The survey is intended to provide crucial weekly data to help understand the experiences of American households during the COVID-19 pandemic,” the announcement of the survey said. The announcement said: In this initial release, the Household Pulse Survey Interactive Tool provides data for select indicators at national and state levels. National data also are available in table format. We plan subsequent weekly releases through late July, and will include additional estimates for states and the 15 largest metropolitan statistical areas. For the April 23-May 5 period, invitations to take part in the survey were sent to 1,867,126 households and a total 74,413 responded (63,003 complete interviews and 11,410 partial interviews). Some of the key findings include: • Among the population of adults 18 and over, 47 percent either lost employment income or another adult in their household had lost employment income since March 13. Thirty-nine percent of adults expected that they or someone in their household would lose employment income over the next four weeks. • About ten percent of adults reported that they did not get enough of the food they needed some of the time or often. Another 32 percent report getting enough, but not the kinds of food they needed. On average, households spent $196 a week to buy food at supermarkets, grocery stores, online, and other places to be prepared and eaten at home. • Adults who responded reported feeling anxious or nervous more than half the days last week or nearly every day 29.7 percent of the time. They reported not being able to stop or control worrying more than half the days last week or nearly every day 22.8 percent of the time. For measures related to depression, 18.6 percent of adults report feeling down more than half the days or nearly every day last week, and 21.4 percent reported having little interest or pleasure in doing things more than half the days or nearly every day last week. • 38.7 percent of adults report that over the last four weeks, they delayed getting medical care because of the coronavirus pandemic. • When asked about the likelihood of being able to pay next month’s rent or mortgage on time, 21.3 precent reported only slight or no confidence in being able to pay next month’s rent or mortgage on time. Another 2.5 percent reported next month’s mortgage is or will be deferred. • In households with children enrolled in public or private school (K-12), adults spent 13 hours on average on teaching activities during the last seven days. The Bureau said it partnered with five other federal agencies to develop the Household Pulse Survey, including the Bureau of Labor Statistics, National Center for Health Statistics, USDA Economic Research Service, Department for Housing and Urban Development, and the National Center for Education Statistics.

Baltimore Mayor Jack Young (D) is once again demanding President Donald Trump scrap his planned visit to the city on Memorial Day, arguing that he believes the trip is against the law, citing the city’s stay-at-home order still being in place due to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. “We don’t need to be spending our resources for the president who’s coming here under our orders to stay at home. I think he’s violating the law,” Young said, according to CBS News Baltimore. The White House announced this week that President Trump and first lady Melania Trump will travel to Baltimore to visit the Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine. President Trump said in a statement: The City of Baltimore remains under a Stay at Home order that was put in place to help safeguard our residents from the dangers associated with COVID-19. We have worked closely with our health professionals to educate the public about the benefits of social distancing and staying home, unless leaving for an essential reason, like visiting a doctor or picking up groceries. On Thursday, Young first called on President Trump to cancel his trip, citing health concerns stemming from the pandemic and the price tag associated with a presidential visit. Young said, reported CBS Baltimore: I wish that the President, as our nation’s leader, would set a positive example and not travel during this holiday weekend. I would hope that the President would change his mind and decide to remain at home. If he decides, however, to move forward with his scheduled trip to Baltimore we will, of course, be prepared for his visit. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R), who has repeatedly criticized the Trump administration, said he will not meet with the president and instead plans to celebrate his birthday with his family. He said: We are honored that the President and the First Lady have chosen to spend  Memorial Day at Fort McHenry. Although Marylanders are encouraged not to gather in large numbers this year – now more than ever – it’s important to reflect on the American heroes who sacrificed their lives for our freedom. Monday is the governor’s birthday, and he has plans to mark the day at home with his family. Joining President Trump and first lady Melania Trump to visit Fort McHenry are Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Interior Secretary David Bernhardt.

Friday on Fox News Channel’s “The Daily Briefing,” network senior judicial analyst Andrew Napolitano said President Donald Trump’s declaring during the White House press briefing that he could “override” governors to reopen houses of worship was incorrect. Perino asked, “Does he have the power to do that?” Napolitano said, “In a word, no. As ill-advised as these gubernatorial orders are, as essential as is the right to worship, as fundamental as it is, as absolutely protected by the First Amendment as it is, the president does not have any authority to override the governors. I will tell you, but the president can do. He can’t dispatch the Department of Justice to file lawsuits in federal court, and judges can override the governors. But the president on his own —no matter well intended he may be, and I believe he’s well-intended here— is without authority to do that.” All right, but let me ask a question then because if it’s what the governors are doing is unconstitutional, what is the remedy then? Are you suggesting the church needs to bring a lawsuit against the governor or the DOJ to file against the State? Napolitano said, “One of the jobs of the DOJ is to keep the states at heel when they interfere with the fundamental liberties of people in their states. I have been begging the Department of Justice to sue Governor Murphy here in New Jersey, who has found the houses of worship are not essential. Here, the doors are locked, and you cannot go in for private prayer on your own, much less an organized prayer service or a Catholic mass. So that is one thing that the DOJ can do. Individuals, of course, can sue. Judges can interfere with governors when governors violate the state constitution or the federal constitution. But the president is without authority to exercise that interference on his own.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Dr. Deborah Birx on Friday at the White House expressed concerns that new coronavirus cases were reported in the Washington, DC, metro area and other cities like Los Angeles, and Chicago — even though the areas remained closed. “We still see these ongoing cases,” she said. She presented a chart showing there was not a dramatic decline in the Washington, DC area of new cases or emergency room visits with coronavirus-like illnesses. White House coronavirus chart for DC area “I’ve asked the CDC, and the CDC is working with the local areas in Chicago, and this area and L.A. to really understand where are these new cases are coming from and what do we need to do to prevent them in the future,” she said. Birx also questioned studies suggesting that the United States could have saved more lives if they had closed down states earlier. On March 14, she said, New York had less than 50 cases reported, Chicago had less than ten, Washington state had less than ten and Los Angeles had less than 20. She noted that Washington state had over 100 cases, but that there were only about 500 cases in the country nationwide. The White House Coronavirus Task Force announced the first 15-day shutdown recommendations on March 16th.

Tens of millions of children under 12 months are potentially at risk for diseases such as diphtheria and polio as the Chinese coronavirus pandemic interrupts routine vaccinations, according to data published by global public health experts on Friday. STAT News reports: Vaccine campaigns have been disrupted in at least 68 countries, according to data released by the World Health Organization, UNICEF, the Sabin Vaccine Institute, and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. The interruptions could affect 80 million children under 1 year old in those countries. The agencies said that the disruptions are occurring at a scale unseen since widespread immunization campaigns began in the 1970s. The countries reported at least moderate interruptions to the programs, with some countries suspending their programs completely. The organizations said 27 countries have postponed campaigns of vaccinations that protect against measles, while more than a dozen have paused some polio vaccination programs. Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organization (WHO), said in a statement: Immunization is one of the most powerful and fundamental disease prevention tools in the history of public health. Disruption to immunization programs from the Covid-19 pandemic threatens to unwind decades of progress against vaccine-preventable diseases like measles. Public health experts are urging immunization programs remain operational to both ensure children are protected against current illnesses and are ready to distribute coronavirus vaccines if they become readily available. Gavi CEO Seth Berkley said in a statement: More children in more countries are now protected against more vaccine-preventable diseases than at any point in history,” Gavi CEO Seth Berkley said in a statement. Due to Covid-19, this immense progress is now under threat, risking the resurgence of diseases like measles and polio. Not only will maintaining immunization programs prevent more outbreaks, it will also ensure we have the infrastructure we need to roll out an eventual Covid-19 vaccine on a global scale. Due to the pandemic, polio and measles vaccination campaigns have been heavily impacted, with the former having been halted in 27 countries. Conversely, polio campaigns have been halted in 38 nations. On Wednesday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) warned that administered vaccines have plummeted 63 percent for children in the Big Apple in the last year. Two new studies offer hope for an effective coronavirus vaccine — and for the notion that prior infection also confers immunity. Both studies were conducted on rhesus macaque monkeys, so testing on humans is required for more definitive proof. But in one study, monkeys developed immunity against the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus after receiving experimental vaccines. “Our findings increase optimism that the development of COVID-19 vaccines will be possible,” said lead researcher Dr. Dan Barouch. He directs the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. As part of the new research, macaques were given experimental coronavirus vaccines that expressed six different forms of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, a structure on the virus’ surface that it uses to bind with and invade human cells. The vaccines provide DNA that enables host cells to make the spike protein, so that they can then generate antibody responses to it. In this way, the immune system is trained to recognize coronavirus and quickly respond to it if it appears. The vaccines were given to 25 adult macaques in initial vaccinations and also in follow-up boost immunizations. Another ten monkeys got a sham vaccine. All of the macaques were infected with the new coronavirus six weeks after vaccination, and those that had received the real vaccines produced levels of antibodies in their blood that were high enough to neutralize the virus within two weeks. In fact, eight of the 25 vaccinated monkeys showed no detectable virus at any point following exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and the other vaccinated animals showed only low viral loads, the researchers reported in the March 20 issue of the journal Science. In all cases, as the production of immune system antibodies rose, viral load declined. That suggests that there’s a direct correlation between the two — an important factor to consider as vaccine development goes forward, the researchers said. In another important finding, a second study conducted by the same team found that monkeys who were infected with the new coronavirus developed immunity. In that research, nine adult macaques were infected with the virus, but then cleared it from their bodies when they were re-exposed to it 35 days later. All nine also had few or no symptoms after re-exposure and had immune responses that appeared to protect them against a second infection. Further research is needed to find out how long this natural immunity lasts, the study authors noted. The UPI contributed to this report. 

For those anxiously anticipating the beginning of college football, you got good news today. The Southeastern Conference approved voluntary on-campus workouts for student-athletes beginning on June 8th. The nation’s premier college football conference made the allowance with the guidance that the workouts be conducted “under strict supervision of designated university personnel and safety guidelines developed by each institution.” The decision comes on the heels of the NCAA’s decision earlier this week, to allow football and basketball players to return for voluntary workouts on June 1st. “This is an important first step toward having a season this fall, and we will continue to collectively work together as our top priority is to ensure the safety and well-being of our student-athletes, coaches and staff,” Auburn coach Gus Malzahn said. Texas Governor Greg Abbott, whose state is home to one SEC school, recently expressed optimism that the college football season would start on time, with at least some fans in attendance. “Our goal right now is to have college football season start as planned with fans in stands,” Abbott told KXAN. Athletic activities in the SEC have been suspended since March 12th.

A recent report claims that leading figures in the data science industry believe that the computer code developed by Professor Neil Ferguson, which convinced governments that lockdown was the best choice to prevent the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus, was “totally unreliable.” A recent report from the Telegraph alleges that experts have begun to question the computer code developed by Professor Neil Ferguson which largely influenced world governments to enter states of lockdown to prevent the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus. David Richards, the co-founder of the British data technology firm WANdisco, derided Ferguson’s data model of coronavirus infections as a “buggy mess that looks more like a bowl of angel hair pasta than a finely tuned piece of programming.” Richards added, “In our commercial reality, we would fire anyone for developing code like this and any business that relied on it to produce software for sale would likely go bust.” The Imperial College’s model placed the fatality rate higher than others and predicted that in the United Kingdom alone 510,000 people would die without a lockdown. This reportedly prompted a dramatic change in policy from the UK government which ichluded shutting down businesses, schools, and restaurants. The Telegraph writes: The Imperial model works by using code to simulate transport links, population size, social networks and healthcare provisions to predict how coronavirus would spread. However, questions have since emerged over whether the model is accurate, after researchers released the code behind it, which in its original form was “thousands of lines” developed over more than 13 years. In its initial form, developers claimed the code had been unreadable, with some parts looking “like they were machine translated from Fortran”, an old coding language, according to John Carmack, an American developer, who helped clean up the code before it was published online. Yet, the problems appear to go much deeper than messy coding. Many have claimed that it is almost impossible to reproduce the same results from the same data, using the same code. Scientists from the University of Edinburgh reported such an issue, saying they got different results when they used different machines, and even in some cases, when they used the same machines. Researchers from the University of Edinburgh commented on the Imperial College’s Github file: “There appears to be a bug in either the creation or re-use of the network file. If we attempt two completely identical runs, only varying in that the second should use the network file produced by the first, the results are quite different.” A fix to this bug was later provided but appeared to be one of a number of bugs within the system. The developers claim that the model is “stochastic”, and that “multiple runs with different seeds should be undertaken to see average behaviour.” But some specialists have argued that “models must be capable of passing the basic scientific test of producing the same results given the same initial set of parameters…otherwise, there is simply no way of knowing whether they will be reliable.” Michael Bonsall, Professor of Mathematical Biology at Oxford University, commented that: “We’d be up in arms if weather forecasting was based on a single set of results from a single model and missed taking that umbrella when it rained.” Konstantin Boudnik, vice-president of architecture at WANdisco, also stated that Ferguson’s previous models which incorrectly predicted up to 136,000 deaths from mad cow disease, 200 million from bird flu, and 65,000 from swine flu, do not inspire confidence. “The facts from the early 2000s are just yet another confirmation that their modeling approach was flawed to the core,” says Dr. Boudnik. “We don’t know for sure if the same model/code was used, but we clearly see their methodology wasn’t rigourous then and surely hasn’t improved now.” A spokesperson to the Imperial College COVID19 Response Team stated: The UK Government has never relied on a single disease model to inform decision-making. As has been repeatedly stated, decision-making around lockdown was based on a consensus view of the scientific evidence, including several modelling studies by different academic groups. Multiple groups using different models concluded that the pandemic would overwhelm the NHS and cause unacceptably high mortality in the absence of extreme social distancing measures. Within the Imperial research team we use several models of differing levels of complexity, all of which produce consistent results. We are working with a number of legitimate academic groups and technology companies to develop, test and further document the simulation code referred to. However, we reject the partisan reviews of a few clearly ideologically motivated  commentators. Epidemiology is not a branch of computer science and the conclusions  around lockdown rely not on any mathematical model but on the scientific consensus that COVID-19 is a highly transmissible virus with an infection fatality ratio exceeding 0.5pc in the UK.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated during a recent livestream that employees considering leaving Silicon Valley for areas with cheaper cost-of-living could be subject to pay cuts. Many Facebook employees are working from home during the Chinese virus pandemic and questioning the need to live in the extremely costly San Francisco Bay area. During a recent livestream, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated that as Facebook plans to “aggressively” ramp up its hiring of remote workers, those that choose to live outside of the Silicon Valley area may be subject to pay cuts, CNBC reports. Zuckerberg stated that he predicts that 50 percent of Facebook’s employees could be working remotely within the next five to 10 years, stating: “We’re going to be the most forward-leaning company on remote work at our scale.” Facebook plans to allow certain employees to work remotely full time, but those that move to a different location will have to notify the company by January 1, 2021. Employees that have moved outside the Silicon Valley area could have their salaries cut based on their new locations, according to Zuckerberg. “We’ll adjust salary to your location at that point,” the CEO said noting that this is necessary for tax and accounting reasons. “There’ll be severe ramifications for people who are not honest about this.” Zuckerberg stated on his weekly employee livestream that he believes that this decision will help the company improve its employee retention and allow the firm to hire from talent pools that previously could not move to big cities to work with the firm. “When you limit hiring to people who either live in a small number of big cities or are willing to move there, that cuts out a lot of people who live in different communities, different backgrounds or may have different perspectives,” Zuckerberg said. Zuckerberg stated that 95 percent of Facebook’s employees were now working remotely, according to a survey of staff 50 percent of the employees stated that they were as productive working from home as they were at the office. 40% of employees said they were extremely, very, or somewhat interested in full-time remote work according to the survey, and among that subset of employees 75 percent stated that they were considering they might move to a different city if they could work remotely. Zuckerberg added: “It’s somewhat of an unfortunate and unsustainable setup for people to have a lot of these jobs they have to move to a small number of big cities.” Facebook will reportedly allow existing employees to request permanent remote work if they meet a specific criteria. Zuckerberg’s announcement comes shortly after Facebook unveiled new features for the company’s enterprise communication software, Workplace. Workplace has grown its base from 3 million users in October to 5 million now amidst the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic. Facebook share prices rose by nearly 1 percent following Zuckerberg’s announcement. Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

ATLANTA, Georgia — Vice President Mike Pence defended Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp against establishment media and leftist critics who just weeks ago inaccurately predicted widescale doom as Georgia moved to aggressively reopen its economy ahead of schedule. “Let’s be clear: Gov. Brian Kemp has proven them wrong every day,” Pence said when Breitbart News asked him and Kemp during a press gaggle to respond to critics throughout the media and left who ripped Kemp at the outset of the reopening process. “The people of Georgia have proven them wrong every day.” The vice president’s praise of Kemp’s handling of the coronavirus crisis comes just weeks after Georgia in late April moved to aggressively reopen its economy—and the state faced a bevy of criticism from establishment media outlets and leftists. “Georgia’s Experiment in Human Sacrifice,” was a headline, for instance, in the Atlantic for a piece by Amanda Mull. Others in media and on the left were similarly vicious to Kemp. Now, though, the data demonstrates that Kemp was right and they were wrong. A month into Georgia’s reopening process, the first and most aggressive anywhere in America, cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are all on the decline. Georgia continues its reopening process, and providing hope to other states across the country following its lead. While Pence was much more direct in noting that the establishment critics of Kemp were wrong, Kemp brushed them off and said to Breitbart News that he is not interested in battling with media critics—he is more focused on winning the war with the coronavirus and energizing his state’s economy. “I’ll just say the way I’ve been dealing with that is I’m not criticizing anybody,” Kemp said. “There’s no playbook on this. We’ve all been in this together. Everybody has had to make tough decisions, whether it’s at the federal level or local level or certainly at the state level. I think everybody has the lives of their citizens and constituents [in mind], and they’re concerned about them when they make those decisions. I haven’t been too worried about criticizing the press too much either. I just want to keep driving our numbers down and keep making sure we give people an opportunity to get back to work and save this great economy that we have.” Pence’s trip to Georgia began with a lunch visit the Star Cafe in Atlanta with Gov. Kemp and Georgia’s first lady Marty Kemp. Later in the day, he visited Waffle House corporate headquarters in Norcross for a roundtable with Kemp and Waffle House’s CEO. The vice president’s trip comes during a broader effort by the White House to reopen America, one that President Donald Trump and Pence have been cheerleading across the country. Trump was in Michigan on Thursday to pressure Democrat Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to move faster, and Pence was in Florida on Wednesday to cheer on GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis and enjoy a burger with him.

Pence told the press as they left. pic.twitter.com/4tavNhmdJb — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) May 22, 2020  .@VP Pence, appearing alongside @GovKemp, at the reopened Star Cafe in Atlanta: “Georgia is leading the way.” Breitbart's @mboyle1 is on the ground in Georgia. pic.twitter.com/SNbtbDS9fA — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) May 22, 2020  Later, during the Waffle House roundtable, Pence noted that case numbers and hospitalizations continue dropping in Georgia even as testing increases–a remarkable feat, he said, since one would think that increasing testing would lead to a spike in cases. In the press gaggle inside Star Cafe, Pence told Breitbart News that all 50 states are reopening now. Pence also said that America does not face a choice between the economy or the public health—he said it is a choice between “health and health.” “I was just in Florida a few short days ago where I heard tell of the level of criticism that had been waged there against the efforts of Florida to safely and responsibly reopen,” Pence said. “I’ve been working with governors in both political parties every day since the president tapped me to lead the White House Coronavirus Task Force. There is not a governor in a state or territory in this country that hasn’t done everything in their power to put the health and well-being of their people first. What governors recognize and what President Trump and I recognize is this is not a choice between health and a growing economy. This is a choice between health and health. There are very serious health consequences to having our economy continue to be closed. I think the American people understand that.” “We asked people during the most difficult days of the coronavirus pandemic to avoid elective surgery, but the better part of a month ago we saw hospitalizations dropping around the country, so we encouraged states to open up elective surgery again.” Pence continued. “I want to take this time to tell everyone in Georgia: Now is the time to go back to your local hospital and have that procedure and have that routine checkup to support your health and to support your local healthcare community. The truth is when people forgo routine checkups, there are health risks with that. When people go a long time without work, there are profound emotional and physical impacts of that. That’s what Gov. Kemp has recognized and the people of Georgia have recognized and other governors around the country like the governor of Florida are doing.” “All 50 states today are now in some measure of reopening their economies, ” he said. “They’re demonstrating we can do it safely and responsibly. But what some of the critics have to recognize is it’s not a choice between health and a strong economy. It’s between health and health, and the president and I and the governor here are determined to move forward and safely and responsibly reopen. That’s because that is the best way for a safe and strong America.” Kemp, during his comments in response to Breitbart News during the press gaggle, said that he has been focused on making scientifically sound decisions—and his push to reopen, which has happened as the coronavirus has receded here, proves that. “If you think back a few months ago, it’s the best economy we’ve ever seen. I’ve been a small business guy for 30 years,” Kemp said. “I’ve been through ups and downs and I’ve had weeks where I didn’t know if I was going to be able to make payroll. Marty and I were scratching every penny we could get to get our people paid. We were at that point in Georgia and I knew that—and the president and the vice president said to us that we can’t let the ill effects of the virus be worse than the virus itself. We’re fighting two battles—the COVID battle but also the battle to get this economy back to where it was when we started. That’s what I’ve been focused on—I’m not too worried about critics that are out there. I’m making decisions based on science and public health advice—every decision I’ve made with [Georgia Health Commissioner] Dr. [Kathleen] Toomey has been in conjunction with that and I just appreciate the support and the help of the administration, as we’ve been on this battle for months now.”

The City of San Francisco opened its first officially-sanctioned homeless camp this week, located outside City Hall. The camp, called “Safe Sleeping Village,” includes 80 tents, set up inside rectangles marked in white paint on asphalt, and “provides meals, showers, clean water and trash pickup” to camp residents, according to the Associated Press. San Francisco has opened its first sanctioned camp for homeless people, in a parking lot right outside its city hall. The camp, called "Safe Sleeping Village," has designated areas marked out for tents to maintain social-distancing. pic.twitter.com/9id3Zjilhn — CBS News (@CBSNews) May 22, 2020  SFGate.com reports that the camp opened May 13 for “individuals who were already established in the City Hall area” In addition, “Occupants must sign a community guidelines agreement and are expected to meet certain expectations around conduct. Only occupants can enter the site through entrances that are monitored by officials 24 hours a day.” Other official homeless camps are to be opened later, to address the problem of crowded informal camps on city streets. The coronavirus gave new impetus to San Francisco’s experiment with homeless tent cities. As Breitbart News noted in March, both San Francisco and Los Angeles originally planned to move as many homeless people indoors as possible to prevent the spread of the virus in homeless encampments. However, experts soon learned that the virus spread more easily indoors than outdoors, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advised against moving the homeless indoors. San Francisco reversed course and encouraged homeless people to stay in tents during the outbreak. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Dr. Ben Carson recently told Breitbart News Daily that homeless tent cities that are set up on public land, and that provide medical services, might be the best way to address the problem.

Housing and Urban Development Secretary Dr. Ben Carson reacted Friday to the report of a New York State directive which sent over 4,300 recovering coronavirus to nursing homes within the state as a means to free up space in the hospitals. Carson acknowledged on Fox News Channel’s “America’s Newsroom” that the decision to mingle coronavirus patients with the elderly “was clearly a mistake,” and said even if the move was following CDC guidelines, people need to use “a bit of logic” before making such decisions. “It was clearly a mistake to be sending these people to the nursing homes without having done the necessary preparation in the nursing homes, teaching the staff in the nursing homes, providing the PPE in the nursing homes. That’s been done now, and as you can see, it’s dramatically made a difference. Whether there were appropriate guidelines in place before by the state, we can argue about that all day and all night, but we can use a little bit of logic here. Obviously, we don’t want to take people who have an infectious disease and concentrate them in a place that doesn’t appear to receive them.” Carson responded to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) saying he was merely following President Donald Trump’s CDC guidance and that nursing homes cannot discriminate against a coronavirus patient. “That’s a ridiculous argument,” Carson stated. He added, “Obviously, you want to accept people if you have provisions and have taken the appropriate safeguards, but you just can’t say, ‘OK, let’s bring somebody with tuberculosis in here because we are not supposed to discriminate against them’ without having prepared for that. That makes absolutely no sense whatsoever to a Republican, a Democrat or anybody with a brain.” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent

Appearing Friday on CNBC’s Halftime Report, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said keeping the United States shut down for too long could bring “irreparable damage” to the country.  A partial transcript is as follows: SCOTT WAPNER: There’s a growing debate in this country about the pace and progress of reopening and I’d like to read you today a tweet from the former CEO Goldman Sachs Lloyd Blankfein and get your reaction to it, if I could: “Hospitals are not overwhelmed. Most of us will be exposed anyway since we can’t sequester until there’s a vaccine, and we know which groups need protection from worst outcomes. Is the public health benefit from broad lockdowns at this point worth such extreme damage to livelihoods?” There are also people who argue for herd immunity. How do you address what Mr. Blankfein is saying today and what others have said in the past days, that’s it’s just time to open this country up and protect the most vulnerable. DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: A) We have no disagreement. We must protect the most vulnerable. And B) Yes, depending upon the dynamics of the infection in the particular state, city, region, county that you’re in we certainly want to in a cautious way, reopening. We can’t stay locked down for such a considerable period of time that you might to irreparable damage and have unintended consequences, including consequences for health. And it’s for that reason that guidelines are being put forth, so that the states and the cities can start reenter and to report.

President Donald Trump announced Friday at a surprise briefing at the White House new detailed federal guidelines allowing churches to reopen during the coronavirus pandemic. “Today, I am identifying houses of worship, churches, synagogues, and mosques as essential places that provide essential services,” Trump said, announcing the release of new Centers for Disease Control guidelines. “Some governors have deemed liquor stores and abortion clinics as essential but have left out churches and other houses of worship,” Trump said. “That’s not right.” Trump said he wants every governor to reopen all churches “right now.” “If there’s any questions, they’re going to have to call me, but they will not be successful in that call,” Trump said. The president made a brief announcement about churches and left the podium as Dr. Deborah Birx detailed information about the fight against the coronavirus. Earlier in the week, reports noted that the White House disputed guidelines from the Centers for Disease Controls as too strict, withholding official federal guidance for a few days. Since then, Trump has repeatedly called for governors to allow churches to reopen. “The churches are not being treated with respect by a lot of the Democrat governors,” Trump commented to reporters as he left the White House for a trip to Michigan on Thursday afternoon. “I want to get our churches open, and we’re going to take a very strong position on that very soon.” The president confirmed that the new guidelines would apply to churches, synagogues, and mosques. Despite many churches holding services online, President Trump remarked Thursday that it was not the same as attending in person. “It’s wonderful to sit home and watch something on a laptop, but it can never be the same as being in a church and being with your friends,” Trump said during an event with black leaders on Friday.

Coronavirus shutdowns around the country have succeeded in showing that numerous Democrat governors do not view the Second Amendment as essential. Shutdown orders all contain a list of businesses that are listed as “essential,” and therefore exempt from closure. But the Democrat governors of California, New Jersey, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and New York, did not list gun stores as essential. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D) did pivot, and listed gun stores as “life-sustaining” businesses after the Second Amendment Foundation filed suit, because Wolf’s initial order–issued March 21, 2020–required the stores to close down, Breitbart News reported. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D) reopened gun stores on March 30, two days after the Trump administration’s March 28 announcement listing them as “essential.” But Breitbart News reported that prior to ceding to the Trump administration’s pro-Second Amendment announcement, Murphy laughed in a citizen’s face when the citizen expressed concern over not being to purchase guns for self-defense. Meanwhile, a gun store that is over a century old is closing up shop for good in New York. The owner said they cannot pay rent without customers, and they cannot have customers when they are shut down by Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s (D) order. In New Mexico, Gov. Michelle Lujan-Grisham (D) deflected from her refusal to count gun stores as “essential” by suggesting New Mexicans could just buy guns online if they needed them. The NRA was quick to note that other gun controls signed by Lujan-Grisham mean New Mexicans cannot buy a gun from any source if their local stores are closed. The story is the same story in California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) did not list gun stores as “essential.” The Mercury News reported that Newsom took a slightly different approach than his Democrat colleagues in other states, insomuch as he left the decision to open or close gun stores to the various sheriffs in counties around the state. Therefore, while he did not mandate closure, he simultaneously did not label gun stores “essential.” Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) emerged as an exception to the Democrat view of gun stores as non-essential. On March 21, 2020, Breitbart News reported that his shutdown order listed gun stores as “essential.” AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

The number of new coronavirus cases per day in New York State is down, bringing the Empire State to a level “lower than when we first began,” Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) announced on Friday. “News is good today. Hospitalizations are down. Net change in hospitalizations is down. Number of new cases per day is down,” Cuomo announced. “This is a level now that is lower than when we first began, so that’s good”: JUST IN: New COVID-19 cases in New York State are lowest since start of outbreak, Gov. Andrew Cuomo says. "This is a level now that is lower than when we first began." https://t.co/aCG7eIdIbL pic.twitter.com/PblSyOiJQX — ABC News (@ABC) May 22, 2020  While the number of fatalities are “painfully high” at any number, that number has also been descending, Cuomo stated. There were 109 reported deaths on Thursday, nearly one-third of which occurred in nursing homes: "You see that this number has been stubborn on its way down," New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo says as 109 more people in the state have died from COVID-19. https://t.co/aCG7eIdIbL pic.twitter.com/fpNy1gvrMP — ABC News (@ABC) May 22, 2020  Cuomo emphasized the importance of reopening the state in a “smart” way and said it must be phased by metrics — testing, tracing, isolations, and sufficient hostile capacity. “So all your actions are based on data,” he said, announcing that the Long Island and Mid-Hudson regions will be permitted to reopen if deaths continue to decrease. Cuomo’s reports coincide with other states and hospital systems, which have reported declines in hospitalizations and cases. Pennsylvania’s Lehigh Valley Health Network (LVHN) announced this week, for example, that it has experienced a “steep decline” in patients hospitalized with the coronavirus: Look at that steep decline in the number of COVID-19 patients in LVHN hospitals! It’s even better than predicted. Proof… Posted by Lehigh Valley Health Network on Wednesday, May 20, 2020 New York State reported 361,313 cases and 28,663 deaths as of Friday morning.

A new study suggests that 20 percent of university students may not return to college for the fall semester. Some analysts believe that the ongoing Chinese virus pandemic has drastically shifted American attitudes towards higher education. According to a report by Axios, the coronavirus pandemic may reduce fall enrollment at American universities and colleges by as much as 20 percent. Universities and colleges around the nation have been forced to lay off employees to make up for budgetary shortfalls caused by the pandemic. Ted Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education, told Axios this week that colleges typically lose 10 percent of their enrollment each year. Mitchell claims that universities and colleges should view the additional 10 percent loss as a positive sign for future recovery. “Let’s look at it the other way around: About 80% of students say they plan on enrolling in the fall. They’re planning on enrolling in the same institution and continuing with their education. I think that students get it. Families get it,” Mitchell said. Mitchell argues that universities and colleges need to rapidly adapt their offerings to meet the evolving needs of students. Mitchell suggested that higher education needs to focus on giving students the skills necessary to succeed in the labor market. It’s going to be an important moment for a range of institutions, some of whom will need to find good partners to be able to provide the robust online learning that, Kim, you and I are talking about now. Other institutions are going to be more creative about expanding who they think of as their students. A majority of college students today are not 18-22-year-olds. Colleges need to cater more to the lifelong learner, the adult learner. And certainly in this economy, individuals who need to train and resell for the next generation of jobs. Breitbart News reported this week that Michigan’s public universities face $1 billion in combined losses due to the Chinese virus pandemic. Stay tuned to Breitbart News for more updates on this story.

TOKYO (AP) — Uncertainty grips next year’s postponed Tokyo Olympics: Will there be fans or empty stadiums in 14 months? And how will thousands of athletes, staff, and technical officials travel, be housed, and stay safe amid COVID-19? And Tokyo is not alone. China — where the COVID-19 outbreak was first detected — will hold three mega-sports events within a year after Tokyo is set to close. The World University Games in Chengdu in western China open 10 days after the Tokyo Games close, with up to 8,000 athletes. Next come the Beijing Winter Olympics beginning on Feb. 4, 2022, and the Asian Games in Hangzhou starting on Sept. 10. The previous edition of the Asian Games in Indonesia drew 11,000 athletes and featured more sports than the Olympics. A fourth major event, soccer’s 24-team Club World Championship, was to open in China in June of 2021, but has been postponed because of scheduling conflicts created by the pandemic. China is a go-to country for these mega events, through expertise gained from the 2008 Beijing Olympics and because it absorbs the massive costs. It spent at least $40 billion to organize the 2008 Olympics, and there was no national debate since the authoritarian state prohibits voting or referendums. Voters in Europe and North America have repeatedly said “no” to referendums to hold the games. China landed the 2022 Winter Olympics when several European bidders withdrew. Beijing won narrowly in a vote by the IOC against Almaty, Kazakhstan. “Telling the citizens of Bavaria or Switzerland that another Winter Olympics would benefit them greatly doesn’t work,” Jonathan Grix, who studies sports policy at Manchester Metropolitan University, wrote in an email. He said voters sense that “citizens rarely benefit the most from such events.” “Authoritarian states have no need to ask the populace, they have no need to compromise on policy, there is no political opposition (by definition) and most delivery services are state-run, ensuring the smooth running of the event,“ Grix added. Japanese and International Olympic Committee officials have given few details about how the Tokyo Olympics will be staged, the cost of postponement, and who will pay for it. They’ve teased the problems and floated tenuous solutions. They’ve agreed on one thing: If the games can’t open on July 23, 2021, they’ll be canceled. In a joint news conference last weekend, the director general of the World Health Organization cautioned it would not be “easy” to make the Olympics a safe global gathering spot. But Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus expressed confidence: “I think it’s possible,”
IOC President Thomas Bach has been cautious in speculating how the Olympics can be held. He’s suggested a possible quarantine for athletes, hinted at limited fan access to venues, and has not ruled out events in empty stadiums. Of course, he says that’s not his preference. IOC member John Coates, who oversees preparations for Tokyo, has been direct. “We’ve got real problems because we’ve got athletes having to come from 206 different nations,” Coates said, speaking at a News Corp Australia digital forum and reported in The Australian newspaper. “We’ve got 11,000 athletes coming, 5,000 technical officials and coaches, 20,000 media.” There’s also about 4,000 working on the organizing committee and an expected 60,000 volunteers.” Some scientists in Japan and elsewhere believe a vaccine is needed to guarantee safety for athletes. But some have asked if young, healthy athletes should be a priority for vaccination. The biggest challenge might be guaranteeing the safety of fans who have already bought millions of tickets. If there are no fans, will there be refunds? Will there be lawsuits? Tickets provide at least $800 million income for local organizers with the added cost of postponement estimated in Japan at $2 billion to $6 billion. Eric Saintrond, the CEO of the FISU — the Switzerland-based governing body of the World University Games — said in an email to The Associated Press that decisions related to “security and health will be taken” by the Chinese government. He said final decisions in this area do “not in fact rest with FISU.” He said all preparations were “on track.” University Games spokesman Wang Guangliang was asked about housing for athletes, fans, and so forth, but offered little clarity, deflecting back to the FISU. “The impact of the pandemic is still unforeseeable and we are still studying the situation and need to discuss with FISU about what to do to reduce the impact and ensure the safety of all participants,” Wang wrote in a email to the AP. Postponing the Summer Olympics by a year has raised questions about marketing the Winter Olympics, which open six months after Tokyo closes. Construction is on schedule, but sponsors may face challenges. “Sponsors and business partners of the games will have to keep investing extra money in their marketing programs for Tokyo if the games are postponed, potentially forcing them to reduce their budgets for the next Olympics,” Wei Jizhong, a former secretary general of the Chinese Olympic Committee, told the China Daily. The Associated Press emailed questions about Beijing 2022 preparations to Juan Antonio Samaranch, the IOC vice president who oversees Beijing preparations. He did not immediately reply to the request, nor to a follow-up. Beijing could also face the issues of athlete quarantines, fewer fans, and the fear of spreading the virus even more. In an interview in February with China’s official Xinhua News Agency, Samaranch was laudatory about preparations. He praised Beijing organizers, President Xi Jinping, who heads of the Chinese Communist Party, and China’s handling of the virus. Sheena Greitens, who studies Asian politics at the University of Texas at Austin, said large sports events give China high visibility and “can keep reporters focused on the sporting events rather than having them use their time in-country to dig around on other topics that might reflect poorly on the CCP (Chinese Communist Party).”
“They provide a way for China to boost its cultural and ‘discourse power’ globally,” Greitens wrote in an email. “And they do so in a forum that generally emphasizes international cooperation and is weighted away from the serious disagreements that many countries have with China over territorial conflict, human rights, and trade, among other topics.”

The spread of the Chinese coronavirus in war-torn Yemen “has in effect collapsed” the country’s healthcare system, the United Nations warned on Friday, appealing for urgent humanitarian funding. The spokesman for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), Jens Laerke, told a briefing in Geneva on Friday that health workers were being forced to turn people away for treatment, due to lack of medical supplies and personal protective equipment. “Aid agencies in Yemen are operating on the basis that community transmission is taking place across the country,” he said. “We hear from many of them that Yemen is really on the brink right now. The situation is extremely alarming, they are talking about that the health system has in effect collapsed.” On Thursday, a flight carrying international aid workers landed in the city of Aden, yet the country still remains desperately short of the number needed to properly manage the situation, which experts believe is far worse than being reported. Laerke warned that various essential aid programs, including ones set up for an effective coronavirus response, may have to be cut off in the coming weeks because of funding shortages. The U.N. will consequently host a virtual fundraising conference with Saudi Arabia on June 2nd. “It is very, very critical that the international community steps up now and at the pledging conference on the 2nd of June because we are heading towards a fiscal cliff,” he explained. “If we do not get the money coming in, the programs that are keeping people alive, are very much essential to fighting back against COVID, will have to close.” “And then the world will have to witness in a country what happens without a functioning health system battling COVID,” he continued. “I do not think the world wants to see that.”  Yemen has officially recorded 184 cases and 30 deaths as of Friday, but the medical charity Doctors Without Borders revealed this week that these figures are incorrect and that at least 68 have died from the virus at its Aden facility in the first half of May alone. Laerke asserted that the U.N. was “working on the assumption that there is already widespread communal transmission going on,” while its population is also at risk from other major diseases including a cholera outbreak estimated to have infected over two million people. Yemen’s healthcare system has been on the brink of collapse for several years now amid a lengthy civil war that has forced millions of people to flee their homes as refugees. The war between Saudi-backed government forces and the Iran-backed Huthis began in March 2015, when a Saudi-led military coalition intervened against insurgents began taking over the country. The war has left tens of thousands of Yemenis dead, the majority of them civilians, and the U.N. estimates around 24 million people, around 80 percent of the population, are dependent on some form of humanitarian aid.

LAS VEGAS (AP) — Add boxing to the list of sports on the comeback trail. Promoter Bob Arum said Thursday he plans to stage a card of five fights on June 9 at the MGM Grand, the first of a series of fights over the next two months at the Las Vegas hotel. A second fight card will be held two nights later, with ESPN televising both cards, kicking off twice weekly shows at the hotel in June and July. No fans will be allowed, and Arum said fighters and everyone else will be tested at least twice during fight week for the new coronavirus. The fights are pending approval of the Nevada Athletic Commission, which meets next week to consider the events, along with two cards that the UFC plans to stage at its facility in Las Vegas. They are also pending the reopening of the MGM and other Las Vegas hotels, something that is widely expected to happen the first week of June, though no dates for a second phase of easing virus restrictions have been announced by Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak. “Once we get those fights in and UFC gets its initial fights in, both of us will ask for additional dates,” Arum told The Associated Press. “The key was getting enough testing, and we’ve got plenty of testing in Nevada to hold our events.” In addition to Arum’s fights, British promoter Eddie Hearn said this week he plans to hold fights beginning sometime in July from the backyard garden of the family mansion outside London where he was raised. Hearn told The Athletic that the first fight card is tentatively set for July 15. Golden Boy promoter Oscar De La Hoya has also talked about returning with a July 4 card, though he has offered no details. UFC returned to action earlier this month with cards in Florida, including a pay-per-view event, that took place without fans. Arum declined to say who would be fighting on June 9, saying ESPN wanted to make the announcement after the fights are approved. But he said the cards would feature the same quality of fighters who were on ESPN before the shutdown of sports around the world. The cards would be expanded to three-hour shows, Arum said, and feature a main event, a co-main and three supporting fights. “These will be the same guys we were going to have before to the extent possible,” he said. “Guys like (Olympic medalist) Shakur Stevenson and others who would have been fighting on our cards.” Stevenson was set to headline a Top Rank card in March at Madison Square Garden when it was called off at the last minute because of the pandemic. Another Top Rank fighter, Ireland’s Michael Conlan, was to fight in New York on St. Patrick’s Day, but Arum said Conlan won’t be on the upcoming cards because he’s unable to travel from Ireland. Arum said fighters and cornermen will be tested when they arrive in Las Vegas the week of the fight and will be housed on a “bubble” floor at the MGM Grand. They will be allowed out only to eat at an approved restaurant in the hotel or to train at the Top Rank gym. Fighters will also be tested the night before they fight. The double tests should eliminate the issue the UFC had when a fighter tested positive and was removed from the UFC 249 card, Arum said.
“Our protocols will be much more stringent than UFC had in Florida,” Arum said. “In ours you wouldn’t have a fighter testing positive the day of the fight or the day before.” Arum credited Jim Murren, the former MGM CEO who leads a state task force dealing with the virus, with making sure there are enough tests available for fighters, judges, commissioners and anyone else involved on site. He said 60-70 people may be tested on fight day alone, using tests that can give results in a couple hours. While pre-pandemic fights were held in the 16,000-seat MGM Grand Garden, Arum said the fights will be held in a convention area or ballroom at the hotel. There will be no media allowed, at least at the beginning, he said, because of the logistical difficulty of testing more people. Arum’s Top Rank has a long-term deal with ESPN for fights that before the pandemic hit were on the main network and streaming service ESPN+. The network also combined with Fox to televise the pay-per-view of the Tyson Fury-Deontay Wilder heavyweight title card in February that was Top Rank’s last card. Arum said he talked to Fury on Thursday and that plans are underway to hold the rematch — probably somewhere outside the U.S. — late this year. He said there are also still plans for a highly anticipated lightweight title unification fight between Vasiliy Lomachenko and Teofimo Lopez by the end of the year.

The Hong Kong stock market was rocked by a massive sell-off on Friday after the Chinese Communist government in Beijing declared its intention to bypass the Hong Kong legislature and impose a draconian security law to shut down the protest movement. That single act effectively ended the island’s limited autonomy in the eyes of many residents and concerned international observers. AFP reported on Friday that real estate and financial stocks were among the hardest hit as “investors fled for the hills with many worried about Beijing’s increasing influence in the semi-autonomous finance hub and what that could mean for doing business there.” “Markets are now worried that the city’s freedoms – unseen on the mainland and protected by an agreement made before Britain handed the territory back in 1997 – could be curtailed,” AFP added. In this respect, Beijing’s proposed security laws are even worse than the notorious extradition law that sparked the Hong Kong protest movement in 2019. The extradition law made both Hong Kongers and foreign investors worry about the island’s autonomy dissolving, which would jeopardize special trading relationships established on the basis of Hong Kong’s unique position as the tolerably free, attractively appointed lobby for the grim factory of totalitarian oppression that is China.  There were also fears that the extradition law would make it easy for China to judicially kidnap foreigners by trumping up charges in China’s opaque, heavily politicized courts and using extradition to drag the victims away from Hong Kong. Both of these concerns are greatly exacerbated by the security law proposal, so foreign investors are swiftly growing nervous about sending either their money or their personnel to Hong Kong, resulting in six to nine percent drops in key property and financial stocks, while the Hang Seng index fell by four percent overall on Friday morning. The Hong Kong dollar also dropped as a result of nervous sell-offs. The silver lining in this dark financial cloud is that China has not revealed the full details of its security law or effectively imposed it through the rubber-stamp legislature in Beijing yet, and urgent international efforts are underway to persuade Beijing to back down. “Traders around the world are playing the waiting game to see details of the new Hong Kong law to gauge how severe the terms are. And more specifically, the White House response to decide whether Hong Kong’s special economic status will be affected,” Stephen Innes of AxiCorp told AFP. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday condemned China’s plan to “unilaterally and arbitrarily impose national security legislation on Hong Kong” and said China’s next move could significantly impact American policy toward Hong Kong. “Hong Kong has flourished as a bastion of liberty. The United States strongly urges Beijing to reconsider its disastrous proposal, abide by its international obligations, and respect Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy, democratic institutions, and civil liberties, which are key to preserving its special status under U.S. law,” Pompeo explained.   “Any decision impinging on Hong Kong’s autonomy and freedoms as guaranteed under the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law would inevitably impact our assessment of One Country, Two Systems and the status of the territory,” he warned. MarketWatch saw the financial shock waves from Hong Kong hitting London on Friday, slamming U.K. stocks with heavy Hong Kong exposure hard enough to produce losses as high as eight percent.  “Investors were also asking how the national security law in Hong Kong would affect U.S./China relations. The actions will stoke fears of another wave of protests in the country and cause unwanted disruption at a time when the region is trying to get back on its feet after the coronavirus crisis,” warned AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould. CNN suggested China is calculating that its deadly coronavirus pandemic may have left the international community in general, and the UK in particular, too weak to resist the Hong Kong power grab. In CNN’s view, the UK is especially unlikely to pick a massive fight over Hong Kong because it is “dependent on trade with China to boost its flagging economy” now that it no longer belongs to the European Union. CNN warned the security law “could end Hong Kong as we know it,” not only because the increased Chinese intelligence presence on the island will scare off foreign businesses, but because Hong Kong’s legal stability will be shattered by the brute-force implementation of Chinese Communist control: “Implementation of the law in Hong Kong could also prove to be a nightmare for the city’s courts — which operate separately to the Chinese legal system and free of the political pressures put on mainland judges. This does not mean the law is at much risk of being overturned, however. The NPC is the court of final appeal in Hong Kong and can issue an “interpretation” of any constitutional issue, essentially rewriting the Basic Law on the fly. But the confusion and uncertainty the new rules may create, and a potential prolonged fight in the courts, could pose a major blow to the city’s reputation for upholding the rule of law, which has long been seen as vital for Hong Kong’s position as an international finance and business hub. The South China Morning Post on Thursday predicted turbulence in the Hong Kong markets because the U.S. Congress was already mulling several regulatory actions that would damage Chinese tech companies. Analysts quoted in the piece suggested China could be planning to herd its tech giants away from foreign stock markets and back to a more tightly controlled Hong Kong, whose exchange would become a Chinese alternative to Nasdaq. CNBC noted that major changes were made to Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index this week that make it more welcoming to big Chinese companies like Alibaba while also allowing them to remain listed in the U.S. stock market. This would have the effect of slipping billions of index fund dollars into those Chinese companies, as their stocks began appearing in more investment portfolios, possibly offsetting some of the financial damage from Hong Kong losing its special trade status.

Based on new facts, I have no choice but to officially retract my earlier statement that Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-NY) should not be held responsible for any coronavirus deaths. Unfortunately, Cuomo is directly responsible for a number of coronavirus deaths. Possibly thousands. My earlier assumption was based on a sound premise: there’s nothing we can do about plagues. Like floods, tornadoes, and other natural disasters, this is the price we pay to live in the natural world. To blame a politician, or anyone, for a single death caused by a virus is obscene. Further, in the event of a plague, all we can expect from our government is to avoid triage. The government’s responsibility is to save as many lives as possible, and our government — at the local, state, and federal levels — met this responsibility admirably. Incredibly, no one in this country died due to a lack of medical care or lack of a ventilator. Everyone who could be saved was saved. What more can any reasonable person ask? Well, in the case of Andrew Cuomo, we could have asked that he not pour plague into New York’s nursing homes and assisted living centers, that he not mandate these facilities accept discharged hospital patients recovering from, and, therefore, still infectious with the coronavirus. Weeks before — literally, weeks before — the coronavirus hit New York, we knew the virus was a unique threat to the elderly. In fact, a full six weeks before Cuomo shut down New York on March 20, warnings were being posted to take special care to protect nursing homes. So Cuomo had to have known the coronavirus ravaged the elderly, not just disproportionately, but disproportionately by incredibly high and, therefore, impossible-to-ignore numbers. But Cuomo not only ignored those numbers; he went so far as to require — require — that coronavirus patients who were recovered enough to be discharged from a hospital, but still infectious, be accepted into nursing homes. According to NBC News, Cuomo authorized a “state mandate requiring nursing homes to accept those recovering from COVID-19, even if they still might be contagious.” The predictable results were catastrophic, a mini pandemic within facilities that are nothing close to equipped to handle a pandemic, which has so far resulted in 5,300 mostly unnecessary deaths. How was this devastating outcome not predictable? Well, of course, it was predictable, which is why one of the first things Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) did — we’re talking as early as March 15 — was to prohibit the return of the coronavirus hospital patients to nursing homes until they were no longer infectious. The difference in the results thus far is heartbreaking. Florida lost only 3.5 nursing home residents per 100,000, while New York lost a whopping 27 per 100,000. And that is an apples-to-apples comparison that has nothing to do with New York’s population density or mass transit. A nursing home is a nursing home. If that’s not heartbreaking enough, Cuomo signed his mandate ordering nursing homes to accept those still infectious on March 25. And to prove he knew he made a terrible error, Cuomo eventually rescinded it, but not until May 9. So for six deadly weeks, Cuomo’s order ensured plague was poured into facilities ill-equipped to handle such a thing, facilities full of the very human beings the virus was most likely to kill. For a few seconds on Wednesday, America’s useless and corrupt media, America’s fawning Cuomosexuals, actually stopped fawning to ask the governor about his deadly nursing home policy. To defend his indefensible directive, Cuomo made three absurd and easily debunked excuses. Here’s the first: Is the best use of a hospital bed to have somebody sit there for two weeks in a hospital bed when they don’t need the hospital bed … and you need that hospital bed for somebody who may die without it? The premise of Cuomo’s answer is simply not true. While there’s no question New York hospitals were hit hard, they were inundated, not overwhelmed. There was always bed space. But riddle me this… How is pouring plague into nursing homes supposed to result in the need for fewer hospital beds? Good heavens, placing infectious patients among the very population most likely to require hospital care is not freeing up beds; it is a deliberate act that ensures more hospital beds will be needed. Furthermore, let’s not forget that the USNS Comfort and its 1,000 beds arrived in New York just five days after Cuomo signed his nursing home decree. There was nothing stopping Cuomo from placing nursing home patients there; the Navy ship remained almost entirely empty the entire time it was docked in New York Harbor. Another facility that remained almost entirely empty was the field hospital built at New York’s Javits Convention Center, a 1,000-room facility that opened less than two weeks after Cuomo signed his deadly nursing home decree. The center treated fewer than 1,100 patients over its five-week lifespan, which means its 1,000 beds remained “largely empty ” and had plenty of room to accept nursing home patients. Cuomo’s second excuse, predictably, has been to blame President Trump: Why did the state do that with COVID patients in nursing homes? It’s because the state followed President Trump’s CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] guidance. This, of course, is gibberish. Cuomo wasn’t forced to do anything any more than DeSantis was. The difference is that DeSantis made the correct decision, while Cuomo made one deadly decision after another. Plus, Cuomo reversed his deadly decree without the CDC ever altering its guidelines. But let’s pretend Cuomo’s hands were tied. What we have here is a governor more than willing to defy the federal government when it comes to protecting illegal aliens but not the elderly. What we have here is a governor willing to defy the federal government to protect tax breaks for the rich but not the elderly. Cuomo’s final excuse was to blame — unbelievably — the nursing homes: For a COVID patient, a nursing home must say “I can quarantine, I can isolate, I have the right staff, I have the right PPE,” or else that nursing home should not take that patient … So any nursing home could just say, “I can’t handle a COVID person in my facility.” This is simply not true. Cuomo’s mandate not only required that nursing homes accept coronavirus patients returning from hospitalization — incredibly, Cuomo outlawed the right of the nursing home to even ask if the patient tested positive for the virus. How can you request to not accept a patient if you don’t know his status? What’s more, uncovered emails prove that New York state denied requests from nursing homes to send “suspected covid patients” to the empty Javits Center facility. “We don’t have the ability to cohort right now based on staffing and we really want to protect our other patients,” Cobble Hill Health Center CEO Donny Tuchman wrote to the state Health Department. The request was denied, even though only 134 of the Javits Center’s 1,000 beds were in use; only 62 of the 1,000 beds aboard the USNS Comfort were in use. Sadly, the New York Post reports that “Cobble Hill has led all state nursing homes in the number of residents killed by the coronavirus[.]” Cuomo is not the only governor who poured death into nursing homes. In New Jersey, where 51 out of every 100,000 nursing home resident has died of the coronavirus, the state’s Democrat governor signed an order similar to Cuomo’s that outlawed nursing homes refusing an infectious patient. Like New York, New Jersey also barred nursing homes from asking that patients be tested before accepting them. The bottom line is that thousands and thousands of people died unnecessarily because of Andrew Cuomo’s fatal mismanagement and equally fatal error of judgment. This is all on him, hence my retraction.  Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.

The Ministry of the Interior of Saudi Arabia on Friday announced a 24-hour coronavirus lockdown and nationwide curfew for the Eid al-Fitr holiday, which is scheduled for May 23 to 27 in the kingdom.  The exact date of Eid, which marks the end of Ramadan, is determined by sightings of the crescent moon. Under the rules of the lockdown, Saudi mosques will not open for Eid prayers, so Muslims were advised to pray at home. Eid is usually a highly social occasion, but the Ministry of the Interior banned gatherings of more than five people, or more than one family if the respective family members live in different houses. Penalties for violating the lockdown include steep fines beginning at about $2,600 in U.S. dollars and increasing for repeat offenses. Both organizers and attendees will be fined for social gatherings that exceed the prescribed limits. Although Saudi malls and retail stores were open during Ramada, they will be closed during the Eid lockdown. Arab News reported this week that Egypt is planning a six-day curfew during the Eid holiday and Jordan will “restrict movement of vehicles on the first day of Eid al-Fitr.”  Voice of America saw Pakistani shoppers rushing to buy food, gifts, and sweets for the traditional Eid celebration ahead of possible restrictions, while Indonesia and many other countries with large Muslim populations have joined Saudi Arabia in banning large gatherings, while generally stopping short of complete lockdowns. A notable exception is Iran, whose horrific coronavirus epidemic was concealed as much as possible by the ruling regime, and which now seems determined to proceed with large Eid gatherings provided the participants observe social distancing rules. CBS News noted the decision to lock down over Eid was made because “infections have surged back in recent weeks.” Saudi Arabia’s 42,925 confirmed cases give it the largest coronavirus outbreak in the Gulf region, alarming Saudi health officials so much that they have considered suspending the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina.

WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. (AP) — Little League is offering youth baseball organizations a pathway forward as they eye a restart amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The organization released a series of “best practices” guidelines this week that highlight how to create a safe playing environment whenever state and local authorities give youth sports in a given area the the all clear to restart. Little League canceled the 2020 Little League World Series and other championships because of the pandemic last month but remains hopeful a regular season may still be possible. Little League president Stephen Keener said during a roundtable discussion hosted by Republican Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania on Thursday that it compiled the outline after consulting with medical professionals and receiving guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, among others. While Keener stressed the decision will ultimately be made by each family, he believes it was important to show parents that playing “can be done, we think as safely as possible … if you follow these guidelines.”
The recommendations include eliminating all non-essential contact and banning the postgame handshake line in favor of lining up along the respective baselines and tipping caps to opponents. All players should wear masks while in the dugout and coaches and volunteers should wear masks and protective medical gloves at all times, the guidelines said. Players should also be separated by six feet while in the dugout or in the stands and the shared use of equipment is prohibited when possible. Umpires would move from behind home plate to behind the pitcher’s mound and game balls would be switched out every two innings. Concession sales would also be prohibited. So would ballpark staples like sunflower seeds and spitting. The recommendations also include limiting the amount of family members allowed into a facility to watch games.
Toomey said he would sign his 10-year-old son up for baseball “tomorrow” because he believes it can be done safely. “I think it is time that we begin resuming normal life,” Toomey said.
The best practices were released a week after Major League Baseball put together a 67-page proposal outlining how it could conceivably return to play this year.

The leader of Russia’s majority-Muslim Chechnya region, Ramzan Kadyrov, is in Moscow with a suspected case of the Chinese coronavirus, Russian media reported on Thursday. No government officials have confirmed the news, but Kadyrov has remained out of the public eye in recent days. The report that Kadyrov, the highest-ranking Muslim in Russia’s government, had become ill with a suspected case of Chinese coronavirus surfaced in Russian state media, suggesting it came directly from government sources. The TASS news agency did not cite government sources in its report, however, instead identifying “a source in medical circles” as the person confirming the news. “Ramzan Kadyrov has been brought to Moscow with the suspected coronavirus infection. [He] is now under medical observation,” TASS reported that the source said, clarifying that no official confirmation of the news exists, meaning neither the Chechen Republic nor Russian officials have confirmed it. “Kadyrov’s aide Ahmed Dudayev emphasized that the Chechen leader was personally observing the work of the regional anti-coronavirus crisis center,” TASS added. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) noted that Interfax and RIA-Novosti, other Russian government-linked news networks, also reported that Kadyrov was in Moscow on Thursday and “under medical supervision.” In contrast, RFE/RL noted that the Chechen government outlet Grozny TV appeared to have contradicted the reports out of the Moscow media outlets, saying “that Kadyrov was still in control.” Akhmed Dudayev, the head of Grozny TV, said on his Instagram account that Kadyrov “is personally in control of the situation, he is taking all necessary measures. The work of his headquarters is under his personal control.” Kadyrov is one of Russia’s most controversial political figures, a strongman dictator accused of perpetrating horrific human rights abuses on suspected LGBT people in Chechnya. In 2017, human rights groups sounded the alarm after Russian newspaper Novoya Gazeta reported that Kadyrov had established “concentration camps” to detain suspected gay people. A government spokesman replied that the report was not true because “if such people existed in Chechnya, law enforcement would not have to worry about them, as their own relatives would have sent them to where they could never return.” Kadyrov similarly denied the existence of LGBT Chechens in an interview that year. “We don’t have those kinds of people here,” he told HBO. “We don’t have any gays. If there are any, take them to Canada. Praise be to God. Take them far from us so we don’t have them at home. To purify our blood, if there are any here, take them.” Kadyrov claimed he was considering retirement in 2017 and has reportedly clashed with Putin behind the scenes, though he has vocally asserted loyalty to Moscow. He remains the head of Chechnya at press time. If his coronavirus infection is confirmed, Kadyrov would join a growing number of high-ranking Russian officials fighting a coronavirus infection, among them Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov, who is currently hospitalized. Peskov personally confirmed his infection to Interfax on May 12. Reports at the time noted that Peskov was last seen in public in the same room as Putin on April 30, weeks before the confirmation of his health status, so it is not yet clear if Putin was exposed to the virus. Russia has more documented Chinese coronavirus cases than any country in the world except the United States, largely due to deceptive documentation practices outside of America in places like China, where the virus originated. At press time, Russia has reported 326,488 cases of Chinese coronavirus and 3,249 deaths. Russia’s numbers may be significantly artificially deflated. Last week, Moscow officials admitted that as many as 60 percent of the city’s coronavirus deaths may not have been added to the official tally because of co-morbidities; many governments around the world count those infected with coronavirus as official coronavirus deaths even if they also suffered from other ailments. “Over 60 percent of deaths occurred from obvious alternate causes, such as vascular accidents, stage four malignant diseases, leukemia, systemic diseases linked to organ failure and other incurable deadly diseases,” Moscow’s Health Department said. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin has also estimated that the number of total cases in the city may be three times what authorities documented. Russian authorities have received significant criticism for their response, some of it from doctors complaining that they do not have sufficient protective gear and medical equipment to treat the large number of patients. Multiple doctors have mysteriously fallen out of windows after making these criticisms since the outbreak started. The head of Russia’s Coronavirus Information Center, Alexander Myasnikov, also courted controversy this week by encouraging Russians to become comfortable with the large number of deaths. “The infection will still take its toll, and we’ll all get it. Those meant to die will die. Everyone dies,” Myasnikov said in a television interview. “Even if it’s coronavirus, so what? Of course, you need to get a test to avoid infecting others, but you do understand it’s an illusion. We’ll run out of tests if everyone runs out to check after every sneeze.” Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.

Senator Lamar Alexander (R-TN) on Friday stressed the need for testing to get students back in school in the fall. Alexander said children should plan to be in school in the upcoming school year, but said proper testing and social distancing will be “key” to reopening schools, which he said is important to avoid the risk of “social, intellectual, emotional damage.” Fox News Channel’s “America’s Newsroom” host Sandra Smith asked Alexander, “Should … kids plan on going back to school this fall?” “My opinion is yes,” Alexander replied. “There are some health risks — Dr. Fauci warned against cavalierly dismissing those — but we do know that COVID has been less damaging to younger people, even though they may carry it to older people. So, I think most principals, most school boards are making plans now to go back to school in August.” He continued, “[A]ny teacher can tell you there are other risks — the risks of social, intellectual, emotional damage to a child who might lose an entire school year, and we want to avoid that.” As for safely reopening schools, Alexander said children should wear masks and continue practicing social distancing, in addition to more testing being provided by the schools. “If you find a child in a classroom who is infected, he … or she is removed from the classroom, you test all of the other kids in the classroom, and make sure the school is safe,” he advised.

Friday on Hugh Hewitt’s nationally syndicated radio show, Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) said that given the circumstances of China’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic combined with the nation’s aggressive economic practices, the United States had entered a so-called “cold war” with China. Scott touted an effort he was spearheading to require transparency regarding where products were manufactured as a measure of accountability. “Absolutely,” Scott replied when asked about “Cold War 2.” “There’s no question about it. Now they’re clearly in it. They’re in for world domination. We’ve been naïve. So we’ve got to say to ourselves, we’ve got to say to ourselves how do we take care of ourselves. Understand you have an enemy. They’re an adversary. It’s called Communist China. They’re not here to help us, all right? They didn’t. They intentionally didn’t tell us about the Coronavirus. It was intentional. It was not, you know, there was, there was nothing, oh, maybe, gosh, we didn’t do a good job.” “No, it was intentional what they did,” he continued. “You can see it was intentional. We’ve got to hold them accountable, the World Health Organization accountable. And so I’ve got a bill that says from now on, the online resellers like Amazon, you will disclose, you should be doing it anyway. Tell us where things are made so we can buy American products. Walmart, Costco, show us.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor

The climb in Coronavirus-related deaths in Mexico elevates the nation to the number 10 spot globally. Despite widespread allegations of under-counting cases and mislabeling causes of death, the country managed to bump Canada and the Netherlands in a matter of days. Some of the alarming figures come from Mexico’s daily news conference where Undersecretary of Health Hugo Lopez Gatell revealed a total of 6,510 fatalities and 59,567 confirmed cases nationwide since the pandemic started. Since Monday, Mexico added 1,333 new deaths. Al 21 de mayo de 2020 hay 59,567 casos confirmados, 12,905 confirmados activos y 33,291 sospechosos por #COVID19. Se han registrado 108,980 negativos, 6,510 defunciones confirmadas, 769 defunciones sospechosas y fueron estudiadas 201,838 personas. 1/3 pic.twitter.com/VSEKxifhr1 — Hugo López-Gatell Ramírez (@HLGatell) May 22, 2020  The number 9 global spot in fatalities is held by Iran with 7,300 deaths. Just like China, the Middle Eastern nation stands accused of suppressing true totals. The climbing death toll in Mexico comes as Lopez Gatell and staff are widely accused of downplaying the pandemic. A recent study by a Mexican NGO revealed that in Mexico City alone, officials only documented one-third of the Coronavirus-related fatalities. Lopez Gatell also admitted that some of his figures only accounted for cases in government hospitals. The discrepancy in counts pushed some states to release their own.

Hundreds of American physicians have signed onto a letter addressed to Vice President Mike Pence and the Coronavirus Task Force that urges the total reopening of the nation’s businesses and schools. The letter states that, while they value every life that has indeed been lost due to the infection caused by the Chinese coronavirus, the physicians assert the evidence that now exists indicates the lockdowns have “not been necessary to save lives but instead inflicted devastating harm on 10s of millions of people.” “We CAN treat the sick and protect the vulnerable without social and economic lockdown,” reads the letter, led by healthcare providers from the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS). The doctors bring several points to light. “This virus is survivable by greater than 99% of those infected,” they observe. “For those under 60, the estimated infection fatality rate is 0.05%. On average, the infection fatality rate is 0.2%.” In addition, about 80 percent of those infected with COVID-19 “have no symptoms or mild symptoms at most,” they continue. “We now know that a well-defined subset of the population is vulnerable to severe illness or death by COVID-19,” the doctors say, specifically noting nursing home patients, who suffer psychologically as well because they are isolated from family members. The physicians take to task the media which they accuse of “terrifying people, creating crippling fear that has drained the life out of our society.” They add that “public health officials and administrators” have also been “interfering with medical decision-making,” and specifically cite some elected officials and state boards that have “prevented the use of safe and FDA approved medications” that treat the COVID-19 infection. “Physicians are also pressured to count deaths in a way that inflates the true infection fatality rate,” the signers assert. The doctors note that “natural widespread immunity can be achieved safely without waiting for a vaccine” when otherwise healthy individuals contract the virus and immunity builds over time. The physicians stress, however, that those who are especially vulnerable to serious illness or death should be identified and protected whenever possible. Finally, they urge the task force and elected officials to avoid mass testing of citizens as a means to “create policy that restricts an individual’s livelihood and freedom to participate in society.” “[A]nd absolutely,” they add, testing “should not be used to threaten businesses and counties with repeated closure.” “We cannot accept the current dysfunction in society as the ‘new normal,’” the doctors conclude. “Our goal is to lead with hope and courage instead of fear and confusion … Our medical professionals are ready to serve this nation according to the time-honored Hippocratic Oath that calls us to serve with respect and compassion and, above all, to do no harm.” Physicians who wish to sign onto the letter may do so here at the AAPS website.

The NHL Players’ Association’s executive board is voting on a 24-team playoff proposal as the return to play format, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Thursday night because the vote was still ongoing. Results of the vote could be in as soon as Friday night. Even if the executive board votes to approve the format, it doesn’t yet seal the deal for the NHL season resuming. The league and players union still need to negotiate other details, including health and safety protocols. But the format is a substantial piece of the return to play puzzle. Under the plan proposed by the joint NHL/NHLPA Return To Play Committee, the top four teams in each of the Eastern and Western Conferences would play each other for seeding while the remaining 16 teams face off in a best-of-five series play-in round to set the final 16 to compete for the Stanley Cup. That would mean byes for Boston, Tampa Bay, Washington and Philadelphia in the East and defending champion St. Louis, Colorado, Vegas and Dallas in West. Pittsburgh, Carolina the New York Islanders and Rangers, Toronto, Columbus, Florida and Montreal would also make it in the East and Edmonton, Nashville, Vancouver, Calgary, Winnipeg, Minnesota, Arizona and Chicago in the West. “I feel like if you’re doing the 24-team thing, it basically gives a team a chance that had no chance of making it, which if you play 82 there’s maybe 6, 8% chance that the team in 12th place (in the conference) makes it,” Carolina player representative Jordan Martinook said Wednesday, more than 24 hours before the executive board meeting. “Nobody’s ever seen this before, but at the end of the day, the Stanley Cup Playoffs are 16 teams, seven games a series.” This format would lead to the traditional four rounds of seven-game series. “I don’t think there’s going to be a perfect scenario where everyone’s super excited about,” Nashville’s Ryan Johansen said earlier Thursday. “As long as everybody can agree and be happy with the decision that will be made, that’s really all that matters.” If the NHLPA’s executive board and the league’s board of governors approve the plan, the who of returning would be set. The where, when and how must still be determined, including how many cities will host games, quarantine regulations and testing. “Nothing’s really certain until it’s certain, so things can change so quickly and they have on different things,” Return to Play committee member James van Riemsdyk of the Flyers said Wednesday. “We’re trying to keep as many options open and navigate through different things and hopefully come up with a vision that obviously first and foremost is the health and safety of everyone.” Commissioner Gary Bettman this week said the league was looking at eight or nine locations to serve as hub cities for the resumption of the season. It’s unclear when the league and players will agree to begin the second phase of preparations for return, which would be the reopening of team practice facilities and voluntary workouts. The following step would then likely be a three-week training camp before games resume. “Obviously it’s an important thing to navigate through all the different issues that there are so that ultimately we can try to find a safe way to get things going here,” van Riemsdyk said. “There’s been some different talks and things like that and talking about a bunch of different things and trying to sort through some different issues.”

TEL AVIV – The Palestinian Authority has refused to accept a shipment of aid against coronavirus sent by the United Arab Emirates because the PA “doesn’t want to serve as a bridge for the normalization of ties between the UAE and Israel,” the Palestinian news agency Maan reported on Thursday. “We refused the aid from the UAE because it wasn’t coordinated through us or any of our systems,” Health Minister Mai Alkaila said at a press briefing in Bethlehem on Thursday. “We are an authority and have our sovereignty and we can’t have our sovereignty and we can’t accept such aid without coordinating with us.” A history-making flight carrying the medical supplies became the first commercial flight between Israel and the UAE. The rare Etihad airways flight was carrying 14 tons of PPE, including “10 ventilators that are acutely needed,” according to a joint statement from the UAE  and the United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process. How awful. The Palestinian Authority has rejected the UAE  shipment of #Covid_19 supplies “because the authority doesn’t want to serve as a bridge for the normalization of ties between the UAE and Israel.” https://t.co/vMeWtELCm0 pic.twitter.com/6j3fxgNiPy — Avi Kaner (@AviKaner) May 21, 2020  Palestinian media, as well as Russia Today Arabic, cited a Palestinian official as saying the PA declined to receive the aid because it was refusing to be used as a “tool for normalization” between Israel and the UAE. The two countries do not have diplomatic relations but there have been several instances of warming relations in recent years. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei described the act as a betrayal of the Palestinians. “Today, some Persian Gulf states have committed the biggest treachery against their own history and the history of the Arab world,” Khamenei tweeted. “They have betrayed #Palestine by supporting Israel. Will the nations of these states tolerate their leaders’ betrayal?” Today, some Persian Gulf states have committed the biggest treachery against their own history and the history of the Arab world.

CLAIM: Joe Biden called on Trump to shut down the country’s economy “one week earlier” to deal with coronavirus. VERDICT: FALSE. Biden did not call for an early shutdown, though he did criticize Trump’s policies on the pandemic. Former Vice President Joe Biden appeared Friday morning on The Breakfast Club, the popular radio show hosted by “Charlemagne tha God.” (Charlemagne had been ripping Biden for months for not appearing yet on his broadcast.) While much of the ensuring controversy focused on Biden’s comments on race — “If you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black” — he also made some rather outlandish claims on coronavirus. Biden cited a recent study, which was written up in the New York Times, claiming fewer people would have died from coronavirus if the country shut down one week earlier. He then claimed he had been calling for such action to be taken. “If he had listened to me, and others, and acted one week earlier to deal with this virus, there’d be 36,000 fewer people dead. Dead! Dead! And you guys are wondering, what’s he doing? Come on, man! Get a life! Get a life!” Biden said. But Biden never called for the country to be shut down. Trump delivered his Oval Office address on March 11. One week earlier, on March 4, Biden was still traveling around the country and holding campaign rallies with supporters. For example, he held a campaign rally in Detroit, Michigan, on March 9 (above) with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer — now hailed by Democrats and the media for her tough coronavirus restrictions. He campaigned in a Detroit auto plant the next day, cursing at a worker who criticized his stance on gun control. He only began canceling rallies on March 10. Biden did write an article criticizing Trump’s coronavirus policies on January 27 — one of the few times a Democratic candidate said anything about the issue before late February. He also attacked Trump’s travel ban on China on Jan. 31 as “hysterical xenophobia” — though that ban proved successful in slowing the spread of the virus to the United States. The first time any Democratic debate discussed the coronavirus was at the Feb. 25 debate in South Carolina. Biden did not call for shutting down the economy; rather, he said he would restore funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which had already been restored; and he said he would demand that China allow American experts into the country, which had also already happened. He never urged Trump to shut down the U.S. economy. Joel B.

Noise complaints by annoyed neighbors are on the rise in Japan as people forced to stay home for weeks during the country’s coronavirus lockdown grow increasingly hostile. In an extreme case, a man in Tokyo was stabbed to death by his neighbor following a noise complaint, the Japan Times reported on Wednesday. On May 4, a 38-year-old construction worker was stabbed to death by a neighbor over a noise complaint in Tokyo’s Adachi Ward. The man was killed at his parent’s apartment, which he had been visiting with his family before he was murdered. The culprit, Shizuharu Hiruta, 60, lived in the same apartment building as the victim’s parents. He was immediately arrested following the deadly attack and readily confessed to the crime, telling police he “could not stand the loud footsteps and voices.” The next day, on May 5, 80-year-old Senji Takahashi “slashed” his 62-year-old neighbor with a knife in Tokyo’s Edogawa Ward. Senji told investigators he was “annoyed” by the noise his neighbor made. On April 16, Japan’s prime minister, Abe Shinzo, declared a nationwide state of emergency, including stay-at-home orders and school closures, in an effort to curb the spread of the Chinese coronavirus. In Tokyo, the nation’s capital and most populous prefecture, the order will remain in place until May 31. On the island of Japan, limited space coupled with a high population density has long been an issue. Most people are forced to live in close quarters with one another in small apartments. In Tokyo especially, micro-living spaces are infamous. Now, confined to their often cramped homes due to the lockdown, Tokyo residents have grown increasingly sensitive to noise from neighbors. In March and April, Tokyo police received 24,245 phone calls reporting excessive noise, an increase of 28.5 percent from the previous year, the Japan Times reported. According to the report, the Japanese were already sensitive to noise prior to the pandemic, likely due in part to their living in densely packed apartments. In 2018, 15,665 noise complaints were filed, according to Japan’s Environmental Dispute Coordination Commission. This amounted to 32.9 percent of total reported disputes for the year. Between neighbors, noise complaints have been the number one source of official disputes for the past five consecutive years. In April, “corona divorce” trended across Japanese social media as couples vented their frustrations online at being forced to stay at home for extended periods with their partners, with some spouses contemplating or filing for divorce.

Researchers at Australian National University (ANU) have called for ‘climate change’ to be recorded as a cause of death on death certificates. They claim that in Australia, the rate of people dying as a result of global warming may be 50 times higher than is officially acknowledged. In a letter to The Lancet Planetary Health, researchers Arnagretta Hunter and Simon Quilty claim the impact of climate change is currently understated. National mortality records in Australia suggest substantial under-reporting of heat-related mortality. Less than 0·1% of 1·7 million deaths between 2006 and 2017 were attributed directly or indirectly to excessive natural heat. However, recent research indicates that official records underestimate the association at least 50-fold. According to the Sydney Morning Herald: Over the past 11 years in Australia, just 340 deaths have been recorded as being caused by excessive heat, but statistical analysis by two doctors with the Australian National University shows that 36,765 could have been attributed to heat. “Climate change is a killer, but we don’t acknowledge it on death certificates,” co-author Arnagretta Hunter, from the ANU Medical School, said. And: “Climate change is the single greatest health threat that we face globally even after we recover from coronavirus. “We are successfully tracking deaths from coronavirus, but we also need healthcare workers and systems to acknowledge the relationship between our health and our environment.” Dr Hunter and her co-author Dr Simon Quilty, call for death certificates to include more information about factors contributing to deaths. Climate activists around the world see the coronavirus pandemic as a crisis which they must not allow to go to waste. The timing of this letter suggests that they are learning their lessons well. They may have noted that in many countries, the medical authorities have adopted extraordinarily lax policies towards the inclusion of “Covid-19” on death certificates. In the UK, for example, as Ronan Maher has reported here and here, the Coronavirus Act (2020) includes clauses which makes it possible for doctors to put Covid-19 as a cause of death on certificates without even having seen the patient before their death — and with little independent oversight. This makes it quite possible that significant numbers of Coronavirus victims either did not have the disease – or did have the disease but only as a minor adjunct to much more serious conditions which killed them. As the authors of the letter to Lancet Planetary Health must surely be aware, including ‘climate change’ as a cause of death on death certificates is fraught with similar difficulties. As well as being easily abused by activists with an agenda, it is impossible to attribute with any certainty even extreme weather events to climate change.

The UK is set to introduce a mandatory 14-day self-quarantine for all arrivals into the country from overseas, including British citizens, with those breaking the rules facing up to £1,000 in fines. Secretary of State for the Home Department Priti Patel is expected to make the announcement during Friday’s press briefing, with the measures set to come into effect in June. Any travellers arriving into the UK — at airports, ports, or train stations — must provide Border Force with the details of where they are staying, with officials able to conduct checks on those on quarantine orders to make sure they are complying. Exemptions will include those arriving from the Republic of Ireland, as well as medics and hauliers, according to the BBC, and contrary to earlier reports, it is believed those travelling from France will also be subject to self-isolation orders. ‘We Are Guided by the Science’: British Govt Shrugs Off Responsibility For Open Borders, No Arrival Testing https://t.co/W0VUGwAHRv — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 13, 2020  The government is expected to say that the plans are to be put in place to prevent a second wave of Chinese coronavirus. However, critics of the government’s strategy have said that the UK should have locked down the country’s external borders months ago. In April, the month after lockdown restrictions were put in place, reports revealed that 100,000 travellers were still landing at British airports every week. In the three months before the lockdown, the Home Office had quarantined only 273 people out of the 18.1 million arrivals into the country. Since the outbreak, around 130 countries introduced lockdowns on their external borders as well as quarantines and screenings, with the UK being an “outlier” by imposing none. Professor Gabriel Scally, the president of epidemiology and public health at the Royal Society of Medicine, had said last month that he found it “very hard to understand why it persists in having this open borders policy. It is most peculiar.” Farage Says ‘Boris Needs to Get a Grip’ on Coronavirus and Fire Health Secretary https://t.co/HhODW0QCtX — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 22, 2020  Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage criticised the government as far back as March for forcing Britons to stay under lockdown and observe extreme social distancing while the country continued to allow international open borders to legal migration. On March 23rd, Mr Farage had said: “So we are to be locked down — and a new testing regime will begin. Will the planes keep coming from Milan, Tehran and Beijing? I expect not. It’s all too late.” “On the very same day that Lombardy was closed down, 17 flights came into the United Kingdom from Milan’s Malpensa airport…. [with] not a single person being temperature checked,” he revealed, referencing Italy, which at the time was a hotspot of contagion. Just earlier this month, Mr Farage had criticised the government for being “all over the place” on its lockdown policy after considering allowing “air bridges” for travel from countries that had got their outbreak under control. The government had previously argued that locking down airports was effectively pointless because the virus was already so widely spread around the country. To date, the UK still has the second-highest number of coronavirus fatalities in the whole world, with more than 36,000 dead. In April, Farage warned that with the government’s dithering over the screening of entrants that “in the subsequent enquiry, the word will’ be ‘negligence’.” Mr Farage has also been highly critical of government’s failure to tackle illegal migration, with the number of English Channel boat migrants surging during the lockdown, many reportedly coming from migrant camps rife with coronavirus. Farage’s reporting on the issue came to a head this week when he filmed the French navy escort a boat full of migrants into British waters to hand off to UK authorities.

Norway’s airline Norwegian Air has calmed fears of bankruptcy with new major investments, including one from a corporation linked to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Chinese company BOC Aviation bought a 12.7 per cent stake in Norwegian Airlines after converting its bond loans into 390 million shares of the company. “This could be very important. China is a special owner, the Chinese state is special and drives Chinese interests very strongly,” economic journalist Kristina Lagerström told Swedish broadcaster SVT on Wednesday. “This entire settlement that Norwegian made when trying to save the company from bankruptcy was based on the fact that those who lease the aircraft take over the company; that is the consequence of this,” she added. Other firms have also bought significant stakes in the airline including Irish aircraft leasing company Aercap which bought 15.9 per cent of the company. On Tuesday it was also announced that the airline would be receiving a loan guarantee of three billion kroner (£237 million/$290 million) from the Norwegian government with CEO Jacob Schram stating that “virtually all of the revenue stream has stopped”. Farage Warns Chinese Interests Lining up for ‘Fire Sale’ of UK Businesses https://t.co/WMCcyM7R5W — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 10, 2020  “Our goal has not only been for Norwegian to survive, but for us to come back stronger with a sustainable operation and a structure that will benefit shareholders, customers and colleagues alike,” he added. Norwegian, like many other airlines, has faced extreme financial difficulty due to travel bans enacted by many countries to stop the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus. Scandinavian airline SAS has also received a bailout from the Swedish state after the government allotted nearly half a billion euros in loans for airlines operating in Sweden’s airspace last month. In mid-March, before the height of the coronavirus outbreak in Europe, Joakim Bornold, analyst and economist at Söderberg & Partners, warned that SAS would face an existential crisis as a result of the pandemic. Air France has also looked towards a government bailout but has been told by the Macron government that it would have to cancel all domestic flights and engage in other moves to make the airline “green”.

Thursday on Fox News Channel’s “The Story,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) rejected congressional Democrats’ calls for passage of the HEROES Act, the latest measure promoted by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) to respond to the coronavirus pandemic. “Well, we know these are desperate times as a result of the pandemic,” he said. “The CARES Act, which we passed a few — a month or so ago, on a bipartisan basis, only about half of that money has gone out yet. I think there’s a high likelihood we will do another rescue package. But we need to be able to measure the impact of what we have already done, what we did right, what we did wrong, correct that. And we’re not quite ready to intelligently lay down the next step, but it’s not too far off. Let me tell you what it won’t be. It won’t be a $3 trillion left-wing wish list that passed the House that they almost — couldn’t get all the Democrats to vote for, that Senator Schumer is in favor of. That’s not going to pass the Senate. It’s not going to become law.” “We need to work smart here, help the people who are desperately in need, try to save as many jobs as possible, and begin to open up the states, which are decisions by the governors that are going on all over America now, and get this economy growing again,” McConnell added. Widely panned by Republicans as a “messaging bill,” McConnell said another drawback of that effort was it incentivized unemployment. “The problem was, by paying people more not to work than to work, it’s making it difficult to get people back to work,” he explained. “You can understand that. We do need to continue unemployment insurance. It’s extremely important at a time like this. But to pay people more not to work than to work doesn’t encourage resuming your job. And that will end in July. And we think that, in order to create jobs, we need to incentivize people to go back to work, not encourage them to stay home.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor

Thursday, during her weekly briefing, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said because voting in the United States was “under assault” from the coronavirus, it must be protected with nationwide vote-by-mail so no one is “forced” to go to a polling place and risk their health. Pelosi said, “Voting is under assault both from a systemic nationwide campaign of voter suppression and from the coronavirus. The fear of getting sick and not to go to the polls. People should not have to choose between voting and preserving their good health and that of their families. Because no matter what you do when you go out, you bring it home. Again, no one should be forced to vote for their health or their vote.” She continued, “In the HEROES Act, we added the balance of what we think we need to have voting at home and to protect the ballot. That would be $3.6 billion. A small price to pay for our democracy and the good health of Americans going to the polls. We will be there to expand vote at home, vote by mail some call it, including no-excuse absentee ballots, same-day registration, and again, having polling places available for those who want to participate in person for whatever reason.” She added, “This is about the livelihood and life of our democracy. Essential to the life of our democracy is removing obstacles of participation to voting. And now, even more so now, when voting can be a risk to your health, as we saw demonstrated in Wisconsin.” She concluded, “We don’t want anything to stand in the way of the right to vote.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

During an interview with the Hill on Thursday, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said that “there is a strong likelihood” that another coronavirus relief bill will be needed, but the administration will “step back for a few weeks” to see if more money needs to be spent, and, if so, how to spend it. Mnuchin said that the current relief package, the CARES Act, does have provisions in it to help workers, but the unemployment insurance provision needs to be fixed so that people aren’t being paid more by unemployment insurance than they were making working. He added, “We’re going to carefully review, the next few weeks. I think there is a strong likelihood we will need another bill. But we just have $3 trillion we’re pumping into the economy, and we’re going to step back for a few weeks and think very clearly how we need to spend more money and if we need to do that.” Mnuchin also stated that he hopes the next bill will be a bipartisan bill. He also said that because the House’s bill, the HEROES Act, “is a partisan bill,” it isn’t being focused on by the administration. Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

Wilson Roosevelt Jerman’s family announced his death after contracting coronavirus at the age of 91 last Saturday. Jerman was one of the longest-serving White House employees in history, having begun his tenure as a cleaner in 1957. Jerman worked with every president from Eisenhower to Obama. By the time he retired at age 83 in 2012, he had ascended to the position of White House butler. His granddaughter, Jamila Garrett, remembered him in an interview on Washington, DC, station WTTG. “My grandfather was a family-loving, genuine man,” Garrett told WTTG reporter Shawn Yancy. “He was always about service. Service to others. It didn’t matter who you were or what you did or what you needed, whatever he could provide he did.” Jerman was known to go well beyond the call of duty during his 55 years in the White House. “George Bush Jr. has a little trouble adapting to a new environment, some trouble sleeping,” she recalled. “Well, my grandfather would actually sit with him in his bedroom until he fell asleep.” Garrett also thanked former First Lady Michelle Obama for including her grandfather in her book. “You know, just considering that we aren’t able to grieve normally, physically together, that is one way that we are able to still feel connected to his success and connected to so much that he promoted around authenticity and building relationships,” she said. “He always taught us that there will always be obstacles in your life. Always. They won’t disappear. It doesn’t matter your status, it does not matter your role or what you do, there will always be obstacles. But you keep pushing forward,” she said.

The majority of Americans do not support providing taxpayer-funded federal relief to illegal aliens during the Chinese coronavirus crisis, a new survey reveals. While President Trump’s administration deposited $1,200 stimulus checks to most Americans as coronavirus relief, House Democrats passed a plan providing 11 to 22 million illegal aliens with $1,200 stimulus checks, jobs, and amnesty to remain in the U.S. The latest Pew Research Center survey finds that Americans, by a majority, do not support giving taxpayer-funded coronavirus relief to illegal aliens. In total, only about 37 percent of Americans, or less than 3-in-8, support providing illegal aliens with stimulus checks. The survey showed that no age group, by a majority, supports coronavirus relief for illegal aliens. Likewise, only 33 percent of men and 41 percent of women support such a policy. (Pew Research Center)   A wide margin of support for coronavirus relief for illegal aliens differs on whether an American was born in the U.S. or in a foreign country. For instance, about 55 percent of native-born Americans said they support stimulus checks for illegal aliens. Foreign-born, naturalized Americans supported the policy by 68 percent, a 13-point margin. Even among Democrat voters, stimulus checks for illegal aliens is not broadly popular. For example, a slim majority of about 56 percent of registered Democrats said they support coronavirus relief for illegal aliens, as well as only 14 percent of Republicans. This week, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) introduced legislation that defunds states using taxpayer money to give illegal aliens coronavirus stimulus checks, as California has done. Recent surveys find overwhelming support for a pause to all immigration. The latest Washington Post/University of Maryland poll revealed that about 65 percent of all Americans said they support suspending all immigration at the moment. An Ipsos Poll conducted last month found that nearly 8-in-10 Americans said they supported a full immigration moratorium. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Latin America, driven in large part by the situation in Brazil, has reportedly surpassed the United States and Europe in new daily novel coronavirus cases reported over the past week. On Wednesday, Reuters reported: Latin America accounted for around a third of the 91,000 cases reported earlier this week. Europe and the United States each accounted for just over 20%. A large number of those new cases came from Brazil, which recently surpassed Germany, France, and the United Kingdom to become the third-largest outbreak in the world, behind the United States and Russia. Cases in Brazil are now rising at a daily pace second only to the United States. Brazil is now reportedly the fastest growing coronavirus hotspot in the world. Despite the increase in cases, many Latin American countries, particularly the ones with the largest economies in the region (Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia), have either already begun to loosen their lockdown restrictions or will soon do so after shutting down to stem the spread of the virus. COVID-19 will likely devastate Latin America’s economy as it has the rest of the world. Coronavirus landed in Latin America on February 26 when Brazil confirmed its first case. Governments in the region have since taken an array of measures to protect their citizens and contain the spread of the virus. As of Monday, virus fatalities in Latin America had exceeded 30,000, accounting for about ten percent of all recorded deaths, Reuters noted. Meanwhile, Europe accounts for over half of the more than 329,000 COVID-19 deaths worldwide. The coronavirus deaths in the United States amount to about 30 percent of the world’s total. Many countries are only reporting COVID-19 deaths that take place inside hospitals. Reuters noted that the substantial increase in the number of cases in Latin America represents “a new phase in the virus’ spread, which initially peaked in China in February before large-scale outbreaks followed in Europe and the United States.” As of Thursday, there were over five million confirmed cases across the world.

One of Wuhan’s top virologists – known as “Bat Woman” by colleagues for her expertise on coronaviruses in bats – has kept out of the public eye amid reports this month that she had defected from China and fled to the U.S. Embassy in Paris with 1,000 pages of confidential research in hand, Japan’s Nikkei reported on Thursday. Shi Zhengli, director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology’s Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases, is an expert researcher on coronaviruses in bats and has studied the subject at her Wuhan lab for years. News of her disappearance comes amid increasing reports that the Wuhan coronavirus, which has caused a global pandemic responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths, may have originated in the Wuhan laboratory she directed. Reports surfaced in early May that Shi may have defected from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)’s regime, fleeing Wuhan for the U.S. Embassy in Paris along with her family and hundreds of pages of intelligence files. According to a May 2 article by the CCP newspaper Global Times, Shi denied the reports that she had defected. The CCP alleged that Shi issued a statement via social media saying she would never betray her country. “No matter how difficult things are, it [defecting] shall never happen,” the statement appearing on her WeChat account reportedly read. The Nikkei’s report describes Shi as “one of the people most likely to know the truth about [the Wuhan coronavirus’s] origin.” As the report points out, Shi herself has remained largely silent so far on the origin of the Wuhan coronavirus. Any statements allegedly made by Shi, such as her CCP-approved social media statement on May 2, have yet to be proven as having come directly from her. The CCP’s promotion of the social media post, in the absence of Shi offering public comments, does not necessarily mean the statement came from her, given the Communist party stands accused of silencing and punishing several Wuhan doctors who tried to share information about the novel coronavirus this year in the early months of its initial outbreak. What Shi is reported to have said upon being notified of the first cases of the novel coronavirus by Wuhan authorities in December seems most revealing. In an article about Shi and the Wuhan coronavirus originally published on March 11 by the Scientific American, Shi told the magazine she immediately suspected that the novel coronavirus cases may have emerged from her Wuhan lab and asked herself, “Could they have come from our lab?” Shi continued: I wondered if [the Wuhan municipal health authority] got it wrong,” she says. “I had never expected this kind of thing to happen in Wuhan, in central China.” Her studies had shown that the southern, subtropical provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan have the greatest risk of coronaviruses jumping to humans from animals—particularly bats, a known reservoir. If coronaviruses were the culprit, she remembers thinking, “Could they have come from our lab?” According to an editor’s note, the Scientific American article was updated since its original March publication for inclusion in the magazine’s June 2020 issue and “to address rumors that SARS-CoV-2 [Wuhan coronavirus] emerged from Shi Zhengli’s lab in China.” In the updated version, the author says she interviewed Shi after the initial lockdown of Wuhan was lifted in April. Although the stated purpose of the additional interview in April was to “address rumors” that the Wuhan coronavirus emerged from Shi’s lab, Shi still refused the opportunity to deny the reports. Instead, she is described as “distressed” at the allegations. Perhaps tellingly, Shi did say of the matter, “What we have uncovered is just the tip of an iceberg.”

Police arrested the mayor of a small town in Peru on Wednesday after he violated lockdown measures in order to go out drinking with friends, before hiding from police in a coffin reserved for victims of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. According to local police, the mayor of Tantarà, Jaime Rolando Urbina Torres, hid in a coffin and pretended to be a corpse when officers arrived to arrest him. A bizarre picture released by authorities shows him lying in an open casket with a face mask on, while his drinking buddies are said to have hidden in drawers. Torres was already facing widespread criticism from locals for being absent during the crisis and violating the rules as he pleased. Earlier this month, he was summoned to attend a public meeting where people accused him of failing to take the pandemic seriously. Warning, not graphics. This is Peruvian mayor of city of Tantarà, the moment he was found by police:alive and kicking, but pretending to be dead in a coffin he suddenly jumped into, in the attempt, to escape arrest for violating quarantine to get drunk with friends pic.twitter.com/fs7LJ73ART — Tancredi Palmeri (@tancredipalmeri) May 21, 2020  After Brazil with its population of close to 200 million, Peru has been the Latin American country most severely affected by the coronavirus, confirming a hefty 108,769 cases and 3,148 deaths, the twelfth highest number worldwide. Neighboring Ecuador has the highest number of relative cases, recording approximately 169 deaths per one million people. “There will not be a day in which the restrictions are lifted and everything is as before,” Peruvian President Martín Vizcarra asserted at a press conference yesterday. “We have to make adjustments responsibly and we will do this with the assistance of professionals and experts.” The incident in Tantará is one of the various embarrassments faced by the Peruvian government since the outbreak began. Last month, police in Cusco doused a group of American tourists with bleach as they tried to leave the country amid the beginning of a nationwide quarantine. The incident led to victims contacting their members of Congress, who forced the U.S. State Department to contact local authorities and “ensure that “health care practices comply with international standards.” Last month, nine people died in a Peruvian prison riot where inmates were demanding better sanitary conditions as protection from the pandemic. As part of the process of retaking control of the prison, authorities deployed over 200 policemen in a nearly three-hour operation. At least two prisoners, five policemen, and 60 prison guards also sustained injuries. Follow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com

President Donald Trump on Thursday announced that he would order flags to fly at half-staff to memorialize Americans lost to the coronavirus. “I will be lowering the flags on all Federal Buildings and National Monuments to half-staff over the next three days in memory of the Americans we have lost to the CoronaVirus,” Trump wrote on Twitter. The president announced his decision after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) asked Trump to mark the day when America reached the milestone of 100,000 deaths from the virus. Pelosi and Schumer wrote in a letter to President Trump: We will always carry their memory in our hearts. As we pay our respects to them, sadly, our country mourns the deaths of nearly 100,000 Americans from COVID-19. Our hearts are broken over this great loss and our prayers are with their families. Currently the number of coronavirus deaths in the United States stands at 94,591 according to data tracked by Johns Hopkins University. The president said that the flags would fly at half-staff on Memorial Day to honor Americans who died serving in the U.S. military. “On Monday, the flags will be at half-staff in honor of the men and women in our Military who have made the Ultimate Sacrifice for our Nation,” he wrote. ….On Monday, the flags will be at half-staff in honor of the men and women in our Military who have made the Ultimate Sacrifice for our Nation. — Donald J.

Just hours after Tulare County supervisors voted to open up for business despite Gov. Gavin Newsom’s lockdown orders, officials received a letter threatening to withhold some of the $47 million in federal CARES Act relief funds it had been awarded. “It is my understanding Tulare County has taken steps that are inconsistent with the Governor’s Executive Orders and the State Public Health Officer’s directives,” the letter from the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services said. “These problematic and concerning actions jeopardize public health and safety, not only within the county, but beyond, through community contact and spread,” the letter said. It went on: If Tulare County believes there is no emergency, such that it can ignore the Governor’s Executive Orders or the State Public Health Officer’s directives, the county would not be able to demonstrate that it was extraordinarily and disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. This could jeopardize its disaster fundin. The San Francisco Chronicle reported on how local officials were responding to the suffering of local businesses when they voted to reopen: “It’s become an issue of needing to get people back on their feet, back to work,” said Supervisor Dennis Townsend, who authored the county’s measure that permits virtually all businesses to reopen and halts local enforcement of the California stay-at-home directive. “By trying to protect people, we were taking away the livelihood of people.” The Visalia Times Delta reported on the rift between state and local governments: The supervisors’ 3-2 decision allows nearly all businesses to reopen that fall under Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the state’s plan. That includes dine-in restaurants, churches, barbers, gyms, movie theaters and shopping malls. As for the disaster funding, Townsend said the county has spent about $1.4 million on its COVID-19 response so far. By comparison, the CAO estimates the county will lose between $18-25 million in tax revenues with the economy shut down. On Monday, Newsom singled out Tulare and neighboring Kings counties as two of five that will remain closed under newly relaxed criteria for restarting California’s economy. He pointed to severe outbreaks at nursing homes and meatpacking plants as obstacles the bi-county region would need to overcome before its economy could progress. The Times Delta reported that Chairman Pete Vander Poel said “holding Tulare County hostage” because of nursing homes and the “corporate bad actors” who operate them for a profit is unfair because it is, after all, the state regulates those facilities. But some businesses are nervous since state officials have bullied them. The California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) closed a Corcoran bar over the weekend following a similar reopening resolution passed by Kings County supervisors Friday, the Times Delta reported. Another establishment, Downtown Rookies Visalia,  announced it would reopen with dine-in service at 50 percent capacity but reversed it decision. The bar wrote on its Facebook page: However, after speaking with ABC this morning, we must follow governor Newsom’s restrictions and ABC will not permit any sit-down dining for restaurants that have a liquor license. So, unfortunately, we are back to take out only, until this governor of ours decides to release us for business as usual. The California Board of Barbering and Cosmetology also spoke out against businesses opening. “If businesses continue to put public health and safety at risk by not following the guidance provided, and if circumstances warrant it, the Board may pursue disciplinary action against their license,” the board said in a statement. “This will not be taken lightly.” But others who live in this rural part of California agree with the plan to reopen the local economy. “I’m happy with the board’s decision; it’s a step in the right direction,” Keith Korsgaden, who partially opened up his Visalia Crawdaddy’s dining room on Wednesday, said in the Times Delta report. “A lot of people would like a big part of their social life back, gathering for lunch and dinner with each other.” Customer Asha Pratt said she was glad to finally sit down for lunch with her two daughters. “I’m happy Crawdaddy’s is open,” she said. “It’s time to open the economy.” The Chronicle reported that county leaders have no intention of changing course. “We will not be doing any type of enforcement,” Supervisor Kuyler Crocker said.

Lakers star LeBron James is not letting the coronavirus stand in the way of practice. Instead, James is holding small, private, one-on-one sessions with his teammates. The Lakers did open their facilities for the players, but it is still a no-no for the whole team to pound the boards at once. So, James is sponsoring small sessions on a closed-off, private court with one or two other teammates at a time to keep their skills sharp, according to TMZ Sports. According to The Athletic’s Shams Charania, James is enforcing safety protocols for each session, testing players for coronavirus, and is making sure social distancing rules are being enforced. “All the safety measures have been taken,” Shams says. “In these private workouts, everyone has been tested, everyone involved has practiced social distancing.” LeBron James has held safe, private on-court workouts with some Lakers teammates at a secure location, our NBA @ShamsCharania reports. More details: pic.twitter.com/P4TamkL6li — Stadium (@Stadium) May 21, 2020  Charania did not elaborate on what this “testing” entails. Meanwhile, Lakers small forward Danny Green added that the team has put in place a number of policies for players returning to the facilities. During a visit with the Load Management podcast, Green laid out what it is like to enter the facilities. “I got tested before [entering], they do the swab. They stick a Q-tip in your damn brain. Scramble it around,” Green explained. “[After you test negative] you come in the facility, you have to wear your workout gear as you come in. The shoes that you have on, you have to take off at the door. They give you flip-flops at the front. You have to sanitize your hands, sanitize your phone, keys, etc.” Green continued: “[Once you’re done in the training room] you have your time in the weight room, on the court, however it is, vice-versa. “But when you’re working with the trainer you’re not supposed to be touching. You’re supposed to be 12 feet apart. So they instruct you what to do, how to do it. You do your weights “For the players, you’re allowed to take your mask off if you can’t workout with your mask because, obviously, you can’t breathe. But the training staff, everybody, has masks on. When you get to the court they have a seat for you, where your shoes are. “You change into your basketball shoes. They you have your time that they put on the clock, like 45 minutes or so. And then, once that time is up, you have five minutes to get out.” “You don’t use the locker room,” Green concluded. “You can’t shower there.” Follow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston.

Former Democrat presidential hopeful Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) is set to introduce a bill on Thursday that would create a new federal organization to assist with elections. According to released statements, the legislation would create a “DemocracyCorps” of people who would help individuals register to vote, serve as poll workers, and assist with voter education campaigns. Booker said in a statement: The right to vote is sacred and we should make exercising that fundamental right as easy as possible.  Unfortunately, the global pandemic has placed that right in peril, and unless decisive measures are taken to provide safe voting options, many Americans may face a terrible choice this fall between protecting their health and participating in our democracy. My bill would help solve this problem. DemocracyCorps aims to cultivate and inspire a new generation of young people to strengthen our democracy by helping Americans safely exercise the franchise, just as the Freedom Summer volunteers before them. The newly founded organization would include 35,000 people who would serve two-year terms. Those individuals would be assigned to certain states based on population size, amount of elected officials, and population on Native American lands. Booker’s proposed legislation, the DemocracyCorps Act, comes amid the coronavirus pandemic that has swept the world and left Americans unsure of how to safely carry out elections. Many prominent Democrats, including former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), have called for a vote-by-mail process, which they claim would be a safer alternative to standing in lines at polls. Booker’s bill would also include broader election reforms and includes ideas from other pieces of legislation from Sens. Kamala Harris (D-CA), Ron Wyden (D-OR), and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN). The ideas derived from other pieces of legislation include expanding early voting to 20 days before a federal election, online voter registration, and allowing vote-by-mail. Several Republicans have warned that a vote-by-mail system could lead to election fraud, including President Donald Trump. Follow Kyle on Twitter @RealKyleMorris and Facebook.

Around 10,000 Iranian health workers have tested positive for the Chinese coronavirus, the regime-aligned Iranian Labour News Agency quoted the country’s deputy health minister as saying on Thursday. With health services stretched to the limit, Iran is the worst affected country in the Middle East by the worldwide pandemic, reporting around 130,000 cases and 7,250 deaths. Approximately 7.7 percent of the infected are health workers, at least 100 of whom died in the month of April. No further details of infections among health workers were provided. On Thursday, Health Minister Saeed Namaki appealed to his countrymen to refrain from traveling during the Eid al-Fitr Islamic holiday later this month to avoid another spike in the number of infections. The rules will be particularly difficult to maintain given that so many Iranians, especially the most devout, have long held the tradition of traveling to different cities to mark the end of Ramadan. “I am urging you not to travel during the Eid. Definitely, such trips mean new cases of infection. People should not travel to and from those high-risk red areas,” Namaki said. “Some 90% of the population in many areas has not yet contracted the disease. In the case of a new outbreak, it will be very difficult for me and my colleagues to control it.” A study from the Iranian parliament’s research center suggested that the real number of infections and deaths could be double the official tally, making it one of the hardest-hit countries worldwide. The National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) announced last week that by their estimates, more than 41,000 people have died, close to four times the official figure. Since late April, the Iranian regime has started relaxing some lockdown restrictions in order to prevent excessive damage to the country’s economy, which has already suffered a major contraction in recent years after President Donald Trump reimposed economic sanctions after pulling out of the Comprehensive Joint Plan of Action, otherwise known as the Iran Nuclear Deal. As well as the reopening of certain economic sectors, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has also allowed for the reopening of mosques since the beginning of May to mark the holy month of Ramadan. Children also began returning to school this week. Yet as a result of these measures, Iranian authorities recently admitted that the country is already seeing a resurgence in the number of cases. However, Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour appeared to blame the rise on a “change of attitude” among certain parts of the population. “We are witnessing a rising trend in the past three or four days, which is significant,” Kianoush Jahanpour told a televised news conference earlier this month. “[This rise] is based on our behavior, especially in the past two weeks, considering that a part of society has apparently had a change of attitude.” Follow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.

President Donald Trump said Thursday in Michigan that he would not close the country if it was hit by a second wave of the coronavirus. “We are going to put out the fires. We’re not going to close the country,” Trump said. “We can put out the fires. Whether it is an ember or a flame, we are going to put it out. But we are not closing our country.” The president spoke during a tour of a Ford factory that was manufacturing ventilators, as he continues pushing for the country to reopen after the coronavirus-fueled shutdowns. “We did the right thing, but now it is time to open it up,” he said. “A never-ending lockdown would invite a public health calamity. To protect the health of our people, we must have a functioning economy.” Earlier in the day, Trump said that some Democrat governors were not reopening their states fast enough. “You have a lot of, unfortunately in this case, Democrat governors, I think they think it’s great politics to keep it closed, but what are they doing, they’re hurting themselves, I don’t think it is good politics … they’re hurting themselves, they’re hurting their state, and it’s not good,” Trump said, and added, “You’ll break the country if you don’t.”

Actress and apparent environmental expert Rosanna Arquette claims that President Donald Trump’s administration will cause “insurmountable” destruction to human beings and wildlife. “During this pandemic the trump administration has signed off to drill for oil in the Arctic sacred refuge,” Arquette said on Thursday in a tweet that accompanied a photo of polar bear. “The evil and the destruction this will cause human beings and wildlife is insurmountable.” During this pandemic the trump administration has signed off to drill for oil in the Arctic sacred refuge  .the evil and the destruction this will cause human beings and wildlife is insurmountable pic.twitter.com/PLhfAJeqoY — Rosanna Arquette🌎✌🏼 (@RoArquette) May 21, 2020  What prompted the Pulp Fiction actor’s rant? Well, it may have been the Interior Department’s recent decision to move forward with the ConocoPhillips’ Willow project which the Trump administration says could produce some 590 million barrels of oil over the next 30 years. But Thursday was not the first time Arquette has fired off an unhinged rant about mass death and despair. In March, the Deceiver actress proclaimed that deaths in the United States from the Chinese coronavirus could have been avoided if the nation had a “real leader who cared about the American people.” Arquette also said the “deaths of innocent people” will be the legacy of the Republican Party. Hell, Rosanna Arquette says she’s disgusted with her own skin color. Last year, the Born Guilty actress apologized for being born white and said that she’s ashamed of the “privilege” that she believes her skin color brings her. “I’m sorry I was born white and privileged. It disgusts me. And I feel so much shame,” said the Poison actress in 2019. And when Arquette is not focusing on her own skin color, she is busy accusing other people of focusing on skin color. In 2019, after two separate mass shootings, the actress declared that President Trump “incites racist violence.” “The president of the United States of America incites racist violence. The end,” the White Lies actress said. You can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo, and on Instagram.

The image is striking: Fans watching a college football game in the midst of a pandemic, wearing masks with a smidge of social distance between them on row after row of bleacher seats. The photo is 102 years old. The Georgia Tech alumni Twitter feed posted a black-and-white photo of the scene at Grant Field in 1918. Decades before tailgates, prime-time kickoffs and billions in program-supporting TV money, the ethos of the die-hard college football fan was not much different than today: Risks be damned, we’re going to the game. And once fans are allowed back in stadiums, history has shown that football could come back strong. “That’s really what started the big boom of college football in the 1920s,” said Jeremy Swick, historian at the College Football Hall of Fame. “People were ready. They were back from war. They wanted to play football again. There weren’t as many restrictions about going out. You could enroll back in school pretty easily. You see a great level of talent come back into the atmosphere. There’s new money. It started to get to the roar of the Roaring ’20s and that’s when you see the stadiums arm race. Who can build the biggest and baddest stadium?”
A comeback seems a long away off even as some schools try to prepare for what many hope will be a full season this fall. For now, headlines are still dominated by discussions about what can be done safely. “I think a lot of people will hesitate to attend sporting events as spectators until there is a proven vaccine,” Georgia Tech professor of sports history Johnny Smith said. “I think there are parallels in what we can learn from 1918 in terms of how we respond to a pandemic,” Smith added. “The cities that were hesitant and didn’t impose closure orders as quickly had far more fatalities. I think the lesson we can draw in general from 1918 about how to respond to a pandemic is that closure orders and social distancing is effective.” College football back then was already trying to field teams amid the lingering effects of World War I. There were restrictions on travel, practice and number of games played. The storied Army-Navy game was canceled in 1918 and the lone postseason game was the 1919 Tournament East-West game in Pasadena, California, a game better known today as the Rose Bowl. The pandemic sickened players and coaches, shortened seasons and even forced some universities to scrap their seasons. On Oct. 13, 1918, The Washington Post carried a story that declared the epidemic “sweeping the country has dealt the death blow to necessary preparations, and with the stage still undetermined, the outlook is anything but bright.” Penn coach Bob Folwell, better known as the first coach of the New York Giants, was hospitalized with Spanish flu and missed six weeks during the 1918 season. West Virginia failed to field a team and at least one player died when he ignored a cold that morphed into the virus. The Missouri Valley Conference, which included Kansas, Kansas State and Missouri, shut down for the season. Pittsburgh and Michigan shared the national championship, though neither team played more than five games and all but one was held in November. In September 1918, the second and by far deadliest wave hit in the U.S., the final blow for teams trying to schedule a full season. The headlines that followed included “Masks for Michigan Men” (Daily Pennsylvanian, Oct. 23) and “Rough Year For Football, But Game Shows Its Mettle” (Chicago Daily Tribune, Oct. 21). “A lot of them closed up camp, especially once the second wave hit,” Swick said.
The pandemic killed more than 50 million people worldwide, including 675,000 in the United States. Even with lower numbers in 2020, Smith said, fans will still be cautious. “I think generally people are going to be more hesitant to return to stadiums today,” Smith said. “I think there will be a certain segment of the population that is more concerned about a second wave. That’s another lesson to keep in mind from 1918.” And if fans are allowed, what rules will be in place? The bleak question looms large should campuses open to students in the fall: Is it safe to pack fans inside The Swamp or The ’Shoe if the pandemic is still on?
“I think when we look back on this idea of people wearing masks to attend a football game and raise the question today, would people do that? I’m not sure that people would,” Smith said. College football commissioners in mid-April insisted sports cannot be played this fall if campuses are not open, a stance echoed by NCAA President Mark Emmert. Still, schools are working hard to find ways to play, and there are encouraging signs even if campuses are not fully open in the traditional sense. Much more is at stake from a century ago: TV money, bowl games, conference championships, cross-country travel all need to be sorted out. In 1918, there were no more than 90 college football teams. There are 130 major college football teams alone in 2020, spread across 41 states and competing in 10 conferences, save for a handful of independents. To play or not to play is still the essential dilemma a century later but football — and sports — will return at some point, as it did in 1919. The Ogden Standard noted after the sport’s yearlong break in the state it was “anxiously awaiting the rustle of the cleated shoes, the line plunges of victory and the return of the greatest of all college sports.” “People really wanted to get back to their lives,” Smith said. “Sports is all about the human experience, human connection. We’re not meant to isolated. That’s a frustration a lot of people have in 1918 and today. I think people not being able to attend sporting events is symbolic of a larger sense of loss in America.”

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a document only dated “May:” new guidelines for reopening the American economy in the wake of the coronavirus. CNBC reported that the federal agency has not held a coronavirus briefing for more than two months.  The CDC guidance suggests using a three-phase re-opening strategy. “This document briefly summarizes CDC’s initiatives, activities, and tools in support of the Whole-of-Government response to COVID-19,” the 60-page document stated: The plan for reopening America outlines a three-phased approach for reducing community mitigation measures while protecting vulnerable populations. The phased approach can be implemented statewide or community-by-community at governors’ discretion. The guidelines propose the use of six “gating” indicator to assess when to move through from one mitigation phase to another. Those “gating” indicators include decreases in new coronavirus cases, decreases in emergency department visits for coronavirus or COVID-like illnesses, decreases in emergency room influenza-like illnesses; decrease in percentage of SARs-CoV-2 positive tests, “treat all patients without crisis care,” and a “robust testing program.” Under the “Guidance on Infection Control and Contact” heading the CDC names “focus areas” as long-term care facilities, assisted living facilities, dialysis facilities, dental facilities, ambulatory care facilities, pharmacies, emergency medical services, food processing facilities, and correctional facilities and businesses, including links to the specific guidance for each. It also provides links to CDC guidance on protecting “critical infrastructure workers.” The guidance includes specific instructions for reopening day care centers, schools, and day camps, “employers with workers at high risk,” restaurants and bars, and mass transit administrators. Here is a sampling of the CDC guidance: President Donald Trump released a 18-page “Opening Up America Again” document last month. Follow Penny Starr on Twitter

Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) warned of Democrats’ political exploitation of the coronavirus outbreak as a pretext to nationally implement all-mail voting and ballot harvesting, offering his remarks on Thursday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow. Marlow recalled Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez’s claim that President Donald Trump’s opposition to nationwide vote-by-mail proposals is is an attempt to “steal the election.” Perez’s statement amounts to “Democratic hysterics over at the DNC,” replied Cotton. Cotton said, “There have been lots of false predictions about this virus, and especially about the policy responses to it now for two months. Do you remember in early April there was demand that Wisconsin cancel its primary or go to all-mail voting? That didn’t happen. Their predictions that tens of thousands of people were going to die from standing in line at voting places. That obviously hasn’t happened. To my knowledge, there’s been no evidence linking that primary election in Wisconsin to any surge in cases.” Cotton continued, “States ought to be able to conduct the elections as they see fit. We ought not allow the Democratic Party to use this pandemic at the time to fulfill their wish list of same-day registration, of all-mail voting, [and] of ballot harvesting that creates the kind of fraud that we’ve seen in places like California and North Carolina. We have to protect the integrity of our elections, especially in the middle of a pandemic.” LISTEN:  Democrats regularly call for vote-by-mail and ballot-harvesting as necessary measures above and beyond social distancing and the wearing of masks to ensure safe elections during the coronavirus outbreak.

A man in Singapore has been sentenced to death via a Zoom call, as the country remains on lockdown because of the coronavirus. The judge sentenced Punithan Genasan, 37, on Friday for his role in spearheading a 2011 drug deal that involved a heroin transaction. Its the second known case where a death sentence was delivered remotely because of the coronavirus pandemic. “For the safety of all involved in the proceedings, the hearing for Public Prosecutor v. Punithan A/L Genasan was conducted by video-conferencing,” a spokesperson for Singapore’s Supreme Court told Reuters. The vast majority of court hearings in Singapore, however, have been postponed until at least June 1 because of government shutdowns due to the coronavirus. Genasan’s lawyer, Peter Fernando, said his client is thinking about appealing the ruling. Singapore has a strict policy on the use of illicit drugs and uses capital punishment to deal with drug-related offenses. In 2013, 18 people were executed — the highest amount in two decades, according to Amnesty International. Of those executed, 11 were charged with drug-related offenses, BBC News reported. Singapore imposed a partial lockdown in early April after a second wave of coronavirus cases caused by foreign workers living in crowded conditions. The government plans to reopen beginning next month gradually. The city-state recorded 29,812 confirmed cases of the virus, with 24 deaths as of Thursday.

Karl Manke, a 77-year-old barber in Owosso, Michigan, has defeated Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Attorney General Dana Nessel in court for the second time in about a week. The Argus-Press reported: Judge Matthew Stewart ruled that Karl Manke will not have to close his shop after the state again failed to prove he was an imminent danger to public health. Stewart said the state did not arrest Manke when he was cited, so he didn’t represent “an imminent health danger.” “(The attorney general) has not presented any studies underlying the doctor’s conclusion. (The attorney general) has not shown any nexus between the cutting of hair and an increased risk of transmission,” Stewart wrote, the Detroit Free Press reported. “(The attorney general’s) filings rest more on general facts about COVID-19 than specific practices or conditions at (Manke’s) business.” Nessel’s office said she would appeal the ruling. The Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs suspended Manke’s license without a hearing. “It’s an unbelievable abuse of power,” attorney David Kallman told radio host Steve Gruber, stating there is no legal basis for the action. “This is pure retribution by the governor’s office and by the AG. This is so petty and vindictive, it’s beyond the pale,” Kallman said. After her defeat, Nessel attacked Manke publicly. We want him to discontinue his conduct, which we think is aiding and abetting the spread of the virus,” Nessel claimed. “Mr. Manke,” she sighed, “He’s not a hero, he’s not a patriot. A patriot is a person that fights all enemies, foreign and domestic, and does everything possible to protect his fellow countrymen and countrywomen.” “To me, Mr. Manke is doing just the opposite of that and he’s being selfish in his behavior,” the attorney general declared.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-NY) on Wednesday attempted to shift blame for his state’s nursing home coronavirus deaths on to President Trump, saying he was merely following guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Cuomo has received harsh criticism for a now-reversed March 25 directive regarding nursing homes, which reads: “No resident [of a nursing home] shall be denied re-admission or admission to the NH [nursing home] solely based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19. NHs are prohibited from requiring a hospitalized resident who is determined medically stable to be tested for COVID-19 prior to admission or readmission.” This week, Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) called for a federal investigation into Cuomo and his administration over the handling of this nursing home policy. As of Tuesday, over 5,800 nursing home and adult care facility residents have died from the illness.  A partial transcript is as follows:  REPORTER #1: There is a call for a federal probe into how the state handled the nursing home situation, specifically the March executive order allowing COVID-positive patients back into the nursing homes. In reflecting on those comments, I was wondering why was that executive order made at the time? GOV. ANDREW CUOMO: Look, this is a political season, I get it. I have refrained from politics. I’m not going to get into the political back and forth, but anyone who wants to ask why did the state do that with COVID patients and nursing home, it’s because the state followed President Trump’s CDC guidance. So they should ask President Trump. I think that will stop the conversation. QUESTION: Are you fudging the numbers? Because that’s the accusation that you’re facing, that you are changing the numbers to make— GOV. CUOMO: —Let’s do one at a time. Your first point, why did the state do that? Because the state followed president Trump’s CDC guidance, okay? That’s that answer. No numbers were changed. REPORTER #2: But governor, you’ve shown a willingness to thwart president Trump at other times. Why on that March 25th memo did you not thwart him? Why did you follow CDC guidance? And do you regret that? GOV. CUOMO: No, not at all. REPORTER #2: I mean, considering the death toll? GOV. CUOMO: Well, you have to remember the facts. I know you’re the New York Times, but facts are still facts, right? Even at the Times, okay? Here are the facts. The CDC guidance said a nursing home cannot discriminate against the COVID patient because, at that time, the issue was hospital capacity, right? Remember the hospital capacity? And we were dramatically increasing hospital capacity. If a person doesn’t need an urgent care bed in a hospital because they are not urgently ill and they have—it can take two weeks to test negative when you’re no longer urgently ill, is the best use of a hospital bed to have somebody sit there for two weeks in a hospital bed when they don’t need the hospital bed because they are not urgently ill, they’re just waiting to test negative on the antibody test, which can take two weeks, and you need that hospital bed for somebody, who may die without it. The second fact, a nursing home cannot accept a patient who they are not qualified to handle. For a COVID patient, a nursing home must say “I can quarantine, I can isolate, I have the right staff, I have the right PPE,” or else that nursing home should not take that patient and, the third point, we always had alternative beds. Any nursing home that says “I can’t take that COVID patient,” for whatever reason, I don’t even care what the reason is, “I don’t have the staff, I don’t have the time, I’m overstressed, I don’t have the PPE,” we always have alternative beds. We have had alternative beds all throughout this. We never got to a place where we were bumping up against the capacity. So any nursing home could just say, “I can’t handle a COVID person in my facility.”

The nation’s capital may begin a phased reopening on May 29, more than a week earlier than anticipated, after shutting down to get a handle on the novel coronavirus pandemic, Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) announced on Thursday, citing a low transmission rate and a decline in community spread. On May 13, Bowser extended the district’s stay-at-home measure to June 8, noting that she could “revise this order at any time.” However, the outbreak of COVID-19, the coronavirus illness, appears to be on a downward trajectory in D.C., allowing officials to consider beginning a phased reopening on May 29, “barring any new peaks” in community spread and the transmission rate, Bowser said during a press conference. Thank you to all who contributed their time and recommendations to the ReOpen DC Advisory Committee. ReOpen DC brings us all together to reopen with a plan based on science and tailored to the needs of our community. To read the full presentation visit https://t.co/Jmt2AtJ6Cm. https://t.co/akwkYaqpGy — Mayor Muriel Bowser #StayHomeDC (@MayorBowser) May 21, 2020  “It is not an on and off switch. We will not be able to go back to life as we enjoyed it in February,” she noted. “But we are incrementally adding activities back in our lives, which we all miss and are all eager to get back to. Staying open and being able to manage this virus means we all have to do our part.” She urged D.C. residents to continue taking measures to prevent the spread of the virus, such as wearing masks, social distancing, practicing good hygiene, and getting tested if necessary. “Reopening means that more people will be mixing, more activities will be opening, and there will be more infections in the city,” Bowser warned. The mayor reported “11 days of a sustained decline in community spread,” adding that the transmission rate is now at “nine days below one.” According to the D.C. reopening guidelines, there must be a 14-day decrease in community spread, and the transmission rate must be below one for three days to reopen. “We’re also very focused on our testing capacity, and presently we have the ability to test all of our four priority groups,” Bowser said, later adding, “We are close to where we need to be with contact tracing to be able to meet the goals laid out by the [D.C.] Department of Health.” Health experts consider the number of hospitalizations to be an essential measure of the severity of the ongoing outbreak. According to the district’s data, the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations has declined in recent weeks. D.C. has hundreds of available beds to deal with the ongoing pandemic and a possible increase in cases. As of Thursday afternoon, data compiled by the Harvard Global Health Institute placed the hospital bed occupancy rate at 0.72 and the Intensive Care Unit occupancy rate at 0.6. The nation’s capital continues to see an increase in the cumulative number of cases and deaths. Over 41,750 people have tested positive for COVID-19, and 412 others have reportedly perished from the virus in D.C.

Victoria’s Secret will permanently close around 250 stores in the U.S. and Canada in 2020, parent company L Brands announced Wednesday. The company made the announcement Wednesday in their first-quarter fiscal report. The parent company L Brands has said it plans to spin-off Bath & Body Works and operate Victoria’s Secret as a standalone business. L Brands was founded in 1963 by Leslie H. Wexner in Columbus, Ohio. Wexner was the only known client of disgraced money manager Jeffrey Epstein, who was found dead in a New York jail cell in 2019. The company has been hard hit by the economic turmoil of the coronavirus. Nearly all of its stores in the U.S. closed in March and those that will reopen are not expected to open until July. L Brands said its overall sales for the three months ended May 2 fell 37 percent compared with a year ago. Gross profit fell 59 percent. The company lost $275.2 million in the quarter, compared with net income of $40.3 a year ago. Profits per share were down 807 percent for a loss of 99 cents per share.

President Donald Trump expressed his interest at the White House on Thursday in getting more churches reopened despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. He blamed Democrat governors for keeping churches closed. “The churches are not being treated with respect by a lot of the Democrat governors,” Trump commented to reporters as he left the White House for a trip to Michigan on Thursday afternoon. “I want to get our churches open, and we’re going to take a very strong position on that very soon,” he added. When reporters asked him if he would include mosques in his effort, he said he would. Recent reports revealed that the White House disputed proposed Centers for Disease Control guidelines prepared for the reopening of churches, delaying their release. A Trump administration official told CNBC that the White House wanted a more federal approach to the guidelines. The White House reaffirmed the president’s interest in getting churches reopened. “Not only is it good for the community; it’s their right under the Constitution to worship freely without government intrusion,” White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere said to CNBC. “The Trump Administration will always protect that right and continue to partner with states to ensure congregations are properly protected as restrictions are responsibly eased.”

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) on Wednesday opted to withdraw the harsh emergency rule his administration filed last Friday, which criminalized business owners violating his stay-at-home order. The emergency rule had noncompliant businesses facing a Class A misdemeanor for reopening against the governor’s orders — an action that could have carried jail time or a fine of up to $2,500. A Pritzker spokesperson, at the time, described the rule as an “additional enforcement tool for businesses that refuse to comply with the most critical aspects of the stay-at-home order.” The governor faced a slew of backlash and, while he has continued to defend the sentiment of the rule — praising it for giving “more flexibility” in the enforcement of his orders —  he is urging the legislature to come up with a measure “with the same intended mechanism in a phased manner in line with the Restore Illinois plan.” “Enacting this measure through legislation will allow us to have these tools throughout the Restore Illinois plan versus an emergency rule that would be withdrawn and rewritten at the start of phase three and then phase four,” Pritzker explained. It quickly became clear that Pritzker’s emergency rule lacked teeth, as his administration’s general counsel, Ann Spillane, admitted that “nobody’s getting arrested or handcuffed.” “But they are getting a citation where they would have to go to court,” Spillane stated. Additionally, the Illinois State Police released a statement, clarifying that the department would not “issue any criminal misdemeanors to individuals for violations of temporary emergency rules or executive orders.” “The Illinois State Police will only apply those emergency rules to entities such as corporations, LLPs or other business entities consistent with state and constitutional law,” the department stated, stressing that officers would not arrest an individual for violating the governor’s executive orders or emergency rules. “We encourage all citizens to continue to do their part to maintain public health as we move forward in the days ahead with Reopening Illinois,” the department added. Republican state Rep. Steven Reick, who serves on the Joint Commission on Administrative Rules (JCAR), said his office received a surge of feedback from residents, expressing resistance to Pritzker’s rule. “He’s got executive authority to issue his orders, but the fact is that if he really wants the public support he needs to bring the General Assembly into this process so that we can exercise our right to represent our constituents,” Reick said, according to the Center Square. Another Republican lawmaker, state Sen. Dave Syverson, described the withdrawal of the rule as a “big win.” “The idea of criminally charging small business owners for trying to stay open to support their families was something the Senate Republicans strongly opposed,” he said. “This was a big win on our first day back in Springfield,” he continued. “I am glad that, with the help of a large public outcry, we were able to defeat this rule change.” Other Democrat governors have struggled in enforcing their severe lockdown measures, losing the battles in the courts — like in Wisconsin — and among local authorities. A handful of district attorneys in Pennsylvania, for instance, have stated that they will not prosecute businesses reopening against Gov. Tom Wolf’s (D) orders — a decision that even Wolf admitted he would not challenge.

Thursday on Fox Business Network’s “Cavuto,” Job Creators Network CEO Alfredo Ortiz discussed his organization’s full-page ad in The Wall Street Journal that calls for a “second opinion” to Dr. Anthony Fauci’s on the coronavirus shutdown. Ortiz said, “At the end of the day, it is not about the economy versus life but life versus life. Some of the folks insisting continuing shutdown would be on some phone calls I’m getting directly from small business owners across the country, friends of mine who have been in business for decades who are strong supporters of the community in tears because overnight, effectively they have seen their entire life savings and life dreams just up in smoke because of something the government drove, which is a government shutdown. This is not about economy versus life. It is about life versus life. This is real-life people being impacted on a grand scale. We saw jobless claims today, Neil. Look at numbers. We’re talking almost 30 million jobless claims right now, 15% unemployment.” He continued, “That’s why we took the full-page ad out in The Wall Street Journal about today asking Dr. Fauci for a second opinion because this is real. He brought up some good points, but we do need the second opinion because we needed indicated decisions to be able to make these really, what I’m calling massive decisions whether to open, whether to close.” He added, “That is all I think we’re saying being respectful here. Dr. Fauci is it great American. He’s done fantastic things for our country. All we are asking for is a second opinion, so we make educated decisions as Americans.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Thursday on MSNBC’s “Andrea Mitchell Reports,” Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said to be a model for the American people President Donald Trump should be wearing a face mask amid the coronavirus pandemic because “real men wear face masks.” Mitchell asked, “The president is now leaving for Michigan. He’s going into a state that requires wearing a face covering. He hasn’t said yet, as far as I know, whether he is going to wear a mask. He has not been seen wearing one, and he’s also, as you know, done things that go against CDC guidelines and against FDA warnings in taking a risky medication. Mayor Garcetti, what should the president do in terms of the way he models behavior for the rest of the country?” Garcetti said, “Simply put, he’s our commander-in-chief. I say real men wear face masks when they’re going to be with other people in public. It’s our gateway to increasing freedom and more economic activity and greater opening up. I think modeling that is something so important for all of our leaders, and any men who don’t want to wear face masks got to get over ourselves and just do it.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Demand for drive-in movie theaters is surging in several states, as more people seek out entertainment from the comfort of their vehicles in the wake of the deadly Chinese coronavirus. What may be a mixture of coronavirus concerns and an appetite for nostalgia has caused pop-up drive-in movie theaters to appear in several states, including, Texas, New Jersey, Wisconsin, Georgia, New York and more. “It’s been like when you have a big summer movie like Avengers or something like that come out, except that right now we’re playing movies that you can see at home,” said Andrew Thomas, the owner of Showboat drive-in theater in Houston, Texas, of his businesses’ recent “off the charts” popularity, according to a report by Houston Chronicle.

(Stephanie Keith/Getty Images) The report added that Showboat was the Houston area’s only drive-in movie theater — until recently. A similar situation is unfolding in New Jersey, as drive-in movie theaters are popping up across the state, according to a report by NJ.com. New Jersey’s Berkeley Township, Brick Township, Jackson Township, Hillsdale, Northvale, Sayreville, and Vineland all have new pop-up drive-ins available, following the state’s governor Phil Murphy approving the initiative. Even Nantucket residents will have the nostalgic opportunity available to them, as the Dreamland Film & Cultural Center is the final steps of securing a location for a drive-in theater on the island in Massachusetts, according to a report by the Inquirer and Mirror.

(KARIM SAHIB/AFP via Getty Images) In Franklin, Wisconsin — just outside of Milwaukee — a new drive-in theater called Milky Way Drive-In is set to open on Friday, according to a report by Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Meanwhile, in Madison, Wisconsin, The Mallards celebrated opening night of the new drive-in theater at Warner Park with 100 cars parked in the outfield, reports 15 WMTV. And in Atlanta, Georgia, residents are also enjoying the drive-in theater experience after the city’s Plaza Theater — Atlanta’s oldest operating cinema — has reopened as a temporarily transformed drive-in theater, according to Eater Atlanta. The report added that the new drive-in movie theater includes food delivered from local Atlanta restaurants. Moreover, two new drive-in movie theaters are coming to Miami, Florida, this week. The first of the two drive-ins will be on May 22 at the Dezerland theme park in North Miami, with the second set to open up on May 24 in Miami Beach at the parking lot on Collins Avenue and 46th Street.

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is giving $5 million to Andrew Yang’s universal basic income group called Humanity Forward. The donation to Humanity Forward comes as the CEO is looking to give away $1 billion of his wealth from his other company, Square, to his fund called Start Small, as a way to combat the coronavirus. Dorsey announced the donation on Yang’s podcast Yang Speaks. On the podcast, Dorsey told Yang that a universal basic income (UBI) was “long overdue,” and “the only way we can change policy is by experimenting and showing case studies of why this works.” Yang says Humanity Forward plans to distribute Dorsey’s gift in the form of cash grants totaling $250 a piece to nearly 20,000 people who have lost their jobs or have suffered economically as a result of the coronavirus. Humanity Forward has already given away $2 million in direct cash assistance to help people suffering from the coronavirus crisis. “Not only will Jack’s donation directly impact tens of thousands of people in need during the current economic downturn, it will help Humanity Forward and our movement continue to make a case for universal basic income in the United States,” Yang said in a statement. “We know UBI for every American is possible, and this $5 million from Start Small is going to help demonstrate what is possible for families across the country,” the statement continued. As a presidential candidate, Yang made having a universal basic income the centerpiece of his campaign platform, claiming it would improve everything from health care to graduation rates. Yang’s message helped him gain a following among Dorsey, Tesla founder Elon Musk, and other tech entrepreneurs, but he exited the race after some disappointing results in Iowa and New Hampshire.

Appearing Thursday on CNN’s New Day, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel (D) urged President Donald Trump to wear a face mask during his tour of a Ford manufacturing plant, suggesting that he could be banned from unclosed facilities in the state if he opts against wearing one. I joined @CNN this morning to discuss President Trump's visit to the Ypsilanti Ford plant today and my letter that asks he adheres to safety guidelines and wear a mask during his visit.pic.twitter.com/A8rWGgeLnE — Dana Nessel (@dananessel) May 21, 2020  A partial transcript is as follows:  ALISYN CAMEROTA: You felt so strongly about this that you wrote a letter to the White House asking the president to wear a mask. Why did you think that was necessary? DANA NESSEL: Obviously, here in Michigan, we’ve been particularly hard hit by the COVID-19 crisis. We’ve lost over 5,000 of our state residents and we have well over 50,000 infections. Our auto manufacturing facilities just went back online on Monday, but there was a carefully negotiated agreement that became law between the auto manufacturers and the UAW. There are a number of requirements in place — one, that there not be any visits by outsiders to the plants anyway, but we’re waiving that — but also that there be six-foot distancing between people in the plant, people be properly screened before they enter, and lately, that they wear a facial covering in order to protect themselves and in order to protect the workers. We are just asking that President Trump comply with the law of our state — just like we would make the same request of anyone else in those plants. CAMEROTA: You also point out that President Trump has been exposed. His personal valet tested positive, so you write in your letter: “Anyone who has potentially been exposed, including the President of the United States, has not only a legal responsibility, but also a social and moral to take reasonable precautions to prevent further spread of the virus.” In terms of the legal responsibility, you’re the chief law enforcement officer for your state, so what if he doesn’t wear a mask? NESSEL: Obviously, we’re asking that he do that. For most people, of course, legally they can be held accountable… if he fails to wear a mask, he’s going to be asked not to return to any unclosed facilities inside our state. I know that Ford has asked him to do the same thing. But if we know that he’s coming to our state and we know he’s not going to follow the law, I think we’re gonna have to take action against any company or any facility that allows him inside those facilities and puts our workers at risk. We just simply can’t afford it here in our state… If President Trump doesn’t care about his own health, doesn’t care about the health and the safety of people who work in those facilities, at least care about the economic situation of costing these facilities so much money by having to close down and having to disinfect the plant after he leaves.

Pennsylvania cannot fully return to normal until a “foolproof” vaccine is available, Gov. Tom Wolf (D) said on Wednesday. When asked if the return of large events are contingent on a vaccination, Wolf said Pennsylvanians need to be confident that the novel coronavirus is under control and treatable. He said he believes it will take a vaccine or “some assurance that they’re not going to get sick” to attend big events, go shopping, and return to school. “Ultimately I think what it’s going to take for everybody to feel safe going to a Penn State game or a basketball game is that they have some confidence that they’re not going to get sick by being in close contact with somebody else,” Wolf said, noting that the state is focusing on testing and contact tracing. “I think that’s what it’s going to take to really get our economy back to normal, and I really think that can’t happen fully, 100 percent until we have a vaccine that is foolproof,” Wolf said. “That’s my own stance.” Two other Democrat governors have also hinged their hopes of future normalcy on the development and availability of a vaccine. “Until a proven vaccine is widely available, we cannot firmly enter the ‘new normal,’ when life will once again return to all our workplaces, downtowns, and main streets,” New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D) stated bluntly on Monday: Until a proven vaccine is widely available, we cannot firmly enter the “new normal,” when life will once again return to all our workplaces, downtowns, and main streets. Posted by Governor Phil Murphy on Monday, May 18, 2020 California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) also said the Golden State would not be “going back to normal” until a vaccine is available. “We’re not going back to normal,” the governor said at a press briefing this month. “It’s a new normal with adaptations and modifications, until we get to immunity and a vaccine.” While their dependence on the development of a vaccine remains prevalent, there is no guarantee that one will come — at least in a timely manner. No other vaccine for other coronavirus forms has ever been approved. President Trump has remained positive about the development of a vaccination, noting the “staggeringly good” test results of the coronavirus vaccine from Moderna. Trump also said this month that he is already involved in the process of mobilizing the military to distribute the vaccine as soon as it is developed, adding that “at the end of the year, we’re going to be able to give it to a lot of people very, very rapidly.” “Unless you’re mobilized and ready, you’re not going to be able to do it for a long time. So we’re starting now,” he added. Regardless, though, President Trump said the country is moving forward. “I just want to make something clear,” the president said during a press conference in the Rose Garden last week. “It’s very important, vaccine or no vaccine, we’re back.”

A recent report from researchers at Carnegie Mellon University claims that nearly half of the Twitter accounts tweeting about the Chinese virus are likely bots. NPR reports that a recent study by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University claims that it is likely that half of the Twitter accounts discussing the Wuhan coronavirus are bots, the common name for automated accounts that interact with and attempt to mimic normal human users. Researchers examined more than 200 million tweets discussing the virus since January and found that about 45 percent were sent by accounts that act more like an automated program than humans. The researchers stated that it is too early to determine who is controlling the bot accounts but that tweets from the accounts appeared to be aiming to sow division amongst Americans. Kathleen Carley, a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University who is one of the authors of a study analyzing bot-generated coronavirus activity on Twitter, stated: “We do know that it looks like it’s a propaganda machine, and it definitely matches the Russian and Chinese playbooks, but it would take a tremendous amount of resources to substantiate that.” Researchers identified over 100 false narratives about the virus being pushed by bots across Twitter, including theories that hospitals were filled with mannequins or that 5G cell signal towers were the source of the virus. “We’re seeing up to two times as much bot activity as we’d predicted based on previous natural disasters, crises and elections,” Carley said. Researchers flagged accounts that tweet more than is humanly possible or claim to be in multiple countries within a few hours period as possible bots. “When we see a whole bunch of tweets at the same time or back to back, it’s like they’re timed,” Carley said. “We also look for use of the same exact hashtag, or messaging that appears to be copied and pasted from one bot to the next.” Breitbart News reported this week that the Chinese government has launched a massive Twitter information campaign, more than doubling the number of official government tweets since January and in recent days attempting to spread a conspiracy theory that the Wuhan coronavirus came from a U.S. government lab. On May 8, the spokesperson for China’s Foreign Affairs Ministry posted a sweet that has been liked more than 4,000 times which reads: “The #US keeps calling for transparency & investigation. Why not open up Fort Detrick & other bio-labs for international review? Why not invite #WHO & int’l experts to the US to look into #COVI19 source & response?” Chinese accounts have published more than 90,000 tweets since the beginning of April from 200 diplomatic and state-run media accounts in a massive Wuhan coronavirus information war according to a study of data collected by the Hamilton 2.0 dashboard of the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a tool aggregating accounts connected to the Chinese government. Analysis by Bret Schafer, the digital disinformation fellow at the alliance, based in Washington, D.C., found that Twitter output from China’s official sites has almost doubled since January and the number of diplomatic Twitter accounts has tripled to 135 from 40 accounts at this time las year. Schafer stated that the Chinese accounts “have become more aggressive, more conspiratorial, and the ones who have done that are their most popular accounts and have by far the most engagement.” Schafer said that the Twitter account for the Chinese Embassy in France “has significantly more followers than the embassy in Poland, for example, because the embassy in France has been a driver of the most aggressive content.” Read more at Breitbart News here.

Alec Baldwin made clear what he thinks about America, launching a fake news filled rant attacking Americans who’ve spent years praising the country’s greatness. The Left-wing actor also blamed President Donald Trump for those killed by the Chinese coronavirus. Baldwin called Trump a “maniac” responsible for overseeing “one of the worst [coronavirus] responses in the world.” “Americans have spent decades telling the world how great we [are],” the Boss Baby star said. “Actually, we don’t shut up about it. And yet we have more deaths from this crisis than anywhere. We have had [one] of the worst responses in the world. Trump didn’t cause the virus, but he spread it. Trump is a maniac.” Americans have spent decades telling the world how great we r. Actually, we don’t shut up about it.And yet we have more deaths from this crisis than anywhere. We have had 1 of the worst responses in the world. Trump didn’t cause the virus, but he spread it.Trump is a maniac. — HABFoundation (@ABFalecbaldwin) May 21, 2020  America has recorded the highest number of coronavirus cases worldwide but Sweden holds the highest death rate par capita. Furthermore, experts are still trying to understand the Chinese coronavirus. There is a level of unpredictability over the aggressiveness of contagion. Some of the world’s worst-hit countries have also been the most-developed, such as the United Kingdom, Belgium, Spain, and Italy, all of whom have a far higher per capita death rate than the United States. Baldwin’s unhinged rant didn’t mention China, which hid the truth about the deadly decease from the world, allowing it to spread and eventually throw economies across the globe into economic depression. In the U.S., Democratic governors like Andrew Cuomo in New York, pushed through rules that sent sick nursing home patients back into their respective facilities, killing thousands of people. Baldwin didn’t mention that mess. Meanwhile, extremely poor or even conflict-stricken states such as Venezuela, Yemen, and Ethiopia have all reported less than 1,000 cases, although in reality these numbers are likely higher due to lack of testing. Baldwin, however, has always shown little regard for the finer details of political debate. Earlier this month, the Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol star said Trump suffers from a “degenerative mental illness that is costing 1000’s of lives.” Baldwin also attacked Trump supporters, labeling them as “mentally ill” and declaring them responsible for the “near moral collapse” of the United States.

Pennsylvania congressional Democrats remain silent on Gov. Tom Wolf’s (D) decision to put coronavirus-infected patients in nursing homes, while Pennsylvania Republicans chastised the governor for endangering the state’s elderly in exclusive statements to Breitbart News. Wolf, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), and New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D) have all received intense backlash for forcing nursing homes to accept coronavirus-infected patients. At least partly due to the order, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania have three of the four highest deaths in long-term care facilities, or nursing homes. Wolf came under such controversy that he said on Monday that he would be open to a federal investigation into this administration’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak in nursing homes. Breitbart News wrote about how New York and New Jersey congressional Democrats have remained silent on their governors’ decision to mandate that long-term care facilities host coronavirus patients. Breitbart News sent comment requests to Pennsylvania’s congressional delegation, House and Senate, and Democrats have ignored the request for comment. The Pennsylvania Democrats that ignored the comment request include: Several Pennsylvania Republicans chided Wolf for endangering some of the state’s most vulnerable citizens. Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA) told Breitbart News, “It is clear that aggressive measures should have been taken in Pennsylvania to protect nursing home residents and prevent outbreaks in long-term care facilities, particularly in those the PA Department of Health knew were ill-equipped to control the spread of the virus.” Rep. Scott Perry (R-PA) called for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to investigate the governor’s handling of the coronavirus last week. Perry wrote in an op-ed last week: When the Congressional Delegation and the leadership of the State Legislature inquired to Gov. Wolf about the inordinate amount of COVID-19 fatalities in elder care, assisted living and nursing facilities, we received a familiar response: silence. Nearly 70% of all COVID-19 deaths in Pennsylvania have occurred in nursing and long-term care facilities. Governor Wolf has failed to protect our most vulnerable populations, and he’s shown little desire to modify his decisions that continue to have devastating effects on our most at-risk population. The Pennsylvania Republican delegation slammed Wolf for failing to protect the elderly Pennsylvanians and chastised Levine for pulling a family member out of the nursing home while preventing small businesses from operating. Rep. Fred Keller (R-PA) told Breitbart News, “From failing to protect older Pennsylvanians from the spread of COVID-19 in nursing homes while allowing a top cabinet official to pull a family member out of a similar facility, to refusing to allow small businesses to safely resume work despite the fact that we’ve successfully flattened the curve, Gov. Wolf’s coronavirus response has been nothing short of an unmitigated mess. It is clear that the governor lacks a coherent plan to deal with this pandemic, and the public health and economic impacts have been devastating as a result.” Rep. John Joyce (R-PA) told Breitbart News, “Since the onset of the coronavirus crisis, I have called on Gov. Wolf to be transparent and forthcoming with the people of Pennsylvania. It is deeply concerning that the Wolf administration continues to move the goal posts as we seek to recover from the health and economic ramifications of this outbreak. We should be focused on protecting the lives and livelihoods of Pennsylvanians – including our seniors and residents of long-term care facilities. As I have said before, the Wolf administration must consider the comprehensive health needs of our communities and take action to serve Pennsylvanians across the Commonwealth.” Other conservative lawmakers have noted that Wolf’s administration has especially harmed elderly Pennsylvanians, noting that nursing home deaths account for roughly 70 percent of total coronavirus deaths. “Secretary Levine’s decision to place COVID-19 positive patients back into nursing homes was misguided and dangerous. Elected officials managing this crisis must rely on the data to make informed decisions. Seniors are particularly vulnerable to this disease and should be treated with the utmost caution,” Rep. Dan Meuser (R-PA) said in a statement to Breitbart News. “Secretary Levine’s intent may have been to protect hospital capacity, but placing seniors with COVID-19 back into nursing homes where they could expose other high-risk individuals was short-sighted. As a result, these facilities have accounted for nearly 70 percent of fatalities across the Commonwealth.” “COVID-19 patients should never have been readmitted to long-term care facilities where the congregate settings and at-risk populations were needlessly endangered,” Rep. Lloyd Smucker (R-PA) told Breitbart News. “Congressman Smucker has stated that Gov. Tom Wolf has failed the people of Pennsylvania in his administration’s handling of nursing home issues. The public has since learned that the state Department of Health abandoned early intervention plans for nursing homes while simultaneously requiring them to admit patients who tested positive for COVID-19, allowing it to spread quickly in our most vulnerable communities.” Smucker said that he is “thankful that President Trump’s administration has been so supportive of the Commonwealth’s nursing home and long-term care facilities, by providing direct personal protective equipment shipments and dispatching teams of experts from the CDC to provide assistance to these hotspots.” One conservative said that Wolf and Levine have acted as “petty tyrants” while harming Pennsylvania small businesses and the state’s senior citizens. Rep. Guy Reschenthaler (R-PA) told Breitbart News, “Gov. Wolf, along with unelected bureaucrats in the Pennsylvania Department of Health, acted like petty tyrants by prioritizing shutting down small businesses rather than focusing on protecting our most vulnerable senior citizens. By forcing nursing homes to accept COVID-19 patients, Gov. Wolf put thousands of seniors in harm’s way, with nearly 70 percent of COVID-19 deaths in the state coming from these facilities. Gov. Wolf’s one-size-fits-all approach to fighting this pandemic has upended our economy and rendered one in four workers jobless, all while putting our seniors in care homes at greater risk.”

Thursday on ABC’s “The View,” Minority Leader Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY) said President Donald Trump is promoting an “already discredited conspiracy” theory with his Obamagate tweets instead of focusing on the coronavirus pandemic. Co-host Meghan McCain asked, “So Senator, President Trump has been nonstop tweeting about Obamagate, which stems from allegations Obama and senior officials used government power to spy on Trump’s campaign. Can you say with 100% certainty that this did not happen,, and it’s all a big Trump conspiracy theory to distract us?” Schumer said, “Well, I didn’t say it, 17 intelligence agencies—these are nonpartisan, these are people who have risked their lives for us, CIA, NSA— they said it. This came from the Russians who wanted to divert attention for what they did. He continued, “For the Senate and President Trump to spend time on this when we have a COVID crisis is just absolutely absurd. We should be focusing on helping people through this crisis, not pursuing already discredited conspiracy theories.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

A Texas dad recently drove more than 1,000 miles to surprise his daughter with a Chick-fil-A meal on her birthday. Julio Cesar Segura, 53, began his eight-and-a-half-hour journey from El Paso, Texas, to Austin, Texas, at 4:15 a.m on May 8 to visit his daughter, Diana Segura Lerma, on her 19th birthday. The dedicated dad and realtor spent 17 hours in the car and drove 1,152 miles only to spend 30 minutes with his daughter and to drop off her favorite Chick-fil-A sandwich — a chicken sandwich with pepper jack cheese, mayonnaise, and buffalo sauce. Julio and Diana each share a sandwich together for lunch as a tradition for her birthday. But this year was extra special for Diana since she did not expect her dad to show up at her residence. “He told me that since he couldn’t do much, he wanted to know what I’d like for lunch and he would send an Uber Eats order,” Diana told SWNS. “He brings me that sandwich for lunch on my birthday every year — so far he hasn’t missed a year.” But instead of a delivery driver, Diana opened her door to see her dad holding balloons, a Chick-fil-A bag, and posters wishing her a “Happy Birthday.” “I decided to go the day before. I love her and I wanted to make sure she had a good birthday,” Julio said. Diana felt shocked when she saw her father show up at her apartment. “I was so excited. I haven’t seen him in months, since winter break. I didn’t think that I would see him again until August,” she said. “He has always been someone who loves gestures, but I never imagined he would do this in a pandemic.” Although she was excited, she was a little upset she could not hug him. “When you see a loved one and they come so far to see you, it’s your instinct to hug them,” she said. Because they were concerned about the coronavirus, each of them ate their meals six feet apart on a terrace outside Diana’s apartment. Julio was happy with how his surprise turned out. “I was the driving the whole day, but I was so happy on the way back,” he said. “She deserved a good birthday.”

Shows like the hit CBS police procedural drama Blue Bloods are reportedly looking to employ robots, that use ultraviolet light to kill germs, to clean film sets when production restarts amid the Chinese coronavirus outbreak. The robots, priced at $125,000 each, are already used in many hospitals to kill off viruses on walls, counters, floors, and the like. They automatically roam a fixed area using ultraviolet (UV) light to kill germs, including the virus that causes COVID-19, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Donnie Wahlberg and Tom Selleck in Blue Bloods. Craig Blankenhorn/CBS Television Network The machines are made by Xenex Disinfection Services of San Antonio, Texas, under the trademarked name “Xenex Germ-Zapping Robot.” According to the Hollywood Reporter, the machine is being sought by the TV police drama starring Tom Selleck under the auspices of a brand new company offering disinfecting services for the film industry. The company, Production Safe Zone, is headed by Dr. Mark Stibich, who noted that the way we address pathogens lags far behind our scientific knowledge of the matter. “The way we like to think of it is that our pathogens, like coronavirus, have evolved — but our tools that clean the environment haven’t,” Dr. Stibich told the outlet. “We’re still basically using buckets and mops and wipes, and what we need is a new tool to reduce the risks that the environment may cause an infection.” A major obstacle to the venture is the Hollywood film crew unions that require union members to be in charge of every aspect of filmmaking. But Dr. Stibich says he is perfectly willing to sit down with the unions to create protocols. “We work hand in hand with the union, as we did in the hospitals, and train their people up so that we’re not bringing in some automated service that reduces the workforce,” Stibich said. Thus far, the unions have refused to comment on the idea. The technology is a proven issue. Hospitals all across the nation use similar machines to sanitize their facilities.

Tech giants Apple and Google have reportedly released the technology to automatically notify people if they have been exposed to individuals that have tested positive for the Wuhan coronavirus. The technology was produced by the two tech giants to allow iPhones and Android smartphones to communicate. AP News reports that tech giants Apple and Google released smartphone technology on Wednesday to notify users that they may have been in contact with individuals who have been exposed to the Wuhan coronavirus. 22 countries and several states in the United States are planning to build voluntary phone apps using their software. The contact tracing system relies on Bluetooth wireless technology to detect when someone who downloaded the app has spent time near another app user who has tested positive for the virus. Multiple governments have attempted to roll out their own phone apps since the beginning of the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic. Many of the apps have faced technical issues and have failed to be widely adopted, they also often use GPS track user’s price locations which Apple and Google have banned from their new tools for privacy and security reasons. Health agencies in Germany as well as in the U.S. states of Alabama and South Carolina have been waiting to use Apple and Google’s new system while other governments claim that the tech giant’s privacy restrictions make the system harder for public health workers to use. The tech firms claim that app users will be protected by encryption and anonymous identifier beacons that regularly change. The companies said in a joint statement: “User adoption is key to success and we believe that these strong privacy protections are also the best way to encourage use of these apps.” The statement from the firms also included comments from state officials in North Dakota, Alabama and South Carolina which appear to signal plans to use the new tech. North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a Republican, commented: “We invite other states to join us in leveraging smartphone technologies to strengthen existing contact tracing efforts, which are critical to getting communities and economies back up and running.” Breitbart News reported in April that privacy experts are warning that this tracing tech could be an invasion of user privacy.  Klon Kitchen, a technology analyst at the Heritage Foundation, told MarketWatch: “All of this could be abused. But information that could be used is already being collected.” But he added, “They have a vested interest in getting the economy up and running, and getting their engineers back in the building, and the government lacks the ability to do this.” Josephine Wolff, a cybersecurity policy professor at The Fletcher School at Tufts University, commented on the tech stating: “The bigger concern is: What if other entities can access?” But Wolff seems reassured that the firms will keep any identifiable information out o the hands of third parties due to the 15 minute refresh time on the identifier on Apple and Google devices. “You might worry about someone creating a map of where you have been, but with an identifier that changes every 15 minutes it would be so much harder to trace to an individual person,” said Wolff. Wolff added: “The truth about Google and Apple is they have so much information about us already.” Even New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat who has praised Apple and Google’s efforts, noted that there are privacy concerns relating to the tech. “Apple and other companies are working on using technology to do tracking. How do we do that and how do we do it fast?” Cuomo said before acknowledging the privacy issue stating: “Do you really want that cell phone in your pocket to be a tracking device?” A survey at the end of April found that three out of five Americans are unwilling or unable to use the smartphone contact tracing technology developed by the Masters of the Universe in Silicon Valley.

The Lehigh Valley Health Network (LVHN) is reporting a “steep decline” in patients hospitalized with the Chinese coronavirus — a significant development, as the hospital system spans across several Pennsylvania counties remaining under Gov. Tom Wolf’s (D) severe lockdown order. “Look at that steep decline in the number of COVID-19 patients in LVHN hospitals!” the health network exclaimed on its Facebook page, providing a chart with the predicted trend. “It’s even better than predicted. Proof that social distancing, hand washing and wearing a mask helps keep people safe and protected,” the hospital network added, encouraging people to be “COVID SMART”: Look at that steep decline in the number of COVID-19 patients in LVHN hospitals! It’s even better than predicted. Proof… Posted by Lehigh Valley Health Network on Wednesday, May 20, 2020 A closer look at the chart shows that they are now under 150 coronavirus-related hospitalizations in LVHN hospitals — a mark they did not expect to hit until the end of the month. LVHN also noted that it ordered more tests than any others in the region — 27,658 — and has seen 5,781 positive cases as a result. The hospital system breaks down the LVHN positive cases county by county, almost all of which remain under Wolf’s restrictive lockdown order. Warren County and Carbon County stand as exceptions, as Warren moved to the yellow phase on May 8, and Carbon will move to the yellow phase on Friday. Penn State Health CEO Steve Massini reported similar results during last week’s virtual roundtable discussion with Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA) and Rep. Lloyd Smucker (R-PA), explaining that Penn State Health facilities have experienced a “continued decrease” in coronavirus hospitalizations since its peak last month. “As of this morning, we have successfully treated and released more than 175 confirmed COVID-19 patients from our hospitals in Hershey and Reading,” Massini told the lawmakers at the time. “The interesting point to make is, at the level of 23 patients in our hospital today, that is a 50 percent decrease from our high point of 51 patients in mid-April,” he continued. “Again, we’ve had a continued decrease.” He concluded that “Penn State Health’s experience with COVID-19 has been less severe” than initially anticipated. Nearly 70 percent of coronavirus fatalities in the Keystone State has been linked to nursing homes.

Michigan’s universities are facing significant losses as a result of the Chinese virus pandemic. One estimate suggests that public universities in Michigan will lose a total of $1 billion as a result of the pandemic. According to a report by the College Fix, public universities and colleges in the state of Michigan will lose approximately $1 billion as a result of the Chinese virus pandemic. “There are no simply no revenues coming in at this point,” Dan Hurley, the president of the Michigan Association of State Universities, said in a comment. Many universities and colleges furloughed employees in April to compensate for losses incurred during the spring semester. Western Michigan University President Edward Montgomery announced on May 11 that a “substantial number” of employees would be laid off as a result of budgetary issues. “We have to do the process sooner rather than later,” Montgomery said last week. “You need to aim high rather than aim low, so we don’t have to repeat the process. If we wait and don’t plan, we won’t have the time to make the necessary adjustments for the fall.” University of Michigan-Flint Professor Mark J. Perry, who may be best known for his war against university policies that discriminate against male students, claims that his university has suffered a substantial drop in enrollment as a result of the pandemic. “The Flint campus is right now reporting an expected decline of 19.5% for Fall 2020 credit hours compared to the same time a year ago, according to the most recent enrollment report from the UM-Flint Registrar’s Office yesterday,” Perry wrote in an email. “A year ago the expected credit hours for Fall 2019 were 42,491 and this year it’s down to 34,210. And the report from the previous week on 5/11 showed an expected 17.5% decline in Fall 2020 credit hours, so the expected outlook worsened slightly in the last week.” Several universities in Michigan that have been affected by the pandemic have already announced plans to reopen their campuses for the fall. Michigan State and the University of Michigan, two of the largest public universities in the state, are currently developing their own plans for a fall reopening. Stay tuned to Breitbart News for more campus updates.

Trial lawyers are licking their chops as the United States reopens more than two months after locking down due to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. John Houghtaling, one such trial lawyer representing part of a group of celebrity chefs suing insurance giants over the pandemic, described the forthcoming fight in a quote to the Washington Post as what he said is “going to be the most expensive legal battle in history.” He then predicted: The insurance companies are going to win some of those, and they’re going to lose some of those. But in the meantime, the businesses are going to fail. People are going to be out of work. Houghtaling is a managing partner at Gauthier Murphy & Houghtaling LLC, a firm in the New Orleans suburb Metairie, Louisiana. Houghtaling is testifying before the Democrat-led House Small Business Committee on Thursday afternoon, where lawmakers will discuss the liability issues as Congress considers potentially granting a liability shield to companies nationwide upon reopening—something many Republicans consider imperative to successfully return to normal as a society. An outsized battle looms in Washington, as trade associations for trial lawyers push their own vision of open-ended lawsuits while groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce come down on the side of restricting litigation over coronavirus. The brewing fight in Congress, too, could become a hinge-point on whether there is a fourth major coronavirus relief package that could pass and be signed into law in the coming weeks and if there is one what it looks like. A source familiar with the fight told Breitbart News this will be a “billion dollar fight,” as powerful forces on each side—trial lawyers versus businesses—move in on lawmakers from every direction. The issue that confronts lawmakers is how to limit the scope of litigation over coronavirus while also not giving away too much to the business community. President Donald Trump said at a roundtable with restaurant executives earlier this week he hopes to strike the right balance, to “protect workers and businesses alike with curbs on frivolous litigation—frivolous litigation—a thing I know something about.” He added: There’s a lot of frivolous litigation. So we don’t want someone going and sitting in your restaurant Tilman [Fertitta] and then suing you for $10 million because something happened. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said a liability shield for businesses from the kind of endless litigation that trial lawyers enrich themselves on is a must-have in any fourth phase coronavirus relief package. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has indicated that she is seeking to help out struggling state and local governments, and McConnell could pin a liability shield to that—forcing this issue to be addressed. McConnell has deputized Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) with addressing the matter, and sources with knowledge of the matter told Breitbart News the fight will surely intensify as the calendar changes from May to June. Houghtaling is representing Thomas Keller, the celebrity chef who the Washington Post’s Tim Carman described as “the mastermind behind the three-star Michelin restaurants Per Se in New York and the French Laundry in California.” Keller is one of many restauranteurs nationwide suing their insurance companies because the insurance companies are not paying them for the shutdowns caused by COVID-19. “The owners are pressing carriers to honor business-interruption policies during an outbreak that has wreaked so much financial havoc that it could bankrupt insurance companies and put at risk claims not related to covid-19,” Carman wrote in the Post. In these particular kinds of cases, what these trial lawyers like Houghtaling and the others representing these various restaurants are looking for is for insurance companies to honor business interruption policies or to cover their clients like they would in a natural disaster even if the policies do not explicitly cover pandemics. But this is just the tip of the iceberg for trial lawyers as the reopening battle moves forward coast to coast—cases that could be forthcoming include against states for various policies they implemented like New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s decision to force COVID-19 patients into nursing homes or against companies in the case of a worker who returns to the workplace contracting the virus. That’s not to mention consumer-led suits against any business where people think they may have gotten the virus, and so much more. According to Politico, the American Association for Justice—a national collective of trial lawyers—released polling on the issue that forecast many potential lines of litigation that the attorneys may see coming. “The trial lawyers hired Hart Research Associates, a Democratic polling firm, which surveyed more than 1,200 voters online last week,” Politico’s Theodoric Meyer wrote earlier in May. “The pollsters told voters that companies want to prevent workers and consumers who contract coronavirus from suing them ‘even if they could demonstrate that the company engaged in unsafe practices.’ Sixty-four percent of respondents said they opposed giving companies such immunity, while 36 percent supported it.” The Chamber of Commerce, which is squarely on the other side of the fight, released its own polling according to Politico showing the exact opposite. “A poll conducted days earlier by the Republican firm Public Opinion Strategies for the Chamber’s Institute for Legal Reform found the opposite among 800 voters surveyed by phone,” Politico’s Meyer wrote. “Asked whether ‘Congress should protect many businesses and types of companies from lawsuits related to the coronavirus,’ 61 percent of voters agreed and 27 percent said no.” But no matter who is paying out and who is receiving payments as a result of litigation, and no matter who wins and who loses lawsuits, the one group that always comes out on top is the trial lawyers. That “most expensive legal battle in history” that Houghtaling describes has but one absolute winner: the trial lawyers who bring the cases. Houghtaling is a curious choice for Democrats in the House as a witness to push this line protecting endless litigation, as his political donation history aligns closely with top Democrats in Congress. Federal Election Commission (FEC) reports show that Houghtaling donated $10,000 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC)—the formal Democrat Party arm charged with electing Democrats to the House—in 2014. Those FEC records show that he also made a $5,128 in-kind contribution to the DCCC for hosting the fundraising event at which he gave the $10,000. For instance, in 2000 he donated $1,000 to Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton’s U.S. Senate campaign in New York. Later, in 2016, he gave $2,700—the maximum allowable by law—to Clinton’s presidential campaign. In fact, from 1998 until 2015, Houghtaling gave almost exclusively to Democrats. But in 2014, Houghtaling founded an energy company called American Ethane Company, LLC. The company, which has ties to Russia and according to filings with the Louisiana Secretary of State even has a mailing address in Moscow, seems to have altered Houghtaling’s donation history. He started giving to Republicans, including former U.S. Rep. Charles Boustany—a GOP House member who ran for U.S. Senate—and other Republicans throughout the South in particular in Louisiana like Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC), and House GOP whip Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA). The establishment media has actually ripped Houghtaling’s energy company in its efforts to paint President Trump as close with Russia. In July 2018, the Guardian for instance ran this headline: “Former Putin adviser has secret investment in US energy firm praised by Trump.” In the piece, the Guardian’s Luke Harding details how Vladimir Putin’s former chief of staff has a stake in Houghtaling’s company: Vladimir Putin’s former chief of staff has a secret investment in an American energy company hailed by Donald Trump as creating jobs for American workers. Alexander Voloshin – who served as Boris Yeltsin’s chief of staff before working for Putin between 2000 and 2003 – has an undisclosed stake in American Ethane, a Houston-based firm that recently signed a multibillion dollar export deal with China. Voloshin is part of a consortium of Russian investors in American Ethane that at one point included the oligarch and billionaire Roman Abramovich. There are plenty of other ties between American Ethane and Russia, but the company also has ties to the Chinese. According to the firm’s own website, it has made a number of deals with Chinese companies and has a Shanghai office. But all of that aside, why the Democrats would brush all of these previous concerns about Russia aside to hype a trial lawyer like this amid the coronavirus pandemic and as the country seeks to reopen are curious—and could foreshadow that bigger battle many are talking about behind the scenes that’s about to burst out into the open.

If you’ve been wondering why some of college football’s premier programs have been pushing so hard to play football this year despite a global pandemic, we have your answer. According to a Washington University study commissioned by ESPN, if college football isn’t played in 2020, it would cost the Power 5 conferences (ACC, Big 12, Big 10, Pac 10, SEC) in the sport would lose $4 billion. According to ESPN: [Patrick] Rishe estimates that the 65 Power 5 schools would collectively lose more than $4 billion in football revenues, with at least $1.2 billion of that due to lost ticket revenue. Each Power 5 school would see at least an average loss of $62 million in football revenue, including at least $18.6 million in football ticket sales, he said. Rishe’s analysis for ESPN used publicly available data from the 2017 season from the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics and the 2018 Equity in Athletics Database from the U.S. Department of Education, along with conservative projections of increases in revenue over the past two years to arrive at 2020 estimates if the U.S. were not in the midst of a pandemic. Rishe’s projected losses are actually conservative; they don’t include potential losses in media revenue, conference distributions, donations and revenues from corporate partnerships. With 65 member schools, the Power 5 conferences comprise roughly half of the total number of teams that compete at the Division I level. As Nick Bromberg of Yahoo! points out, it’s not just the schools who would take a financial hit if football were to not be played. ESPN would take a significant hit if there was no college football season either. The network has a stake in the SEC and ACC Networks, along with the Big 12’s ESPN+ streaming service, and pays billions for college football rights. Its fall programming is largely centered around football games. The network has scrambled to fill programming voids over the last two months amid the coronavirus pandemic and would have to scramble even more if there were no college football games to show starting in September. The trickle down effect of Power 5 conferences taking a $4 billion hit would be felt across college athletics. Football programs, normally the only sports programs that generate revenue, pay the freight for the swim teams, soccer teams, and other programs at the school. Without that income, many of those other sports would have to shut down. Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn

Thursday on “CBS This Morning,” Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI) called President Donald Trump’s threat to withhold federal funding from Michigan for sending absentee ballot applications to voters “unacceptable.” Discussing Trump’s threat while she is dealing with two dams that broke and 10,000 residents being evacuated, Whitmer said, You know, we are in the midst of this global pandemic. We lost 5,000 people in the state of Michigan. It’s been devastating. We are at a point where we think it’s safe to start re-engaging sectors of our economy, but then this flood hits. We’ve got to evacuate tens of thousands of people who are worried and scared. On top of this global pandemic. And to have this kind of distraction is just ridiculous, to be honest.” She continued, “Threatening to take money away from a state that is hurting as bad as we are right now is just scary, and I think something that is unacceptable. My hope is that today he will be in Michigan. He’ll see we are hard-working, good Americans. We need the support of our federal government as much of as anybody else, if not more right now, because of this added challenge. And I’m hopeful that he comes away knowing that that’s what’s most important. No petty political stuff that he had going with the secretary of state yesterday. We’ve got to be focused on doing the right thing right now on behalf of the people.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Mexican health officials revealed the highest daily spike in fatalities related to the Coronavirus (COVID-19). The new record comes as authorities are broadly accused of doctoring statistics to downplay the true scope of the pandemic. During the daily news conference, Mexico’s Epidemiology Director Jose Luis Alomia said the nation has seen a total of 6,090 fatalities and 56,594 confirmed cases. The number of fatalities rose by 424 in a single day.

Mexico has only performed 193,589 tests, which led politicians to claim this helps keep the number of cases artificially low. Undersecretary of Health Hugo Lopez Gatell previously admitted his figures do not include cases from private hospitals. An NGO called Mexicanos Contra la Corrupcion e Impunidad MCCI says that in Mexico City alone, officials only acknowledge one-third of Coronavirus fatalities.

Britain’s National Health Service (NHS) has revealed that it is following U.S. President Donald Trump’s lead on experimenting with hydroxychloroquine as a coronavirus preventative. The state-run, socialised healthcare provider will be giving hydroxychloroquine to as many as 10,000 health workers at at least 20 hospitals as part of a clinical trial led by the Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit (Moru), to confirm anecdotal evidence that it can prevent people from catching the Chinese virus. The announcement may give satisfaction to President Trump, who was slammed by left-liberal politicians and commentators when he revealed that he was taking hydroxychloroquine as a possible preventative. The American leader told reporters on Monday that they would “be surprised at how many people are taking [hydroxychloroquine], especially the frontline workers, before you catch it,” before revealing that he is taking the drug himself. Chuck Schumer, who leads the Democrats in the U.S. Senate, branded the President “reckless” and claimed that “All the experts say at best it doesn’t help” following the revelation. “I would rather he not be taking something that has not been approved by the scientists, especially in his age group,” added Nancy Pelosi, Schumer’s 80-year-old counterpart in the House of Representatives — before going on to suggest the President should be extra cautious because he is “morbidly obese”. President Donald Trump on Monday confirmed at the White House that he was taking hydroxychloroquine and zinc as preventatives against the coronavirus. https://t.co/xNYf9vC0HQ — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) May 18, 2020  “Based on the known pharmacology of hydroxychloroquine, coupled with the emerging knowledge surrounding SARS-CoV-2 viral replication and Covid-19 pathophysiology, we were very keen to test the effectiveness of this molecule in a preventative rather than late-stage treatment setting,” said Dr Anthony Grosso of Accord Europe, a British pharmaceuticals manufacturer which has donated more than two million tablets for the NHS study. “If drugs as well tolerated as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine could reduce the chances of catching Covid-19, this would be incredibly valuable,” explained Professor Martin Llewelyn, the study’s British lead. “If these drugs offer even a degree of protection, it would be a very big deal. We know from previous studies that these drugs have anti-viral activity, but as a treatment it seems to be relatively modest,” he said . “It seems the best chance of these drugs having a role could be in prevention,” he concluded — exactly the reason President Trump has been using the drug. Why is the Establishment Media so determined to attack hydroxychloroquine? "As soon as [Trump] said something positive about it, the media has been on a jihad to discredit the drug. It’s quite strange.” https://t.co/32Y7RNdWxH — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) April 9, 2020 

A New Jersey gym that opened in defiance of the state’s stay-at-home order has been shut down by the state’s health department. State and local health officials plastered signs on the doors of Atilis Gym in Bellmawr on Thursday morning, CBS Philadelphia reported. The owners say they will not reopen again immediately and violate the health department order. The gym owners were cited for the past three days for reopening their gym to protest the shutdown orders. Atilis Gym first reopened its doors on Monday, drawing crowds of protesters and police. Officers quickly cited the gym for defying Gov. Phil Murphy’s stay-at-home order before the health department shut it down Thursday. Ian Smith, the gym’s co-owner, told NBC 10 Philadelphia the closure was a “dirty tactic” by the governor and a “coordinated attack” on his business. “It’s a gross abuse of power,” Smith said, adding that though the gym would not reopen Thursday to violate the health order, it planned on opening by Friday. Smith said the health department had not inspected the gym to take a look at safety measures to protect customers and vowed to file a lawsuit. The New Jersey Department of Health did not immediately respond for comment. When Smith was asked if he regretted opening his business in the first place, he replied, “Absolutely not. We’re gonna defend our rights.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) have asked President Donald Trump to lower flags to half staff at all public buildings on the day when the United States reaches 100,000 deaths due to Chinese coronavirus. “We will always carry their memory in our hearts,” Pelosi and Schumer wrote. “As we pay our respects to them, sadly, our country mourns the deaths of nearly 100,000 Americans from COVID-19. Our hearts are broken over this great loss and our prayers are with their families.” PELOSI and SCHUMER write TRUMP asking him to order flags flown at half staff on the day America reaches 100k COVID deaths. pic.twitter.com/rErBkhFzJh — Jake Sherman (@JakeSherman) May 21, 2020  “Respectful of them and the loss to our country, we are writing to request that you order flags to be flown at half-staff on all public buildings in our country on the sad day of reckoning when we reach 100,000 deaths,” they added. “It would serve as a national expression of grief so needed by everyone in our country.” The Democrat leaders’ letter comes as the U.S. death toll has surpassed 94,000, according to data tracked by Johns Hopkins University. To fly the flags at half staff, President Trump would be required to make a presidential proclamation.

Burundi successfully held its first competitive national election since its civil war in 1993 on Wednesday, despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, which has hindered elections in other countries, Reuters reported. Burundi’s last national election in 2015 was the subject of international criticism after current president Pierre Nkurunziza won a controversial third term. Nkurunziza has agreed to step down after this year’s election following 15 years in office. His ruling party, CNDD-FDD, chose a retired general and fellow member, Evariste Ndayishimiye, to run against the opposition party leader Agathon Rwasa and five others this year. The full results of the election’s outcome are expected by May 27. The winner must secure at least 50 percent of the vote in the first round. Otherwise, a run-off election must be held within the next two weeks, according to the report. “We call on Burundians to vote in massive numbers and vote peacefully. We need good elections,” Pierre Claver Kazihise, chairman of Burundi’s election commission, said during a state TV broadcast in the lead up to the vote. Wednesday’s election met both criteria, with “long” lines at polling stations where operations ran “smoothly,” according to voters interviewed by Reuters. “The voting is really taking place smoothly and I voted for change but I am pessimistic about the counting of votes,” said one citizen who asked to be quoted anonymously. According to some voters, certain social media platforms and messaging apps, such as Twitter and Whatsapp, seemed to have been shut down around the time of the election. Some speculated that the government may have orchestrated the move to prevent the spread of information during the crucial polling period, according to the report. Burundi’s last national election in 2015, which saw Nkurunziza elected to his third term, was the subject of widespread international criticism. Citizens protested the election results in demonstrations that turned violent. The U.N. criticized Nkurunziza and his ruling party of human rights violations in the aftermath, which the government denied. This eventually led the government to shut down the U.N.’s human rights office in Burundi in 2019. Last week, the government ousted another U.N. official when it ordered the head of Burundi’s World Health Organization mission, a U.N. health body, to leave the country after the health authority objected to the government holding crowded political rallies in the lead up to Wednesday’s election. The gatherings, attended by thousands of people, were allowed despite the ongoing Chinese coronavirus pandemic.

Russia’s coronavirus information chief implied on Tuesday that victims of the coronavirus had met their destiny, assuring Russians that the nation’s coronavirus outbreak should not worry them because death is inevitable, the Moscow Times reported. The government official’s remarks preceded Russia reporting on Wednesday the second-highest number of Chinese coronavirus cases in the world. Alexander Myasnikov, previously a celebrity doctor, made the controversial comments during an interview with pro-Putin pundit Vladimir Solovyov, broadcast on Tuesday: The infection will still take its toll, and we’ll all get it. Those meant to die will die. Everyone dies. Even if it’s coronavirus, so what? Of course, you need to get a test to avoid infecting others, but you do understand it’s an illusion. We’ll run out of tests if everyone runs out to check after every sneeze. After his interview aired, Russian media shared Myasnikov’s statement. He has since faced criticism from the Russian public for his seemingly callous remarks. On Tuesday night, the TV doctor defended his views via social media, accusing the Russian press of taking his words out of the context of the interview. Myasnikov said his statement was intended to impart confidence to his audience, as many Russians may be experiencing “uncertainty and fear of tomorrow.” “There’s no need to waste energy and destroy your psyche with panic. We’re all mortal by dint of our existence,” the doctor wrote in a statement posted to his Telegram account late Tuesday. “The fact that a person is mortal shouldn’t darken the days of our, alas, fleeting life. We should just live and enjoy this life.” In mid-April, the Kremlin appointed Myasnikov as the head of Russia’s Coronavirus Information Center, a position that Myasnikov had reportedly already assumed unofficially prior to the announcement, BBC Russia reported. As Information Chief, Myasnikov’s responsibilities include informing the public about treatment and prevention methods for the Chinese coronavirus as well as combating “fake news” surrounding the virus. Additionally, the cardiologist leads the Health, Demography, and Social Policy Commission of the Moscow Public Chamber. According to BBC Russia, Myasnikov works closely with Moscow leadership. He assisted Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin as an adviser during the city’s 2018 mayoral election and also served as an adviser to President Vladimir Putin during Russia’s 2018 presidential election. The radio and TV personality has previously been known for his positive spin on Russia’s coronavirus outbreak. In early February, he said that the emergence of the coronavirus might be beneficial for Russians because it encouraged people to increase hygienic practices such as hand washing and to start wearing sanitary masks in public, according to the report. He then said he believed there was a “zero percent” chance of the coronavirus spreading in Russia. He deemed the country’s coronavirus death rate at the time a “Russian miracle” for being remarkably low. Russian officials have been accused of drastically undercounting and underreporting the nation’s true number of the coronavirus infections and deaths. “The coronavirus epidemic will come to naught, I think, by mid-April,” Myasnikov erroneously predicted in March, when he described the coronavirus pandemic as a “seasonal phenomenon.” Two weeks later, Myasnikov backtracked on this statement, encouraging Russians to patiently wait for “herd immunity” to pervade the population and protect people from the virus, according to BBC Russia’s report. In mid-April, the American-trained medical doctor said that Russia’s healthcare system was better prepared to take on the coronavirus pandemic than Western healthcare systems, a claim that has been disproven in recent weeks as Russia’s hospitals have been overwhelmed by the national outbreak. The Russian government has failed to provide its healthcare workers with basic personal protective equipment (PPE), causing doctors and nurses to quit in protest. In late April, President Putin admitted Russia had a “deficit of all sorts” of medical equipment as it prepared for a surge in coronavirus cases in recent weeks. At press time on Wednesday, Russia had officially recorded 308,705 coronavirus infections and 2,972 deaths from the Chinese coronavirus.

The deep blue state of Illinois is beginning to revolt against the nation’s strictest coronavirus lockdowns even as those in charge seek to strengthen their power. Some of the more outrageous examples of overreach are seen in the City of Chicago, where Mayor Lori Lightfoot has fenced in the city’s extensive lakeshore areas and even created newly designated no parking zones around churches to prevent worshipers from attending services. Last Sunday, the city’s first gay mayor sent the Chicago Police Department (CPD) out to erect new signs around the neighborhood of Philadelphia Romanian Church to suddenly create long stretches of new “No parking/tow warning” zones around the building. Lightfoot also sent the CPD to prowl around outside several of the city’s churches to hand out parking violations, Chicago’s CBS affiliate reported. The mayor’s campaign against churches comes on the heels of statements by several church officials across the city saying they had no intention of submitting to the mayor’s orders to shut down their houses of worship.

Huh) The Windy City is not the only Illinois jurisdiction instituting the draconian lockdowns that are riling citizens. The state’s novice Governor, J.B. Pritzker, has also dabbled in harsh lockdowns that have stifled the state. Indeed, a recent review of lockdown policies by the personal finance site WalletHub found Illinois has the harshest lockdown policies in the country. As a result, the Windy City citizens are not the only Illinoisans who have revolted against the Democrat-enforced lockdowns. A growing number of county and municipal officials are coming out in opposition to Gov. Pritzker’s seemingly arbitrary orders. Pritzker ruled businesses that violated his orders could be handed a prison sentence of up to a year for refusing to obey him. But many balked at the order. Sheriff James Mendrick of DuPage County, Illinois, for instance, told his constituents he had no intention of enforcing Pritzker’s order to fine and arrest violators of the gov’s lockdown orders. “I just can’t do this anymore. I stand with our citizens and businesses of DuPage County who have offered no trouble or no resistance to any rule we put upon them, no matter how strange.,” Sheriff Mendrick wrote in a Facebook post. “I will not victimize lawful residents of DuPage County trying to put food on their children’s table. I’m so proud of our DuPage citizens who have done everything right from the beginning. All I can say is thank you,” he added. Kendall County Sheriff Dwight Baird joined Mendrick and let his county know that he had no intention of sending police to break up gatherings, take out weddings, or shut down businesses because in his opinion, “the Governor’s Executive Order is not a law.” Gibson City, a town in central Illinois, also announced they would not be enforcing Pritker’s orders. “After careful consideration, the Gibson City Police Department will not be making any criminal misdemeanor arrests of individuals or business owners for violations of temporary rules of Executive Orders, the town said in a statement on Wednesday. In addition, downstate Madison County reopened its businesses despite the orders. In reply to these officials, Gov. Pritzker warned he would send the state police in to enforce his rules. “Counties that try to reopen in defiance, may not be reimbursed by FEMA for damages they cause because they ignored the law,” Pritzker said adding, “Local law enforcement and the Illinois State Police can and will take action.” Individual business owners have also defied the governor’s threats. A gym owner in Moline, a city on the border with Iowa, straight west of Chicago, reopened his business on Monday in direct defiance of Pritzker’s orders. Madison County Board Chairman Kurt Prenzler helped usher through a resolution that “basically declared all businesses and churches essential.” “I did the Zoom classes for a while. Rented out all my equipment and, you know, you reach a point where enough is enough, and somebody’s got to say something,” said Chris Ninotta, owner of Omni Strength. “I can’t do it any longer. I’m a single father, and that’s where my loyalty lies, and there’s no man or government on earth that’s gonna tell me I gotta, you know, do this.” In another case, Kevin Promenschenkel, owner of Poopy’s biker bar in Savanna, Illinois, filed a lawsuit after his state liquor license was threatened because people used his picnic tables – spaced more than 10 feet apart – to eat their takeout orders. The above actions by business owners and government officials noted above are only a handful of the examples of residents and officials revolting against the Illinois governor’s autocratic orders.

Residents of Saudi Arabia who violate the country’s coronavirus ban on large gatherings will be permanently banished from the Kingdom, the nation’s interior ministry announced Tuesday, Saudi news site al-Arabiya reported. On Saturday, the Ministry of Interior’s (MOI) security spokesman, Talal al-Shalhoub, urged the public to adhere to Saudi Arabia’s physical distancing mandates, been implemented to curb transmission of the Chinese coronavirus. “If a violator is a resident of Saudi Arabia, he will be deported from the Kingdom, and will be forever forbidden from re-entering it after his punishment is carried out,” al-Shalhoub said Tuesday. Saudi Arabia, with a population of 30 million people, currently has the highest number of coronavirus cases out of all six Persian Gulf states with 62,545 infections, in addition to 339 deaths. The Kingdom has banned large gatherings, defined as a grouping of “more than five people,” in an effort to contain its outbreak, al-Arabiya reported. To comply with this mandate “shoppers and staff members” are “not allowed to gather in malls or shops beyond the specified capacity limit which ensures two meters of separation between people,” al-Shalhoub said. Shops will be fined for each person found gathering in and outside of their establishments above the set capacity. For example, for a first-time offender, “an establishment will be fined 5,000 riyals ($1,331) for every extra person present in the facility above the set capacity limit.” The fine per person above capacity doubles for second and third-time offenders: “The maximum fine is 100,000 riyals ($26,619).” Third-time offenders “will be referred to the public prosecution,” according to the report. Private sector establishments defying the set capacity limits can be shut down by the government for three to six months. “Anyone who attends a gathering, or calls for it, or causes it will be considered a violator of the government’s measures and will face fines and penalties,” al-Shalhoub reminded the public on Saturday. On April 25, King Salman bin Abdulaziz ordered a partial easing of coronavirus restrictions already in place to coincide with the beginning of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. The order allowed retail stores and shopping malls to re-open as long as they maintained coronavirus prevention measures such as physical distancing and a limit on visitors. On May 14, Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Commerce said shopping centers could remain open until May 22. Kuwait and Qatar, who both share a border with Saudi Arabia, announced over the weekend they would imprison people for up to three years for failing to wear a sanitary face mask in public in accordance with their coronavirus prevention measures.

New claims for unemployment benefits fell to 2.438 million last week, data from the Department of Labor showed Thursday. That brings new unemployment claims, a proxy for layoffs, since the coronavirus pandemic began to claim jobs nine weeks ago to around 38.6 million. Economists had been expecting around 2.4 million for weekly claims. The prior week was initially reported at just below 3 million and was revised down to 2.69 down. The largest increases in initial claims for the week ending May 9 were in Florida’s 48,222 and Georgia’s 14,420. The largest decrease in claims was in California, where claims dropped by 103,590. This was followed by Texas’ 102,382, Oklahoma’s 54,806, North Carolina’s 28,602, and Missouri’s 21,382. Claims hit a record 6.87 million for the week of March 28. Each subsequent week has seen claims decline. Continuing claims, those made after an initial application, rose for the week ended May 9 to just over 25 million, a new record high. Those are reported with a one-week lag. The week prior was 22.548. The jump is an indication that most of those who lost jobs in recent weeks have remained out of work. The federal government has been shipping in an extra $600 a week to state unemployment benefits, making the program much more generous. Many workers can now earn more on unemployment than they did when they had a job. These super-sized benefits, however, are set to run out in July. The government said the U.S. unemployment rate soared to 14.7 percent in April, the highest since the Great Depression. The new claims numbers may be undercounting the toll the coronavirus and lockdowns have exacted on the U.S. labor market. Many states have ha problems processing the large amount of claims.  

The far-left Washington Post was forced to report Monday that in states with plenty of available coronavirus tests there are “too few people lining up to get tested.” Wait, whuh? You mean there are a buttload of coronavirus tests out there and hardly anyone wants to take them…? Oh, no, no, no, no… The question is a much bigger one than that… Let’s try that again: You mean the corporate media have spent three months and billions of dollars investing in fear porn — much of that porn invested on this ridiculous concept of “massive testing,” and hardly anyone wants to take the available tests? The answer to both questions is a hearty “yes.” In a sane world, the answer to both questions would be a hearty “duh.” Come on, did you expect anything different? We’re Americans after all, which means that at the end of the day we know bullshit when we hear it, and this media demand for a massive testing regime is bullshit. And how well do the American people know this? This well: A Washington Post survey of governors’ offices and state health departments found at least a dozen states where testing capacity outstrips the supply of patients. Many have scrambled to make testing more convenient, especially for vulnerable communities, by setting up pop-up sites and developing apps that help assess symptoms, find free test sites and deliver quick results. But the numbers, while rising, are well short of capacity — and far short of targets set by independent experts. Utah, for example, is conducting about 3,500 tests a day, a little more than a third of its 9,000-test maximum capacity, and health officials have erected highway billboards begging drivers to “GET TESTED FOR COVID-19.” Let’s go to the experts! Why aren’t more people showing up? “Well, that’s the million-dollar question,” said Utah Health Department spokesman Tom Hudachko. “It could be simply that people don’t want to be tested. It could be that people feel like they don’t need to be tested. It could be that people are so mildly symptomatic that they’re just not concerned that having a positive lab result would actually change their course in any meaningful way.” That’s actually a very good answer. I know the other day, while doing business with a local health care provider, my wife and I were offered a coronavirus test. “No thank you,” we said. Why would we get tested if we are feeling okay? What’s the point? Anyway, WaPo also found a whole lot of bad reasons to explain why people aren’t wasting their time on these stupid tests, reasons that can be blamed on — wait for it, wait for it– America!: Experts say several factors may be preventing more people from seeking tests, including a lingering sense of scarcity, a lack of access in rural and underserved communities, concerns about cost, and skepticism about testing operations. Let’s take these one by one… “A lingering sense of scarcity.” BWHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! There is no actual scarcity, but there’s a “lingering sense of scarcity.” Okay. Yeah. Listen, if I know one thing about Americans, it’s that if we really want something, no “lingering sense of scarcity” will stop us from getting it. Ever heard of a Cabbage Patch Doll? An iPhone? Are you freakin’ kidding me? This is America. This is Consumer Nation. We shop till we drop, baby. We seek till we find. And if a “lingering sense of scarcity” defeats us, that means we never really wanted it in the first place. “…a lack of access in rural and underserved communities[.]” BWHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! See all of the above. “…concerns about cost[.]” BWHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! First off, these tests are free. Secondly, did I mention these tests are free? Thanks to the efforts of the White House, most insurers have agreed to waive the co-pay, and the uninsured will also pay nothing for anything COVID-19 related. “…and skepticism about testing operations.” Ding! Ding! Ding! Skepticism is good. Skepticism is healthy. More skepticism, please. Why should I bother to get tested if 1) I feel just fine and 2) I’ve not been in contact with someone infected with the coronavirus? Submitting to a test under those conditions makes perfect sense. You want to be sure not to infect anyone else — in other words, don’t be a Chris Cuomo. And if there is a flare-up of infections in a certain area, the CDC needs to know it. We don’t want the health care system to crash. So I get that. But to get tested just for the hell of it? Why? Especially when you can exit the test all proud of the fact you are not sick and enter a cloud of coronavirus left by a guy who just sneezed before the elevator door opened. Secondly, there’s some evidence of false negatives, meaning people are testing negative for the virus who actually have it. So of course skepticism is warranted. The whole idea behind this unbelievably stupid massive testing regime is a media creation, an anti-science way to continue to move the goalposts on President Trump so that he can never achieve success. The goalpost moving is now to the point where the media are literally — literally! — demanding America conduct a billion tests a week. This is absurd, but it is deliberately absurd, a deliberate set-up by a partisan news media who will never allow Trump to claim a win. What’s more, we all know the real reason behind the media’s desire to increase testing: More testing means we find more people who are infected, and that allows the media juice up the fear porn with fake news, like this one at CNNLOL about Texas. But, gee, what if you’re all dolled up to offer a billion tests a week and hardly anyone wants to take them? Oh, wait — Utah can’t even find 3,501 people to take pointless coronavirus tests. Utah has the capacity to conduct 9,000 tests a day and only 3,500 are showing up. And do you want to know what that means…? Trump won. Trump more than achieved success when it comes to testing. If there are more tests than people who want to take them, that’s a total win. It also proves (yet again) that the bubbled, provincial media have absolutely no understanding of human nature. They actually believed they could terrify Americans into going through all the hassle and inconvenience of a medical procedure just because the fear porn media told them to. Sorry, that’s not how human nature works. During the 80s, at the height of the AIDS epidemic, when AIDS meant not only certain death, but a cruel, long, and agonizing death, countless people could not be convinced to refrain from loveless or sex, countless people could not even be convinced to wear a condom. We glorious Americans are not wired that way. The whole point of being an American is to live our lives in whatever way we choose. The heroism of the gay community during that time, their refusal to be rewired, to conform, to “social distance,” to stop being who they were while at the same time demanding the government do its one and only job, which is to protect our God-given right to live our chosen lives… that’s what this country is all about. And that’s exactly what you are seeing during these lockdown protests: Americans refusing to stop being who they are… Entrepreneurs, consumers, social animals, sun bathers… And why should we stop? First off, we’re not stupid. Secondly, we have great bullshit detectors. Finally, since the entire premise of our country is to live our lives in the way we wish, this makes us immediately skeptical of do-gooders who try to undermine our lifestyle, which makes us willing to accept the risks to fight for and go on living that lifestyle. Good grief, disease was one of the reasons nearly half the Mayflower passengers were wiped out that first year. So it is in the American DNA to live free, and despite the evil wishes of our media and too many Democrat governors, it always will be. That doesn’t mean we should be dumb about it. If I was in close contact with someone who had the China virus, if I had the symptoms, I’d get tested — of course I would. But any other reason is absurd and a waste of resources.  Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.

Hollywood actors Julia Roberts, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Hugh Jackman are among the long list of A-list celebrities lending health experts — starting with Dr. Anthony Fauci — their social media platforms as part of the #PassTheMic, an initiative organized by global nonprofit ONE Campaign aimed at promoting “health and economic experts … discussing a global response to” the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. Roberts will be the first to relinquish her social media accounts — Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter — to Dr. Fauci. Hollywood stars Hugh Jackman, Sarah Jessica Parker, David Oyelowo, Busy Philipps, Rita Wilson, Robin Wright, Connie Britton, Millie Bobby Brown, Danai Gurira, and others have giving health experts their social media accounts for 24-hours to various health experts. A video has been released to announce the campaign. Watch below: <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> Dr. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of President Donald Trump’s White House task force, has become a household name, from joining late-night TV shows to celebrity podcast programs to promote the administration’s message about it’s response to how people should best take care of their health in response to the Chinese coronavirus.  Dr. Fauci even once said he’d like to be played by Brad Pitt in any future movie portrayal of the coronavirus crisis. Saturday Night Live was happy to oblige with Pitt, who played Dr. Fauci in a skit last month. Watch below: <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> Just the same, Dr. Fauci has often publicly contradicted the president, for instance on when and how quickly to reopen schools and America’s economy.  Roberts held a Q&A with Dr. Fauci discussing how the developing world can best respond to the deadly virus that originated in China. “This gets to a fundamental problem that we have to deal with and that is the extraordinary health disparities in the developing world. Right now, in, if you take southern Africa sub saharan Africa, parts of Asia, South America, and even parts of the Caribbean, as areas that don’t have the healthcare system to be able to respond the way one can respond in New York or LA or New Orleans or Chicago. We have really a moral responsibility for people throughout the world. I mean if you’re in the developed world, you know and we did that when we developed a PEPFAR program, we felt that we had a responsibility to the developing world that they should not suffer more or more easily just because where they happen to have been born.” Watch below:  The #PassTheMic campaign, announced Wednesday, is part of the ONE World Campaign and calls “for a global response to COVID-19 that protects the most vulnerable, supports people worst hit economically, strengthens health systems and creates a more just and equal world.” The “PassTheMIC” social media takeovers will last throughout May and into June. The launch of the campaign comes on the heels of President Trump’s message to the World Health Organization, warning that it will permanently lose U.S. funding unless it commits to “major substantive improvements within the next 30 days.” Trump suspended U.S. funding to the United Nations subsidiary last month, as Breitbart News reported, noting then the W.H.O. played a key role in “mismanaging and covering up” the global spread of the deadly Chinese coronavirus.

Casualties at the hands of jihadis during the first three weeks of Ramadan hit a grim milestone, exceeding 1,000 with 584 fatalities and 587 injuries, data compiled by Breitbart News shows. This report covers April 24, the first full day of the holy month, through May 14. On average, Islamic terrorists killed about 28 people and injured an estimated 28 others during that three-week period. There were an estimated 56 casualties, which include fatalities and injuries, each day. Islamic terrorist attacks have continued seemingly undeterred during Ramadan despite the ongoing Chinese coronavirus pandemic and the associated lockdowns. Jihadis from the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL), the second deadliest-group during the holiest month for Muslims, have reportedly dubbed their efforts the “Battle of Ramadan.” This year, the number of casualties, which includes deaths and injuries, is on pace to exceed those from 2019. The 1,171 casualties (584 fatalities, 587 injuries) during the first three weeks of the holy month have already surpassed the 1,087 (531 fatalities, 556 injuries) during the same period last year by about ten percent. The Afghan Taliban remains the bloodiest and most prolific group, with 76 attacks (264 deaths, 278 injuries). Taliban narco-jihadis are responsible for about half all the attacks and casualties, respectively. During Ramadan’s ongoing month, there have been 164 attacks in 18 countries, the vast majority in Afghanistan. Despite the fall of its so-called caliphate early last year, ISIS continues to wreak havoc in what some monitor groups and news outlets have described as a potential resurgence, mainly in Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan. ISIS is the second-deadliest terrorist group during Ramadan, responsible for the most bloody single-day attack (32 fatalities, 133 injuries), which took place at a funeral in Afghanistan on May 12. In the last few weeks, the group has carried out some of the deadliest attacks in months in Iraq and Afghanistan. This week’s count covers the heinous attack on a maternity ward in the Afghan capital of Kabul that left at least 24 people dead, including mothers and newborns, and 16 people injured. While the U.S. blames ISIS’s wing in Afghanistan for the attack, Kabul blames the Taliban. Breitbart News’ Ramadan count did not assign the responsibility for the attack to either group, but as both potential culprits subscribe to jihadist ideology, the attack is almost certainly jihadist in nature. Early this year, the United States and the Taliban signed a preliminary agreement to pave the way for intra-Afghan negotiations and the withdrawal of U.S.-led foreign forces. The vast majority of the victims of the Ramadan attacks are Muslims. Breitbart News recorded some attacks by militants from unknown groups using Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) in areas within the Sahel region of Africa, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Syria, known to be jihadi hotbeds. IED is a preferred weapon of jihadis, known to urge their members and supporters to engage in jihad on Ramadan, believing that martyrs will get extra rewards in paradise. Despite these attempts, violence is entirely dissonant with Ramadan for most Muslims. Most of them follow the tradition of abstaining from eating, drinking, smoking, having sex, and other physical needs each day, starting from before the break of dawn until sunset during Ramadan. Breitbart News primarily gleans its tally from the Religion of Peace website and the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) in coordination with news and government reports. This report only includes incidents where Breitbart News has corroborated those reports and online entities that monitor jihadi activity. It also omits attacks where the jihadist nature of the perpetrators is not clear, including attacks where no group has taken responsibility in an area where terrorists of non-jihadist ideologies are also present. The overall number of attacks and the associated casualties could be higher, given that Breitbart News is not able to confirm all incidents. Moreover, monitor groups do not document all terror events online. Death and injury figures may change as some victims succumb to their wounds. For the most part, the tally excludes casualties suffered by jihadis. Some of the documented incidents in Syria may inadvertently include deaths and injuries sustained by rebel groups with Islamic terrorist ties. All the terrorist attacks so far during Ramadan 2020, as documented by Breitbart News, include: April 24 — Badghis, Afghanistan — Taliban kills 13 local policemen and takes eight other prisoners in the village of Laman in Qala-e-Naw City.

The Catholic Bishops of Minnesota have written an open letter announcing the resumption of public Masses as of May 26, in defiance of lockdown restrictions set by the state’s Democrat governor Tim Walz. Many people of faith “were disappointed in Governor Walz’s May 13 announcement that he would end the Stay-at-Home order to allow more commerce but prohibit religious gatherings of more than ten people,” an order that “defies reason,” declares the May 20 letter, signed by Minnesota’s six Catholic bishops as well as the diocesan administrator of the Diocese of Duluth. Insisting that the life of faith is “essential,” the bishops declare that they have given Catholic parishes “permission for the resumption of the public celebration of Mass on Tuesday, May 26, which will give us time to be ready for the celebration of Pentecost on May 31.” “Parishes will be required to follow the strict protocols we have published for sanitation and social distancing and will have to limit attendance to one-third of the seating capacity of the church,” they state. “No one will be obliged to attend, as the bishops of Minnesota will continue to dispense from the obligation to attend Sunday Mass.” The bishops take pains to point out their ongoing efforts to work collaboratively with the Walz Administration as well as their overarching concern for the spiritual and physical well-being of their flock, while also noting the injustice of the governor’s arbitrary targeting of religious practice for especially strict regulation. The letter notes that both the Catholic hierarchy and “some Lutheran colleagues” submitted a joint plan to the Governor on May 8 detailing their sanitation measures and proposing a cap on church attendance limited to 33 percent of building capacity, a plan that the governor rejected. “Given our willingness to coordinate with the Governor, we are especially disappointed that his most recent order (20-56) does not address both the vital importance that faith plays in the lives of Americans, especially in this time of pandemic, and the fundamental religious freedom possessed by houses of worship that allows our country to thrive,” the bishops declare. “The Governor’s remarks today further underscored a failure to appreciate the role of our Church and other faith groups in serving the community,” they said. “The human cost to this pandemic has been extraordinary, not just in terms of lives lost to the virus but the rapidly growing problems of job loss, depression, crime and violence, and substance abuse.” The bishops affirm their unanimous “conviction” that they can safely resume public Masses in accordance with both our religious duties and with accepted public health and safety standards. The letter further notes that while Catholic parishes in Minnesota have permission to reopen for worship on May 26, none is obliged to do so. It also states that the bishops have encouraged those most at risk to stay home. The bishops conclude their letter with a section on the respective rights and responsibilities of civil government and Church leaders, noting that the decision to suspend parish activities, Catholic schools, and the public celebration of Mass was made by the bishops themselves prior to any executive orders by the governor. “Our decision to suspend the public celebration of Mass was painful,” they add. “We made that decision not because we were compelled to do so, but because we judged that the circumstances required it. We believe that those circumstances have changed, as confirmed by the Governor’s decision to end the Stay-at-Home order and allow more commerce.” With the reopening of shopping malls and other establishments, “how can reason require us any longer to keep our faithful from the Eucharist?” they ask. “We are blessed to live in a nation that guarantees the free exercise of religion,” they state. “This right can only be abridged for a compelling governmental interest, and only in a way that is narrowly tailored to be the least restrictive means of achieving the desired end.” “We think that the executive order issued last Wednesday fails this test. An order that sweeps so broadly that it prohibits, for example, a gathering of 11 people in a Cathedral with a seating capacity of several thousand defies reason,” they add. “Therefore, we have chosen to move forward in the absence of any specific timeline laid out by Governor Walz and his Administration,” they state. “We cannot allow an indefinite suspension of the public celebration of the Mass.” Follow @tdwilliamsrome

China’s increasingly strident propaganda attacks on the U.S. and Europe are a disgrace, President Donald Trump said late Wednesday, adding the campaign “comes from the top.” “[China’s Foreign Ministry] Spokesman [Zhao Lijian] speaks stupidly on behalf of China, trying desperately to deflect the pain and carnage that their country spread throughout the world. Its disinformation and propaganda attack on the United States and Europe is a disgrace,” Trump said on Twitter. He then pointed to the very top of the Chinese Communist Party in general and dictator Xi Jinping in particular, saying the anti-Western rhetoric “all comes from the top. They could have easily stopped the plague, but they didn’t!” “China is on a massive disinformation campaign because they are desperate to have Sleepy Joe Biden win the presidential race so they can continue to rip-off the United States, as they have done for decades, until I came along!,” he added. ….It all comes from the top. They could have easily stopped the plague, but they didn’t! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 21, 2020  China is on a massive disinformation campaign because they are desperate to have Sleepy Joe Biden win the presidential race so they can continue to rip-off the United States, as they have done for decades, until I came along! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 21, 2020  Trump has never backed away from challenging Chinese officials for trying to shift blame for the coronavirus pandemic that started in the southern China city of Wuhan late last year. Beijing’s response is to plead it did nothing wrong in handling the virus which has now spread to become a deadly global problem. Earlier in the day, the president blasted an unnamed official from the Communist government for comments on the pandemic. “Some wacko in China just released a statement blaming everybody other than China for the Virus which has now killed hundreds of thousands of people,” Trump wrote on Twitter on Wednesday morning, as Breitbart News reported. “Please explain to this dope that it was the ‘incompetence of China,’ and nothing else, that did this mass Worldwide killing!” Trump wrote. Some wacko in China just released a statement blaming everybody other than China for the Virus which has now killed hundreds of thousands of people. Please explain to this dope that it was the “incompetence of China”, and nothing else, that did this mass Worldwide killing! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 20, 2020  As Breitbart News reported, Beijing systematically prevented awareness of contagious disease control in the early days of the Wuhan outbreak, but is now promising to invest $2 billion in Chinese coronavirus response in the next two years and offer the world free access to a Chinese-made anti-coronavirus vaccine once it is developed.

Seven-in-ten Americans believe that wearing a mask in public is a “sign of respectfulness,” according to a YouGov poll released on Wednesday. The YouGov/HuffPost poll also found that 62 percent of Americans believe that wearing a mask is “more of a matter of public health than a matter of public choice” while nearly two-thirds of those surveyed said “they always or mostly wear a face mask or other covering when they’re in public and near other people (while grocery shopping, for instance).” The survey also found that 83 percent of Americans do not believe wearing a mask is a “sign of weakness” while just 8 percent believe it is “a sign of weakness to wear a face mask when in public and near other people.” A majority of Americans (63 percent) also believe that President Donald Trump and other government officials should wear masks in public and near others. These results are consistent with previous polling on masks. A Washington Post-University of Maryland poll released last week found that nearly 80 percent of Americans believe masks are “necessary” to wear outside the home, and a Morning Consult/Politico poll found that 70 percent of Americans believe Trump and Vice President Mike Pence should wear masks in public. The YouGov/HuffPost poll was conducted May 14-16 and has a margin of error of +/-4.1 percentage points.

On Wednesday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “The Last Word,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) stated that coronavirus tests, tracing, and treatment, funding for state, local, tribal, and territorial governments, direct payments and unemployment insurance, OSHA standards, funding for the Postal Service, vote by mail, and SNAP benefits are the “seven hills of Rome,” that House Democrats are “there to make sure prevail when we go to the table for negotiation” on the next coronavirus aide package. Pelosi began by saying that coronavirus “testing, tracing, and treatment” along with funding for state, local, tribal, and territorial governments and “injecting funds into our — the pockets of the American people with what we have with direct payments, unemployment insurance, etc.” are the “three pillars of the HEROES Act.” Which are built on provisions that were included in previous coronavirus legislation. She continued that OSHA standards, funding for the U.S. Postal Service, “voting at home,” and SNAP benefits are the additional four planks of the legislation. Pelosi concluded, “And so, those are what I call the seven hills of Rome, the three original pillars, the four issues that I just mentioned, that we’re there to make sure prevail when we go to the table for negotiation.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

Wednesday on Fox News Channel’s “The Story,” Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) dismissed complaints from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) about President Donald Trump’s focus on China for its part in the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Hawley scoffed at Pelosi’s characterization of Trump’s rhetoric on the communist Chinese as a “diversion.” “I would say if you think China is a diversion from the challenges that the United States faces, then you’re not living in reality,” Hawley said. “You need to come back to planet Earth. China is the single-greatest national security threat to this country. More than that, Martha — they’re the single-greatest economic threat. We’ve been losing jobs to China for years. We’ve been losing manufacturing to China for years. Now they’re building up their military, even as they unleash this pandemic on the world. We’ve got to change our relationship with China and the time to do it is right now.” The Missouri Republican signaled things would be different regarding the United States’ relationship with China from this point forward. “We’re just getting started in terms of standing up to them as a nation,” he added. “I can tell you — Beijing needs to understand that the free ride is over. The United States is back. We are going to protect ourselves and rebuild a better world for the 21st century.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor

On Wednesday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “The Last Word,” host Lawrence O’Donnell said that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is “two sneezes away from the presidency, with the fact that the president and vice president are not taking the necessary precautions.” During his opening monologue, O’Donnell said that the president “does have a plan to protect himself from the coronavirus pandemic. He requires everyone who works for him to be tested every day. He requires anyone who’s coming to see him to be tested before they’re allowed to be in a room with him.” Later, while introducing Pelosi, O’Donnell stated that she “is second in the line of succession for the presidency.” He explained, “[T]he reason I mention tonight, the line of succession for the presidency is that Mike Pence was in Florida today, very proudly having a hamburger with the governor of Florida, wearing no mask, not taking the recommended precautions. Donald Trump, obviously, doesn’t wear a mask. He’s going to go to a Ford factory tomorrow, where he surely will not be wearing a mask, not be taking all the precautions. And so, there’s that old saying that the vice president is a heartbeat away from the presidency, but it seems tonight, you are two sneezes away from the presidency, with the fact that the president and vice president are not taking the necessary precautions.” O’Donnell then asked Pelosi if she is “concerned about that situation with the president and the vice president, their lack of precautions?” Pelosi responded that she prays for both Trump’s and Pence’s safety, but her concern is that they are setting a bad example. She further noted that both Trump and Pence are surrounded by doctors, but people who follow their example aren’t. Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

Anti-government “extremists” seeking to terrorize Americans have infiltrated the anti-coronavirus lockdown movement and are baselessly accusing governors of trampling on civil rights, panelists argued during a virtual forum Wednesday held by Democrats on the House Homeland Security Committee. Reps. Max Rose (D-NY) and Emanuel Cleaver (D-MO) hosted the event on extremism during the coronavirus outbreak. Jonathan Greenblatt, the head of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) declared: Extremists are taking their hate to the streets marching alongside other angry Americans. We see anti-government extremists and militia members accusing governors across the country of trampling on their civil rights even as those governors desperately try to manage one of the most confounding health crises in our country’s 240 some odd year history. Outside the state capitol in Michigan, protesters angry over the restrictive anti-virus lockdown, including some carrying guns, have demanded that Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) end the shutdown. Similar protests have broken out across the country in response to coronavirus shutdowns that have devastated the American economy with the worst unemployment rates since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Panelist Ali Soufan, a former FBI counterterrorism agent who now heads the Soufan Group, a security consulting firm, grouped so-called “extremists” within the anti-lockdown movement with white supremacists, saying: Extremists are quick to make use of conspiracies and polarizing narratives in order to radicalize, recruit, and call for acts to violence, which poses a direct threat to the safety of the American people. Specifically, White supremacists blame Jews, immigrants, foreigners, and other minorities, like Asian Americans, for the pandemic. Anti-government extremists use the stay-at-home orders and other policies perceived as infringing on individual freedoms as an excuse to stockpile weapons. Soufan indicated that all those “extremists” have joined forces and are feeding off each other during the ongoing pandemic, pushing coronavirus disinformation. “All these anti-government people, the hate people, anti-semitic people, they are getting together, and now we are starting seeing them capitalizing on each other’s conspiracies and piggybacking off them,” he said. “All these movements are in a way celebrating together COVID-19 [coronavirus illness] because they feel that this is their opportunity to destroy the system that they don’t believe in,” Soufan added. Soufan and Greenblatt acknowledged that Islamic terrorists, like the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) and al-Qaeda, are also exploiting the coronavirus pandemic plaguing the world.

Wednesday on MSNBC, Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez accused President Donald Trump of attempting to “steal the election” by opposing vote-by-mail during the coronavirus pandemic. Host Chris Hayes said, “For more on the president’s efforts to subvert the democratic process, I’m joined by the chair of the Democratic National Committee. I’m always conflicted about, you know, stories of the variety the president tweeted. He tweets a lot of things and most of it is nonsense or lies or liable or slander or whatever. But the way he attacked absentee voting today struck me as genuinely dangerous and genuinely sort of threatening to democracy. How high on the priority list is it for you to do what you can to the safeguard administration of free and fair elections this fall?” Perez said, “It’s the highest priority, Chris because we know that you’re going to see voter suppression on steroids in the months ahead. We had a conversation I know about the election in Wisconsin recently where they tried to weaponize the pandemic to suppress the vote and steal the state supreme court race. It failed miserably. That’s what you’re going to see.” Hayes said, “I want to play for you something the president just said about voting, which struck me as deeply pernicious, this sort of voting is an honor and going off about how he doesn’t want people mail-in voting. Take a listen.” In a clip, Trump said, “Common sense would tell you it’s massive manipulation can take place, massive. They — and you do —you have cases of fraudulent ballots where they actually print them and give them to people to sign, maybe the same person signs them with different writing, different pens. I don’t know. A lot of things can happen. If you can, you should go and vote. Voting is an honor. It shouldn’t be something where they send you a pile of stuff, and you send it back.” Perez said, “Voting isn’t simply an honor, Chris, voting is a fundamental right. People pay the ultimate price to exercise the right to vote. And in a pandemic, the notion that you have a president going after Republican and Democratic secretaries of state in the middle of a pandemic, Secretary Benson is trying to make it easier for eligible people to exercise their right to vote. She’s trying to allow them to exercise the choice that the Michigan Constitution provides them.” He added, “What we have to do between now and November is make sure that every single voter in every single state has a choice. The choice to vote on election day. So the choice to early vote, the more days of early voting, the more social distancing you do and the right to vote absentee with no excuse, the right to vote by mail. Republicans and Democrats agree on that. This president, in a desperate effort to steal an election, is going to stop at nothing.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

On Wednesday’s broadcast of CNN’s “Situation Room,” Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms (D) stated that Georgia seems to be “doing better as a state,” and that while there are lags in infections, under the state’s reopening, “things are not as bad as I thought that they would be, yet.” Bottoms began by expressing concern about the worldwide spike in cases and by noting that “we’ve had so many questions about the data in our state and whether or not it’s accurate data, and I think really the telltale sign for so many of us will be what will be the impact on our hospitals.” She continued, “I know in Georgia, we are dismantling the expansion that we had in our World Congress Center. I hope it’s not too soon. But, right now, based on our analysis of the data that we have from the state, we are about on a ten-day decline. We need four more days, of course, to be in that 14-day decline that we have been awaiting.” Bottoms added, “Well, again, we are about ten days in. So, if we had followed the CDC guidelines, we would be four more days, and then we could begin to relieve some of those restrictions that were in place, but that being said, things are not as bad as I thought that they would be, yet. And I am very hopeful that they continue that way. But, as we know, with COVID-19, there’s often a lag in infections and when people begin to actually show symptoms and get sick. And so, right now, it appears that we’re doing better as a state, and I’ll keep watching and waiting.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

While President Trump takes steps to bring vital industries back to the United States, the Chamber of Commerce is already warning that the U.S. must continue to be reliant on foreign countries for goods, products, and supplies. This week, Trump announced a multi-million contract with Phlow Corporation, based in Richmond, Virginia, to begin returning pharmaceutical production to the U.S. “This is a great day for America,” White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said of the move. “This has all of the elements of the Trump strategy. It’s made in the USA. It’s innovation that will allow American workers to compete with the pollution havens, sweatshops, and tax havens of the world.” In an online conference, reported by Reuters, Chamber of Commerce CEO Tom Donohue said the U.S. must not reshore all of its production back to America and must stay reliant on foreign supply chains. “Protecting the resiliency of our supply chain doesn’t have to mean reshoring all production in the United States,” Donohue said. Donohue said there will “continue to be a huge place in the U.S. economy for a global supply chain.” As Breitbart News has chronicled, the U.S. has suffered from a shortage of vital drugs, rubber gloves, and plastic bottles due to decades-long free trade policies. The plurality of these basic necessities are made in China. Research by the Coalition for a Prosperous America (CPA) has revealed that reshoring all pharmaceutical production to the U.S. would create more than 800,000 American jobs. Likewise, reshoring all medical supplies to the U.S. has the potential to create more than 300,000 American jobs. For years, economic nationalists have urged the Trump administration to make permanent its 25 percent tariffs on billions of Chinese imports. CPA economists have said that a permanent 25 percent tariff on all Chinese imports would bring a million jobs back to the U.S. by 2024. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

A Tula, Russia, nurse is facing penalties for wearing nothing but a “swimming suit” beneath a clear protective suit along with gloves and goggles in the COVID-19 ward. First reported by local Russian newspaper Tula Pressa, the unidentified nurse was originally accused of wearing nothing but “lingerie” under her translucent personal protective equipment (PPE). Later, hospital administration admitted that the outfit was, in fact, merely a two-piece bathing suit. The unnamed nurse claimed that she was not aware that her (lack of) outfit was visible through the gear and that it was simply too hot on the coronavirus treatment ward to wear anything more. The hospital cited her for “non-compliance with the requirements for medical clothing,” and told The Sun that “a disciplinary sanction was applied to the nurse of the infectious diseases department who violated [uniform] requirements.” Despite the uproar, the hospital reported receiving “no complaints” from patients under her care, although one admitted feeling “some embarrassment.” In fact, many Russians responded to the viral story by applauding the stunt: “At least someone has a sense of humor in this gloomy, gloomy reality,” said Sergey Ratnikov. “Well done, she raised the mood of the patients,” another said. “Why punish the nurse?” someone asked. “You need to reward her. Seeing this outfit, no one wants to die.”

In a troubling sign for the exhibition industry, a new survey has found that the majority of consumers now prefer to watch new movies at home as fears about the Chinese coronavirus continue to outweigh the urge to go out. The study — which polled 1,000 consumers — asked if they would prefer to watch a new movie as a digital rental at home or in a traditional cinema. An overwhelming 70 percent of respondents said they are more likely to watch it at home while just 13 percent said they are more likely to venture out to the cinema. The remaining 17 percent of those polled said they were unsure. The study was performed by the analytics firm Performance Research, in partnership with Full Circle Research Co. The results were published Wednesday in Variety. John David Washington and Robert Pattinson in Tenet (Warner Bros. Pictures, 2020) Patrons watch a 3D IMAX movie at a theater of Wanda cinema run by Dalian Wanda Group Co. in Beijing, China, Monday, May 21, 2012. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan) “Just as the country begins to open up there has been a swing toward increasing caution, with a majority of Americans clearly saying ‘not yet’ when it comes to attending large public events,”  Jed Pearsall, president of Performance Research, told the Hollywood trade publication. Movie theaters around the country shut down in late March as the Chinese virus surged through the U.S. Except for a small number of cinemas, the vast majority of theaters remain closed. The indefinite hiatus has put the future of major chains including AMC Theatres and Regal Cinemas in jeopardy. Justin Timberlake and Anna Kendrick in Trolls World Tour (DreamWorks Animation, 2020) The major Hollywood studios are using the forced shutdown to experiment with releasing some of their titles directly to digital home video. Universal’s animated musical Trolls World Tour was the first major studio title to skip cinemas during the outbreak, followed recently by Warner Bros.’ animated Scoob! NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell recently said that more titles will skip movie theaters going forward. “I would expect that consumers will return to the theaters and we will be part of that. And I also expect that PVOD [premium video on demand] is going to be a part of that in some way. It’s not a replacement, it’s going to be a complementary element,” he said during an earnings call in April. His statements — as well as the digital success of Trolls World Tour — prompted AMC Theatres to say that its cinemas won’t show Universal movies in the future. The U.S. box office has been in decline in recent years as Netflix and other streaming options have kept more Americans at home. Last year’s domestic office dropped nearly 4 percent, its largest decline in five years. Follow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg. Have a tip? Contact me at dng@breitbart.com

It would cost nearly $440 million to test every nursing home resident and staff member in the United States once for COVID-19, according to data collected by the American Health Care Association (AHCA) and the National Center for Assisted Living (NCAL). The AHCA has also warned that regular testing of nursing home residents and staff members would be almost impossible without support from federal and state funding. Due to the differing amounts of residents and staff members in each state, some states would see a multi-million dollar bill for testing. States with numerous residents where it would cost the most to test nursing home residents and staff members include California ($36,381,000), New York ($33,955,950), Florida ($25,305,300), Ohio ($24,950,250), and Illinois ($21,441,150). Areas with fewer residents and staff members where testing would be cheaper include the District of Columbia ($755,850), Hawaii ($1,229,550), Deleware ($1,340,250), Montana ($1,383,750), and Idaho ($1,415,700). “For months now, we have been advocating for expanded and priority testing in nursing homes to protect our residents and caregivers, but this is a significant undertaking and cost for nursing homes to shoulder on their own,” said Mark Parkinson, President, and CEO of American Health Care Association and National Center of Assisted Living. “That’s why we have asked HHS to grant our request for a $10 billion emergency relief to help fund expedited testing and the additional staffing needed to respond to this unprecedented health crisis,” Parkinson added. The AHCA has also insisted that initial payments be made to each facility based on the number of residents and its size. In its recommendation, the association concluded that if a facility has 50 and under licensed beds, it should receive $50,000. Facilities with between 51 and 100 beds should receive $100,000, facilities with between 101 and 200 beds should receive $150,000, and facilities with more than 200 beds should receive $200,000. The AHCA and the NCAL also issued a joint statement to The U.S. Department of Health & Human Services and Federal Emergency Management Agency: A facility with COVID-19 positive residents would also receive an additional payment in the same amount as reflected above, to target buildings with an outbreak of any size. With all nursing homes now required to submit this data to CDC on a weekly basis, it allows for identification of these facilities more readily. Of the 15,000 Skilled Nursing Facilities in the U.S., the average initial payment would be around $120,000 for a total of $1.8 billion. Of those, roughly 5,000 have COVID-19 positive residents today, so the cost of the additional payment would be $600 million. A $10 billion fund would allow these payments to continue for three to four months. While there is likely a more targeted way to distribute funds, we need help immediately. We encourage HHS to use this formula, or another simple one, and then perhaps, consider a more targeted approach after the first month. We respectfully request that HHS and FEMA provide this urgent request for funding and additional supplies to help the long term care profession during this unprecedented public health crisis to protect our beloved residents and heroic caregivers. What we need now is to rally around nursing homes and assisted living communities the same way the public health sector has around hospitals. The data collected by the AHCA and the NCAL does not include the cost to test residents and staff at assisted living facilities and other long term care locations across the country.

Drugs can be manufactured in America more quickly, efficiently, and with better quality control than in China, said Rosemary Gibson, senior adviser at the Hastings Center and author of China Rx: Exposing the Risks of America’s Dependence on China for Medicine, offering her comments in an interview on Tuesday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with host Rebecca Mansour and special guest host John Hayward. Gibson explained processes allowing for competitive domestic production of medicines relative to foreign competitors. “We will have brilliant minds that will be using, for the first time, advanced manufacturing technology to make our basic medicines — these generic drugs — and they’ll make them faster, cheaper, with a smaller environmental footprint, and have real-time quality control,” Gibson said. “We’ll be doing all of that right here in the U.S.A.” Gibson added, “There’s been a traditional way of making drugs. It’s like making it in batches, like you might make spaghetti sauce in batches, but this is a sort of continuous process that’s been used in the chemical industry for a hundred years.” LISTEN:
 Gibson remarked, “In the pharma sector, there hasn’t been the innovation in how medicines are made, and with more of a continuous process, they can be made much faster, and you don’t need such a huge physical infrastructure. You still need large facilities, but you have a smaller facility footprint because the process is so much more efficient.” Gibson went on, “I’ll give you an example of how this works on a small scale. There’s technology now where — and it’s my lay term — it’s in a washing machine-sized box that these incredible engineers and chemists are making a thousand doses of an antibiotic in a lab in 24 hours, and we have the opportunity, eventually, to take this to scale.” “This is bringing new advanced manufacturing to a sector that has not invested in it but, with support of public and private sectors, that’s exactly what’s going to happen,” added Gibson. Gibson estimated, “This is starting a revolution in our country, and I’m hoping that more companies here in the United States will want to step up to the plate. Even better, [Phlow] is a company that is now a public benefit corporation, and it started the process to be a B corporation and that means [the company must] have a social mission [and] make a contribution to society.” Gibson shared, “I was asked to be an independent unpaid director to ensure that the company fulfills this mission for society. This is not something where we want taxpayers to be gouged on their drugs — this has happened too much in our country — and so it’s great to see people that want to do things for the right reasons.” On Tuesday, the White House announced its awarding of a $354 million contract with Phlow, a pharmaceutical manufacturer located in Richmond, VA, to manufacture medicines in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The federal government’s contract with Phlow includes a partnership with Virginia Commonwealth University and Civica Rx, noted Gibson. Gibson said, “[Civica Rx] is a non-profit group that is a consortium of about 1,300 hospitals, started by the Mayo Clinic and others. These private hospitals want to buy medicines that aren’t made in China, and so they could be a customer of the products that would be produced in this plant.” Gibson continued, “So we have the federal government that’s going to be asking these folks to make drugs for the Strategic National Stockpile, and they’ll also be making products for private hospitals in the United States. It’s a great public-private partnership, and I hope more federal agencies will come on board, and I hope that more hospitals and other private sector purchasers of medicines will eventually see the wisdom of buying medicines made in America.” Gibson explained how China’s mercantilist policies had destroyed much of America’s domestic pharmaceutical production. “We opened up free trade with China in 2000,” stated Gibson, “and within a couple of years of that free trade agreement with China being signed, that’s when the last penicillin plant in the U.S. closed. That’s when the last aspirin plant closed. We can’t make it anymore. The last vitamin C plant closed.” Gibson went on, “Bad trade deals, and China came in and cheated. They dumped [drugs] at below-market prices. They kept them low for several years, and they drove out American business as you can’t compete. If you and I want to set up a business tomorrow to make medicines, China could come in the next day and undercut us and drive us out of business.” Contracts between domestic drug manufacturers and large institutional purchasers of medicines are the ideal strategy to restore U.S. pharmaceutical production and counter China’s predatory pricing, determined Gibson. U.S.-based drug companies need “contracts with the government [and] with hospitals that lock in a fair price,” concluded Gibson, “not too low so we can’t keep our machines running properly, but not too high to gouge taxpayers and the public. Those long-term contracts [provide] an agreement that we’re going to work together to supply quality medicine. Once you have those, China can’t undercut those.” A restoration of domestic generic drug manufacturing would create “hundreds of thousands of good-paying STEM jobs,” added Gibson.

President Trump’s border controls have greatly reduced the strain that illegal immigration once put on American hospitals near the United States-Mexico border. Since March 21, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Title 42 order went into effect, U.S. Border Patrol agents have only taken about 230 border crossers to nearby American hospitals for treatment. Before the CDC order, Border Patrol agents told Breitbart News they were admitting about 75 border crossers every day to American hospitals, or more than 2,200 border crossers a month. In February, Border Patrol took more than 2,000 border crossers to American hospitals. The CDC order, which has cut illegal immigration by 84 percent and given Border Patrol agents the ability to swiftly deport border crossers, has helped drop that strain on American hospitals by 94 percent in just two months. In recent months, American citizens living in northern Mexico have started traveling to southern California for health care, inundating local hospitals. Border Patrol agents said there is no federal statute that prevents American citizens from traveling back to the U.S. to receive better medical treatment. As Breitbart News reported, Trump is readying a broader public health regulation to extend Border Patrol’s ability to have control over the southern border with quick apprehension and deportation rates.

President Donald Trump and his administration are currently considering a travel ban on Brazil after the South American country’s confirmed number of infections hit 275,000, the third-highest number of nationwide cases worldwide. Brazil surpassed the United Kingdom on Monday to become the country with the third-highest number of confirmed cases, behind Russia and the United States. Tuesday saw the number of cases rise by a record 17,408 people, with over 275,000 now having tested positive for the virus. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Trump admitted the country was “having some trouble” with coronavirus and a travel ban was under consideration. “We are considering it,” he said. “We hope that we’re not going to have a problem. The governor of Florida is doing very, very well testing – in particular Florida, because a big majority come into Florida. Brazil has gone more or less ‘herd’ [immunity, an attempt to maximize exposure to the virus], and they’re having problems.”  “I don’t want people coming over here and infecting our people,” he added. “I don’t want people over there sick either.” After nearly two months of quarantine, the United States is in the process of gradually reopening its economy after recording the highest number of cases worldwide. All 50 states have now begun easing lockdown measures in a bid to kickstart the American economy, which has shrunk at its fastest rate since the 2008 financial crisis. The most severely affected region of Brazil is the city of São Paulo, where Mayor Bruno Covas warned this weekend that the healthcare system could soon be overwhelmed if people refuse to abide by social distancing guidelines. “The city is coming to the limit of options,” Bruno Covas told journalists Sunday, warning that nine in ten intensive care beds were full. “We need to decide if we want to test the limits, or if we will be prudent and firmly maintain social isolation for the time needed so that the health system doesn’t collapse. We are closer than we would like.” Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro did not respond to Trump’s remarks when speaking to reporters on Wednesday, but he did confirm that Brazil’s Health Ministry would issue guidelines on the use of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for the coronavirus. Bolsonaro has sharply divided public opinion with his response to the outbreak, having repeatedly downplayed its significance and warned of the potentially devastating economic impact of lockdown measures. He has sharply antagonized regional governors who have chosen to implement lockdown measures, inspiring crowds to take the streets and protest.  Bolsonaro’s resistance to coronavirus safety measures resulted in the expulsion last month of then-Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta on the grounds that Mandetta did not appreciate the importance of ending lockdown measures as soon as possible.

Rebekah Jones, the woman inaccurately described as an “architect” and “scientist” behind Florida’s COVID-19 dashboard, sparked a political firestorm after claiming she was fired for refusing to manipulate data to “drum up support for the plan to reopen.” However, her accounts, including her claim of starting the dashboard “from scratch,” are falling apart as her patterns of questionable behavior — from getting booked for battery on a police officer in 2016 to facing active criminal charges of cyber stalking and cyber sexual harassment — emerge to the spotlight. Critics have long scrutinized Gov. Ron DeSantis’s (R) handling of the Chinese coronavirus in Florida. He initially exercised a tailored approach, laying a general groundwork and allowing localities to impose more drastic measures depending on the situations in their specific areas. DeSantis eventually issued a stay-at-home order for the state, but his success has been widely attributed to other decisions, including screening individuals hailing from coronavirus hotspots — installing checkpoints along the Florida-Alabama, Florida-Georgia border, and major Florida airports — and taking swift action to protect residents of nursing homes. Unlike his blue state counterparts, which directed such facilities to accept coronavirus patients, DeSantis’s administration virtually locked down nursing homes, imposing strict restrictions on those entering the facilities. As a result, Florida has seen far less cases and fatalities related to the virus despite the Sunshine State’s older, more vulnerable population. Although the current data speaks to the success of DeSantis’s approach, critics saw another opening for criticism after Rebekah Jones, who was widely and inaccurately described as an “architect” of the highly esteemed COVID-19 dashboard, claimed she was removed from her post for refusing to “manually change data to drum up support for the plan to reopen.” The Tampa Bay Times reported that officials “had directed her to remove data from public view that showed Floridians reported symptoms of the disease before cases were officially announced” — something Jones apparently viewed as “the wrong call.” “I understand, appreciate, and even share your concern about all the dramatic changes that have occurred and those that are yet to come,” Jones said in a letter regarding her departure. “As a word of caution, I would not expect the new team to continue the same level of accessibility and transparency that I made central to the process during the first two months. After all, my commitment to both is largely (arguably entirely) the reason I am no longer managing it,” she added. Despite her past claims and implications, Jones did not create the dashboard, nor did she analyze the data. The dashboard was created by Esri, a company providing geographic information system software. Additionally, Jones was part of an eight-person team tasked with visualizing the data reported by the 67 Florida counties. Furthermore, Jones has been inaccurately described as a scientist heading the project — another assertion that is false. She holds a PhD in geography, is not an epidemiologist, and was ultimately tasked with mapping the data. A source with knowledge of her removal told Breitbart News that Jones was simply asked to change the way that she was visualizing the data — not manipulate results. The Tampa Bay Times also alluded to that fact, explaining that the disagreement involved the temporary disappearance of the “EventDate” column, which “showed when people first reported coronavirus symptoms or positive test results”: For much of the next day, May 5, the column was either missing or empty, with every row listing “None.” Finally, it returned shortly before 8:02 p.m. Times reporters asked Health Department spokesman Alberto Moscoso that day why the data disappeared. Two days later, he said, “This field continues to be represented on the Department’s COVID-19 Dashboard.” In other words, public health experts asked Jones to disable the automatic exportation of data so experts could verify the results, according to an email from Department of Health I.T. Director Craig Curry, who cited Dr. Carina Blackmore, director for the Division of Disease Control and Health Protection, in his request to Jones. “Per Dr. Blackmore, disable the ability to export the data to files from the dashboard immediately. We need to ensure that dates (date fields) in all objects match their counterpart on the PDF line list published,” Curry wrote. DeSantis spokeswoman Helen Aguirre Ferré released a statement on Jones’s removal, noting that she was fired for “insubordination” and explaining that, despite the plentiful mischaracterizations and assumptions, Jones was not tasked with analyzing the data. Her duties “were to display data obtained by the Department’s epidemiological staff.” “The team that created the graphics on the dashboard, which was made up by multiple people, received data that was provided by subject matter experts, including Senior Epidemiologists, Surveillance Epidemiologists, and a Senior Database Analyst,” Ferré stated. She continued: Jones exhibited a repeated course of insubordination during her time with the Department, including her unilateral decisions to modify the Department’s COVID-19 dashboard without input or approval from the epidemiological team or her supervisors. The blatant disrespect for the professionals who were working around the clock to provide the important information for the COVID-19 website was harmful to the team. Accuracy and transparency are always indispensable, especially during an unprecedented public health emergency such as COVID-19. Having someone disruptive cannot be tolerated during this public pandemic, which led the Department to determine that it was best to terminate her employment. Jones’s past adds credence to DeSantis’s office claims of insubordination. During her time as a Louisiana State University (LSU) staff member in 2016, she was booked on “one count of battery on a police officer, one count of remaining after forbidden and two counts of resisting arrest,” according to LSU Police Department spokesperson Lt. Kevin Scott: Scott said officers arrived at the Sea Grant building when Jones refused to leave at the request of LSU Human Resources. Scott said Jones initiated physical contact against two LSUPD officers while resisting arrest and officers were forced to subdue her. She also has quite the rap sheet in Florida’s Leon County. “This woman also has a history, a pretty long track record of some pretty disturbing allegations against her in her personal life,” Real Talk 93.3’s Bobby Mac said on Wednesday’s Real Morning’s show, noting her altercation with a police officer, as well as “multiple restraining orders that have been filed by a former individual in a relationship with her that have been granted.” He also highlighted a “libel lawsuit that has gone against her as well,” adding, “This is a pattern of, I think, nefarious actions on the behalf of this individual.” Jones has also faced accusations of stalking, dating violence, and has been “arrested and charged with three felonies including robbery,” court documents indicate. “She’s not a data scientist. She’s somebody that’s got a degree in journalism, communication, and geography. She is not involved in collating any data,” DeSantis told reporters on Wednesday. “She does not have the expertise to do that. She is not an epidemiologist. She is not the chief architect of our web portal. That is another false statement,” he continued. “And what she was doing was she was putting data on the portal, which the scientists didn’t believe was valid data. So she didn’t listen to the people who were her superiors. She had many people above her in the chain of command,” the governor said, drawing attention to the active criminal charges against Jones in the state of Florida: Come to find out she’s also under active criminal charges in the state of Florida. She’s being charged with cyber stalking and cyber sexual harassment. So I’ve asked the Department of Health to explain to me how someone would be allowed to be charged with that and continue on, because this was many months ago. WATCH: Gov. DeSantis, with VP Pence at his side in Orlando, talks about the criminal charges against Rebekah Jones, sexual cyber harassment and cyberstaking. https://t.co/08X1RNxG1J pic.twitter.com/3fa2qCSFfo — WPEC CBS12 News (@CBS12) May 20, 2020  The governor added that he has a “zero tolerance policy for sexual harassment” and added that Jones should have been dismissed “long before.”

The South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported on Wednesday that, despite copious promises by the Chinese government to crack down on scammers and con artists, they are still preying upon foreign governments and private citizens desperate to buy masks and other protective equipment to combat the Wuhan coronavirus. China has long been the world’s largest producer of such equipment. The current state of the Chinese marketplace was described by knowledgeable observers as sheer chaos: Desperate buyers, many with little experience of doing business in China, have scrambled to secure medical protective equipment at astronomical prices. Export restrictions that appear to change with the wind have confounded customs workers and scuttled shipments. And con artists in China have fed off the frenzy with promises to source medical goods they cannot or will not deliver. To lure overseas buyers into making a purchase, they often make seductive sales pitches, claim false connections with legitimate medical manufacturers, flaunt authentic-looking paperwork and guarantee a speedy passage through customs. Michael Crotty, whose Shanghai-based firm Golden Pacific Fashion & Design is making face masks for export, said the “chaos and dysfunction is hard to describe”. The SCMP investigated the situation by sending reporters to pose as buyers of protective masks, hazmat suits, coronavirus test kits, and other supplies. They found shady characters lurking at every level of the Chinese market pushing dubious products and brandishing fraudulent certifications.  One outfit investigated by the SCMP appeared to have borrowed an unrelated person’s home address in Australia as the nominal location of its “temporary warehouse,” to the great consternation of the woman who lived there. Confronted with this and other sketchy details of his operation, the suspected con man – who claimed he could deliver an improbably large number of ventilators for coronavirus patients – spouted some slogans popularized by Chinese dictator Xi Jinping and then stopped communicating with the reporters. The SCMP said most legitimate sources of hot coronavirus equipment have backorders stretching into the winter, so desperate buyers are taking more chances on dodgy operations pushing low-quality products. Phony paperwork, false claims of ties to legitimate manufacturers, and special deals involving large sums of cash upfront have become common. The reporters said eight of the nine suppliers they investigated “provided documentation made out to different companies” when asked for their bona fides. The general sense conveyed by market experts who spoke with the SCMP is that buyers are so desperate to get their hands on coronavirus supplies that they are taking gambles on sources they know are dicey and allowing themselves to be shaken down for exorbitant prices. The Chinese Communist government is perpetually promising to crack down on scam operations, but Beijing’s efforts to date fall short of those promises and have made the market worse in some ways: After European buyers complained about defective products, China in April tightened export controls on a range of PPE goods. This further roiled medical-goods supply chains, creating confusion at customs and delaying shipments of much-needed cargo. Buyers, freight forwarders and legal professionals have been “befuddled” by vague wording and contradictory information in new export rules, [U.S.-based lawyer Steve] Dickinson said. “[They] put a range of legitimate steps on parties who were exporting, instead of just having it as a free-for-all,” said Nigel Blair, the head of Nihao Global, which has launched a vetted online marketplace for Chinese medical supplies. The market, however, was still rife with “bootleggers” trying to take advantage of the crisis, he added. China’s “gold rush” in mask production as the Wuhan coronavirus spread across the globe inspired over 38,000 companies to register as suppliers, overwhelming the ability of overseas buyers and regulatory agencies to tell good companies from bad. Some of the quality issues appear to stem from factory equipment that was hastily repurposed to create masks instead of other goods, using lower-grade material that was acquired for other purposes. Faulty medical equipment from Chinese suppliers has caused huge problems for buyers in Canada, Spain, the Czech Republic, the United Kingdom, Turkey, and the Netherlands, among others. The Chinese Communist Party has dismissed complaints about low-quality masks by blaming the victims for dealing with unlicensed suppliers, or in one notorious case, accusing the customers of using the defective equipment improperly.

While the major Hollywood studios continue to hammer out safety guidelines for when TV and movie production eventually returns, Tyler Perry is moving full steam ahead with his intention to re-start production at his Atlanta, Georgia, studio in early July, issuing a 30-page document outlining his plan to keep cast and crew members safe. Titled “Camp Quarantine,” the document enumerates the steps that Tyler Perry is taking to perform COVID-19 tests and to ensure that the “quarantine bubble” remains secure. “I want it to be abundantly clear that there was no way I could or would consider putting people back to work without a plan that takes extreme measures to try and mitigate as much risk as possible in our productions, and I think we’ve managed to do just that,” Perry wrote in an introduction to the internal document, which was obtained by The Hollywood Reporter. Perry is set to resume production on two BET series — The Oval and Sistas — on July 7. The shoots are expected to last just two weeks. He has previously stated that all cast and crew will remain on studio property — which is a former military base — for the duration of the shoots in order to minimize exposure.

They will then take private flights to Atlanta arranged by Perry. Cast and crew will be tested multiple times for COVID-19 upon arriving at the studio. “Once inside the quarantine bubble, participants are not permitted to leave for the entire 14-day period,” the document states. “All cast and crew are required to wear face masks at all times. Cast exceptions are during ﬁlming only and/or during make-up application and hair styling as determined necessary.”  Catering services will require people to wash their hands and wear masks before approaching the food area. There will be no self-service and all beverages and condiments will come in closed containers.
 Tyler Perry paid tribute to Charles Gregory Ross, a hair stylist  who came down with COVID-19 shortly after working at the studio and who later died.  “As my crew and I had been working with him on and off for over 15 years, it affects us all deeply as you could imagine. It’s still hard to believe,” Perry wrote.  Perry said that he has been in touch with the various Hollywood trade unions about a collective guild plan that is expected soon. “My team and I will gladly be sure to implement these updates into our existing plan when available.” Follow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg.

With highly competitive college entrance exams scheduled in December to prepare for, the government prioritized high school seniors’ return to school first. They are the first public school students to resume in-person classes in South Korea, and some of the first in Asia, Japan’s Nikkei reported. Younger students in South Korea will follow suit by June 8 as part of a phased reopening of schools. “We cannot let the 11 years of preparation by our students be in vain due to the COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] outbreak,” said Vice Minister of Education Park Baeg-beom. The university entrance exams have been rescheduled to December 3, two weeks later than usual, to accommodate the late start to the school year, which traditionally begins in early March. Prior to the reopening, the start of South Korea’s academic year had been delayed five times, according to the report. On Wednesday, students returning to the classroom had their temperatures checked upon entry. Some schools have installed thermal imaging cameras to detect those with a fever. Desks in some schools are equipped with clear plastic partitions, shielding pupils from their neighbors. Students are asked to wear masks and disinfect their desks every day, according to the report. The careful restart witnessed in educational institutions on Wednesday comes amid a general easing of coronavirus lockdown measures across South Korea which began on May 6. Government officials call the return to normal routines “everyday life quarantine,” according to the report. The relaxed social distancing measures follow an overall consensus by the government that it has successfully contained South Korea’s coronavirus outbreak, which was once one of the worst in the world, second only to outbreak epicenter China. This sense of a slowdown in the number of new coronavirus cases has been periodically contradicted by outbreaks of new virus clusters throughout the country. Most recently, on May 11, an outbreak of new cases was traced to a nightclub district in Seoul called Itaewon, where one man infected a host of other clubgoers. The incident caused a resurgence in the number of new coronavirus cases across the country, with 187 new infections linked to the Itaewon cluster documented as of Tuesday, the Nikkei reports. At least one private school teacher who visited Itaewon at the time of the outbreak tested positive for coronavirus. The instructor reportedly infected at least ten of his students, according to the report. Some private schools in South Korea resumed classes earlier than Wednesday’s public school reopening. So far, at least 41 public school staff, including teachers, have admitted to visiting the Itaewon clubs involved in the outbreak, according to data from South Korea’s Ministry of Education. Some underage students have also admitted to going clubbing in the district around the time of the outbreak, according to the report. “Concerns over small infection clusters still remain and no one can predict what kind of situation will arise at schools,” Education Minister Yoo Eun-hae said Wednesday, according to Agence France-Presse (AFP). Responding to concerns from parents about the recent cluster infections, Yoo said the education ministry had set up a “24-hour emergency situation room” this week. He assured parents of students that any schools reporting new coronavirus cases through the hotline will be immediately closed. In the city of Incheon, bordering Seoul, 66 schools were forced to delay the restart of classes by one day after two students tested positive for coronavirus on Wednesday. Hours after reopening, 66 schools told their students to go home and come back the next day while authorities clarified the situation, the Incheon Metropolitan City Office of Education said Wednesday. At press time on Wednesday, South Korea had recorded 11,110 infections and 263 deaths from the Chinese coronavirus.

The People’s Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), published a story Wednesday highlighting calls from Moscow to investigate American biological laboratories and linking them to the ongoing Chinese coronavirus pandemic. The Communist Party has repeatedly claimed that evidence exists that the true origin of the virus lies in the United States. During a recent briefing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying claimed that questions surround the safety protocols around a now-closed U.S. Army laboratory in Maryland and that e-cigarette, or vaping, related respiratory illnesses documented in America last year could have been early Chinese coronavirus cases. None of those diagnosed with vaping illnesses were contagious, a fact Hua has not addressed. The People’s Daily, actually reprinting an article by the state-run CGTN media outlet, noted that Russian Foreign Ministry Sergey Lavrov last week accused Washington of not being transparent in running biological laboratories, particularly in post-Soviet states. America’s “behavior has raised international concerns about what is really going on in the labs,” CGTN claimed Lavrov had suggested. As the Russian outlet TASS reproduced Lavrov’s comments last week, they were not directly linked to any discussion on the Chinese coronavirus. “For almost 20 years, Russia and most other countries, including China, have been calling for a protocol to the convention that would establish a mechanism to verify and check states parties’ compliance with their commitment not to create biological weapons,” Lavrov claimed. “The United States stands almost alone against this initiative. Tensions around the issue have escalated and Washington’s unwillingness to ensure the transparency of its military biological activities in various parts of the world raises questions about what is really going on there and what the actual goals are.” Lavrov did discuss the potential origin of the Chinese coronavirus, but in a way that appeared more defensive on China’s behalf than accusatory towards America. “When we say that reasons behind emergence of the coronavirus infection must be determined, I believe that it is an absolutely justified wording. However, this must be approached from the standpoint of sense, of substance,” he said. “We are against […] politicizing this scientific, humanistic approach in dirty competition.” The location where the virus first infected human beings is not a matter of significant debate outside of complaints from the Chinese government and its allies. The first known cases of Chinese coronavirus infection occurred in Wuhan, China; leaked Chinese government documents time the first diagnosis in mid-November 2019. Some Chinese state media outlets have tried to disseminate the conspiracy theory that American soldiers brought the virus to Wuhan in October 2019, when the city hosted the Military World Games, but no evidence of any infections tied to that event exists. Challenging the lack of evidence of any coronavirus cases outside of Wuhan before this time, as Lavrov appeared to do, allows for a defense of the Communist Party’s moves to silence anyone aware of an infectious disease outbreak and destroy early samples of the virus in January 2020. The CGTN report implied that Lavrov’s comments opened the door for an investigation into Beijing’s allegation that the virus may have originated in America, citing the Fort Detrick, Maryland, U.S. Army lab as “the center of the U.S. government’s darkest experiments.” The lab ceased functioning in July. “What’s even more worrisome was that a vaping-related lung disease, the symptoms of which resemble those of COVID-19 pneumonia, broke out in a community just one hour’s drive away from the lab shortly after the lab was shut down,” the article alleged. “The timing and the location of the outbreak appear dubious, especially since e-cigarettes have been sold in the country since 2007.” The report echoed Hua Chunying’s comments in the beginning of the month. “There are also reports that soon after the closure [of the Fort Detrick laboratory], ‘E-cigarette disease’ broke out in the surroundings,” Hua told reporters. “According to data released by the US CDC in late February, the flu season that begins in the winter of 2019 has infected at least 32 million people in the United States, including 18,000 deaths from flu-related illnesses.” Maryland did not document a significantly elevated number of vaping related illnesses compared to other states. Hua did not offer any explanation for how Maryland could be the birthplace of the outbreak if other states hundreds of miles away experienced vaping illnesses prior to Maryland, nor did she address the fact that none of those patients were isolated and there is no evidence of their illnesses infecting health workers or others near them. The Chinese coronavirus, considered a close relative to the SARS virus which also originated in China, is considered highly contagious through fluid droplets in the air. In the article the People’s Daily published on Wednesday, Chinese media found the American government’s lack of comment on the bizarre conspiracy suspicious. “Unsurprisingly, U.S. authorities and politicians have remained silent on the issue,” the report claimed. “The unusual silence from Washington has raised international concerns as to what kind of risks the U.S. biolabs, which are found in former Soviet Union member countries, Southeast Asian nations and African countries, may pose to global public health security.” The report appears to be an effort to galvanize global support for an international probe into American biological research, ostensibly to find the “true” origin of the virus. Last week, the Global Times, another Communist Party publication, suggested that China and its allies should use venues like the U.N. Security Council to force an international investigation into the labs in question. China could potentially find in Russia an ally for such an investigation. For years, the Russian Defense Ministry has accused the United States of creating biological weapons in laboratories throughout Eastern Europe. In 2018, the ministry explicitly claimed that the Richard G. Lugar Center for Public Health Research in Tbilisi, Georgia, was a secret weapons development center. Russian officials spread alleged Georgian documents claiming that American researchers were using “volunteers” as experimental victims in creating biological toxins. The Pentagon responded by calling the claims “an invention of the imaginative and false Russian disinformation campaign against the West” and “obvious attempts to divert attention from Russia’s bad behavior on many fronts.” Russian conspiracy media revived the Lugar Center rumors in relation to the Chinese coronavirus outbreak, claiming that it may have been the origin location of the pandemic. These reports did not acknowledge that the center has long cooperated with the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) and conducted its research openly, accepting international visits.

Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) blasted the establishment media over its stream of criticisms and dismissal of Florida’s hopeful coronavirus trends, stating bluntly that far too many reporters “waxed poetically for weeks and weeks about how Florida was going to be just like New York” — something that never happened. “Our data is available. Our data is transparent. In fact, Dr. Birks has talked multiple times about how Florida has the absolute best data,” DeSantis, who stood alongside Vice President Mike Pence, told reporters on Wednesday. “So any insinuation otherwise is just typical partisan narrative trying to be spun. And part of the reason is that you’ve got a lot of people in your profession who waxed poetically for weeks and weeks about how Florida was going to be just like New York,” he continued, repeating their previous claims. “‘Wait two weeks. Florida’s going to be next. Just like Italy. Wait two weeks,'” DeSantis said. “Well hell, we’re eight weeks away from that, and it hasn’t happened.” DeSantis added that Florida has a lower death rate compared to areas around the country, including New York, D.C., Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio. “But even in our region — Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia — Florida has the lower death rate, and I was the number one landing spot from tens of thousands of people leaving the number one hot zone in the world to come to my state,” he explained. “So we’ve succeeded, and I think that people just don’t want to recognize it, because it challenges their narrative. It challenges their assumptions,” he added: DeSantis says any insinuation Florida doesn't have best data is typical partisan narrative. "You've got a lot of people in your profession who waxed poetically for weeks and weeks about how Florida was going to be just like NY."https://t.co/jTzJmKk8X0 pic.twitter.com/1sGw3Z1P3V — WFLA NEWS (@WFLA) May 20, 2020  Establishment media outlets and Democrat politicians blasted DeSantis’s approach to addressing the pandemic in his state from the onset, warning that his refusal to immediately impose far-reaching lockdown orders would lead Florida, which has a large elderly population, to become the next U.S. hotspot, or worse, the next Italy. DeSantis, however, quickly focused on protecting vulnerable individuals in nursing homes, almost immediately limiting those who could enter the facilities as blue states, like Pennsylvania, directed facilities to accept patients who tested positive for the virus. Since then, nearly 70 percent of coronavirus deaths in the Keystone State have been connected to nursing homes. While DeSantis eventually issued a stay-at-home order, he largely laid the groundwork, relying on localities to enforce orders tailored specifically to their areas. He also focused on screening individuals hailing from coronavirus hotspots, installing checkpoints on major roads and implementing screenings at several Florida airports. Florida, with a population of over 21 million, reported 47,471 positive cases of the virus and 2,096 related fatalities, as of Wednesday afternoon. Florida hospitals, DeSantis has noted, never reached capacity, nor did they experience a shortage of ventilators. The Sunshine State is currently in the first phase of the reopening process, with retailers, restaurants, and gyms operating at limited capacities.

Construction workers at the University of Alabama’s Bryant-Denny Stadium have reportedly been hit with a “significant” coronavirus outbreak, a report says. The university implemented a $106 million renovation of the 91-year-old stadium last November, and officials were counting on construction to be done by the November kickoff of the 2020 college football season. But now there is some doubt that the stadium will be ready in time, al.com reports. “More than 10 people have tested positive for COVID-19, according to people familiar with the outbreak, but the number could be much higher,” al.com reported on Wednesday. “With so many exposures and a lack of transparency about the outbreak, there is a fear that more positive cases linked to the job site are inevitable. “The large number of positive tests means, essentially, everyone at the job site could have been exposed,” the report added. School officials, though, say that they have insisted that contractors working on the stadium follow coronavirus protocols. In a statement, the University of Alabama said: From the start of the pandemic, UA has continuously mandated that our campus contractors take all necessary steps to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. The contractors immediately adapted operations and processes, engaged in heightened cleaning, and took other protective measures for the health and safety of their employees. The University directly provided sanitation supplies, thermometers, and signage at all construction sites, and made personal protective equipment available to all contractors. Those processes, which have been in place since early March, are continuously refined based on the latest guidance from state, federal and industry leaders in order to protect the health and safety of the campus community. Additional signs reminding workers to stay six feet apart have been posted on the job site. Work continues on the stadium, though, despite the number of those who have tested positive for the virus.

President Trump is edging out Joe Biden, the Democrat Party’s presumptive nominee, in key battleground states and is also leading in support among independent voters in those states, a CNBC/Change Research poll released Wednesday revealed. The survey, taken among 5,408 likely voters in the battleground states Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin from May 15 to May 17, showed the president holding an edge over Biden, 48 percent to 46 percent — a lead just outside the 1.9 percent margin of error. The survey also shows Trump holding an even greater advantage among independent voters in those battleground states, besting the former vice president 41 percent to 32 percent. While voters remain split on who would handle the coronavirus pandemic better, voters believe Trump would do a better job on handling the economy moving forward, 51 percent to 40 percent. Republicans, overall, have a more positive outlook when it comes to the coronavirus. Seventy-one percent of Republicans believe things are improving, but Democrats and independents tend to disagree. Only 35 percent of independents believe things are on the mend, with the percentage shrinking even further among Democrats, with 12 percent. The survey also found that Democrats and independents are more likely to believe that the U.S. will see a second wave of the virus by the end of the year. CNBC reported: 99% of Democrats say that there is at least a 50-50 chance of a second wave in U.S. infections before the end of the year, with 94% telling pollsters that it will probably or definitely happen. On the other hand, 38% of Republicans said a second wave will probably or definitely not appear, with 41% saying there’s a 50-50 chance. More than 8 in 10 independents see at least a 50-50 chance of a second wave this year, with 37% saying there will definitely be one and 19% saying it is probable. If there is a second wave, swing-state voters are divided over who should be blamed. Democrats overwhelmingly said the two people or groups most responsible would be Trump and states that reopened their economies too soon, while Republicans said it would be the fault of China and Democrats. Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in all of the battleground states featured in the CNBC/Change Research poll in 2016.

All states in America had begun a phased reopening of their economies as of Wednesday after shutting down non-essential businesses to stem the spread of COVID-19, the illness associated with the novel coronavirus. Although lockdown orders remain in effect in a handful of states as well as the nation’s capital and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, some non-essential businesses in those regions have reopened, data compiled by the New York Times revealed as of Wednesday afternoon, echoing other analyses. Still, Democrat-allied mainstream media outlets like the Times argue that it is premature for states to reopen at this juncture, despite some metrics, like hospitalizations, showing improvements in the coronavirus situation across the United States. While some health experts have acknowledged that deaths and cases may increase with the reopening of the country as more people go outside their homes, others warn about the potentially lethal costs of keeping the shutdown in place. Testing has also improved in recent weeks, which will lead to health officials detecting more cases. Several states (8) did not impose a shutdown. The vast majority of the remaining ones have allowed their shelter-in-place order to expire, either already or by next week (35). Puerto Rico’s stay-at-home order will expire next week on May 25. Meanwhile, the District of Columbia has extended its quarantine order to June 8. Some states may choose to extend their quarantine orders after they expire or cut them short if conditions improve. On Tuesday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin warned a Senate panel about the devastation long-term shutdown measures can have on the American economy. “There is [a] risk of permanent damage,” he told the Senate Banking Committee. Echoing other health experts, Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), cautioned in April that there is a clear and present danger that lockdown measures may fuel mental health issues like suicides. “Particularly with suicide, one worries about the people who already are struggling with depression, and then are put in a circumstance of being isolated from others,” Dr. Collins told the medical news site STAT. “That’s exactly the wrong thing.” “So that’s one more reason why we need to figure out [the health consequences of the lockdowns] in a safe way, and an evidence-based way how we can get ourselves back out there again because people are suffering with this,” he added. President Donald Trump has acknowledged there is a real health cost to keeping people cooped up in their homes for long periods. The Trump administration has provided guidelines for states to reopen. President Trump, however, has left it up to the states to decide when and how.

CVS Health announced it is giving back the $43 million it received in coronavirus relief funds from the government. CVS Chief Executive Larry Merlo wrote in a letter Tuesday to Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar that his company automatically received the money through the CARES Act Provider Relief Fund, which according to the HHS gave $175 billion to hospitals and health care organizations involved in the coronavirus response, and that his company did not request the money. “We have made the decision to return the funds and forgo participation in subsequent disbursements,” Merlo said. “In doing so, we hope to help HHS provide additional support to other providers who are facing significant financial challenges as a result of the pandemic.” CVS Health has continued to operate during the pandemic and has even indicated it would be hiring additional people. In March, the company said it would hire 50,000 people across the U.S. The following month, the company announced that it would expand its coronavirus testing capabilities. But the pandemic has affected the company’s stock, as shares of CVS have gone down more than 14 percent since the beginning of the year.

An Indiana man who served during World War II as an air force mechanic and survived the attacks on Pearl Harbor has recovered from the coronavirus at age 98. Robert Bates was only one out of three men in his group to survive when Japan bombed Pearl Harbor, WZZM reported. After World War II, he returned home to work for the U.S. postal service. He has been a long-term care resident at American Senior Communities since 2015. After he tested positive for the coronavirus, Bates spent weeks in the Indianapolis VA Hospital battling double pneumonia. Once he defeated coronavirus and its complications, he returned to his nursing home. Bates, also known as Paw Paw, lost weight and strength during his illness, but according to the nursing home, he is making “wonderful progress.” “God and the love of my family keep me going every day. Life is a blessing and I still have some living to do,” Bates said. Bates is among many veterans around his age who have beat the coronavirus. In one case, an Oregon World War II veteran beat the coronavirus at age 95 while another World War II veteran defeated the virus at age 104. A 91-year-old two-time veteran also from Indiana defeated the coronavirus as well.

Washington Redskins rookie receiver Antonio Gandy-Golden said Wednesday he tested positive for the new coronavirus in March and has fully recovered. Gandy-Golden said in a statement that he tested positive during NFL draft training on March 24, had mild symptoms and was cleared on April 7. “I self-quarantined for two weeks and followed all guidelines from health experts,” he said. “I feel 100% now and can’t wait to get on the field with the Redskins.” Gandy-Golden played the past two seasons at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia, which reopened in March despite the COVID-19 pandemic. Jerry Falwell Jr., president of the evangelical school, appeared to reference Gandy-Golden during a Fox News appearance on Wednesday. “Even the one student who was an online student who never was on campus who tested positive, it turns out he quit school to go into the NFL draft back early in March even though he was online, but somehow that got press,” Falwell said. “That was crazy.” Liberty spokesman Scott Lamb responded to an email inquiry about Gandy-Golden’s diagnosis and Falwell’s comments with a paragraph from the school’s website that does not specifically mention the former football player. The site makes reference to a graduated student who tested positive for the coronavirus on March 24 but was not on campus during the two weeks prior. “Prior information that the graduated student came to an on campus clinic was incorrect,” it said. “While the student lives in Lynchburg with family, the location of infection cannot be pinpointed, in part, because the graduated student traveled to Florida on business in the two-week period before the test.”
A Redskins spokesman said the team was unable to comment on Gandy-Golden’s medical situation.
Washington selected Gandy-Golden in the fourth round of the draft last month, 142nd overall. He was not asked about his health during a conference call with reporters on April 25.

President Donald Trump on Wednesday urged Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to lift the draconian coronavirus lockdowns in her state after two dams burst due to flooding. “Governor must now ‘set you free’ to help,” Trump wrote to Michigan residents on Twitter. “Will be with you soon!” Whitmer has closed nonessential businesses through May 28th due to the coronavirus, making Michigan one of the most strict states on mandatory lockdowns. Floodwaters breached two dams in Midland County as officials are currently evacuating up to 10,000 people in the area. The president said that the “best” military and FEMA teams were responding to the tragedy. “My team is closely monitoring the flooding in Central Michigan – Stay SAFE and listen to local officials,” he said. “Our brave First Responders are once again stepping up to serve their fellow citizens, THANK YOU!” We have sent our best Military & @FEMA Teams, already there. Governor must now “set you free” to help. Will be with you soon! https://t.co/cuG1YacPdx — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 20, 2020 

Ford has slammed the brakes on assembly lines at two key factories as the U.S. automaker struggles to get back on its feet following a two-month long coronavirus shutdown. Ford stopped the assembly lines at its Dearborn Truck Plant on Wednesday afternoon after a worker there tested positive for coronavirus.  The Dearborn plant makes the Ford F-150 pickup, the companies biggest money-maker. The Dearborn closing follows the closing of a Ford plant in Chicago on Wednesday morning after one of that factory’s workers tested positive. The Chicago plant makes the popular Ford Explorer and the Lincoln Aviator SUV. The company began to relaunch assembly plants on Monday, promising to keep workers safe and to closely monitor for signs of infection and quickly test workers. The company said that it believes the workers were not infected at the plants but arrived at work with the virus having contracted it during the shutdown. 


SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — A South Korean soccer club is facing penalties, including expulsion from its own stadium, for putting sex dolls in empty seats during a match last weekend. The K-League is one of the few soccer leagues operating during the coronavirus pandemic, with games being played in empty stadiums. FC Seoul’s attempts to increase the atmosphere at Seoul World Cup Stadium backfired despite its 1-0 win over Gwangju on Sunday. The club expressed its “sincere remorse” as public backlash intensified, but said it was assured by a supplier that it was using mannequins — not sex dolls — to mimic a home crowd. About 25 mannequins were supplied by a local company and dressed in FC Seoul colors and wearing masks. The Yonhap news agency reported that fans posted suspicions about the life-size dolls on social media during the match and one banner showed the names of an adult toy manufacturer and of models who had inspired those dolls.
Such advertising is in breach of the competition’s rules, and K-League officials have referred the matter to a disciplinary committee. If found guilty, FC Seoul could be fined about $4,000 or have points deducted. The club could also be punished for damaging the prestige of the league at a time when it had been basking in unprecedented international attention. On May 8, the K-League became the first major soccer league to start playing after the coronavirus pandemic shuttered sports around the world. The opening game attracted 19 million viewers worldwide. There could be worse to follow for FC Seoul, the 2016 league champion. According to reports, Seoul Facilities Corporation, which operates the stadium, is investigating a potential breach. As part of its lease agreement, the club is required to obtain permission in advance for advertising. By not doing so, it could be expelled from the stadium where it has been based since 2004. FC Seoul issued another apology on Wednesday as the case continued to dominate sports news. Yonhap said the club had asked the police to investigate.
“We apologize deeply to all those concerned about the unfortunate situation that occurred,” the club said. “We will review our internal procedures to ensure this does not happen again.”

As the restrictions put in place by the federal and state government to prevent the spread of the coronavirus morph from weeks to months, physicians said on a conference call with reporters on Tuesday that the real threat to Americans is the lack of access to health care.  Screen grab/A Doctor A Day website It’s fear, not the virus, that is leading to dangerous and deadly health outcomes, from children falling behind on routine vaccines to people with serious conditions like heart disease and depression staying at home instead of seeking help. “I just feel that’s there’s a very big disconnect between what the average American thinks is going on and what’s actually going on,” Dr. Simone Gold, an emergency room physician, said on the call. Gold told reporters about a middle-aged woman she met in the emergency room who had fallen while attempting to color her own hair because she couldn’t go to a salon. The woman had a broken hip and shoulder and required surgery. Dr. Mark McDonald, a psychiatrist who specializes in child and adolescent psychiatry, said on the call that for the first time in his ten years of praticing, he lost a patient. The woman, who suffered from depression and had struggled with drug addiction, died at home alone of an opioid overdose. “I am certain that the cause of her death was due to a withdrawal of support in the community, and the withdrawal of her ability to be in school, her inability to [deal with] the added stress,” McDonald said. MEDIA SPREADS FEAR And fear of dying from the virus is being fomented by the media, the physicians said. “All you have to do is watch the six o’clock news here in L.A. to know why they are avoiding the health care system,” Dr. Steven Giannotta, the chairman of neurosurgery at the University of Southern Californian, said on the call. “Because we’ve allowed the media … to stigmatize COVID positivity.” He went on to say: They give two statistics every time — they open their newscast with the number of people who have tested positive for COVID and immediately adjacent to that, the number of people who have died with COVID making, unfortunately, in the viewer’s mind, a nexus between COVID positivity and death. It’s stigmatized our health care system and people are afraid to access the health care system for fear of becoming COVID positive, as if that is the worst possible outcome. But, in fact, it is far more dangerous to stay at home if you have a serious health condition that needs regular treatment, Giannotta said. Dr. Robert Hamilton, a pediatrician in California, said on the call that the lockdown is also hurting young people who are missing out on social time with friends and classroom structure as schools continue to be shuttered. Hamilton said that the Los Angeles Times reported that online learning is not replacing either experiences and that 15,000 students have disappeared as it related to being in touch with teachers online and some 40,000 students have failed to check in daily. Hamilton warned about “the emotional and social toll that this is taking on children being in lockdown for this period of time.” “Issues of depression, suicide, stress, that sense of futility, despair, fear, and paranoia really, are taking hold in our young people,” Hamilton said. LOCKDOWN DANGERS Moreover, the doctors agree that while the initial lockdown for a couple weeks or so to make sure that hospitals and the health care infrastructure was prepared for a surge of the coronavirus was wise, the ongoing restrictions are not only not helping stop the spread of the disease but are delaying the inevitable course of this and many other viruses.  “The reality of herd immunity is obviously we don’t know until we know,” Dr. Jeffrey Barke, co-founder of the Person Care Physicians in Newport Beach, California, said. “But we have examples of past respiratory viral infections where we’ve been able to reach a level of herd immunity to protect the most vulnerable.” “For every child and for every young adult that is locked indoors and is not allowed to be exposed to the virus when they overwhelming do well, especially if you are under the age of 40 or even 50, that’s one person less to achieve that level of herd immunity,” Barke said. He continued: Even if we don’t get up to the recommended 60, 70 or 80 percent of immunity within the population – even it we only reach 30 or 40 percent – that’s 30 or 40 percent of Americans that are exposed, that are immune and that are no longer able to spread the virus and are able, in some regard, to protect the most vulnerable.  So the reality is that we are way past the time where being locked down makes any scientific or medical sense. We are taking the healthiest folks – the youngest, the strongest, our children – and we are in effect protecting the healthiest herd from being exposed and allowing them to get herd immunity. So this idea that somehow we have to wait for a vaccination or a cure to this virus in order to open up schools just makes no scientific sense whatever. “in my view, this is a pandemic of hysteria and emotional overload,” McDonald said. “Beyond a medical pandemic.” “And the downstream consequences medically are very, very severe,” McDonald said. EDUCATE PUBLIC AND LEADERS The conference call, which was hosted by the Tea Party Patriots Action, was also held to announce the launch of a website to educate the public and also to announce that more than 500 doctors have signed a letter delivered to President Donald Trump to share their concerns. “There are more than one miliion licensed physicians in this country,” the website states. “Do you really believe there is only one opinion? Thousands of physicians have something to tell you.” “America needs a second opinion,” the website states. The A Doctor A Day website will feature daily stories from doctors across the country. The letter to Trump, after thanking the president for his leadership during the health crisis, was crafted to “express our alarm over the exponentially growing negative health consequences of the national shutdown.” ADAD Letter – Signed by Breitbart News on Scribd  The letter also said, in part: We are alarmed at what appears to be the lack of consideration for the future health of our patients. The downstream health effects of deteriorating a level are being massively under-estimated and under-reported. This is an order of magnitude error.  It is impossible to overstate the short, medium, and long-term harm to people’s health with a continued shutdown. Losing a job is one of life’s most stressful events, and the effect on a person’s health is not lessened because it also has happened to 30 million other people. Keeping schools and universities closed is incalculably detrimental for children, teenagers, and young adults for decades to come.  The millions of casualties of a continued shutdown will be hiding in plain sight, but they will be called alcoholism, homelessness, suicide, heart attack, stroke, or kidney failure. In youths it will be called financial instability, unemployment, despair, drug addiction, unplanned pregnancies, poverty, and abuse.  Because the harm is diffuse, there are those who hold that it does not exist. We, the undersigned, know otherwise.  HURTING FRONTLINE WORKERS And the lockdown has also hurt many workers, including staff that work for physicians, including nurses and technicians, who are so often now regularly celebrated for being on the “frontlines” of fighting the virus. Gold said when people thank her for her work and express worry that she and other in the health care sector are “overwhelmed” she responds otherwise. “I cannot say strongly enough that the health care system not only is not overwhelmed, it is underwhelmed,” Gold said. “I can give you scores of nurses who have been laid off and scores of technicians that have been laid off.” “Emergency physicians have cut their hours by 35 percent,” Gold said. She said her hospital laid off 50 percent of its technicians. “I’ve never seen anything like this in my career,” Gold said. Moreover, the doctors said that reopening the country is not as difficult as some would say if “commonsense” protocols are followed. And that does not include mandatory mask-wearing or social distancing. “This concept of social distancing, I think, has sort of gotten away from us,” Dr. Scott Barbour, an orthopedic surgeon in Atlanta, said on the call. “There’s no scientific data to back up social distancing.” And, Barbour said, his practice, which employs about 130 people, has mostly remained in operation over the course of the shutdown, with the exception of treating certain high-risk patients. “I think what this shows is that we can reopen the country with commonsense precautions, like washing hands, avoiding shaking hands and cleaning surfaces like doorknobs and countertops that are likely to be contaminated,” Barbour said. The physicians told a reporter who suggested on the call that this coalition is political because it partnered with the Tea Party for the call said they chose Jenny Beth Martin’s organization because they fight for health care freedom and the importance of the patient/doctor relationship. “We are basically sick and tired of the politicization of our health care field,” Barke said. “We just want to take care of patients.” “Thousands and thousands of doctors across this country that want nothing more than to get back to work to care of their patients and provide the best health care that they possible can,” Barker said. “We want to take politics out of health care and get back to the art of taking care of patients once again.” Follow Penny Starr on Twitter

Ohio State Athletic Director Gene Smith expressed optimism on Tuesday, that there will be a way for the Buckeyes home stadium to be at least partially full this year. According to Kyle Rowland of the Toledo Blade, Smith said he’s “confident” that as many 20-30k fans may be able to attend games at Ohio Stadium: Ohio State AD Gene Smith says he’s confident that a plan can be implemented where 20,000 to 30,000 fans can attend football games in Ohio Stadium. — Kyle Rowland (@KyleRowland) May 20, 2020  Though, the clock is certainly ticking if the Buckeyes are to play a full season this year. Gene Smith says scheduling has to be completed in early July for a fall football season to take place. — Kyle Rowland (@KyleRowland) May 20, 2020  Ohio Stadium has a 102,000 seat capacity, but can and has gone as high as 110,000 for big games such as Michigan or Michigan State. Smith hastened to add that he is still not entirely comfortable with the idea of football being played. Gene Smith says he’s not 100 percent comfortable yet with football being played. — Kyle Rowland (@KyleRowland) May 20, 2020  Still, much of what determines whether fans will be in the stadiums this year, is the reopening process dictated by state governments. Given Ohio’s current status, it’s entirely possible that fans could be allowed in the games with social distancing restrictions in place. That would essentially give put the number of fans in roughly the 20-30k proximity that Smith talked about. While teams in the Midwest and the South might be able to hold games with some fan attendance, the outlook appears to be more bleak in states like California and New York where reopening is taking place at a slower rate. However, on the upside, the governors of California and New York have recently voiced support for getting their sports teams back on the field. Though, at this point, without fans.

New York City’s oldest gun store, the John Jovino Gun Shop, is closing down after its owner admitted he can no longer pay rent without customers. NY1 reports store owner Charles Hu saying he hoped to stay open one more year, so he could retire at age 75, but it was simply not feasible financially. Jeremiah’s Vanishing New York spoke to Hu about his store’s closure. He noted problems paying rent, the coronavirus “shutting down business,” and the crippling degree of regulations that had to be met in order to operate the business. News Break reports that the John Jovino Gun Shop is located on Grand Street in Little Italy. It opened “in 1911 in the shadow of the former police headquarters on Centre Street.” AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

NYU has announced its plans to reopen campus for the fall semester. The university claims that it will adopt a variety of precautionary measures to mitigate the spread of the Chinese virus on campus. According to a press release published on Tuesday, New York University will reopen its campuses for the fall semester. The university announced that the upcoming academic year will be structurally modified to mitigate the spread of the virus. For example, some courses will operate in a “mixed mode” under which some sessions will still take place online. In the press release, NYU Provost Katherine Fleming said that the university intends to reopen its campuses around the world. NYU currently operates campuses in New York City, Abu Dhabi, and Shanghai. NYU additionally operates “academic centers” in cities including Berlin, Germany, Florence, Italy, and Sydney, Australia. We’re planning to reconvene in person, with great care, in the fall (subject to government health directives), both in New York and at our Global sites. I can’t pretend that 2020-21 will be a typical academic year. We’ll be living with safety measures and will have to be highly flexible so we can respond to a changing landscape. I can promise you, however, that our goal is to enable you to stay on track academically in a way that works best for you in the current context and that maximizes flexibility. We’re committed to ensuring that all of our students receive the high-quality education that drew them to NYU, even though some students will likely be unable to make it to New York. NYU also announced that it will provide masks for all members of the community. Additionally, the use of masks will be mandatory for the fall semester. The university also claimed that it will restructure classrooms to make it practical for students to follow social distancing guidelines. Breitbart News reported this week that the University of Notre Dame will begin its fall semester on campus on August 10. The modified fall semester will skip the university’s traditional fall break and conclude before Thanksgiving. Stay tuned to Breitbart News for more campus updates.

A new poll from CNBC of 5,408 likely voters in Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin—key swing states in the 2020 election—found a shocking level of fear on the part of Democrats that the U.S. is headed for a second wave of infections before the end of the year. Ninety-nine percent of Democrats say there is at least a 50-50 chance of a second wave. Ninety-four percent say that a second wave will probably or definitely happen. Seventy-one percent of Democrats say the second wave will definitely happen. Just 31 percent of independent voters think the second wave will definitely happen. Another 19 percent fall into the “probably camp,” for a combined 50 percent. Another 28 percent of independents give it a fifty-fifty chance. Only 7 percent of Republicans said a second wave will definitely occur, 14 percent say it probably will occur, and 41 percent saying there’s a 50-50 chance. Thirty-eight percent said a second wave definitely or probably will not happen. The stark partisan divide likely helps explain both Republican support for reopening the economy and Democratic resistance. But the high level of Democratic conviction that another outbreak will happen could become a drag on the economy if Democrats hold back on spending, investing, or prove reluctant to return to work. 

Veteran actor James Woods on Wednesday dubbed New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo “Killer Cuomo” amid intense criticism over the governor’s directive for nursing homes to accept Chinese coronavirus patients discharged from hospitals. Woods began by tweeting a photo of aged school lockers with one of them tagged with the name, “Killer.” “Andrew Cuomo finds his old locker!” Woods quipped. Andrew Cuomo finds his old locker! pic.twitter.com/GzznNShS8L — James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) May 20, 2020  Next, the Casino star shared a New York Post article in which New York Health Commissioner Howard Zucker is revealed to have failed to track nursing home deaths for an entire month after the state reported its first virus death. #KillerCuomo numbers likely to be much higher?  https://t.co/zTwXdRjzTT — James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) May 20, 2020  Woods then shared a photo of a tarp hung off an overpass that reads in large, red letters: “Cuomo killed my mom.” Woods captioned the photo, which has yet to be confirmed as authentic, with the hashtag, “Killer Cuomo.” #KillerCuomo pic.twitter.com/PYvzcoRMNH — James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) May 20, 2020  Cuomo has received blowback for a now-reversed March 25 order on nursing homes, which reads: “No resident [of a nursing home] shall be denied re-admission or admission to the NH [nursing home] solely based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19. NHs are prohibited from requiring a hospitalized resident who is determined medically stable to be tested for COVID-19 prior to admission or readmission.” Over 4,800 people have died in New York nursing homes between March 1 and May 1, per New York state officials. Cuomo faced criticism at a recent briefing for saying that providing masks and gowns to nursing homes is “not our job” because the homes are privately owned. “It was such an insensitive thing to say,” said state Assemblyman Ron Kim, a Queens Democrat who noted that it wasn’t until just this past week that New York and neighboring states announced a plan to combine forces to buy protective gear and medical supplies for nursing homes. “If we had focused on that early on,” he said, “we could have saved a lot of lives.” Cuomo’s administration defended its response to the crisis, saying it has provided more than 10 million pieces of protective equipment to nursing homes and created a database of 95,000 workers who have helped out in hundreds of New York homes. “This was an overwhelming situation for everyone,” said Jim Malatras, who serves on the governor’s COVID-19 task force. “There were deaths and it’s unfortunate. But it doesn’t mean we weren’t aggressive.” One key criticism is that New York took weeks after the first known home care outbreaks to begin publicly reporting the number of deaths in individual homes — and still doesn’t report the number of cases. By the time New York began disclosing the deaths in the middle of last month, the state had several major outbreaks with at least 40 deaths each, most of which were a surprise to the surrounding communities and even some family members.

An NFL player, who is remaining anonymous, has filed a lawsuit alleging that United Airlines allowed him to be sexually assaulted on a flight. The suit, filed by “John Doe 1,” alleges that on Feb. 10 of this year, a woman “sexually harassed, assaulted, abused, and violated” him and the flight attendants did nothing to stop it, TMZ Sports reported. The suit further alleges that the unnamed player was subjected to the behavior through the entire flight from LAX to New Jersey. The woman initially accosted the player over the medical mask he was wearing. Since it was early in the coronavirus scare, she didn’t know why he was wearing the mask on the plane. However, the player also alleges that the woman, who was sitting in a window seat, repeatedly prodded, elbowed, and pushed the him; apparently upset that he was not giving her enough room as he sat in the middle seat. The suit alleges that another player — identified as “John Doe 2” — witnessed the woman’s behavior and even saw her taking pills. The woman, who the two players say appeared under the influence of something, began running her hands across the player’s legs and private areas. When the two alerted the crew, the players say nothing was done about the woman’s behavior for a long period of time. The filing adds that the woman began “grabbing and groping his quads and then stroking her hand across his lap towards the inside of his leg near his genitals.” The players added that they switched seats, and then the woman began inappropriately touching the second player, as well. The flight attendants finally moved the woman to a row by herself, and the players were each given a $150 voucher. Though, now they are suing over the incident alleging that the woman exposed them to possible transmission of the coronavirus, inflicted emotional distress, and caused them concern for other reasons. The attorney involved in the filing insisted, “Those who report assaults should not be ignored, but believed, their claims investigated, and appropriate action taken where warranted.” Follow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston.

Two new drive-in movie theaters are coming to Miami, Florida, this week, as the concept of drive-in theaters has exploded in popularity across the state as more people seek entertainment from the comfort of their vehicles in the wake of the deadly Chinese coronavirus. The first of the two drive-ins in the south Florida city will be on May 22 at the Dezerland theme park in North Miami. The second is set to open up on May 24 in Miami Beach at the parking lot on Collins Avenue and 46th Street, according to a report by Time Out. The drive-in at Dezerland will feature weekly showings of films from Jurassic Park to Sonic the Hedgehog through July 3 with showtimes set for Fridays at 5:00 p.m. Food and beverages will also be available for guests to purchase. Tickets are available online for $30 per vehicle. The drive-in at the Miami Beach parking lot will feature the film Playing With Fire, which will promptly start at 8:00 p.m. on Sunday. Guest are being asked to remain in their vehicles, which includes trips to the restroom. Moreover, the showing is sponsored by the city and is only open to residents. Patrons will have to show proof of residence. There are roughly 300 drive-in theaters operating across the United States today, many of them scattered across Florida. In fact, the Ocala Drive-In was among a handful full of drive-in theaters in the country last month to show newly released major studio films. Aside from independent films, the Ocala Drive-In showed Trolls: World Tour, which made more money for DreamWorks Animation — $100 million in three weeks via video on demand — than the first film made in its entire theatrical run. Pop-up movie theaters are not the only drive-in attraction taking off in Florida. The concept of drive-ins has expanded beyond movie showings. Florida is also set to host what is likely to be the nation’s first-ever drive-in music festival. The festival, called, “The Road Rave” promises “a ​full festival main stage production” headlined by DJ Carnage, who is calling the event “North America’s first-ever drive-in festival of the COVID era.” You can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo, and on Instagram.

China has reportedly launched a Wuhan coronavirus information war across Twitter, more than doubling the number of official government tweets since January including 90,000 posts since April, and recently pushing the conspiracy theory that the virus came from a U.S. government lab. NBC News reports that the Chinese government has launched a massive Twitter information campaign, more than doubling the number of official government tweets since January and in recent days attempting to spread a conspiracy theory that the Wuhan coronavirus came from a U.S. government lab. On May 8, the spokesperson for China’s Foreign Affairs Ministry posted a sweet that has been liked more than 4,000 times which reads: “The #US keeps calling for transparency & investigation. Why not open up Fort Detrick & other bio-labs for international review? Why not invite #WHO & int’l experts to the US to look into #COVI19 source & response?” The military houses and studies infectious diseases at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick, Maryland. The #US keeps calling for transparency & investigation. Why not open up Fort Detrick & other bio-labs for international review? Why not invite #WHO & int'l experts to the US to look into #COVID19 source & response? — Hua Chunying 华春莹 (@SpokespersonCHN) May 8, 2020  Chinese accounts have published more than 90,000 tweets since the beginning of April from 200 diplomatic and state-run media accounts in a massive Wuhan coronavirus information war according to a study of data collected by the Hamilton 2.0 dashboard of the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a tool aggregating accounts connected to the Chinese government. Analysis by Bret Schafer, the digital disinformation fellow at the alliance, based in Washington, D.C., found that Twitter output from China’s official sites has almost doubled since January and the number of diplomatic Twitter accounts has tripled to 135 from 40 accounts at this time las year. Schafer stated that the Chinese accounts “have become more aggressive, more conspiratorial, and the ones who have done that are their most popular accounts and have by far the most engagement.” Schafer said that the Twitter account for the Chinese Embassy in France “has significantly more followers than the embassy in Poland, for example, because the embassy in France has been a driver of the most aggressive content.” The Fort Detrick conspiracy theory has been tweeted more than 30 times from official Chinese diplomatic and state-run media accounts over the past two months according to the Alliance for Securing Democracy. On March 12, Zhao Lijian, the spokesman and deputy director of the Foreign Ministry’s Information Department, who has been one of China’s most prolific officials on Twitter, tweeted: “It might be the US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan.” 2/2 CDC was caught on the spot. When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation! pic.twitter.com/vYNZRFPWo3 — Lijian Zhao 赵立坚 (@zlj517) March 12, 2020  One day later he tweeted that there was “Further evidence that the virus originated in the US,” linking to a post on Global Research, a Canadian blog which argued that the virus could have originated from the U.S. and leaked from Fort Detrick. The blog post has since been taken down but a cached version can be found online. Robert Daly, director of the Kissinger Institute on China and the United States at the Wilson Center, a Washington think tank, commented on China’s conspiracy about Fort Detrick stating: “Obnoxious and childish as this is, it should be noted that such Chinese statements have generally mirrored earlier American statements. Rhetorically, China is counterpunching — not throwing the first blow.” He added: “The primary goal of this rhetoric is to demonstrate to Chinese domestic constituencies that the Communist Party is not lying prostrate before American accusations.” Read more at NBC News here.

Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) told Breitbart News during a press conference on Wednesday that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) wants carveouts for millionaires to “shore up” support for Democrats. Ernst, one of the Senate’s leading government waste hawks, unveiled legislation on Wednesday that would end a carveout for millionaires to obtain a taxpayer-funded unemployment benefit during the coronavirus outbreak. Ernst’s bill, the Returning Inappropriate Cash Handouts (RICH) Act, would block Americans who lost their job but are still earning $1 million or more this year from receiving the $600 weekly unemployment bonus for the newly expanded unemployment coverage under the CARES Act. Ernst’s office noted that the legislation could save the bill as much as $2 million every week. Ernst said during the press conference that millionaires continue to benefit while essential workers put their lives at risk. “Folks, think about it. We have essential workers, many of them working long hours on the frontlines of the pandemic and putting their lives at risk, having their tax dollars taken out of their wallets and put into the pockets of millionaires who aren’t working,” Ernst said. “The question of the day: isn’t that just rich?” “With our nation facing a record-breaking budget deficit of 4 trillion dollars, we cannot afford to be subsidizing the lifestyles of coastal elite millionaires,” she added. Breitbart News asked Ernst why she thought Pelosi would create this carveout for millionaires. Pelosi also eliminated the limitations on the federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT), which Republicans lowered through the Trump Tax and Jobs Act. The SALT deduction primarily benefits wealthy, mostly Democrat, and coastal states such as New York, New Jersey, and California. Ernst said that these carveouts primarily benefit the Democrat donor class. She told Breitbart News, “I mean, where is Nancy Pelosi from? She is one of those wealthy, coastal elites. To shore up their support for Democrats certainly, they want to include these carveouts, and allowing millionaires to take the extra $600 a week that is coming from people, from hardworking Americans and Iowans, is absolutely ludicrous. That’s not something that they paid into through payroll taxes; it’s just government funds that are going to these out-of-work millionaires.”  “They also did do away with the SALT provision that has been enacted through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which gives those coastal elites greater advantage as well,” Ernst added. “So you would have to ask Nancy Pelosi why she and the other Democrats are providing these special breaks for wealthy millionaires when they claim to be for the hardworking middle class.” Sean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) is pressing a resolution “condemning all forms of anti-Asian sentiment as related to COVID–19,” including the phrase “Wuhan Virus.” The former presidential candidate recently introduced S.Res. 580, a resolution calling on public officials to “condemn and denounce anti-Asian sentiment, racism, discrimination, and religious intolerance related to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019), and to call on federal law enforcement officials, working with state and local officials, to take specified steps.” According to the resolution’s summary, federal officials should “expeditiously investigate and document all credible reports of hate crimes and incidents and threats against the Asian-American and Pacific Islander community, and investigate and prosecute perpetrators.” The measure also “recommits” the U.S. to its role in building inclusive, tolerant societies by “prioritizing language access and inclusivity in communication practices.” The resolution particularly takes aim at the descriptors like the “Chinese Virus,” “Wuhan Virus,” and “Kung-flu,” contending that they constitute “anti-Asian terminology.” Harris, along with Sens. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), and Mazie Hirono (D-HI) last month detailed their intention to introduce the resolution, with Duckworth accusing President Trump of conducting “inappropriate and racist efforts to ‘rebrand’ this disease.” “Inflammatory and racist rhetoric from officials at the highest level of our government has contributed to a disturbing rise in hate-crimes targeting Asian Americans,” Hirono claimed, failing to mention that the descriptors have been used several times by establishment media outlets. “Calling COVID-19 the ‘Wuhan virus’, ‘Kung flu’, or ‘Chinese virus’ isn’t clever or funny, it’s wrong and deeply harmful,” she added. Despite their concerns, the virus did, indeed, originate in Wuhan, China, and U.S. officials say that China hid the severity of the virus. The U.S. subsequently halted funding to the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) last month for “mismanaging and covering up” the severity of the threat alongside China. “They’re a puppet of China, they’re China-centric to put it nicer,” Trump said on Tuesday. “They gave us a lot of bad advice.” Trump has since sent a letter to W.H.O. Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, warning that he will reconsider the U.S. membership unless the organization takes drastic steps and “actually demonstrate independence from China”: This is the letter sent to Dr. Tedros of the World Health Organization. It is self-explanatory! pic.twitter.com/pF2kzPUpDv — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 19, 2020  While Harris focuses on condemning phrases like the “Wuhan Virus,” GOP lawmakers are moving to hold China accountable. Sens. Martha McSally (R-AZ) and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) are promoting the Stop China-Originated Viral Infectious Diseases Act (Stop COVID Act) “to ensure the Chinese Communist Party faces consequences for its role in spreading the coronavirus.” “The Stop COVID Act will empower Americans to sue China in U.S. court and seek compensation for the devastating harm the deadly virus has caused to the economy and human life,” a release states. Rep. Lance Gooden (TX-R) is leading the companion legislation in the House. “Right now, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is a shield for the Chinese Communist Party to hide behind. We need to change that,” Gooden said in a statement. “The leadership of Senators Blackburn and McSally will be invaluable in our effort to do just that.”

Colorado State has offered $1,500 Chinese virus aid checks to hundreds of illegal alien students that are currently enrolled at the university. The university claims that it elected to help its illegal student population during the ongoing Wuhan coronavirus pandemic because they are not eligible for federal aid. According to a report by the College Fix, Colorado State University is giving out $1,500 coronavirus aid checks to hundreds of undocumented students. The university created an aid program for illegal students in May after realizing that they would not be eligible for relief under the CARES Act, a coronavirus aid program passed by Congress in March. Colorado State University spokesman Mike Hooker said that the $1,500 checks were awarded based on individual student needs. The recipients included both illegal alien and international students. “These populations include our international and undocumented students, as well as students who, for a variety of reasons, no longer qualify for federal student aid,” Hooker said in an email. “As part of that overall support, the university has provided varying levels of aid outside of CARES funds to about 400 such students, including 218 undocumented Coloradans who qualify for in-state tuition via the ASSET bill who each received $1,500. The university awarded those grants in the same manner that we awarded CARES Act funding, based on an assessment of student need.” Colorado State University is not the only institution in Colorado that is raising money for illegal alien students. The Metropolitan State University of Denver is raising $300,000 to benefit its “Dreamer” student population. Illegal students will receive $80,000 in total grants from the university at the conclusion of the fundraising campaign. Breitbart News reported in May 2019 that the University of Minnesota was offering a scholarship specifically for illegal alien students. The scholarship program runs parallel to the state government’s Minnesota Dream Act, which was designed to help undocumented students get into college. Stay tuned to Breitbart News for more updates on this story.

The iconic Yankee Stadium in the Bronx borough of New York is being turned into a drive-in concert venue and movie theater this summer, in the wake of the deadly Chinese coronavirus pandemic. Time Out reports that Uptown Drive-In — a festival that features movies, music, and car side dinner service — will host events in the parking lot of Yankee Stadium on weekends throughout the summer. Local New York City musicians are expected to entertain revelers. Food from local vendors and games are also expected. The festival is being run by MASC Hospitality Group, which hosts the Bronx Night Market and the Bronx Beer Festival. “Since we were planning on having the Bronx Night Market, the Bronx Beer Festival and Uptown Epicure Festival running this summer, which was supposed to start in May, we already had a lot of great options available,” said MASC Hospitality Group’s Marco Shalma to Time Out. “Everyone is so excited about the possibility of connecting sooner [at this new experience] than initially planned.” Events will be live, with the audio broadcasted to attendees’s cars. There will also be brunch events on Saturdays and Sundays. No dates are available yet as New York state is in the process of slowly reopening businesses, parks, and other venues forced shut by lockdown orders. Those looking to attend the festival events can visit the Uptown Drive-In website to get on its waiting list. Drive-in events are becoming more popular during the era of the coronavirus pandemic, as people seek out entertainment that they can safely enjoy from the comfort of their own vehicles. And if there’s a market, there’s a way.

A woman in Malaysia born without arms has been using her feet to sew personal protective equipment (PPE) to help frontline workers battling the coronavirus pandemic.  “Many people have been asking to see how I use a sewing machine, so I’ll show you my own method when sewing with my feet,” Norfarrah Syahirah Shaari wrote in a video posted to her Facebook page. Shaari uses her toes to fold the fabric and hold the sewing machine so it stitches together the pieces of fabric. She makes the material as part of a volunteer program being held at Teluk Intan Community College, the Malay Mail reported. Shaari said she felt “really motivated” to help support our frontliners. According to data collected by Johns Hopkins University, there are more than 7,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Malaysia and 114 deaths as of Wednesday.

The new coronavirus outbreak in northeastern China, originally dismissed as a minor spate of mostly foreign infections that should not distract from China’s total victory over the Wuhan virus, has grown until 108 million people are under lockdown in the region, according to Bloomberg. The Hill noted that draconian measures have been imposed and heads have rolled, even though the affected province, Jilin, supposedly only has about three dozen coronavirus cases and one death: Government officials throughout the province have stopped buses and trains from going in and out of the region, and schools have been shut down. Tens of thousands of people are also being quarantined, according to Bloomberg News.  On Monday, government officials from Shulan, a city in the province, said it would impose its strictest restrictions yet to try to contain the outbreak, including closing off residential compounds with confirmed and suspected cases. Officials would also allow only one person from each family to leave to buy essential supplies for two hours every two days, according to Bloomberg.  The highest-ranking Communist Party official in Shulan was removed along with five other government officials as a result of the new outbreak.  The Epoch Times quoted Jilin residents who said the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is once again undercounting coronavirus victims to make itself look better and the true number of cases includes an alarming number of doctors and medical staffers.  Several of these correspondents said they personally knew coronavirus patients who have not been counted in official government reports. One spoke of seeing “a fleet of more than ten vehicles” rolling through his neighborhood and dropping off “dozens of people dressed in protective suits” who herded crowds of residents into quarantine centers. Qiu Haibo, a doctor who belongs to China’s National Health Commission team of coronavirus experts, said on Tuesday that the epidemic in Jilin and neighboring Heilongjiang provinces is behaving differently than the Wuhan strain of the coronavirus did. Qiu said the virus has a longer incubation period in the new outbreak, which “causes a problem, as they don’t have any symptoms, so when they gather with their families they don’t care about this issue and we see family cluster infections.” According to Qiu, the northeastern patients also remain infected for longer, take longer to recover, and are less likely to run a fever, which has long been seen as one of the most obvious signs of infection. He saw these differences as evidence the new outbreak was imported from beyond China’s borders, and while he did not speculate on its origin, other Chinese officials have pointed to Russia, which has a huge coronavirus outbreak and borders on Jilin and Heilongjiang.

On Wednesday’s broadcast of SiriusXM’s “Dean Obeidallah Show,” Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) said Republicans and President Donald Trump’s opposition to mail-in voting was an attempt to stop “people of color from participating in the upcoming 2020 general election. Obeidallah asked, “Mail-in ballots — you use this in Oregon. You have people on the right saying, ‘Oh, it is wrought with fraud.’ Tell us how has it been in your state?” Merkley said, “It is incredible we have been doing it since the year 2000.” He continued, “We have had essentially no scandals.” He added, “It stops so many forms of voter suppression and voter intimidation. The Republicans are trying to stop poor people from voting, they’re trying to stop college students from voting, people of color from voting, Indian tribes from voting. So many different ways you can attempt to make it hard. Well, this says you know what, you can’t use all those tricks. You can’t understaff it. You can’t create a four-hour wait in line. You can’t move the polling place at the last second and get with away that. That’s why I’m really pushing for a guaranteed mail-in ballot, no excuses this November across the country.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

The latest polling shows by a wide margin of 58 to 35 percent that people are fine with the reopening of their particular state. Oh, and this particular poll comes from a Democrat pollster, the Global Strategy Group. When asked if their particular state is “moving too quickly to reopen,” “getting the timing about right,” or “not moving quickly enough,” only 35 percent said their state is moving too quickly, while 41 percent said about right, and 17 percent said too slow — which means a total of 58 percent want things reopened. In states where the respondents said their state is “more open than closed,” 47 percent said the reopening is happening too quickly, but a plurality of 49 percent side with opening. They said the timing is either about right (37 percent) or too slow (12 percent). In states that are “more closed than open,” 65 percent take the side of reopening, with 45 percent saying the reopening timing is about right and 21 percent saying it’s too slow. Only 28 percent said things are happening too quickly. This a quite a failure for a fake news media that’s been relentlessly peddling fear porn and lies, especially about Texas, Florida, and Georgia — three states with Republican governors who pretty much did the exact opposite of what media darling Gov. Andrew (D-NY) did and ended up with staggeringly better results as far as coronavirus infections, death rates, and hospitalizations (see here). This is not an outlier poll that’s skewed in some way. By a margin of 40 to 56 percent, those polled said they disapprove of the job Trump’s doing handling the coronavirus pandemic, and that by a margin of 58 to 27 percent, Dr. Anthony Fauci is trusted more than Trump on the issue of reopening. So this is not an oversample of Trump supporters, by any stretch. In fact, the poll seems biased against Trump and still we have these margins in favor of reopening. In other words, to have only 35 percent of a survey sample like this one say their state is reopening too quickly when the entire Democrat Party and their billion-dollar media complex are dedicated almost exclusively to using lies and propaganda to terrify and bully people into staying under lockdown… Well, that’s pretty amazing. Also of note… By a margin of 74 to 28 percent, those polled strongly (31 percent) or somewhat (41 percent) agree with what the pollster describes as a right-wing talking point: When this began, the so-called experts said we needed to ‘flatten the curve,’ but now that we are there, these same people are saying we need to keep the country closed until we find a cure. But that could be years away and we can’t keep the country closed forever or it will ruin people’s lives and the economy. By a margin of 63 to 38 percent, those polled strongly (38 percent) or somewhat (35 percent) agree that: America has always been a country defined by individual liberty and freedom and that can never change. We cannot ask people across the country to be on lockdown forever and sacrifice their basic freedoms and our way of life. We need to reopen our communities and trust that people will act responsibly to protect themselves. Some Democrat talking points about safety over the economy and expanded testing, polled better. But no one disagrees with that. The disagreement is over the necessity of lockdowns when there is no vaccine for the coronavirus, when there is no longer any risk of crashing the health care system — which means there is no reason to remain locked down. Simply put, it will be no safer to open up in a day, a week, or a month than it would be to open today. Continued lockdowns make no scientific sense whatsoever. But they surely make political sense if you’re a Democrat governor (or fake journalist) who wants to trash Trump’s economy and re-election chances. Nevertheless, according to this Democrat pollster, a sizable majority of the country agree with Trump that it’s time to reopen. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.

If the National Football League plays an entire season without fans in the stands, it would cost the league a staggering amount of money. According to Mike Ozanian of Forbes, a season without spectators would cost the league $5.5 billion. That figure comes from compiling the league’s projected losses in ticket sales, concessions, parking, and merchandise. Ozanian does a team-by-team breakdown of how the loss of fans would impact each organization. Squads like the Cowboys and Patriots, who have higher attendance and do better with merchandising, would take a greater hit. While teams like the Bills and Bengals would see a smaller impact. The merchandising, concessions, merchandising, and parking, factors represent 38% of the league’s total revenue according to 2018 figures. As Pro Football Talk reports: It’s unclear whether and to what extent games will be played without fans. It’s possible that some states will allow stadiums to be open, and that others won’t. It’s also possible that medical advances in the coming weeks and months (such as a greater understanding of what it means to test positive for coronavirus antibodies) will make it easier to open stadiums and invite fans at low or no risk for developing COVID-19. Any money lost in 2020 will potentially affect the 2021 salary cap. As recently explained, however, the league and the union set the annual spending limit via negotiation, and it’s possible that the two sides will agree to, for example, borrow against future salary caps in order to keep the 2021 cap at or near where it otherwise would have been. Falcons Owner Arthur Blank has recently speculated that the league season could begin without fans. While Panthers Owner Dave Tepper has held open the possibility of limited fan attendance with social distancing protocols enforced. However, in the final analysis, September is still a long way away and a lot will happen with the virus between now and then. Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn

Mexican officials revealed that more than 11,300 health care staffers across the nation contracted Coronavirus (COVID-19) since the pandemic arrived. The country has more than 54,000 cases, suggesting a discrepancy in official totals or that 1 in 5 are health care professionals. During the daily news conference, Mexico’s Epidemiology Director Jose Luis Alomia revealed the total number of health care workers who contracted the disease is 11,394. Alomia also said there are another 8,275 undergoing testing.

Chinese Communist Party (CCP) media celebrated this week’s World Health Assembly (WHA) meeting as a big win for China, projecting confidence the CCP has stymied the global movement to investigate the origins of the Wuhan coronavirus and retains commanding influence in the World Health Organization (W.H.O.).  State media claimed China’s nemeses – including the United States, Australia, and Taiwan – were the “largest losers” at the WHA. The CCP’s Global Times trumpeted that the “three losers” of the U.S., Australia, and Taiwan “failed to besiege” China at the WHA with a “malicious political attempt” to investigate how China handled the coronavirus.  The Global Times claimed the Chinese political narrative of the coronavirus is now utterly dominant at the W.H.O., while China’s critics have been “isolated or abandoned by the global community for continuing to politicize the pandemic.”  The editorial repeated this talking point with manic frenzy and celebrated China’s loathsome achievement in blocking the return of Taiwan, the world’s best coronavirus fighters, to the W.H.O. as a supreme political power play by Beijing: Besides furious attacks, the US government has been trying to bring the matter of Taiwan into the WHA to provoke the Chinese mainland, which, however, was doomed to fail no matter how hard some US lawmakers and officials like US State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus tried to support the island and challenge the universally accepted one-China principle. Compared to previous years, Ms Keva Bain from the Bahamas, president of this year’s WHA, was more “decisive and clear” about not discussing Taiwan-related proposals, experts said.  An insider familiar with this year’s WHA said that so far, more than 160 countries have reiterated their support to the one-China principle and more than 50 countries sent letters to WHO General-Director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to oppose the Taiwan-related proposal. Chinese mainland analysts said that the separatist DPP in Taiwan thought that it has found the “big brother” – the Trump administration – and it has paid a huge amount of money to flatter the US. But the “big brother” is not as reliable as they have thought, since all efforts they paid to challenge the one-China principle in the WHA failed, as always. The Global Times also thought Australia suffered a huge defeat at the WHA because China hijacked its push for a coronavirus investigation, gleefully repeating a racist smear of Australians that has become very popular among the Communist elite: “This is a totally different thing from the so-called independent inquiry pushed by the Australian side,” Zhao Lijian, spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, told a routine press conference on Tuesday on the resolution approved by the international community. Along with other countries, China has been actively taking part in the negotiations on this resolution, which clearly recognizes and supports the leadership of the WHO amid the pandemic, he noted. Some Chinese netizens also mocked Australia’s attempts as it has been trying to become a “martyr” for defending so-called independence and transparency while its ideas were denounced by the global community. By following the steps of some US hawks who harshly attack China over coronavirus, “it seems that Australia, this giant kangaroo that serves as a dog of the US, will hit a deadlock with China on trade disputes in sectors like coal and beef. Hopefully, the US will compensate it!” one netizen said in a Weibo post on Tuesday.   Another Global Times editorial portrayed the WHA as a “slap” against American “hooliganism”: The COVID-19 death toll in the US had exceeded 90,000 by Tuesday morning (Beijing time). The Trump administration does not have even a little bit of self-reflection. Passing the buck to China and the WHO has been their only strategy. Most of the American people who died of COVID-19 were poor people who did not have a say. The US administration’s only purpose is to continue in power. To this end, they adopted dirty tricks, including misleading public opinion. They do not care how many more people will die. But manipulating the international community is not as easy as Washington thought. Washington wants to bring Taiwan into the WHA, but this issue was not even included in the agenda. Under the US’ instigation, Australia promoted an independent inquiry of China’s handling of COVID-19. But when the assembly started, the draft resolution was about the WHO-led tracing of the origin of the virus, and did not specifically target any country. The final resolution will certainly be far from what the US expects. It is obvious to the world that the US has one of the worst performances in the COVID-19 fight, and it has the worst attitude. The WHO so far is only an advisory organization on global public health, and every sovereign country should be responsible for its own public health security. The US blames its own failure in the COVID-19 fight on another country and on the WHO, and the world had never seen such a scene. This is pure international hooliganism. The bad example set by the US, the only superpower in the world, has seriously threatened the global established practices in the 21st century, and has shadowed justice. It is remarkable that the CCP expects media organizations around the world to continue accepting its transparently false data about the epidemic and pretending that America had a worse coronavirus outbreak than China, even as the Chinese threw another hundred million people under lockdown this week, over a month after they claimed the virus had been all but eradicated. It is even more remarkable that their expectation is not unrealistic, given the media’s political tendencies. The Global Times also claimed the outcome of the WHA proved that U.S. President Donald Trump’s “latest threat to permanently pull funding for the W.H.O. and withdraw U.S. membership” have “failed”: Trump tweeted a letter to the WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Monday, in which he harshly criticized the organization’s “dependence” on China in its decision-making process and COVID-19 response. Trump also wrote in the letter that if the WHO “does not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days,” he will make the temporary freeze of US funding to the WHO permanent and reconsider its membership of the organization. On Monday, the WHA kicked off with leaders of WHO members delivering speeches and calling for a joint effort in fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the US-led campaign to push for a political agenda, including seeking Taiwan’s entry to the WHA as an observer and starting an inquiry targeting China, cast a shadow over the WHO’s annual meeting.  After leaders from member countries addressed the ongoing WHA meeting and agreed on joint efforts in fighting the coronavirus pandemic, Chinese President made five proposals including providing $2 billion over two years to help with the COVID-19 response, make a COVID-19 vaccine available to the world, working with G20 members to support the most severely stricken areas and helping regions like Africa, showing that China, the world’s second largest economy, is shouldering its responsibilities in global affairs amid the unprecedented crisis.  In contrast, the lack of US participation in the global fight further indicated the failure of the Trump administration, not only in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic in his own country, but also in working with other countries due to significant flaws in its governance, analysts said.  These squeals of editorial glee from Chinese state media are likely to strengthen President Trump’s resolve to withdraw from the W.H.O., and are so exuberant that they might even convince a few of Trump’s critics that he was correct to halt funding. Beijing certainly seems to think the W.H.O. is precisely the Communist-corrupted, unreformable organization that its critics fear it has become.  Not all of those critics are in the Trump administration. The Australians, for example, are probably getting tired of Chinese Communists insulting them as lap-kangaroo lackeys of the United States, and they will not think well of WHA states that do not object to Beijing’s portrayal of the assembly as a stunning rebuke to Canberra. Other nations will have to decide when they have had enough of Beijing’s political narrative that all criticism of how the CCP handled the Wuhan outbreak is merely a desperate attempt to distract from their own failures. Knowing that the CCP constantly lies about how many infections and deaths the Chinese people suffered should make it especially difficult to swallow constant taunting that everyone else’s pandemic response has been so much worse than China’s.  It is possible that China’s loud declarations of victory at the WHA are a propaganda campaign to spin a defeat or a means of broadcasting to allied and vassal states what Beijing expects them to do when the great coronavirus investigation begins. If WHA member states have any objection to China’s spin on the assembly, and if they have any hope of persuading American taxpayers to continue providing an oversized share of W.H.O. funding, the time to speak out against the CCP is now.

Sen. Mike Braun (R-IN) told Breitbart News during a press conference on Wednesday that Michigan Democrat Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is slowing the reopening of the state for political purposes. Breitbart News asked Braun if he thought any Democrat governors were stalling the reopening of the state for political purposes, to which Braun said that Whitmer, one of former Vice President Joe Biden’s potential running mates, could be keeping the state under lockdown to benefit her party. Braun said, “Good question. I think that one of them might have been a neighbor of ours to the north. And, I think that you’ll have that full accountability once we get this in the rearview mirror for what the right approach was. I’m guessing the UP didn’t like the one-size-fits-all. I think that will be the biggest takeaway when we can dispassionately look at it, that that was a flawed approach from the get-go.” Braun said that one-size-fits-all may have not been the best approach and that the reopening strategy should be focused on the region. He also said that many businesses could have been open by practicing social distancing. “Even in New York, Upstate New York would have been different from New York City and every county … probably should have had an approach tailored to what the experts said needed to be done to make sure you respect the disease,” Braun explained. “Don’t give it any leeway and we could have done two things at once. I cite downtown Jasper. My wife has had a business there for 42 years this September. That idea of essential and nonessential was kind of a bad way to look at it in the first place. It should have been which businesses could have done the main guidelines of six feet of distancing, don’t put any vulnerable individuals in peril, hygiene, and those are still the things we’re working with. You either pay attention to the rules or you’re going to pay the consequences for not doing it because it’s a tricky disease.” He continued, “When we debrief, this one-size-fits-all … that happens often when you have bureaucrats and folks that don’t think more out of the box. I’m just glad we’re getting more to the transitioning to where the economies are opening.” “I can tell you for certain, the federal government is not in any way a replacement for the real-world economy,” Braun added.

Wednesday on MSNBC, network political commentator former Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO) said former President Barack Obama’s administration did not have even “a hint of corruption during eight years.” McCaskill said, “I think what would be the tale of this election will be what is going on in September and October. I think there are going to be three metrics that this president is definitely afraid of, to use an unfortunate phrase. He’s going to be afraid of the unemployment numbers in September and October, and so far, the complicated and byzantine stimulus that’s been put forward has not eased unemployment. And that’s the measure here. Not the stock market. How many people are in bread lines, and how many people don’t have jobs, and how many people have lost health care? That’s the measure. And then how many—what is the daily body count in September and October? How many people are dying every day from this virus in September and October? And how many new cases are showing up every day? There’s no way there will be a vaccine before September or October.” She continued, “So what is the president’s playbook? Looking down that tunnel, his playbook is to go to what worked for him in 2016 and is to lie about his opponent. And what that thing was with the senators —I’ve got to get this in —what that thing was with the senators yesterday, he went to that lunch to tell them to lie for him. You’ve got to lie about Barack Obama and Joe Biden. You’ve got to turn them into something they are not. You got to make them criminals. He wants to get to the point where they’re chanting lock them up at his rallies about Obama and Biden, who have done nothing illegal. Nothing, nothing, not even close! Not a hint of corruption during eight years of Barack Obama. No wholesale firing of inspector generals. So I really think it’s startling that he’s so panicked that he felt the need to go down there to shore up the Republicans, you guys got to get tougher and lie better because that’s essentially what his message was yesterday.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Amazon already ranks as the country’s No. 1 apparel retailer and owns the Whole Foods Market grocery chain. Now the e-commerce empire is reportedly looking to grow even bigger with a possible acquisition of JC Penney — the venerable department store chain that recently declared bankruptcy in the wake of the Chinese virus pandemic. The news comes amid rumors that Amazon is also looking to acquire AMC Theatres, the largest cinema chain in the U.S., to complement its growing studio business. The Chinese-owned AMC has also suffered during the viral outbreak due to the forced closure of all movie theaters around the country. Amazon has sent a team to Plano, Texas, which is where JC Penney is headquartered, according to a report this week from Women’s Wear Daily. An anonymous source told the fashion publication that the two companies are engaging in a dialogue, but no official announcement has been made. “There is an Amazon team in Plano as we speak,” the publication reported. “There is a dialogue and I’m told it has a lot to do with Amazon eager to expand its apparel business.” A possible deal might include some of JC Penney’s physical stores, which could be used by Amazon as distribution outlets. Amazon has expanded its apparel business with such initiatives as Prime Wardrobe which offers free returns on many items. JC Penney filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Friday, saying that the coronavirus pandemic had battered its business. But the department store chain has been struggling for years and was planning to shutter 200 stores in 2020. The company has 846 stores and employs about 85,000 people. Amazon has been steadily growing its empire through key acquisitions. The Seattle-based company acquired Whole Foods in 2017 for $13.7 billion. It snapped up the smart-home tech company Ring for in 2018 for an estimated $1 billion. Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post in 2013 for $250 million.

Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) on Wednesday raged over President Trump’s opposition to states, like Michigan, moving toward vote-by-mail for the general election, accusing him of wanting to “oppress people and suppress the vote” while “endangering people’s lives.” “Nah, President Incompetent. Michigan promotes democracy without jeopardizing people’s health. You would rather oppress people and suppress the vote (per usual),” Tlaib said in reaction to Trump’s Wednesday morning tweet, threatening to punish Michigan for mailing absentee ballot applications to all state voters. “Oh, and endangering people’s lives seems to be your approach to a pandemic. We won’t be following that method,” she added: Nah, President Incompetent.  Michigan promotes democracy without jeopardizing people's health.

We won't be following that method. https://t.co/lFAWhX5uG5 — Rashida Tlaib (@RashidaTlaib) May 20, 2020  Michigan’s Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson announced on Tuesday the state would send ballot applications, specifically, to voters in the state — a decision that prompted reaction from the president: Breaking: Michigan sends absentee ballots to 7.7 million people ahead of Primaries and the General Election. This was done illegally and without authorization by a rogue Secretary of State. I will ask to hold up funding to Michigan if they want to go down this Voter Fraud path!.. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 20, 2020  Benson claimed the move would ensure “that no Michigander has to choose between their health and their right to vote,” praising vote-by-mail as “easy, convenient, safe, and secure.” The news comes as blue states move to implement vote-by-mail for their respective primaries, and ultimately the general election, citing coronavirus related concerns. California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) essentially led the charge, authorizing vote-by-mail for November’s election — a move failed Trump challenger Hillary Clinton praised heavily: I hope other governors around the country follow @GavinNewsom’s lead. No voter should be forced to choose between their safety and exercising their civic duty this fall. https://t.co/kNkSQ5quw8 — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) May 8, 2020  Democrats have been attempting to use the fears surrounding the Chinese coronavirus to implement policy agenda items, like ballot harvesting and vote by mail. Many of them have been pointing to Wisconsin as a point of reference, which charged ahead with holding its in-person April 7 primary during the pandemic. However, the example does not provide compelling evidence to institute vote-by-mail. Out of 413,000 individuals who showed up to the polls April 7, only a few dozen later tested positive for the virus, and some of them indicated other ways that they may have contracted the illness. Even so, the data indicates an infection rate below two-hundredths of one percent.

BRUSSELS (AP) – The European Union signaled Wednesday that it will not punish member countries for breaking the bloc´s deficit rules to tackle the coronavirus but that it could condition their access to sorely-needed recovery funds on them following its advice on how to manage their budgets. The 27-nation bloc is forecast to enter “a recession of historic proportions this year” as the coronavirus ravages its economies, with an average drop in output of 7.5%. Virtually every country has broken the deficit limit of 3% of GDP as they´ve spent to keep health care systems, businesses and jobs alive. “In all cases, apart (from) Bulgaria, we concluded that the deficit criteria of the treaty is not complied with. In normal times, this would lead to the opening of an excessive deficit procedure. But these are exceptional times,” European Commission Executive Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis said. Dombrovskis´ remarks came as he unveiled advice from the EU´s executive arm, the European Commission, on how countries could weather the economic storm while continuing to promote growth and invest in policies that fight climate change and ease the transition to computer-based economies. While the euro single currency rule book may be allowed to gather dust for now, Dombrovskis warned that it “is not suspended” and that countries will have to return to some budgetary rectitude in the medium term. The commission´s “country-specific recommendations” released Wednesday are part of a system under which the executive arm monitors national budgetary plans and gives policy advice. Countries give the advice lip-service but are routinely slow to respond to it. EU President: ‘The Final Word on EU Law is Always Spoken in Luxembourg’ as Coronavirus Cracks Show https://t.co/ovnrcQXB4J — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 11, 2020  This time, however, Dombrovskis said that the recommendations will be “linked” to a massive recovery fund the commission is due to unveil on May 27, and which is expected to be part of the EU´s new long-term budget, totalling well over a trillion euros. He did not provide details about how the recommendations would be linked to the recovery funds. The pandemic has hurt consumer spending, industrial output, investment, trade, capital flows and supply chains. It has also hit jobs. The unemployment rate across the 27-nation EU is forecast to rise from 6.7% in 2019 to 9% in 2020 but then fall to around 8% in 2021. While the virus has hit every member country, the extent of the damage it ultimately inflicts will depend on the evolution of the disease in each of them, the resilience of their economies and what policies they put in place to respond. Hard-hit countries like Italy and Spain will probably be banking on the recovery fund to survive.

The European Union has pledged its support for the World Health Organization (WHO), following President Donald Trump’s threats to permanently defund the United Nations agency over its mishandling of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. A spokeswoman for the European Commission, Virginie Battu-Henriksson, said that global cooperation is “the only effective and viable option to win this battle” against the Wuhan virus. “This is the time for solidarity. It is not the time for finger-pointing or undermining multilateral cooperation,” the EU spokeswoman added in comments reported by AP. The pledge of support for the WHO from the bloc followed a proclamation from German Chancellor Angela Merkel that “the EU must act together, the nation-state has no chance if it acts on its own”. The European Union urged all other nations to back the embattled UN agency after President Trump announced that he would be permanently cutting of American funding for the WHO unless the organisation makes “major substantive improvements within the next 30 days”. In a letter addressed to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, President Trump wrote: “It is clear the repeated missteps by you and your organization in responding to the pandemic have been extremely costly for the world.” “The only way forward for the World Health Organization is if it can actually demonstrate independence from China,” Trump concluded. Nice try, Communist. But Americans aren't dumb enough to fall for your attempts at cheap PR and propaganda. We the People demand a deep-dive investigation into what the Communist Chinese regime knew and when it knew it–followed by full accountability. https://t.co/kG1UYQk2JF — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) May 18, 2020  The World Health Organization has consistently been accused of spouting Chinese communist propaganda since the outset of the pandemic, initially repeating China’s claims that there was no human transmission of the virus in January. The WHO has also kowtowed to the communist regime in Beijing by refusing the entry of Taiwan into the organisation. The move has effectively cut off the independent nation from sharing information about the virus, despite it being believed to have conducted one of the most effective responses to the outbreak. The European Union has been accused of bending the knee to the Chinese Communist Party during the pandemic, as well. A report from last month indicated that the bloc had rewritten a report on disinformation campaigns carried out by state actors during the pandemic, softening it after pressure from communist officials. “The Chinese are already threatening with reactions if the report comes out,” wrote EU diplomat Lutz Güllner in a leaked email. In its final version of the report, the EU removed any reference to the “global disinformation campaign” carried out by the CCP. The European Union denied the accusation that it had altered its report as a result of Chinese pressure. However, one analyst wrote that EU diplomats were “self-censoring to appease the Chinese Communist Party” and that “appeasement will set a terrible precedent and encourage similar coercion in the future”.

The French Council of State has ordered that a ban on public worship be lifted, ruling that it constitutes a “serious and manifestly unlawful attack” on freedom of worship. On May 18, the State Council ruled that the general and absolute ban on all gatherings in churches, temples, synagogues, and mosques, while perhaps acceptable in the first phase of the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, is “disproportionate” during the period of reopening. The government now has a week to relax the ban on public religious ceremonies in places of worship, which has been in force since March 15. In the eyes of France’s highest administrative court, this prohibition interfered unlawfully with religious freedom, one of whose components is the right to participate collectively in religious ceremonies. The Council of State enjoined Prime Minister Edouard Philippe to replace the outright ban with “measures strictly proportionate to health risks” in alignment with those regulated other similar activities. Subject to certain conditions, therefore, religious worship should be able to resume shortly, at least in certain parts of the territory. The French bishops’ conference (CEF) has been pushing unsuccessfully for a relaxation of the ban since May 11, making specific proposals as to how to resume worship while adhering to safety measures common to all. The prime minister rejected these proposals, originally setting the resumption of worship for June 2, then moving it to May 29. In its ruling, therefore, the Council of State has resolved tensions between the French bishops and the government, coming down on the side of the representatives of the Catholic Church. The decision underscored the arbitrariness of the prime minister’s targeted ban on worship, since gatherings of fewer than 10 people have been permitted in other circumstances.

Former Atlanta Braves star Tom Glavine is warning pro baseball players that they could take the blame if there’s no baseball in 2020. Glavine is also speaking from experience because he was a players’ union representative during the baseball strike of 1994-95, so he has some familiarity on the topic, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “If it were to come down to an economic issue and that’s the reason baseball didn’t come back, you’re looking at a situation similar to the strike of ’94 and ’95 as far as fans are concerned,” Glavine told the paper. “Even if players were 100% justified in what they were complaining about, they’re still going to look bad.” Negotiations on plans for a shorted 2020 baseball season are ongoing between the players and the league. But players are already looking askance at the pay cut suggestions. The league has proposed a plan whereby players receive a 50-50 split of the revenues that the league gets during the regular-season and postseason. But some players immediately balked at the proposal. Tampa Bay Rays star pitcher Blake Snell, for instance, said that he was not interested in putting his health at risk to play baseball during the coronavirus era, and take a pay cut to do it. Glavine did note that, like Snell, he understands that players are worried about their health in this coronavirus era. “I understand that a big part for all of us in getting back to our normal is to have sports back,” he exclaimed. “But you can’t dismiss a player’s concern for his health or his family’s health any more than you would dismiss your own concerns.” “If I was playing today, I wouldn’t say, ‘Hell no, I’m not playing.’ But, of course, I’d have a concern that once you step out that door and you go back into that world, there’s a chance you’re bringing something home to your family. It’s 100% fair for players, coaches, everybody to be concerned about that,” Glavine added. For his part, Glavine said he realized that the revenue split was a “scary proposition” to the players union, but these are unusual times. He also felt that players should avoid talking about their pay in the media. “The accessibility thing was a miscalculation on my part,” Glavine told the Journal. “I just felt like if I did an interview on the radio or TV, if I had five or 10 minutes, I could make somebody understand what was going on and come to our side. That just wasn’t going to happen.” Glavine noted that he’s glad he is retired and does not have to go make these decisions. Though, he also said he misses sports. “It’s nice to do what you do all day, eat dinner and then sit down and watch some kind of game. Not having games to watch has been hard. But you know, we’ll get through it,” he lamented. Follow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston.

President Donald Trump on Wednesday proposed hosting the G7 summit of world leaders in the United States in 2020, despite previously canceling the gathering due to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. “Now that our Country is “Transitioning back to Greatness”, I am considering rescheduling the G-7, on the same or similar date, in Washington, D.C., at the legendary Camp David,” Trump wrote on Twitter. The in-person summit scheduled for June at Camp David was canceled in March because of the pandemic. At the time, the White House said the summit would be held by video conference. But Trump is open to revisiting that decision, arguing it would be a great sign of progress in fighting the coronavirus. “The other members are also beginning their COMEBACK,” he wrote. “It would be a great sign to all – normalization!” The G7 membership includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.

Fans who had been starving for live sporting events had their appetites somewhat sated last weekend. Network executives knew the first weekend with multiple live events would draw good numbers but for the most part they exceeded expectations. The Bundesliga’s return drew record numbers on Fox Sports 1, Saturday night’s UFC card on ESPN was one of the top shows on cable television and Sunday’s NASCAR race on Fox was the most-viewed non-Daytona race in three years. “It was fun being able to watch everything and not knowing what was going to happen. The good thing is people can see a little bit of the pieces of the sports world being able to restart,” said NBC’s Mike Tirico, who called Sunday’s TaylorMade Driving Relief exhibition match. ESPN dominated the weekend. According to Nielsen, the network won Sunday night’s cable ratings with the final two episodes of “The Last Dance,” while Saturday’s UFC Fight Night card was the third-most viewed program on cable, averaging 1.20 million. Saturday’s card was the eighth-most viewed UFC telecast on an ESPN network since the network started airing bouts last January. It was also the second-most viewed ESPN Fight Night. The record remains 1.5 million for the first card aired last February. Bundesliga games on Fox Sports 1 posted their best numbers on the network since it began airing the German professional soccer league in 2015. The Bundesliga is the first of Europe’s first-division soccer leagues to resume play. Saturday’s matches averaged 365,000 viewers while Sunday’s games, which featured seven-time champion Bayern Munich, averaged 361,000. Fox Sports Senior Vice President Michael Mulvihill said that is a 725% increase over the last Bundesliga match on FS1 prior to the shutdown. It is also only the second weekend this season that Bundesliga matches were viewed by over 100,000 fans on Fox Sports 1. “What we’ve seen over the last six weeks is that any time a fan has been given the opportunity to show how much they miss live sports, they have. The appetite is extremely strong,” Mulvihill said. Fox’s strong weekend continued with the NASCAR race at Darlington, South Carolina, averaging 6.32 million. It was the most-watched race outside of the Daytona 500 since the March 2017 race in Atlanta.
Having a late afternoon East Coast window and shelter-in-place measures still in place led to audience increases over 100% in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and Philadelphia. NASCAR could continue to see big audiences over the next two weeks. The race Wednesday night at Darlington will be on FS1 and Sunday’s race at Charlotte will be the first big sporting event to take place on its regularly scheduled date in over two months. “We’re optimistic to see what the numbers will be over the next couple weeks. It might be six or more weeks where NASCAR has the stage to itself,” Mulvihill said. What encourages Mulvihill even more is that Fox’s NASCAR ratings are down only 2% from last year. NBC Sports Group said TaylorMade Driving Relief on Sunday averaged 2.35 million viewers across all platforms, which included NBC, Golf Channel and NBCSN as well as the network and PGA Tour’s streaming apps. The network said the broadcast was on par with final-round events on CBS (2.32M) and NBC (2.35M) aired last spring. Tirico said the highlight for him was seeing the golfers in shorts and carrying their own clubs as the team of Rory McIlroy and Dustin Johnson defeated Rickie Fowler and Matthew Wolff. The golf and NASCAR broadcasts also showed what challenges could lie ahead for network crews over the next couple of months. Tirico anchored the golf coverage from his home in Michigan, while Mike Joy and Jeff Gordon called the NASCAR race from Charlotte. NBC had a pair of on-course reporters while Fox had only one pit reporter at Darlington. With announcers spread out over the country, the first hour of broadcasts can be challenging.
“The TV viewer is going to understand delays and glitches. We learned a lot, though, which should help over the next couple months,” Tirico said.

ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — The Los Angeles Angels will implement furloughs across their organization starting June 1, becoming the latest team to take steps against the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Angels spokesperson Marie Garvey issued a statement on the decision Tuesday. “We, like businesses throughout the United States, are making difficult decisions to protect our long-term stability,” Garvey said. “We are assisting all staff by paying health care through the end of the year. We are also contributing $1 Million to an Angels Employee Assistance Fund to provide grants for those in need.” The Angels’ furloughs will impact employees across the front office, scouting department, player development department and minor league system. They had already pledged to pay their employees through May. The $1 million employee assistance fund is separate from the $1.2 million already put up by the team to pay Angel Stadium’s roughly 1,800 workers. The furloughed employees will keep their medical benefits for the rest of the year or until Oct. 31, depending on their contracts. The Tampa Bay Rays have already implemented furloughs, while the Miami Marlins and the Cincinnati Reds also plan furloughs, including some baseball operations employees. Other teams have cut employees’ salaries, and more announcements of furloughs are expected as the lack of game revenue widely impacts the sport.

The NHL is still more than a week away from determining a return-to-play format, a person familiar with discussions told The Associated Press on Tuesday. And what that plan resembles could be complicated further should the U.S. and Canada extend border restrictions to non-essential travel into July, the person said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the discussions are private. The person spoke after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced border restrictions will stay in effect through June 21. This marks the second time the restrictions have been extended since first being put into place March 18 because of the new coronavirus pandemic. “I am hopeful that today’s announcement will not have a material impact on our return to play discussions and timeline,” NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly wrote in an email. Though the NHL has left open the possibility of having training camps open as late as early August, it was unclear what effect further border restrictions will have on a league with seven of its 31 teams based in Canada. There’s also a question of how travel restrictions will affect players, many of whom have returned to their offseason homes — including about 17% of players currently self-isolating overseas. In a separate development, the NHLPA’s executive board voted to defer the final payment of players’ regular season salaries through the end of May. Players were owed their final checks on April 15, before voting to defer those payments for a month. The decision provides temporary relief to the NHL’s bottom line, opening the possibility of players foregoing some or the entire remainder of their final checks. The players stand to lose all or a portion of what they are owed under the collective bargaining agreement. Players and owners split hockey-related revenue on a 50-50 basis, with a percentage of players’ salaries placed in an escrow fund. Owners can draw from the fund should their share fall below 50%, which is projected to happen this season. Owners considered the players previous decision to defer payment as a sign of good faith. Daly declined to comment on the latest deferment, saying it’s a decision left entirely to players. The NHL paused its season on March 12, with Commissioner Gary Bettman adamant the league intends to award the Stanley Cup, even it means extending the playoffs into September. The decision on when and how to resume the season is being left with a committee made up of representatives of the NHL and NHL Players’ Association. The topics of discussion include whether it’s feasible to conclude all or a portion of the regular season or go directly into the playoffs. The season was postponed with 189 games remaining and teams having played an uneven number of games. Among the options discussed are an expanded playoff format, featuring as many as 24 teams, and the likelihood of having groups of teams gather and play games in a select number of hub cities around the continent and without fans present. There is no set deadline as to when play must resume before the NHL considers canceling the season. Games could feasibly be played into October with the 2020-21 season potential opening in December or January. New Jersey Devils defenseman Connor Carrick said both sides are attempting to make the best of a difficult situation. “It’s going to be an interesting solution, and I think you embrace the novelty with it,” Carrick said. One concern is how a potential nine-month layoff would affect players on non-playoff teams. On Monday, veteran Devils goaltender Cory Schneider said a growing number of players are concerned the NHL will announce a “drop-dead” deadline for returning to play. “I think that’s everyone’s concern right now,” said Schneider, the team’s union representative. “It’s a lot of guys asking is there a drop-dead date? What’s the date that it’s just too late, that you can get a semblance of a season or a playoff.”

President Donald Trump on Wednesday blasted an unnamed official from the Communist government in China for comments on the coronavirus pandemic. “Some wacko in China just released a statement blaming everybody other than China for the Virus which has now killed hundreds of thousands of people,” Trump wrote on Twitter on Wednesday morning. It is unclear who the president was referring to, but he has repeatedly challenged Chinese Communist Party officials for trying to shift blame for the pandemic that started in Wuhan to other countries. The Chinese government continues arguing they did nothing wrong in handling the virus, which spread worldwide. “Please explain to this dope that it was the ‘incompetence of China,’ and nothing else, that did this mass Worldwide killing!” Trump wrote. Some wacko in China just released a statement blaming everybody other than China for the Virus which has now killed hundreds of thousands of people. Please explain to this dope that it was the “incompetence of China”, and nothing else, that did this mass Worldwide killing! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 20, 2020  The president on Tuesday repeated his question about why China failed to stop the virus from spreading to the world. “Now, with all of that being said, to lose lives over this that could’ve been stopped by China, it should’ve been stopped by China,” Trump said after meeting with Senate Republicans. “It’s terrible that a thing like this could’ve happened to the world.”

Chinese Communist Party (CCP) police in Shanghai arrested Zhang Zhan, a citizen journalist and former lawyer, after criticizing the regime’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported on Monday. The arrest occurred last week and resulted in charges of “picking quarrels and provoking trouble,” a “crime” the CCP regularly uses to jail political dissidents. Authorities notified Zhang’s family of her arrest on May 15, who then shared the news with her friends. Before then, Zhang’s friends said they had been unable to contact her since May 14. She is currently still in police custody. Though from Shanghai, Zhang had been reporting on the coronavirus outbreak in the city of Wuhan – where the Wuhan coronavirus was first documented late last year – since February 1, according to the SCMP. Until May 13, the citizen journalist had been regularly posting commentary videos to social media, including platforms officially banned in China like Twitter and YouTube. In some of her commentary, Zhang has been critical of CCP authorities’ response to the coronavirus outbreak.  On February 16, Zhang scrutinized the government’s handling of the ongoing Wuhan coronavirus pandemic in a letter posted online. Her analysis was critical, accusing the CCP of sacrificing citizens’ human rights in its extreme efforts to contain the Wuhan coronavirus or, in her opinion, to appear to: The government isolates individuals from the outside world in the name of treatment. In the name of maintaining stability, the number of infections and deaths is covered up. The media is kept under control in the name of ‘positive energy.’ [The authorities] are coercively and violently ordering and depriving people of their basic human and property rights. According to the report, Zhang was previously arrested by authorities in September 2019 after participating in a Shanghai demonstration supporting the ongoing pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong. The CCP authorities charged her with “disturbing the public order” after she marched through Shanghai’s Peoples Square while brandishing an umbrella that read, “End socialism, Communist Party down.” Zhang was jailed for over 60 days. On May 11, another Shanghai political dissident was released by authorities following his arrest on May 10. Zhang Xuezhong was “taken away” by Shanghai police last Sunday after he posted a letter that also criticized CCP authorities’ response to the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic. His letter was framed in the context of a need for free speech, inherently stifled by the CCP’s political system, he argued. Zhang Xuezhong, like Zhang Zhan, was also a lawyer. He has defended human rights activists in China and also teaches constitutional law as a professor. “I saw so many friends expressing concern for my current situation. Thank you very much. I am now at home and all is well. Good night everyone. I need to get some sleep first, apologies for not being able to reply to your messages,” Zhang wrote on social media Monday.

Pakistan’s Supreme Court ordered the government to lift remaining coronavirus lockdown restrictions on Monday so businesses could fully reopen. The top court, whose decision is binding, argued Pakistan was “swallowing so much money” with a shuttered economy and claimed it was no longer worth staying locked down when there “apparently is not a pandemic in Pakistan,” Reuters reports. Government authorities cited economic strain as the main reason for reopening larger businesses, such as shopping malls, this week. The decision comes amid a surge in Chinese coronavirus cases across the country, despite the court’s declaration that there was “not a pandemic in Pakistan.” The court ordered shopping malls to reopen at the discretion of national health authorities. The decision also calls for restrictions on businesses “opening on the weekends” to be lifted, a mandate which coincides with the end of Ramadan, a month-long Islamic holiday, this weekend. Traditionally, the end of dawn-to-dusk fasting and prayer, known as Eid al-Fitr, sees crowds flooding shopping malls to gather and shop in celebration. Pakistan’s railway announced it will resume train services at limited capacity starting May 20. The announcement, which came on the same day as the court order to reopen malls, seems to have been made to accommodate increased travel during the holiday weekend, which is also typical. According to the report, both the “transport and retail shopping” sectors in Pakistan expect to draw “massive crowds” this holiday weekend. Last week, Pakistan announced an easing of lockdown restrictions, allowing some retail markets to reopen. Upon last week’s partial reopening, shopping markets were “packed” with customers, most of whom ignored physical distancing and face mask mandates still in place to curb coronavirus transmission, according to the report. The court cited the reopening of small retail markets last week as part of its reasoning for opening larger shopping malls this week, arguing that if markets were open there was no longer any “justifiable rational or reasonable” basis for keeping malls shut. “We find no reason why so much money is being spent on this [Chinese] coronavirus, for that, Pakistan is not the country which is seriously affected by it,” the court order said, according to the report. On Tuesday, mosques across Pakistan reopened for “five-time [a day] congregational prayers” in an unofficial move orchestrated by Pakistan’s top Imams, or Islamic religious authorities, who wield an excessive amount of power in Pakistan. “We hope for cooperation from the government. The government should also announce lifting the ban on congregational prayers,” Mufti Usmani, the representative for Pakistan’s Islamic clerics, said in a statement released Tuesday. Previously, Pakistan’s prime minister, Imran Khan, had allowed the Imams to pressure him into easing some restrictions on gatherings at mosques while the country was still under stricter lockdown. At press time, Pakistan had reported 43,966 infections and 939 deaths from the Chinese coronavirus, although the number of cases and deaths is believed to be much higher. Pakistani health authorities cite the nation’s deficient testing practices, due to a lack of medical supplies and a reluctance on the part of the government, as the main reasons for the underreported coronavirus cases.

Things we could never have predicted last year: that in 2020 basket case economies where diarrhoea is a way of life would provide a better example of governance than many Western nations. Consider the latest news from Pakistan. Pakistan’s Supreme Court has ordered the government to lift what is left of the country’s lockdown. The court has ordered shopping malls to reopen and questioned why a virus which ‘apparently is not a pandemic in Pakistan’ should be ‘swallowing so much money.’ According to Reuters: “We find no reason why so much money is being spent on this Coronavirus (COVID-19), for that, Pakistan is not the country which is seriously affected by it,” the court order said. Even before the Supreme Court ruling, Pakistan had already decided to relax its lockdown. “We’re deciding that we are ending this lockdown now,” Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan said in a national TV address. “We know that we’re doing it at a time when our [coronavirus] curve is going up … but it is not edging up as we were expecting.” Note that key detail:  ‘it is not edging up as we were expecting.’ Like UK  Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Pakistani’s Prime Minister Imran Khan was educated at Oxford University (Keble; PPE). Unlike Boris Johnson, however, Khan is clearly agile enough to be able to adjust government policy as the evidence changes. Because Pakistan’s coronavirus experience has not been nearly as bad as doom-mongers predicted — 42,125 COVID-19 cases and 903 deaths in a country with a population of 212 million — Khan has taken a calculated risk. The lockdown, he has decided, is more dangerous than the coronavirus. As he said earlier this month: “Since we started this lockdown, we had this fear that these people who are daily wagers, who feed their kids on daily earnings, what will happen to them?” Khan asked, implying that Pakistan’s poor need the lockdown lifted to survive. From Britain, on the other hand, there is no evidence of such agile thinking from Boris Johnson’s timid, incompetent government. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has warned that Britain is facing a ‘severe recession the likes of which we haven’t seen.’ Again: no shit Sunak! Given that this impending recession is largely the result not of coronavirus but rather of the extended lockdown (and absurdly overgenerous furlough payments), you’d think it might occur to Sunak and his fellow members of the quadrumvirate now governing Britain (Boris, Gove, Raab, Sunak) that there was an easy solution just staring them in the face. End the lockdown now! But apparently it has been lost on all four of those Oxbridge brains — with lockdown restrictions set to continue well into the summer and a bizarre decision to trash what’s left of Britain’s tourist, travel and hospitality industry by insisting that people arriving in Britain from abroad must undergo a two-week quarantine. They say Islamabad is lovely at this time of year. It offers a lot more freedom than you’d get in London, at any rate.

Decorated cloth face coverings inspired by the coronavirus pandemic could become an “essential” fashion accessory, with major British online retailers already selling animal and skeleton print masks. Britain’s adaptation to life under lockdown has taken a runway turn for the weird, with clothing retailers seeking to corner the market in fashionable face coverings. While scientists continue to debate the efficacy of home-made cotton masks in reducing the spread of coronavirus, and whether their introduction could speed up the end of lockdown, UK clothing outlet Boohoo is selling fashionable face coverings for men and women.  Boohoo reminds shoppers that “this mask is for accessory purposes only and should not be used as personal protection equipment”, but adds in the product description that you can “add attitude with accessories for those fashion-forward finishing touches. It’s all about accessories for injecting individuality into your look.”  Asos is also selling lavender bandana masks and tiger and leopard print face coverings for women.  Dana Thomas, author of Fashionopolis: The Price of Fast Fashion and the Future of Clothes, said that masks are “going to become fashion items”, adding: “We’ll wear them like sunglasses, or T-shirts, or even handbags, and we’ll choose them to make statements.” Speaking to the i newspaper on Tuesday, retail influencer Andrew Busby said that even if the item becomes a fashion accessory “essential”, consumers should be under no illusion that these face coverings are “useless” at stopping the spread of the Chinese coronavirus. “Many, if not most, fashion masks are next to useless as they don’t prevent the spread of droplets when we cough because of the nature of the material,” Mr Busby said. Italian designer Tiziana Scaramuzzo created the ‘trikini’, a bikini with a matching mask, as a joke, but then after posting images of the outfit on social media found herself inundated with orders, according to the BBC.     Elexia  A post shared by  Elexia Beachwear (@elexia_beachwear) on May 17, 2020 at 1:07pm PDT Fashion masks useless at preventing the spread of the Chinese virus is just the latest unusual expression of Europe trying to come to terms with the lockdown.

A string of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) took aim at the United Nations on Wednesday, asking why it has been missing in action as the Chinese coronavirus disaster unfolded. They pointed to universally ignored U.N. Security Council calls for a global ceasefire as evidence of the globalist body’s spectacular irrelevance during the biggest public health crisis in three generations. The criticism came as the U.N. bureaucracy claimed success in publishing a list of the “correct” words to use if someone’s gender isn’t known. It suggests using humankind instead of mankind, swapping chairman for chair and replacing husband or wife with spouse as ways to soothe international discourse and promote peaceful harmony among nations. What you say matters. Help create a more equal world by using gender-neutral language if you're unsure about someone's gender or are referring to a group. https://t.co/QQRFPY4VRn #GenerationEquality via@UN_Women pic.twitter.com/koxoAZZuxq — United Nations (@UN) May 18, 2020  “The paralysis of the Security Council in the face of Covid is shameful. To millions of people, it is also incomprehensible,” said David Miliband, CEO of the International Rescue Committee. Rob Malley, president and CEO of the International Crisis Group, blames Washington and Beijing for the U.N.’s inability to get member states to agree on anything. He said the two countries “have treated these negotiations as an opportunity for a blame-game over the origins of Covid-19 rather than an opening to make a straightforward call for a reduction in violence during the pandemic.” Neither country “seems able or willing to show leadership at the U.N. during a global crisis,” Malley claimed. Wednesday’s pointed criticisms are not the first time the U.N.’s failure to be anything but a spectacularly funded debating society during the Chinese coronavirus pandemic has been highlighted. As Breitbart News reported, Oxfam International branded U.N. ceasefire calls “a catastrophic failure”, releasing a report saying the U.N. has been totally ignored in its efforts to be a peacebroker. It outlined that fighting continues unabated across war-torn countries, undermining global efforts to combat the viral epidemic which has infected more than 4.1 million people and caused more than 300,000 deaths worldwide. Unlike the Security Council, the U.N. General Assembly has managed to at least adopt two slim pandemic-related resolutions, one on April 3 aimed at strengthening international cooperation and the other on April 20 to call for equal access to any future vaccines. All this is being played out as the U.N. agency specifically charged with handling the world’s response to the epidemic, the World Health Organization (W.H.O.), has drawn trenchant criticism for its bungled actions and inability to take any course of action without first seeking the approval of the Chinese Communist Party. The U.N. has roused itself however when it comes to a matter it is exceptionally good at: asking the world for more money, something U.S. President Donald Trump has not let pass without comment: So make all Member Countries pay, not just the United States! https://t.co/IVbE4MqBVl — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 9, 2019  In March it sought $2 billion to be transferred from wealthy countries to the poor via the globalist body as an aid in tackling the global viral pandemic. The slim financial response that followed prompted another call for funds earlier this month, lifting the target to $6.7 billion to accommodate the U.N.’s all new, specially updated global plan to counter the viral epidemic. Last December the U.N. General Assembly adopted a stand-alone budget of $3 billion for operations to cover the year 2020, after claiming throughout 2019 it was underfunded and in need of an urgent financial bailout via increased global taxpayer contributions. Barely two months before that, a series of cutbacks began at the U.N.’s New York headquarters, starting with the heating being turned down, the diplomats’ bar shuttering early at 5pm and meetings canceled along with diminished first class global travel budgets. Now bars are open again as long as diplomats require and first-class travel resumed as well as expanded use of private jets.

Tuesday on Fox News Channel’s “Hannity,” Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) argued for his proposed bill that would restrict federal government money appropriated in the name of coronavirus relief from going to state or city government that give payouts to illegal immigrants. “[W]e shouldn’t be spending hard-earned taxpayer dollars on illegal immigrants at a time when 35 million Americans are out of work,” he said. “If we are going to be giving relief checks to those people who are out of work, we need to focus on American citizens, not illegal immigrants.” Cotton also emphasized other efforts to decouple the U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain from China and other foreign nations. While many pharmaceuticals are manufactured in the United States, the source material is often imported from abroad. “[I]t is a tragic irony that the country that unleashed this pandemic on the world also controls many of the most basic pharmaceutical ingredients for the United States,” Cotton said. “That does have to stop. I’ve got legislation that would give incentives to build more manufacturing capacity right here in the United States and ultimately ban the import of pharmaceuticals from China, many of which are adulterated, to begin with.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor

Planned Parenthood affiliates received $80 million in loans from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) in violation of the rules of the relief program revealed Fox News’s Tucker Carlson Tonight Tuesday night. According to the Fox News host, 37 affiliates of the abortion industry giant applied for and received the coronavirus funds. Now, officials of the Small Business Administration (SBA) and some members of Congress want the money returned and say it is possible criminal prosecution may apply. SBA is reportedly contacting the affiliates that received the federal funds, informing each that, with over 600 employees, Planned Parenthood Federation of America is not eligible for the funds that are loaned to organizations with 500 employees or less. Fox News reported Planned Parenthood Metropolitan Washington (PPMW), for example, “self-certified” that it was eligible for a loan of $1,328,000 but is being asked to return the funds. Planned Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino Counties in California received the largest loan of $7.5 million. Ironically, the abortion business voluntarily opted out of the federal family planning grant program (Title X) after the Trump administration enforced a rule that makes a clear distinction between abortion and birth control. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, told Fox News Planned Parenthood had violated the PPP rules: There is no ambiguity in the legislation that passed or public record around its passage that organizations such as Planned Parenthood, whose parent organization has close to half a billion dollars in assets, is not eligible for the Paycheck Protection Program. Those funds must be returned immediately. Furthermore, the SBA should open an investigation into how these loans were made in clear violation of the applicable affiliation rules and if Planned Parenthood, the banks, or staff at the SBA knowingly violated the law, all appropriate legal options should be pursued. Similarly, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) tweeted, “The money needs to be recovered and if anybody knowingly falsified applications, they need to be prosecuted”: The money needs to be recovered and if anybody knowingly falsified applications, they need to be prosecuted https://t.co/FKnrkHnE2P #FoxNews — Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) May 20, 2020  In its latest annual report for 2018-2019, Planned Parenthood revealed the organization performed a record-high number of abortions while it also received record-high taxpayer funding.

On Tuesday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “All In,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) said that states “need to start reopening,” but it is “a really dangerous moment.” And he is “incredibly nervous that we don’t have a president who seems to understand or care about what his role is, and what the federal government’s role is now to make sure that this doesn’t very quickly boomerang back in the wrong direction.” Murphy began by stating that reopenings pose the risk of “throwing lambs to the wolves.” Because people who couldn’t catch the virus during the lockdowns will now be able to. He continued, “What is so maddening is that this administration could have used this time to work with states to invest in the kind of systems that can jump on outbreaks when they start, and they are going to inevitably start to pop up all around the country. And we know exactly how to control them. But instead of helping us build those systems, these testing, tracing, and quarantine systems, the administration has sort of sat back and essentially prevented the CDC from working with us in any meaningful way and stood in the way of efforts to try to fund those systems. So, it’s a really dangerous moment. I think states need to start reopening, but it makes me incredibly nervous that we don’t have a president who seems to understand or care about what his role is, and what the federal government’s role is now to make sure that this doesn’t very quickly boomerang back in the wrong direction.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett  

A group of Maine legislators sent a letter Monday to U.S. Attorney General William Barr, requesting an investigation into Gov. Janet Mills (D) as a result of her numerous executive orders regarding the coronavirus crisis in which, they say, she “has exceeded her executive authority.” In the letter made available to Breitbart News, the lawmakers, all Republicans, led by Maine Rep. John DeVeau, expressed gratitude to Barr for his memorandum to the Department of Justice in April, in which he directed all U.S. attorneys to be watchful of coronavirus restrictions that could violate Americans’ constitutional rights. The legislators wrote: We fully recognize the many unknowns that existed just over a month ago and the need for reasonable executive action in the face of a potentially devastating public health emergency. However, we are deeply concerned that Governor Mills has exceeded her executive authority in violation of both the Maine and United States Constitutions and continues to implement similar policies without authority or justifiable cause. Among the specific concerns the lawmakers cite are Mills’ “arbitrary distinction between ‘essential’ and ‘non-essential’ businesses; denial of Maine citizens’ “right to assemble” in churches with gatherings of more than ten people; and her executive order “establishing quarantine restrictions on travelers arriving in Maine.” In a statement sent to Breitbart News, Maine Rep. Larry Lockman, one of the letter’s signers, said since Mills declared a state of emergency in March due to the coronavirus pandemic, “she has been ruthless in the exercise of her dictatorial powers to close down private businesses and place Mainers under house arrest.” “She ordered churches, restaurants, motels, state parks, and campgrounds to close their doors as ‘non-essential’ enterprises, while allowing abortion clinics and ice cream parlors to carry on business as usual,” Lockman continued. “Mom-and-pop retailers have been shut down, but the big box stores never missed a beat.” The lawmaker continued that many Mainers have suffered due to Mills’ order prohibiting “non-emergency” medical care, including “everything from cancer to cataracts to drug and alcohol addiction.” “Before it’s over, the lockdown will kill more Mainers than the virus, in addition to killing tens of thousands of jobs and small businesses,” Lockman said. “And for what?” he asked. “On a typical day, no more than three dozen COVID-19 patients are hospitalized statewide, in a state of 1.3 million people.” Lockman said it was time to “restore constitutional government in Maine.” “If that means Bill Barr will have to drag Jackboot Janet into federal court, let’s get on with it,” he asserted.

Thursday on MSNBC’s “All In,” Steve Schmidt, John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign manager, called President Donald Trump an “imbecile,” which he said was evidenced by the president announcing that he was taking hydroxychloroquine to prevent coronavirus. Schmidt said, “We’ve seen a president of the United States standing behind the podium emblazoned with the seal of the presidency, saying inject disinfectants, saying that I’m taking this malaria drug that could kill him. Over and over again, the American people have been subjected to wave after wave of idiocy, asininity of misinformation from the president of the United States. And what it all adds up to is the most inept and incompetent response to a crisis that is conceivable to imagine. This is the worst response by an American leader, certainly by a president, but by any American leader in a time of testing crisis in our nation’s history. It’s appallingly bad. And so as we talk right now, more Americans will be dead by the dawn. We’re approaching 100,000 dead Americans because of the abject in incompetence and mishandling of this by Donald Trump.” He added, “President Trump is many things. He’s dishonest. He’s lied to the American people more than 17,000 times. He completely is corrupt. He’s indecent. He’s vile. He’s divisive. But in this moment, the thing that matters the most, and I don’t say this to name call, but he’s an Imbecile. There is no other word for it. That’s the precise word we use in the English language to describe his comportment, to describe his behavior.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Canava’s new underwear features their “dream team” — Governors Andrew Cuomo and Gavin Newsom as well as Dr. Anthony Fauci. Los Angeles clothier Canava is plastering the names of three prominent pandemic personalities on women’s underwear. “NEWSOM, FAUCI, CUOMO = our version of a dream team and we heard you loud and clear,” the brand posted on Instagram Saturday. “After the launch of the NYC Limited Edition there was an outcry for MORE MORE MORE.”     NEWSOM, FAUCI, CUOMO = our version of a dream team and we heard you loud and clear, after the launch of the NYC Limited Edition there was an outcry for MORE MORE MORE.  Now there are Newsom & Fauci, limited edition briefs and bikinis. Run to your keyboard; there aren’t very many of these babies to be had. When you buy any of these limited edition products, we will be matching dollar for dollar your purchase with an equal product donation to healthcare workers in NYC (NYC, Cuomo & Fauci) or California (Newsom).

They also sweetened the deal with an offer to provide “an equal product donation to healthcare workers in [NYC and California],” so that medical personnel could have the opportunity to “rest, recharge, and relax” — in their branded apparel, of course. Canava calls themselves a “profit for purpose” company. And what could be a nobler purpose than turning healthcare workers into national mascots during a global pandemic? “We are living in unlikely times, and we heard you loud and clear that you wanted to show your ‘appreciation’ with more than a thank you,” Canava says in its product description for their Fauci bikini briefs. Cuomo underwear are lower cut for anyone “thirsty” for the New York governor, alongside hipster briefs for those “loving on” the governor of California. This is far from the only fashion idea spawned by the novel coronavirus, COVID-19. An Italian designer recently launched a “trikini” that includes a matching mask with its typical two-piece wear, and Salvatore’s Pizza is working with Donuts Delite to put Dr. Fauci’s face on their pastries.

States across the country are implementing their own plans for reopening in the wake of the coronavirus, with some allowing citizens to get back to their lives and livelihoods, while others continue to order people to remain at home and stay away from public places. The personal finance website conducted a survey to determine which states have the most and least freedom as Americans are posed to celebrate Memorial Day. WalletHub said about its survey: Americans experienced unprecedented restrictions on their everyday life in order to fight the coronavirus, but now most states have partially reopened. In order to determine the states with the fewest coronavirus restrictions, WalletHub compared the 50 states and the District of Columbia across 11 key metrics. Those metrics include whether masks were recommended or required; travel restrictions; large gathering restrictions; school closures; restaurants and bars status; reopening of “non-essential” businesses; child care; strictness of “shelter-in-place” orders; whether a state is part of a multi-state arrangement; suspension or postponement of legislative sessions; and medical services, including elective surgery. Breitbart News is adding to the list whether each state in the survey has a Republican or Democrat governor.  The state with the least restrictions is South Dakota (Republican Gov. Kristi Noem). Jill Gonzalez, WalletHub analyst, said of its report: Two major reasons why South Dakota ranks as the state with the fewest coronavirus restrictions are that it is one of only seven states that never had a mandate for all schools to close during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is the only state that never required a statewide closure of bars and restaurants. South Dakota has already lifted some of the restrictions it did implement, such as its ban on large gatherings, and it only recommends wearing a mask in public rather than requiring it like most states do. The state rated second in returning freedom to its residents is Wisconsin where Democrat Tony Evers is governor. The state’s restrictions have changed drastically since the first WalletHub survey on coronavirus restrictions: Wisconsin moved from 34 to 2, up 32 positions. This is due in part to the fact that the state has lifted all restrictions on large gatherings, had closed but fully re-opened restaurants and bars, has child care programs open and has fully reopened all non-essential businesses. The other eight states in the Top 10 with the least restrictions are, in order, Idaho (Republican Gov. Brad Little), Missouri (Republican Gov. Mike Parson), Utah (Republican Gov. Gary Herbert), Wyoming (Republican Gov. Mark Gordon), Montana (Democrat Gov. Steve Bullock) Arizona (Republican Gov. Doug Ducey), North Dakota (Republican Gov. Doug Burgum) and Iowa (Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds). “Arizona moved from 32 to 8, up 24 positions,” WalletHub reported. “This is due in part to the fact that the state has lifted all restrictions on large gatherings and has lifted all stay-at-home mandatory restrictions.” Georgia fell from 11th to 28th in this latest survey: Georgia moved from 11 to 28, down 17 positions. This is due in part to the fact that the state requires wearing a face mask in public and that the state still has its legislative sessions postponed. The most restrictive states, from 41 to 51 in order, are: Michigan (Democrat Gov. Gretchen Whitmer), New York (Democrat Gov. Andrew Cuomo), New Mexico (Democrat Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham), Washington (Democrat Gov. Jay Inslee), Hawaii (Democrat Gov. David Ige), Vermont (Republican Gov. Phil Scott) , Massachusetts (Republican Gov. Charlie Baker), District of Columbia (Democrat Mayor Muriel Bowser), Rhode Island (Democrat Gov. Gina Raimondo) and Illinois (Democrat Gov. J.B. Pritzker). “Each metric was graded on a 100-point scale, with a score of 100 representing the fewest restrictions,” WalletHub said of its survey methodology. Follow Penny Starr on Twitter

Hollywood depends on a steady flow of new content to keep people at home and glued to their screens. But the Chinese coronavirus pandemic has disrupted the once-reliable pipeline, jeopardizing the supply of new shows that streamers and broadcasters depend on to keep consumers hooked. A new study has found that the coronavirus pandemic will cause an estimated 60 percent of scripted TV shows to be delayed as Hollywood production remains in a state of limbo. The report also estimated that 10% of planned drama and comedy shows will likely be abandoned altogether as a result of the outbreak. Cote de Pablo as Ziva David, Mark Harmon as Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs in the 17th season premiere of NCIS. Erik Voake/CBS Television Network Kelly Clarkson, Gwen Stefani, John Legend, Blake Shelton of The Voice. Trae Patton/NBC Deadline reported that the new study from Ampere Analysis expects that broadcasters will release between 5 percent to 10 percent fewer new scripted titles on a monthly basis than previously predicted during the second half of 2020. The ripple effects of the shutdown are likely to be felt well into next year. Ampere found at least one bright spot amid the industry gloom — reality TV shows are likely to bounce back faster. Reality series are cheaper and faster to produce than scripted content, and often require fewer crew members. A limited number of reality titles have already resumed production, one industry source recently told Breitbart News. Rob Gronkowski and host Nick Cannon in The Masked Singer. Michael Becker / FOX Donnie Wahlberg and Tom Selleck in Blue Bloods. Craig Blankenhorn/CBS Television Network The study concluded that the Chinese coronavirus will result in fewer new shows being greenlit in the foreseeable future. “The knock-on effect of delayed releases is a likely depression of the number of new commissions for some time after the shutdown ends, as commissioners look to fill schedules with delayed projects they have already invested in before signing off new ones,” Fred Black, senior analyst at Ampere Analysis, said in the report, according to Deadline. The major Hollywood studios are currently working with state governments and industry trade unions to create safety protocols for when shooting resumes in the U.S. None of the major studios — as well as Netflix or Amazon — has said when they plan on re-starting domestic production. The indefinite hiatus has thrown tens of thousands of Hollywood union members out of work. Before the coronavirus, TV production was soaring thanks to a bottomless demand for new content fueled by the digital streaming revolution. Production has already started again in New Zealand, where Amazon has been shooting its highly anticipated Lord of the Rings series. A handful of European countries are also set to resume filming on a limited basis, including Poland, the Czech Republic, and France. Follow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg. Have a tip?

On Tuesday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “Your World,” White House Economic Adviser Kevin Hassett stated that if there is another round of coronavirus stimulus, President Trump will push for a payroll tax cut. Hassett said, [relevant remarks begin around 3:45] “I think that if we go to that next phase of negotiations, the president has a way of getting what he wants on these things. And, of course, you know, he’s got to make a deal. He wrote ‘The Art of the Deal.’ But he believes strongly, as I do, economically, that the payroll tax on the employee side is a really big, positive stimulus. The reason is twofold. One, is that people have more take-home pay. So, they go out and buy stuff. And then second, if you go back to work, you make more money. Because you’re not having to pull the payroll tax off on top of it.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

Bad Boys 2 and Transformers director Michael Bay is producing a coronavirus-themed thriller with production set to start in the next five weeks, according to Deadline, in what will be the first major Hollywood production to begin filming in Los Angeles in the Chinese coronavirus lockdown era. Adam Goodman, whose Invisible Narratives is also producing the film, promises that the plan for filming has passed the rigorous safety guidelines crafted by various trade unions and the city of Los Angeles. Mark Wahlberg and Michael Bay in Transformers: The Last Knight, 2017. Andrew Cooper/Paramount Pictures Deadline provided a brief synopsis of the “taut thriller” currently titled Songbird. The film is reportedly set in the year 2022 after the initial 2020 lockdowns caused by the Chinese coronavirus have ended. Despite the end of the first coronavirus lockdowns, though, the virus does not wane, and additional lockdowns are implemented. By 2022, the world is in full blown panic as the virus runs rampant across the globe, collapsing governments and causing chaos. Filmmakers have presented a production plan that will include crews setting up sets on location without any actors present. Actors will reportedly shoot scenes individually and without actors interacting with each other on screen. Deadline reported that there is a plan for remote training for the actors with approval from the trade unions. The film’s production should be welcome news for Hollywood, as Los Angeles County alone has seen roughly 14,000 entertainment-related workers put out of work, according to a new report from tech news outlet dot.LA. Adam Mason (Into The Dark) wrote the script with Simon Boyes (Misconduct). Mason is also set to direct the film. Casting is currently underway, producers said.

The government of Hong Kong announced on Tuesday a 14-day extension of bans on large public gatherings in the city, resulting in the prevention of any mass public events until June 5. June 4 is the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, an event Hong Kong typically marks with a candlelight vigil. Last year, the Tiananmen Square vigil attracted tens of thousands of people and preceded the evolution of isolated pro-democracy events into a sustained movement against Chinese colonization of the city. Hong Kong officially became an “autonomous” region of China in 1997, after the United Kingdom handed over sovereignty. The deal, known as “One Country, Two Systems,” was supposed to allow Hong Kong to retain its tradition of Western-style individual rights but, under dictator Xi Jinping, China has been increasingly imposing laws to erode civil rights safeguards. Protests against China’s impositions, most notably a proposed law that would have allowed Hong Kong to extradite anyone to China accused of violating repressive Communist Party laws, sustained themselves for months before dwindling in light of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. Hong Kong did not lock down completely like many parts of the world, but did ban mass gatherings for weeks. Those restrictions partially lifted at the beginning of the month in light of a diminishing number of new coronavirus cases, triggering a near-instant return of the protests. On Tuesday, Hong Kong Secretary for Food and Health Sophia Chan announced that her government needed to extend a ban on public gatherings of more than eight people in light of newly confirmed coronavirus infections believed to have occurred within Hong Kong. At press time, Hong Kong has documented 1,056 cases of Chinese coronavirus and four deaths. The current ban would have elapsed on Thursday. “As seen from the recent local confirmed cases, the transmission chain in the community has not been completely broken off yet,” she said, citing the three latest confirmed coronavirus cases in the city. Authorities announced on May 14 that a 62-year-old man had joined his wife and granddaughter in testing positive for the virus. The man’s wife tested positive after 23 days of Hong Kong not documenting any new local cases. Doctors typically wait for twice the believed incubation period of a virus to go by without new cases to declare that local community transmission chains have been broken, which in this case would have been 28 days. The new cases resulted in Hong Kong officials planning to test people in 860 households in the family’s neighborhood linked to exposure to those involved. Chan noted on Tuesday that the fact that the virus may still be infecting people freely within Hong Kong made it impossible to lift gathering restrictions or allow the opening of nightclubs and other inherently crowded businesses, but announced one concession: the restoration of religious gatherings at 50 percent capacity. Chan denied that the extension of the gathering ban was intended to ensure that it would be illegal to observe the June 4 anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. “There are no other considerations in terms of the social distancing measures,” she insisted, noting that all extensions of the coronavirus protection measures have been 14 days, so the timing that included June 4 was a coincidence. Police have used the ban on gatherings in past weeks to arrest peaceful protesters in several shopping centers throughout the region. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam is also pushing to criminalize another form of dissent, “disrespect” for the Chinese Communist Party anthem “March of the Volunteers,” as soon as possible. Lam called for lawmakers friendly to her administration to put a law that would result in up to three-year prison sentences for disrespecting the anthem at the top of the docket, making it possible to pass the ban before June 4. Pro-Beijing lawmakers retook the Legislative Council – not without a literal fight from pro-democracy counterparts – this week. The upcoming anniversary observes the killing of an untold number of people – recent estimates suggest around 10,000 protesters – in Beijing in 1989 for protesting against communism. Inspired by the impending fall of the Soviet Union and protests throughout the states behind the Iron Curtain, Chinese citizens flooded Beijing’s iconic Tiananmen Square for peaceful calls for reform. The Communist Party responded with tanks and ammunition. Hong Kong has observed the anniversary of the murders every year since, making it the only part of China to organize gatherings for the event when it joined the communist empire in 1997. Macau, China’s other “special administration region,” typically holds a small photo gallery event, but that, too, was canceled this year. In China, censors work around the clock to erase potential references to the massacre. As last year marked the 30th anniversary, censors not only blocked direct references to Tiananmen Square, but a set of over 260 words that may trigger related results, such as “today,” “candle,” and numbers like 6, 4, 1989, or any combination thereof. Last year, organizers said that 180,000 people filled Hong Kong’s Victoria Park, carrying candles and other lights to represent the people killed by the Communist Party. Police, which have been consistently accused of undercounting protest crowds in subsequent events, claimed only 40,000 people attended. The event did not prompt any altercations or violence.

Several blue state governors have refused to listen to the cries of residents begging them to reopen their respective states, instead issuing threats against localities and business owners who fail to comply with their draconian lockdown orders — threats that have, largely, failed to come to fruition. Residents across several states, under the leadership of Democrat governors, have been urging their respective governors to reopen the economy as the coronavirus curve flattens across the country and hospitals remain significantly under capacity. Some have acted in defiance, forging paths forward without approval from their governors, spurring threats of retaliation from the state officials. However, many of these blue state governors have demonstrated that their draconian lockdown orders cannot prevail against the American spirit, as Americans continue to fight for their right to operate their businesses, work, and earn a living. Perhaps no governor has demonstrated this more so than Pennsylvania’s Tom Wolf (D), who has earned a collection of nicknames — including “Commie Tommy Wolf” — over his refusal to lift the lockdown order on several counties. His lockdown order, which extends to red phase counties, bars non-life essential businesses from operating. Instead of listening to the concerns of residents, many of whom rallied at the state’s Capitol last week, Wolf issued a series of threats to counties and businesses moving to reopen without his explicit permission. “To those politicians who decide to cave in to this coronavirus, they need to understand the consequences of their cowardly act,” Wolf said last week following rumblings of a “mutiny” forming among counties stuck under his lockdown orders. He ultimately threatened to withhold federal stimulus discretionary funds from counties defying his order and also issued a threat to business owners directly, warning that they could lose their health department certificate, liquor license, and certificate of occupancy, at the hands of the state. His remarks came as a handful of district attorneys across the state affirmed that they would not prosecute businesses reopening against Wolf’s orders. Wolf quickly backtracked on his tough talk, admitting that he had not asked the state’s attorney general to take action. “No, I have not–nor do I intend to,” Wolf said. Wolf also waffled during Monday’s press conference, admitting that there would likely be no penalties for gym owners who opt to reopen outside of his instructions. “The real penalty is that the people risk getting sick,” he said. “I’m not sure how gyms are regulated at all, but if they depend on a license from the Department of State or Department of Community and Economic Development or the Department of Health, then that’s where the responsibility lies,” he continued. He added that the “primary responsibility” lies with the business and person making the decision there and the customer. Billionaire Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) has also been talking tough as part of his attempt to discourage potential dissenters. He filed an emergency rule Friday, described as an “additional enforcement tool for businesses that refuse to comply with the most critical aspects of the stay-at-home order.” As a result of Pritzker’s actions, businesses can face up to a $2,500 fine or jail time for violating his order. However, his spokesperson clarified that the threat would only be used against businesses that “pose a serious risk to public health and refuse to comply with health regulations.” “The rule gives law enforcement a tool that may be more appropriate and less severe than closing the business altogether,” Jordan Abudayyeh, a spokeswoman for the governor, said. Ann Spillane, general counsel to Pritzker’s administration, also admitted that “nobody’s getting arrested or handcuffed.” “But they are getting a citation where they would have to go to court,” she added. In the neighboring state of Wisconsin — which Pritzker’s wife has recently visited, despite his stay-at-home order discouraging nonessential travel — the state’s Supreme Court knocked down Gov. Tony Evers’(D) stay-at-home order, leading local health officials to rescind their stay-at-home directives as well. Even Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D), who attempted to imposed some of the most severe lockdown orders in the country — even barring neighbors from visiting each other — has been unable to stop the protests in her state and has faced severe backlash for attempting to enforce her lockdown orders, particularly after waging a war against a 77-year-old barber who reopened his business after being denied unemployment. All the while, she has been losing support from members of her own party. Democrat Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson, for instance, stated that he would not enforce her stay-at-home order, and Democrat County executive Mark Hackel criticized the governor, noting that he remains “unimpressed” by her plan to reopen the state. County sheriffs across the state also took a stand against Whitmer’s instructions. The sheriffs wrote in a letter last month: Each of us took an oath to uphold and defend the Michigan Constitution, as well as the US Constitution, and to ensure that your God given rights are not violated,” the sheriffs wrote in a letter last month. “We believe that we are the last line of defense in protecting your civil liberties.” Pennsylvania’s Cumberland County Sheriff’s Office issued a similar statement, clarifying that it “will not be enforcing any ‘order’ that violates our Constitutional Rights.” On the West Coast, California’s Central Valley took a stand against Gov. Gavin Newsom’s (D) stay-at-home orders, establishing itself as a “sanctuary city” for businesses and churches. City council members passed a resolution “affirming the city’s commitment to fundamental constitutional rights and declaring the city of Atwater a sanctuary city for all businesses,” as the San Francisco Chronicle reported. Americans across the country continue in their defiance of the lockdown orders as business owners — from restaurant owners to salon owners — charge ahead to earn their livelihoods in violation of orders issued by their state leaders. “It appears to be about us, but it’s not about us. It’s about all the people that reached out to me to tell me they’re losing everything — everything hard they ever worked for,” Jesse Probus, owner of Sick Ink Studios in Pennsylvania’s Lehigh County, said in a video statement last week, detailing his decision to begin reopening. “It’s something that I have to do to help other small business owners. Maybe they’ll stand up with me,” he said, adding that he felt as though his “civil liberties are threatened with all this that’s going on.” “Put the politics aside and let the people work, because the country is turning into more like a communist system here,” Themi Sacarellos, owner of Pennsylvania’s Round the Clock Diner, which recently reopened for dine-in services, told Breitbart News. “And I know better than a communist system. I lived in those days.” As Democrat governors fail to enforce their dramatic lockdown measures and slowly begin to heed to the mounting calls to reopen,  states like Florida and Georgia — under the leadership of Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) and Gov. Brian Kemp (R) — are loosening restrictions and yielding hopeful results, as coronavirus cases are not currently surging in either state. In fact, Kemp announced on Tuesday that the Peach State reached the lowest number of hospitalized coronavirus patients “since hospitals started reporting data to the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency (GEMA/HS) on April 8.” “Our hospitalization numbers continue to show encouraging signs in our fight against COVID-19, but we must remain vigilant in our efforts to combat this virus,” Kemp said in a statement. “I continue to ask Georgians to practice social distancing, follow the advice of public health officials, and protect the elderly and medically fragile,” he added: Today marks the lowest number of COVID-19 positive patients hospitalized in Georgia at 986. That’s down 34% since May 1st.  These numbers are encouraging, but we must remain vigilant in our efforts to fight this virus. https://t.co/7uFuMrEyFE https://t.co/f5JRHTfoIK — Governor Brian P. Kemp (@GovKemp) May 19, 2020  Florida has also fared better than blue states like New York, despite its larger, more vulnerable population. “But everyone in the media was saying Florida was going to be like New York or Italy, and that has not happened because we understood we have a big, diverse state,” DeSantis said of the early media criticisms. “We understood the outbreak was not uniform throughout the state, and we had a tailored and measured approach that not only helped our numbers be way below what anyone predicted, but also did less damage to our state going forward,” he added. While Democrat leaders, like Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), are scolding Americans gathering in protest, President Trump has defended citizens who have publicly expressed their disapproval of lockdown orders. “These are great people,” Trump said in April. “They want their life back; their life was taken away from them,” he added.

The radical New Black Panther Party launched a nationwide boycott of “Chinese merchants” on Tuesday — including restaurants, beauty salons, and other businesses — to protest China’s treatment of Africans, among other grievances. Attorney Malik Zulu Shabazz announced the boycott campaign, which he also described as part of a “Buy Black Offensive,” as a protest against discrimination in the People’s Republic of China, as well as the behavior of Chinese companies in Africa. The protests targeted over a dozen businesses across the country, none of which had any apparent affiliation with the Chinese government. For example, one group of protesters held a demonstration outside Yum’s in Washington, DC, a popular local eatery. (The founder came to the U.S. from Hong Kong in 1979.) Breitbart News live-streamed some of the protests in Washington, which included several Black Panther activists trampling a Chinese flag.  Breitbart News’ Matthew Perdie and Jack Knudsen captured the D.C. group in Washington’s Chinatown. Shabazz also staged a press conference outside the Chinese embassy, at which he called Chinese merchants the “bloodsucker of the black community.” Shabazz issued a press release listing the targeted businesses. At his press conference, he singled out the Red Star Restaurant in Harlem, New York City, vowing to “shut it down.” He live-streamed from the Red Star several hours later, apparently having made the trip, filming outside and inside the restaurant as organizers attempted to inform customers about the protest and hand a memorandum to the owner. Shabazz then live-streamed several times from the protest itself, including after police officers arrives on the scene. Shabazz’s press release blamed the Chinese government for “vicious human rights violations; anti-Black racism of Africans living in China; supplying the Black community with poor quality and substandard food; exploiting the local retail market; refusing to hire Blacks; rude and disrespectful treatment; and failure to assist community organizations.” The release further explained that the protests were aimed at “local Chinese business outlets that are open during the pandemic,” with the message that “Harm to Africans in China can bring Harm to Chinese in America.” The protests were timed to coincide with Malcolm X’s birthday.

A video of what appears to be a massive crowd congregating outside a Brooklyn building and twerking on top of cars went viral over the weekend, causing the police to investigate. The New York Police Department (NYPD) is now looking into the video, which went viral on Snapchat over the weekend. The video shows people dancing, twerking on top of cars, and playing loud music on sidewalks as they drink, while staying in close contact with each other. The party is believed to have taken place in the Brownsville neighborhood of Brooklyn, NBC 4 New York reported. A spokesperson for the mayor’s office told NBC 4 New York that police should disperse crowds like that, and anyone who refuses to disperse should be issued a summons. The video from Brooklyn emerged the same day the NYPD shut down a Jewish Orthodox school in Bedford-Stuyvesant that was operating against city and state orders. More than 100 children were inside Monday when the police arrived to shut down the school, officials said. There are more than 191,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in New York City, with 16,059 confirmed deaths as of Tuesday, according to data from the NYC Department of Health.

Muslims in Saudi Arabia will be allowed to perform their Eid al-Fitr prayers at home this year as a result of the closure of mosques in response to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, national news service Al Arabiya reported Monday. Saudi Arabia’s Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdulaziz al-Sheikh said on Sunday that either individually or in a group, Muslims should start praying 15 to 30 minutes after sunrise and carry on until the Duha prayer, the voluntary prayer between the obligatory sunrise and noon prayer. To observe Zakat al-Fitr, the donation Muslims must make to the poor before the beginning of Eid, the Grand Mufti advised that they instead make a contribution to reliable charitable organizations. The coronavirus pandemic has led to the closure of mosques around the world to contain the spread of the disease. However, many devout Muslims have been caught violating the lockdown measures to observe holy rituals in various Islamic countries, sometimes at the advice of religious leaders. The guidance provided by the Grand Mufti follows the decision made by Saudi authorities last week to extend the lockdown measures throughout the country a further five days until Wednesday, May 28. Khaled bin Ali Batarfi, a professor of social studies at Alfaisal University in Riyadh, told The Media Line the extension had been expected given that Eid al-Fitr generally involves people gathering in large groups to “visit markets, gardens, or to any other entertainment places, which usually are crowded with people, in contradiction to the precautionary measures taken during the COVID-19 crisis.” Batarfi added that unlike in other parts of the world, he expects Saudis to abide by the measures. “When there’s an official decision by the government, people feel obligated and commit to it. If such a thing were left without organization and planning, people would feel obligated to socialize. The decision saved face for people,” he explained. “People are still showing acceptance because they understand it is for their own safety.” With a relatively small population of around 34 million people, Saudi Arabia has recorded the 14th highest number of coronavirus cases worldwide. According to official figures, nearly 60,000 people have contracted the virus. Health authorities claim that 329 people have died as a result, a suspiciously low figure that places it massively out of line with global trends. In Belgium, for example, around 56,000 people have confirmed cases of the virus, causing the deaths of at least 9,100, an abnormally high mortality rate of around 16 percent. Other Islamic governments, including Iraq and the Palestinian Authority, have similarly decided to impose curfews to prevent the spread of the virus.

Republicans on the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis are asking Democrats to hold China accountable for causing the coronavirus pandemic, as well as the World Health Organization for its role in facilitating China’s actions. In a May 19, 2020, letter to committee chairman Rep. James Clyburn (D-SC) obtained by Breitbart News, a handful of Republican members on the committee, led by House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA), asked Democrats to join their efforts to investigate China. “We urge you to immediately join our investigation and hold hearings to determine why the Chinese government denied and downplayed the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak, and how China is now attempting to exploit the pandemic it caused,” they wrote. “As President Trump stated in his May 18, 2020, letter to the Director-General of the WHO, ‘We do not have time to waste.’ Congress must work to understand the origins of COVID-19 and reform the WHO,” they added. The letter was signed by Scalise, along with Reps. Jim Jordan (R-OH), Blaine Luetkemeyer (R-MO), Jackie Walorski (R-IN), and Mark E. Green (R-TN). They wrote: Specifically, the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis should investigate: (1) China’s obfuscation of the origin of COVID-19; (2) China’s manipulation of the WHO to cover up the severity of the outbreak; and (3) recent reports that the Chinese government is stealing American medical research and disrupting the medical supply chain, among other tactics intended to exploit the pandemic. Focusing the Subcommittee’s resources on these imperative questions will assist the U.S. government effort to limit ongoing and future harm from Chinese malfeasance. … The Chinese government’s efforts to undermine the American effort to combat COVID-19 and sabotage the global economic recovery are ongoing. We urge the Subcommittee to return to the Capitol and help us hold the Chinese government accountable for its cynical strategy to exploit a pandemic of its own making.
