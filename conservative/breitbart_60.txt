Several peaceful protestors — including the brother of former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn — were arrested at an anti-lockdown demonstration at Speakers’ Corner in London. On Saturday, at least five protestors were arrested by police for allegedly breaking the national lockdown rules by gathering in Hyde Park. Piers Corbyn, a British meteorologist and the brother of the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, sarcastically told police officers that he came to the park for a “picnic”. The climate change sceptic and anti-lockdown activist claimed in a speech: “We’ve got to take back control of the National Health Service (NHS) from this Covid operation. In April, as many people committed suicide in the whole year, there are more people dying because of the Covid lockdown than it is saving.” “The National Health Service has become a Nazified propaganda machine for ‘contagion’. They’re telling us — they said the Jews had contagion — they’re saying everybody in this country could have possible contagion. So, therefore, they can be followed and locked up, ghettoized. We have the Nazification of the National Health Service and we oppose it absolutely,” Corbyn added. After his short speech, Mr Corbyn was arrested by police, who took him away in a van. Mr Corbyn was also arrested earlier this month during a similar anti-lockdown protest in Hyde Park. At the May 16th protest, Breitbart London’s James Delingpole was threatened with a fine and possible arrest by a member of London’s Metropolitan Police for attending the event, despite his “key worker” status as a journalist. There have been over 14,000 fines issued by police during the lockdown since it was introduced on March 23, by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. One protester told Breitbart London: “Isn’t it extraordinary that in the whole history of the world, we’ve never had such a thing as ‘lockdown’ before, so where did that idea come from? Well, it came from Wuhan didn’t it? “So the rest of the world looks at this concept of lockdown — based on these completely erroneous figures — and thinks ‘Well we’ll copy it’. So with that, the Communist Party [of China] have managed to take down the global capitalist system institutions without even firing a bullet,” she concluded. In response to the demonstration, a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police said: “A small number arrests have been made at each site for breach of Covid-19 regulations and some fixed penalty notices issued.” PICS: Antifa, Black Lives Matter Flood London Despite Lockdown, Police Do Little https://t.co/ySrdWGyW0R — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 31, 2020  Follow Kurt on Twitter at @KurtZindulka    

A Cleveland business owner whose cupcake shop got destroyed on Saturday night by rioters said that during the Chinese virus pandemic, she couldn’t have imagined her business getting “hit worse than ever.” Colossal Cupcakes — a popular vibrant and colorful cupcake shop located in the heart of downtown Cleveland, Ohio — was completely “destroyed” by rioters on Saturday evening, according to a report by Fox 8 News. “A gunshot went off and the main window went down. Protesters started pouring into the store,” said Kelly Kandah, the owner of Colossal Cupcakes, to Fox 8. Kandah, who lives nearby her cupcake shop, said that she rushed to the store to close it down upon hearing that rioters were on the move in the city. At the time of closing, four employees were still inside the shop. “I thought if they saw me there, they wouldn’t want to hurt anyone,” said Kandah. “But they started throwing bricks and paint cans and stuff at me and the staff. We hurried and rushed into the back bathroom but they kept coming through the windows.” From there, the store owner barricaded herself with her four employees inside the bathroom and locked the door. She then called the police. “It was horrible,” she said. “We were just listening to them destroy everything. I was so scared in so many ways.” Kandah said that she and her employees remained locked inside the bathroom, only to come out after hearing that police had entered the cupcake shop. “Everything is gone or destroyed,” said Kandah of what remains of her store. “The chandeliers are ripped down, the actual cupcake cases are gone. They took our princess chairs and used them to destroy other cases.” “There is nothing left in there, just glass,” she added. “We just got through what I imagined would be our hardest time, the COVID crisis,” said Kandah. “I never imagined we could get hit worse than ever.” Other businesses in the area were also broken into on Saturday night, including the Cleveland Indians Team Shop and CVS, according to Fox 8. Riots taking place in cities across the country appear to be in response to the death of George Floyd, who died on Monday after former police officer Derek Chauvin was seen pressing his knee onto Floyd’s neck. On Friday, the state of Minnesota announced that Chauvin was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Following Floyd’s death, days of protests ensued, which quickly devolved into the violent riots that are now taking place across the country. The riots have involved looting, buildings being set on fire, businesses destroyed, the White House going on lockdown, and people being beaten and killed. The riots have prompted the mayors of several cities across the country to issue curfews in an attempt to quell the chaos, with some even calling on their state’s governor to activate the National Guard for help. On Saturday, Ohio governor Mike DeWine activated the state’s National Guard to help respond to the violent riots in Cleveland. On Sunday, President Donald Trump announced that the United States will be designating the violent leftist group Antifa as a terrorist organization.

The chairman of the Republican Party in New Mexico on Saturday lambasted the state’s Gov. Michelle Lujan-Grisham (D), suggesting she is a hypocrite for violating her coronavirus lockdown order to make a frivolous jewelry purchase and accused her of lying about it. Asked about the governor breaking her own lockdown rule back in April, Steve Pearce told Breitbart News Saturday host Matthew Boyle, “All across the country Democrat governors think of themselves above the law.” “I think that’s the pattern that we’re seeing,” he added later. “This sense of entitlement. This sense of not having to live by the same rules that they impose on the rest of us is really angering a lot of people and is devastating to New Mexico’s economy.” He went on to accuse Lujan-Grisham (pictured), a potential running mate for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, of lying about violating her stay-at-home order. “Her staff said well [the jewelry] was actually delivered at the curb and then they changed their story — well it was actually delivered to the home of one of the staffers,” Pearce explained. “All of that stuff was not permitted in New Mexico at the time.” He pointed out the state forced a business in Albuquerque to shut down for making curbside sales, consistent with what the governor claimed to have done to get her jewelry in the same city. “An Albuquerque nursery was doing the same thing showing pictures online. People would come and pick up a plant at the curb,” he said. “They were shut down” around the time that the governor made the jewelry purchase under similar circumstances back in April. “The governor’s office is now saying innovative businesses could’ve done the same thing [make curbside sales] if they had any ingenuity about them, just total lies coming out of the governor’s office,” Pearce declared. “And that’s what should make people mad that number one, you do it, number two you get caught, and number three you lie about it.” Our Governor is the latest Democrat to decide that the rules they impose on their citizens to address the COVID-19 pandemic don’t apply to her. A bombshell report reveals that the governor violated her own stay-at-home order to stock up on some high-end jewelry. — New Mexico GOP (@NewMexicoGOP) May 27, 2020  On April 6, New Mexico Health Secretary Kathy Kunkel issued a public health order, prohibiting non-essential businesses like jewelry stores from making any in-person sales. It was not until May 1 that the health order allowed retail curbside pickup. The governor made the jewelry purchase in April. In an interview with the Albuquerque Journal, Nora Meyers Sackett, a spokeswoman for Lujan-Grisham, argued the governor did not violate the lockdown order because it was “contact-free purchase.” She claimed a friend of the governor picked up the purchased item form outside the home of one of the jewelry store’s employees. Ultimately, the governor claimed she purchased the jewelry during the shutdown to “support a local business.” The GOP chief agreed with the Breitbart News Saturday host that Gov. Lujan-Grisham is distracted by her desire to be Biden’s vice president, and has taken her eye off the ball of helping New Mexico residents deal with the coronavirus. “I think she’s trying to stamp some sort of invisible credentials the rest of us don’t see,” Pearce said.

Michel Martin, the black host of National Public Radio’s Weekend Edition Saturday, said “protesters” in Minneapolis have been subjected to tear gas and other enforcement while “mostly white protesters” who gathered in Wisconsin and Michigan last month to push for governors to allow businesses to reopen after the coronavirus lockdown were “heavily armed” and “occupied” the state capitols. The report comes as riots break out in Minnesota and across the country after the death of George Floyd at the hands of police officers on Memorial Day. “This hour, we’ll have the latest from Minneapolis and an update on protests nationwide,” said Martin on the taxpayer-funded media outlet’s weekly program. “But first, we want to take a moment to note how the unrest over Floyd’s death comes at an extraordinary time for America, as the country takes the first tentative steps to reopen from a pandemic lockdown, a crisis in which black and brown Americans have experienced disproportionate sickness, death and economic harm.” “It’s also a moment where other disparities are in full view,” Martin said. “For example, recent protesters in Minnesota have been subjected to tear gas, and President Trump has spoken of using the military to restore order, while last month, heavily armed, mostly white protesters in Wisconsin and Michigan occupied state capitals to demand that businesses be allowed to reopen, at times openly confronting law enforcement.” “Few arrests took place,” Martin said, followed by a soundbite of one of those protesters from last month saying, ‘The guns are fine. We are allowed to bring guns. We are allowed to bring them here.” “President Trump called those protesters very good people and said this about them,” Martin said, followed by an edited soundbite from President Donald Trump. “They seem to be very responsible people to me, but it’s – you know, they’ve been treated a little bit rough,” Trump said in the selected soundbite. “Yesterday in a tweet, President Trump referred to the protesters in Minnesota as thugs, writing the word in all capital letters,” Martin said.

As far as Washington Nationals pitcher Max Scherzer is concerned, there is no reason to continue talks with the league about pay cuts during the negotiations for a revamped 2020 baseball season. Scherzer, who is one of the player reps in talks with Major League Baseball about the scheme to launch a truncated 2020 season, now seems very pessimistic about an agreement being reached. The Nats player issued a statement on Wednesday: After discussing the latest developments with the rest of the players, there’s no reason to engage with MLB in any further compensation reductions. We have previously negotiated a pay cut in the version of prorated salaries, and there’s no justification to accept a 2nd pay cut based upon the current information the union has received. I’m glad to hear other players voicing the same viewpoint and believe MLB’s economic strategy would completely change if all documentation were to become public information. pic.twitter.com/nWKtqGSQo4 — Max Scherzer (@Max_Scherzer) May 28, 2020  Scherzer is a member of the eight-player MLBPA executive subcommittee. The other members include Andrew Miller (Cardinals), Daniel Murphy (Nationals), Elvis Andrus (Rangers), Cory Gearrin (Twins), Chris Iannetta (Yankees), James Paxton (Yankees), and Collin McHugh (Red Sox). A major stumbling block for the negotiations is that the teams have closed their books, and the numbers are unavailable for the players to look at to double-check what the league is saying about the effects the COVID-19 pandemic is having on finances. The player’s union is reportedly preparing a counter-proposal to the league’s offer for a 2020 season featuring a more than 100-game schedule and guaranteed prorated salaries. However, if Scherzer’s sentiment is pervasive, then it looks like the two sides are still not in the same ballpark on negotiations.

Jim Bognet, a former Donald Trump administration official, told Breitbart News Saturday swing district Democrat Rep. Matt Cartwright (D-PA) is “out of touch” on the coronavirus pandemic as well as the George Floyd protests and riots. Bognet (pictured) hopes to unseat Cartwright in Pennsylvania’s eighth congressional district, a pivotal swing district that could help Republicans recapture the House in 2020. The eighth district Republican primary is on June 2. Bognet said his campaign has garnered significant momentum ahead of the congressional primary. Bognet told Breitbart News Saturday host Matthew Boyle, “We are in great shape, we’re gaining a lot of momentum, you can feel the energy and excitement. People are really enthusiastic about coming out and voting for President Trump to get him more votes than ever before in Pennsylvania. We know we are going ahead looking into the fall, that we are going to be ground zero. We need to win Pennsylvania; the campaign can feel the energy, reaching thousands of voters every day on the phones.”  Boyle noted Bognet had been ahead of the curve on many issues, such as calling for a travel ban from China in the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak. Bognet said Republicans need to take back seats such as Pennsylvania’s eighth district because a Republican-controlled House will protect President Donald Trump from future impeachment shams. “I ran for this office to protect President Trump,” Bognet said. “If we don’t get a Republican House, he will be impeached again in 2021.  We can never let that fiasco, sham, and tragedy happen again. So that is my mission.” Bognet said Trump has worked to improve the lives of the black community and the death of George Floyd was a tragedy; however, he cautioned rioting would not heal the nation’s wounds. He said, “It is a tragedy, national tragedy, George Floyd died. It made me sad; it was very disturbing. I was so glad that President Trump reached out to his family, to offer some solace. And Trump has done amazing things for the black community,” including criminal justice reform. Bognet continued: But there is no excuse for rioting. There is no excuse for burning down your own city. There is no excuse for Antifa agitators to come in, whip people up and try to have mayhem and destruction happen. It’s so sad because you know who it hurts, Matt? It hurts the people in that community. It hurts their brothers and sisters who poured their lives into building laundromats and small shops and businesses, and they burn, and then I saw a guy crying as his business was burning down last night. That was horrible. Bognet said this moment could serve as a catalyst for future criminal justice reform. He added that in a similar manner to the coronavirus response, Democrat Gov. Tom Wolf and Cartwright have not led on criminal justice. Bognet said, “This can be a moment where we get some really positive reforms done. You see police misbehavior? We have to go after it. Because it besmirches the name of the 99.99 percent of good cops. And what I saw the other day was disturbing to a large degree I’m very glad that they brought charges. We cannot allow our neighborhoods to be burned down and when these blue state governors and blue state mayors, instead of taking decisive action, like I think President Trump would have if he was a governor, you know Matt, we’ve seen it with Gov. Wolf, and we’ve seen with Matt Cartwright, they are so out of touch they don’t even know what’s going on in the ground. We’ve seen it with coronavirus, and now we’ve seen it with these riots, the people in these communities are going to feel the pain from this.” Breitbart News Saturday airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 10:00 A.M. to 1:00 P.M.

As the world grapples with the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, ongoing turmoil in the Middle East and Beijing’s brutal interventions in Hong Kong, the organization once charged with offering solutions to such problems is sidelined with nobody listening to its calls for “peace, harmony and global unity.” U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has bemoaned a “lack of leadership” during the world’s worst series of crises since 1945. “Where we see power, we sometimes do not see the necessary leadership,” he said recently. AFP reports even after more than two months of negotiations, the 15 Security Council members are still unable to reach agreement on a resolution supporting a call from Gutteres for a global cease-fire while the world battles the Chinese coronavirus. At the U.N., there is a sense the globalist body is drifting and dysfunctional, even as it continues to plead for more money to fund its operations: <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> “In the past, when you had disagreements among members of the Council, it was compartmentalized,” said a U.N. official, speaking on grounds of anonymity to AFP. “So your adversary one day on a particular issue was your best ally the next day on another issue. What we see now is everything spilling over. “So there are camps, or there are disagreements which just spill over from one issue to another,” the official said, clearly alluding to the situation in Hong Kong, where tough new Chinese security legislation has pitted the two leading permanent members of the U.N. against each other. “The tensions between the U.S. and China are really problematic” for the world body, meaning the Security Council is “not able to move forward on a range of things,” the official added. At a press conference Thursday, Guterres expressed his regret the coronavirus pandemic had not evoked a greater sense of unity from world powers. “If the present crisis shows something, it is our fragility. Collective fragility. When we are fragile, we should be humble. When we are humble, we should be united and in solidarity,” he said, in remarks directed to members of the Security Council. As Breitbart News reported, Guterres has been working for months to secure a global ceasefire to enable countries to stop the spread of the virus that first appeared in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year. Today I am calling for an immediate global ceasefire in all corners of the world. It is time to put armed conflict on lockdown and focus together on the true fight of our lives – the #COVID19 pandemic.https://t.co/F6JRA6ekvZ pic.twitter.com/7WgtFMk5GC — António Guterres (@antonioguterres) March 23, 2020  Oxfam International is just one global charity to register its frustration with the U.N.’s impotence, publishing a report saying the globalist cause has been totally ignored. The cease-fire remains unattained due to the Security Council’s “diplomatic failure” to collectively broker a resolution amid the deadlock, the Oxfam report observed, and its absence is expatriated by years of investment in peace-building and countries continuing to sell weapons for use in war-torn regions. “We expect leadership from the council as well as many of those countries who say they support a cease-fire, but who nevertheless remain active participants in conflicts around the world conducting military operations, selling arms and supporting third parties,” Oxfam Interim Executive Director Jose Maria Vera said in a statement. The U.N. recently called for $2 billion to be transferred from wealthy countries to the poor via the globalist body as an aid in tackling the global pandemic which fell short. The slim financial response prompted another call for funds last month, lifting the target to $6.7 billion to accommodate the U.N.’s all new, specially updated global plan to counter the viral epidemic. Trouble is, nobody is listening to a word the U.N. says, even as it burns through those member financial contributions and a yearly budget of $3,073,830,500 it approved for itself to cover the year 2020.

TEL AVIV – Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday offered Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro help and cooperation to combat the coronavirus in the South American country, which is not the epicenter of the pandemic. According to a statement from his office, Netanyahu expressed “solidarity of the Israeli people with the Brazilian people over the spread of the corona pandemic in Brazil.” The Israeli leader also “offered cooperation with Brazilian industries in manufacturing the medical equipment necessary to deal with the pandemic,” the statement said. Netanyahu also offered to organize discussions between the two countries’ teams of experts in order to pass along Israel’s accumulated experience in dealing with the virus. Bolsonaro, for his part, congratulated Netanyahu on forming his new government and said he expects to continue strengthening bilateral relations together. Brazil has confirmed about 375,000 coronavirus cases, second only to the U.S. Because of the lack of testing, the real number is also believed to be much higher. The countries share warm ties. In a visit to Jerusalem last year, Bolsonaro professed his love for Israel in Hebrew, telling Netanyahu, “Ani ohev et Israel,” or “I love Israel.”

SKOPJE, North Macedonia (AP) — North Macedonia has decided to extend a state of emergency for another two weeks because the coronavirus pandemic shows no sign of slowing down. President Stevo Pendarovski announced the extension of on Saturday following a meeting of the National Security Council. The country´s health authorities reported five new deaths and 35 infections in the previous 24 hours, days after the government allowed bars, cafes and restaurants to reopen. The government does not plan to make the establishments close again. North Macedonia had a total of 2,146 confirmed virus cases as of Saturday, including 131 deaths.    

IVANO-FRANKIVSK, Ukraine (AP) – Wearing a white biohazard suit, a face shield and a blue mask over his mouth and nose, the Rev. Yaroslav Rokhman is hard to recognize as a priest when he visits terminally ill patients at a Ukrainian care centre. But his words still bring comfort to the dying. Rokhman, a clergyman in the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, is pleased just to be performing one of a cleric’s most heartfelt duties again. As the coronavirus pandemic’s grip slowly recedes in Ukraine, priests received clearance on May 22nd to resume religious services and to visit the sick and bereaved. “Patients missed the support and spiritual care. They needed a priest. They needed to pray and talk,” he said while attending to patients at a palliative-care facility in Ivano-Frankivsk, a city 450 kilometres (270 miles) west of the capital of Kyiv. Galina Shamineva, a 34-year-old mother of two with cancer, was heartened to see Rokhman, his intimidating protective gear notwithstanding. “I feel good — all thanks to you,” she said from her bed. “I really needed to be able to confess and partake in the sacrament.” Rokhman spoke to Shamineva in a soothing way and made the sign of the cross with his gloved hands. “Sometimes I cry, but I never give up. I’m fighting ’til the last breath,” she told him. In Chernivtsi, one of the Ukrainian cities hit hardest by the virus, the Rev. Vasyl Gasynets has returned to conducting services at his Greek Catholic church, wearing vestments along with a mask while giving Holy Communion. Members of the congregation also were masked as they stood near each other, as did some choir members as they sang. “Our church was clean before the pandemic. And it’s clean during the pandemic. We respect our people. We want everyone to be healthy,” Gasynets said. “We want them to believe that in the house of God, Jesus Christ, Holy Church, everything is clean.” Regulations to prevent the spread of the virus widened a religious fault line in Ukraine. The Orthodox Church of Ukraine and the Greek Catholic Church complied with government restrictions on holding services. But the rival Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which is affiliated with the Russian Orthodox Church, resisted. After the Russia-linked church allowed people to attend Easter services, authorities filed criminal cases against five priests. If convicted, they face prison sentences of up to eight years. At the church’s world-renowned Pechersk Monastery in Kyiv, more than 100 clerics were infected with the virus, and at least three died. Ukrainian authorities reported 393 new confirmed cases on Saturday, down from some 500 new cases a day earlier in May. The country has recorded a total of more than 23,000 confirmed cases and 696 deaths.  

A United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) report has revealed that as many as 650,000 migrants are currently waiting in Libya, ready to cross the Mediterranean Sea to Europe. The report notes that the Chinese coronavirus pandemic could have a major impact on mass migration, but the outbreak has also made such movements increasingly difficult to predict. “The global crisis caused by the pandemic is unprecedented and it is difficult to predict its impact on human trafficking and migrant smuggling,” the report stated, adding that the severe economic consequences of prolonged lockdowns could fuel a surge of migration from various countries, Il Giornale reports. The UN report states: “This suggests that the travel and movement restrictions caused by Covid-19 are not stopping the movement of people fleeing conflict, violence and dangerous and inhuman conditions,” and added that Libyan migrants are forced to use the services of people smugglers. “Information from Libya, where around 650,000 migrants and refugees are currently registered, suggests that the Covid-19 public health crisis has not discouraged people from trying to reach Europe.” Cargo Vessel Unloads Migrants in Sicily As Migrant Route Numbers Rise https://t.co/HU6nenHUmJ — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 10, 2020  While the number of migrants entering the European Union has decreased overall during the coronavirus outbreak, Italy has seen a surge in new arrivals in recent weeks. On the long-term impact of the pandemic on mass migration, the UNODC report predicted that “Future economic downturns are likely to have an impact in terms of movements of people to the richer countries.” Migrants who have arrived in Italy during the coronavirus lockdown have been placed under quarantine aboard vessels off the coast. A report released earlier this month revealed that Italian taxpayers were paying as much as €4,000 per month per migrant in order to maintain the quarantine. Alessandro Pagano, a member of populist leader Matteo Salvini’s League (Lega), slammed the costs, saying: “We are not talking about a third-hand dinghy, but of a ship equipped with a self-service restaurant, pizzeria, ice cream parlour,  pub with special wine assortment, play area and video room, double or quadruple cabins with services and even luxury suites.” Farage: French Navy Coordinates with UK Authorities to Transfer Boat Migrants to England https://t.co/aVQwxcHAPn — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 21, 2020 

WASHINGTON (AP) – The European Union on Saturday urged President Donald Trump to rethink his decision to terminate the U.S. relationship with the World Health Organization as spiking infection rates in India and elsewhere reinforced that the pandemic is far from contained. Trump on Friday charged that the WHO didn’t respond adequately to the pandemic and accused the U.N. agency of being under China’s “total control.” The U.S. is the largest source of financial support for the WHO, and its exit is expected to significantly weaken the organization. Trump said the U.S. would be “redirecting” the money to “other worldwide and deserving urgent global public health needs,” without providing specifics. The head of the EU’s executive arm urged Trump to reconsider. “The WHO needs to continue being able to lead the international response to pandemics, current and future,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. “For this, the participation and support of all is required and very much needed.” The WHO wouldn’t comment on the announcement but South African Health Minister Zweli Mkhize called it an “unfortunate” turn of events. “Certainly, when faced with a serious pandemic, you want all nations in the world to be particularly focused … on one common enemy,” he told reporters.

A federal judge has allowed to stand Maine Gov. Janet Mills’ (D) order requiring tourists to self-quarantine for two weeks after entering the state, which is known as “Vacationland.” On Friday, U.S. Judge Lance Walker denied a motion for preliminary injunction while the lawsuit proceeds. A group of Maine campground and restaurant owners, who claim the governor’s executive order is discriminatory against visitors to the state and harmful to their businesses, is challenging the rule. The Portland Press Herald noted Mills’ reopening plan has extended the two-week self-quarantine regulation for visitors through at least July. The judge’s decision comes in the wake of a statement of interest filed by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) in support of the lawsuit by the campground and restaurant owners. According to a statement by Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband of the Civil Rights Division: The United States Constitution requires government to protect the privileges and immunities of all citizens in our nation. These privileges and immunities include the right of Americans to travel freely anywhere in our country, and state governments cannot limit the right of out-of-state Americans to travel to their state unless doing so is substantially related to protecting the public safety. The Department of Justice remains committed to defending the constitutional rights of all Americans no matter where they live. The department will continue to be especially vigilant of any infringement on the right to travel that unduly harms the ability of Americans to earn a living and support their families. In response to the DOJ’s statement of interest, Mills said, she was “deeply disappointed – and frankly disgusted – that the U.S Department of Justice is making a concerted effort to undermine the health of the people of Maine.” The governor added the DOJ did not raise similar objections “when the President and his own task force took steps to limit travel.” Mills said the required quarantine for visitors is “a proven tool to prevent the spread of this deadly disease.” “It seems to me that [the DOJ’s] only actual ‘interest’ here is, at best, political or, at worst, to harm Mainers, not defend them,” she stated. A group of Maine legislators sent a letter nearly two weeks ago to U.S. Attorney General William Barr, requesting an investigation into Mills’ numerous executive orders during the coronavirus crisis, and claiming she has “exceeded her executive authority.” Among the specific concerns the lawmakers cited are Mills’ “arbitrary distinction between ‘essential’ and ‘non-essential’ businesses; denial of Maine citizens’ “right to assemble” in churches with gatherings of more than ten people; and her executive order “establishing quarantine restrictions on travelers arriving in Maine.” “She ordered churches, restaurants, motels, state parks, and campgrounds to close their doors as ‘non-essential’ enterprises, while allowing abortion clinics and ice cream parlors to carry on business as usual,” Maine Rep. Larry Lockman (R) said in a statement to Breitbart News. “Mom-and-pop retailers have been shut down, but the big box stores never missed a beat.” “Before it’s over, the lockdown will kill more Mainers than the virus, in addition to killing tens of thousands of jobs and small businesses,” Lockman said. “And for what?” he asked. “On a typical day, no more than three dozen COVID-19 patients are hospitalized statewide, in a state of 1.3 million people.”

Howard County, Maryland, has reversed course on a ban on receiving the Eucharist during Masses this weekend as church services resume in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. Calvin Ball, the county executive, said Thursday in an update to his executive orders: Since Governor Hogan announced a modified reopening of restaurants yesterday, Howard County revisited all food consumption restrictions. As Howard County moves closer to a full Phase 1 Reopening, also as of 5:00 p.m. Friday, May 29th, food consumption restrictions will be lifted for faith institutions. Ball issued an order on Tuesday that stated, “There shall be no consumption of food or beverage of any kind before, during, or after religious services, including food or beverage that would typically be consumed as part of a religious service.” However, as Catholic News Agency reported, the Archdiocese of Baltimore said it had “serious concerns” about the public health guidance placing a ban on the Eucharist as a condition for churches to hold Masses. “Such restriction would restrict the distribution of holy Communion, an integral part of a Catholic Mass,” the archdiocese said in a statement. “In fact, if the priest could not consume the Body and Blood of Christ after consecration, it would not be a valid Mass”:  Archbishop William Lori said in a tweeted video message to Catholics of his archdiocese, “Without question, we’ve been apart for way too long, and we are hungry for the nourishment that the Eucharist provides”: "We have been apart for far too long and we are hungry for nourishment that the Eucharist provides," Archbishop William Lori says in special message to parishioners about the gradual reopening of churches. https://t.co/x9NmNT8sjl — ArchdioceseBaltimore (@archbalt) May 26, 2020  The archbishop said parishes in some jurisdictions are open this weekend “with limited attendance” for the feast of Pentecost. Lori cautioned that a “one size fits all” approach to reopening parishes “isn’t possible,” and she referred Catholics to their individual pastors for further guidance. Mary Ellen Russell, a spokeswoman for the archdiocese, said, “We are very pleased to hear that Howard County will be lifting their restrictions on faith institutions regarding food consumption.”

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) shared an infographic on Saturday via Instagram with guidance for protesters, which she entitled “PROTESTING SAFELY,” including a warning of “white supremacists” who “may be infiltrating these protests.” Her recommendation came during ongoing demonstrations, protests, and riots in several cities following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Despite encouraging and supporting unrest, Ocasio-Cortez simultaneously advises her Twitter followers to avoid “public places” due to the coronavirus outbreak: To everyone in NYC but ESPECIALLY healthy people & people under 40 (bc from what I’m observing that’s who needs to hear this again): PLEASE stop crowding bars, restaurants, and public spaces right now. Eat your meals at home. If you are healthy, you could be spreading COVID. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) March 14, 2020        BE SAFE. Here’s our guide on being prepared for safe protests.

Here’s our guide on being prepared for safe protests. PLEASE READ ⬇️
.
1. LOOK OUT FOR THINGS THAT DON’T SEEM RIGHT. There are increasing reports and investigations that white supremacists may be infiltrating these protests, breaking windows and destroying property. If anything seems off to you, DOCUMENT IT. Always check who is organizing.
.
2. FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS OF GRASSROOTS BLACK ORGANIZERS. They have been at this a long time and are disciplined in the ropes of community organizing and demonstration. It IS a discipline. Follow trusted leaders whose goal has been the focused pursuit of justice. If they just showed up, that’s a red flag.
.
3. HAVE A BUDDY. Make sure someone is keeping an eye on you and check in on them.
.
4. STAY SAFE and take care of each other. Further centralization of political power and enforced material equality should be the response to current unrest, determined Ocasio-Cortez. She said: If you are calling for an end to this unrest, and if you are calling for an end to all of this, but you are not calling for the end of the conditions that created the unrest, you are a hypocrite.  If you’re trying to call for the end of unrest, but you don’t believe health care is a human right, if you’re afraid to say, ‘black lives matter,’ if you’re too scared to call out police brutality, then you aren’t asking for an end of unrest. You are asking for injustice to continue, and for your people to continue to endure the violence of poverty, the violence of lack of housing access, the violence of police brutality, and not say a damn thing. That’s what you’re asking.  So if you’re out here calling for the end of unrest, then you better be calling for health care as a human right. You better be calling for accountability in our policing. You better be supporting community review boards. You better be supporting the end of housing discrimination. You better be standing up to for-profit real estate developers that are intimidating people and trying to evict them from their homes. That’s what you better be calling for, because if you don’t call for those things and you’re asking for the end of unrest, all you’re asking for is the continuation of quiet oppression. So if you want the end of unrest, then you should be asking for measures that actually liberate people in their lives from the oppression of economic and social inequity. Ocasio-Cortez regularly qualifies justice as “economic,” “social,” and “racial.” Follow Robert Kraychik on Twitter.

The protests across the nation over the death of George Floyd are fueling fears in U.S. cities that the demonstrations could exacerbate the spread of the novel coronavirus outbreak, which has disproportionally ravaged minority populations. At the very least, thousands of people, many of them from minority communities, have taken to the streets to express outrage over Floyd’s death while disregarding mitigation policies like social distancing meant to stem the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Minority communities have “been most traumatized by the dual crisis of a COVID-19 pandemic and an economic crisis that we’re facing right now,” St. Paul, MN Mayor Melvin Carter (D) pointed out during a press conference Saturday. “Those same communities are being re-traumatized right now as our black-owned barbershops, as our immigrant-owned restaurants as local generational family-owned businesses are damaged and destroyed night after night,” he added. “This must stop.” Some protesters are wearing masks, but Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) told reporters on Saturday they are doing so for the wrong reasons — to wreak havoc without being recognized and “take advantage of this situation.” “I will continue to stress because it seems like a lifetime ago: We are still in the middle of a pandemic and passed 1,000 deaths yesterday. We still have hospitals on the verge of being overrun with COVID-19,” Gov. Walz declared. “We are in the middle of a pandemic right now,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey (D) added, echoing Walz. “We have two crises that are sandwiched on top of one another.” On Thursday, health officials in Minnesota also warned that the mass protests were almost sure to fuel new COVID-19 cases. The Star Tribune quoted State Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm as saying: People are moved to want to speak and to want to gather in solidarity and in protest, and we certainly honor and respect that right. As we know, large gatherings do pose a risk in any epidemic, but certainly where we stand today with the state of COVID-19 spread in our community. Knowing that we have community spread, we just want to again encourage folks who gather to be mindful of the risk. Violent rioting and looting have been raging in Minnesota’s Twin Cities, particularly in Minneapolis, where Floyd died after Derek Chauvin, a now-fired white police officer, kneeled on his neck for several minutes in an incident caught on camera. Floyd was unarmed. The havoc that began in Minnesota has spread to urban centers across America, including New York City. “You have a right to demonstrate. You have the right to protest. God bless America,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) declared during his coronavirus briefing Saturday. “You don’t have a right to infect other people. You don’t have a right to act in a way that’s going to jeopardize public health.” “Even if you think you’re a superhero because you’re young and you’re strong, you can get it and then infect someone else,” he added. “So it’s just wholly irresponsible… You can have an opinion, but there are also facts, and you’re wrong not to wear a mask.” Protests, including peaceful demonstrations, have been sweeping the nation since Floyd’s death on Monday as many cities began a phased reopening. “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” Minnesota Gov. Walz said. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear, and disrupting our great cities.” At least initially, some Democrats, including Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, endorsed the protests that have spiraled out of control. On Friday, Authorities have charged fired police officer Chauvin with third-degree murder and manslaughter.

During Friday’s Democratic Weekly Address, Rep. Frank Pallone (D-NJ) stated that the HEROES Act “lays the foundation we will need to ease social distancing and safely reopen the economy.” Transcript as Follows: “Hello, I’m Congressman Frank Pallone from New Jersey. This week, our nation mourns the loss of 100,000 Americans to the coronavirus. It’s a staggering number and grim milestone. Families all around our nation continue to grieve lost ones, oftentimes from a distance. While it’s difficult to even comprehend this loss, it reminds us that we must come together to combat this terrible virus so that we can save lives and protect communities in the weeks and months ahead. This national emergency requires every aspect of government to work together. We must reduce the spread of the virus so we can confidently begin to reopen our economy and get more than 40 million Americans, who’ve lost their jobs as a result of this pandemic, back to work. And the only way we can do that is through a coordinated national strategy: a strategy that significantly boosts testing and invests resources into contact tracing, surveillance and containment. We simply cannot fight this pandemic if we don’t know who has it and where it is being spread. And that requires a national strategy and response. Unfortunately, President Trump and his Administration have failed to provide the consistent and stable leadership that is necessary to guard our nation through this public health and economic crisis. Instead of showing leadership, competence and vision, the Trump Administration is shirking all responsibility and is instead forcing states to find their own way out of this pandemic. For months, the President has refused to develop and implement a national testing program. For months, we’ve been promised millions of tests were right around the corner and that everyone that wanted a test could get one. These promises have been hollow. Testing is getting better, but public health experts continue to warn that our country is far short of the testing we need. And the failure of national leadership has forced states to compete against each other to procure tests and the vital supplies needed to administer tests from the private market. We simply cannot allow the Trump Administration’s failures to persist, and that’s why House Democrats took bold action and passed The Heroes Act earlier this month. This legislation continues our ongoing commitment to providing the health care resources and support needed to combat the coronavirus crisis. The Heroes Act will strengthen testing by finally requiring the Trump Administration to develop comprehensive, coordinated strategies for testing, contact tracing and surveillance. The Administration will be required to include clear benchmarks and timelines. It will also be forced to publicly report key metrics. These requirements are critical to bringing much needed transparency to our nation’s response efforts. It will allow us to see if the Trump Administration is fulfilling their promises and hold them accountable when they are not. The Heroes Act also provides up to $75 billion in grants to support robust testing, contact tracing, surveillance and containment activities. It also provides additional funding to communities that have a high number of COVID-19 cases or are experiencing a surge, as well as for areas with populations experiencing disparities. This includes low-income and the uninsured, communities of color, people with disabilities and other underserved communities. We simply cannot beat this virus without these efforts in place. The Heroes Act builds on the progress we have made and lays the foundation we will need to ease social distancing and safely reopen the economy. Now, it’s time for the Senate to act. Unfortunately, to date, Senate Majority Leader McConnell continues to delay and obstruct. This cannot continue. With more than 100,000 Americans dead, we must collectively find solutions, like The Heroes Act, that will help us finally stop the spread of this virus. It is the only way we will be able to protect the American people, and safely and confidently reopen our communities. I thank you for listening, and please, stay safe.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

MANCHESTER, England (AP) – Sports events will be allowed to resume in England from Monday without any spectators, providing they comply with the government’s coronavirus protocols. The guidance for elite sports bodies was published by the government on Saturday as COVID-19 lockdown restrictions that were imposed in March are eased further. “The wait is over,” Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said. “Live British sport will shortly be back on in safe and carefully controlled environments.” It paves the way for the planned June 17 return of the Premier League, the world’s richest soccer competition. “There is still much work to be done to ensure the safety of everyone involved,” Premier League chief executive Richard Masters said. The government announcement allows English cricket authorities to plan for international series against West Indies and Pakistan. Formula One is also exploring two races at Silverstone from July, with the season yet to start. The first competitions to return on Monday are set to be horse racing, snooker and greyhound racing which lined up events in anticipation of the end of an 11-week shutdown of sports. British horse racing employs tens of thousands of people and the absence of meets since March 17 has left many facing “considerable hardship,” according to the Jockey Club. “The lockdown has been an incredibly hard period for our industry and it will be a long road back to recovery,” Jockey Club chief executive Delia Bushell said. “While we are not a human-contact sport, extensive plans are nevertheless in place to create the safest possible environment for participants.” Athletes and other staff will be required to travel to venues individually and by private transport where possible. Screening for coronavirus symptoms is required before entering. Where social distancing cannot be maintained – staying 2 meters (6 feet) apart – activities need to be risk assessed and mitigated. Media have been told to “minimize crossover” with others at the venue, including players. There is also a request that “during any disputes between players and referees, or scoring celebrations” they must stay apart. “This guidance provides the safe framework for sports to resume competitions behind closed doors,” Dowden said. “It is now up to individual sports to confirm they can meet these protocols and decide when it´s right for them to restart. “This is a significant moment for British sport. By working with clinicians every step of the way, we are creating the safest possible environments for everyone involved.” The first major event after the resumption of sports is set to be the 2,000 Guineas horse race next Saturday at Newmarket, with jockeys wearing face masks. But the government is not yet prepared to allow non-elite sports to resume, denying regular citizens the chance to play cricket and football in a park. “We are working hard to get grassroots sport back up and running safely too, so that people can reunite with their own football, rugby or cricket teammates and get back on their pitches, fields or athletic tracks,” Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston said. “But we will only do this when it is safe and appropriate to do so, based upon scientific advice.” The government, however, will from Monday allow groups of six people from different households to exercise outside as long as they remain 2 meters apart. Currently only two people from different households can meet up. Though the Covid-19 deaths per day have fallen in Britain since the peak in April, another 215 were still reported on Saturday by the government, bringing the known death toll in all settings including hospitals and care homes to 38,376. Deputy chief medical officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam said it was still a “very dangerous moment” but added the return of sports events without spectators “is not going to have any meaningful impact” on the infection rate.

BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Romania’s prime minister has paid fines totalling about $600 for smoking indoors and holding a meeting in a government building where several Cabinet ministers and other participants did not follow social distancing rules. In a photograph published in Romanian media, Prime Minister Ludovic Orban and others can be seen smoking with food and bottles of alcohol on a table. No one in the photo wore a mask or maintained the required spacing. Orban told the Mediafax news agency that the picture was taken on May 25th, his birthday. The foreign minister and economy minister of Romania were among those attending. Romania has registered 19,133 confirmed coronavirus cases and 1,259 deaths.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has cashed in the first portion of an incentive-based stock options payout for keeping the company’s market capitalization at $100 billion along with hitting revenue milestones. The award is valued at about $775 million. CNBC reports that Tesla CEO Elon Musk has earned the first part of a huge incentive payout according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday. The payouts are linked to 1.7 million shares of Tesla which are valued at around $775 million based on Thursday’s closing market value. Tesla shares closed at $805.81 on Thursday and options have a strike price of $350.02. Thursday’s filing also set a day of July 7 for the company’s annual shareholders meeting, stating: “As of the date of this proxy statement, one of the 12 tranches under this award has vested and become exercisable, subject to Mr. Musk’s payment of the exercise price of $350.02 per share and the minimum five-year holding period generally applicable to any shares he acquires upon exercise.” Musk has earned the first portion of stock options for keeping Tesla’s market capitalization at $100 billion on a 30-day six-month trailing average. A 2018 regulatory filing outlined the conditions for the payout which included Tesla hitting trailing-fourth-quarter revenue of $20 billion or EBITDA (minus stock-based compensation) of $1.5 billion for Musk to get the stock award. Musk owned approximately 18.5 percent of Tesla as of May 1 according to FactSet, an ownership stake worth around $24 billion. Thursday’s proxy filing revealed that Musk’s stake in the company had risen to 20.8 percent, a total of 38.7 million shares, including 18.5 million used as collateral for the CEO’s personal debt. Musk’s full award is set to vest over 12 tranches with different milestone requirements reaching up to $650 billion in market capitalization for Tesla. Since the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic began, Tesla has focused heavily on reopening its manufacturing facilities. Breitbart News recently reported that Tesla plans to open its plant in Fremont, California, and has told workers their options are to violate the state’s stay-at-home orders and come to work, or stay home and forgo payment and benefits. In an email obtained by the Guardian from Tesla’s management to its workers, the firm stated: “Choosing not to report to work may eliminate or reduce your eligibility for unemployment depending on your state’s unemployment agency.” Tesla workers told the Guardian that they feel that Tesla’s management is using intimidation tactics in order to force them to return to the job by threatening to cut their pay and unemployment benefits. Breitbart News recently reported that Tesla has sued local authorities for attempting to enforce shutdown orders. In a post to the company blog on Saturday, Tesla stated that the county’s position had left it no choice but to take legal action to ensure that Tesla and its employees could return to work.

Rapper Lil Wayne interviewed doctor Anthony Fauci — the director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases — on his new radio show, Young Money Radio. “I want to say thank you for even considering being on this show, Dr. Fauci, I really do want to say thank you,” said Lil Wayne as he introduced Dr. Fauci to his show, which is hosted via Apple Music’s Beats 1 radio. “You made a prediction that the U.S. could experience 100,000 to 200,000 deaths,” the Grammy-winner added. “I saw a week later, you were forced to revise that estimate. What number do you think we’re at now?” Fauci estimated that the United States will likely see between 120,000 to 140,000 coronavirus deaths this year. “Well, as you mentioned correctly, Lil Wayne, we’re over 100,000,” said Fauci. “And we still have a number of states, cities, regions, that have active transmission of infection. So although we don’t want to predict an exact number, I think it’s probably going to be at least another 20 or more thousand, maybe 120,000, 140,000.”     We have two doctors on the show today — Dr. Dre, and the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases DR. FAUCI!  We’re facing the worst pandemic of our lifetime and he’ll be on to have a REAL discussion about its affect on our community. Watch LIVE on  #YoungMoneyRadio at 4pm PT/7pm ET on @applemusic. 🏾 A post shared by  Lil Wayne (@liltunechi) on May 29, 2020 at 1:39pm PDT “You gotta be careful, because you know, all of these predictions that we’ve made over these months have turned out to not be completely accurate,” added Fauci. “If we don’t make sure — as we’re trying to ‘open up America again’ — to get things back to normal, there’s gonna be people who are going to get infected, and we may get rebounds.” “So we need to be able to prepare ourselves to respond to those rebounds,” affirmed Fauci. The rapper then asked whether Fauci thinks that returning to normalcy will increase the risk of infection. “I see a lot of cities opening back up and people partying in large numbers,” noted Lil Wayne. “Do you think this will affect the numbers of deaths?” “I think it will,” said Fauci. “I think that if you look at the dynamics of an outbreak in any given state, city, or county, or region, if the infection level is really low, they can afford to be a little more brisk in how they open up and get back to some form of normality.” But if you have a state our a county or a city in which there’s still a lot of active infection, and you jump out there and prematurely do the kind of mingling and get rid of the distancing — you know, you saw those pictures on TV of people crowding at bars and at beaches — you gotta be careful of that because you might be tempting to fate to allow there be a rebound infection, so you gotta do this with care with prudence. To date, the 21 states that have eased lockdown restrictions since May 4 haven’t experienced significant increases in Chinese coronavirus hospitalizations and fatalities, according to an ABC News investigation. The report also said there wasn’t a spike in the rate of people testing positive for the disease. “I hope we’ll get a vaccine,” added Fauci at one point during the interview. “By December?” asked Lil Wayne. “We’ve already started the early phases of the vaccine trial in a number of different candidates,” said Fauci. “And we hope that if we get lucky — and I’m cautiously optimistic that we will — that by the end of this calendar year, the beginning of 2021, that we would have a vaccine that we could deploy to people throughout the country, and then other vaccines maybe throughout the world,” he added.

ROME — The Vatican has decried the rise in anti-Christian hate crimes throughout Europe as well as the discriminatory treatment suffered by Christians during the coronavirus lockdowns. Speaking on behalf of the Holy See, Monsignor Janusz Urbańczyk stressed the gravity of anti-Christian violence in an address at a conference of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) on intolerance and discrimination, Vatican News reported Thursday. The Holy See’s Permanent Representative to OSCE noted the disturbing increase in explicitly anti-Christian acts in Europe, including “threats, violent attacks, murders and profanation of churches and places of worship, cemeteries and other religious properties.” In 2019, Christian sites in Europe suffered a record number of attacks, with some 3,000 Christian churches, schools, cemeteries, and monuments vandalized, looted, or defaced. Reports chronicling the anti-Christian acts describe a broad spectrum of profanation including arson, defecation, desecration, looting, mockery, Satanism, theft, urination, and vandalism. The greatest number of acts of violence against Christian sites have occurred in France, where churches, schools, cemeteries, and monuments “are being vandalized, desecrated, and burned at an average rate of three per day,” the reports state. In his address this week, Msgr. Urbańczyk said he was concerned over the growth of the false idea “that religions could have a negative impact or represent a threat to the well-being of our societies” as well as the push to make prayer and religious practice a private matter with no place in the public square.

Even in the midst of times of crisis, fundamental freedoms such as religious liberty must be respected, the monsignor declared. “Tolerance cannot be an alibi for denying or guaranteeing fundamental human rights,” he said.

China’s state-run Xinhua news service on Friday took great interest in an American researcher’s call for more aggressive censorship by Big Tech companies to reduce “misinformation.”  China’s censorship regime was originally justified as just such a crusade against false information and the regime’s apologists claim that is the primary goal of their million-censor army to this day. The article that caught Xinhua’s interest referred primarily to incorrect information about the Chinese coronavirus, which adds an extra layer of bitter irony since the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is the world’s undisputed heavyweight champion at spreading false coronavirus information: “The pandemic lays bare how tech companies’ reluctance to act recursively worsens our world. In times of uncertainty, the vicious cycle is more potent than ever,” said Joan Donovan, research director of the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School in Cambridge, Massachusetts. […] The senior researcher demanded that “tech companies become more transparent, accountable and socially beneficial,” while urging holding them to this commitment long after the pandemic. “Social media companies must flatten the curve of misinformation,” she added. The Chinese government would never leave it to any private companies to bulldoze that “curve of misinformation” according to their own notions of accuracy or fairness. In China, all of the misinformation bulldozers are driven by Communist Party officials, and a private company CEO who decided to “fact check” a statement by dictator Xi Jinping would never be seen or heard from again.  Dissident Xu Zhiyong, for example, who attempted to do just that in a scathing letter demanding Xi resign, is facing 15 years in prison for his “fact check.” Donovan’s article, which probably caught the eye of the Chinese Communist Party because she railed at length against President Donald Trump and “right-wingers” (and special guest star Elon Musk) for being too enthusiastic about using hydroxychloroquine to combat the effects of the coronavirus, perhaps inadvertently made the case that only a massive government censorship apparatus on the scale of the one constructed by Beijing could provide the level of inoculation against “misinformation” that she advocates: After blanket coverage of the distortion of the 2016 US election, the role of algorithms in fanning the rise of the far right in the United States and United Kingdom, and of the antivax movement, tech companies have announced policies against misinformation. But they have slacked off on building the infrastructure to do commercial-content moderation and, despite the hype, artificial intelligence is not sophisticated enough to moderate social-media posts without human supervision. Tech companies acknowledge that groups, such as The Internet Research Agency and Cambridge Analytica, used their platforms for large-scale operations to influence elections within and across borders. At the same time, these companies have balked at removing misinformation, which they say is too difficult to identify reliably. Moderating content after something goes wrong is too late. Preventing misinformation requires curating knowledge and prioritizing science, especially during a public crisis. In my experience, tech companies prefer to downplay the influence of their platforms, rather than to make sure that influence is understood. Proper curation requires these corporations to engage independent researchers, both to identify potential manipulation and to provide context for ‘authoritative content’. U.S. tech companies are not shy about admitting they cannot police everyone for misinformation, hate speech, and so forth. An ostensibly fair system can be made grossly unfair by applying it unevenly, which is the heart of the criticism from those who noticed that Twitter will contentiously label a post from President Trump for “glorifying violence” but seems untroubled by the Supreme Leader of Iran’s enthusiasm for genocide. The Chinese Communist Party does use “sophisticated artificial intelligence” as part of its massive censorship apparatus, but also has a huge number of human operators working to suppress speech the government dislikes. China imposes its censorship mandates on foreign speech as much as possible and blocks foreign sources of information it cannot control. The cost of such an operation is far beyond anything a profit-seeking company could pay and, as the current debate about Twitter censorship demonstrates, it is exceedingly difficult to find a standard of absolute truth or perfect fairness that would insulate private censors from complaints, retaliatory loss of business, and possibly legal action.  Hydroxychloroquine is, like everything else related to the coronavirus, a matter of much debate among the medical community. That community is still torn by vigorous arguments over whether surgical masks provide any protection from the pandemic. The World Health Organization, of which Donovan wrote approvingly in her article, continues to insist they do not, but masks have become tremendously important to the American Left and the Democrat Party, and its members regard challenges to the effectiveness of masks as “misinformation.” This, again, is not a problem for China. A high-ranking member of the ruling party in good standing would never be accused of spreading misinformation because the truth is whatever the Party says it is. If the truth changes tomorrow, the old truth becomes misinformation. If a high official falls from Party grace, he suddenly becomes a source of misinformation.  The CCP believes its approach is the only way to police the turbulent Internet for “truth,” so it is quite happy to hear people who haven’t thought all the way to the end of the censorship game take a few fumbling steps in its direction.

In Mudanjiang, a city in China’s northeastern Heilongjiang province, a recent spike in coronavirus cases has caused the government to reimpose a partial lockdown, the Epoch Times reported on Friday, with local reports indicating that authorities are sealing residents in their homes. Over the past three days, Mudanjiang health authorities announced that they had identified eleven asymptomatic carriers of coronavirus in the city. The news followed a period of several weeks in which authorities reported no confirmed or asymptomatic cases of the virus. According to the report, Chinese officials record asymptomatic cases separately from symptomatic, or confirmed, cases. Flights into and out of the city have been halted, along with train and bus services, according to the report. Students who had returned to school in recent days were ordered to return home. This is the third time Mudanjiang has faced lockdown restrictions. It was first locked down in January, along with most of China, after the initial Wuhan coronavirus outbreak late last year in the eponymous central Chinese city, then again last month following another outbreak. Students had just been allowed to return to school on May 25 when the third lockdown was announced, according to the report. On May 28, a local taxi driver surnamed Huang told the Chinese-language Epoch Times that residential compounds in Mudanjiang where asymptomatic carriers live have been fully “locked down” from the outside. “Shuguang Xincheng has 107 residential buildings and is one of the largest residential compounds in Heilongjiang Province,” Huang said. “The whole compound was locked down on the evening of May 25.” She added that the Lishui Lantian residential compound, where a colleague of hers resides, was also locked down. A video uploaded to social media by a Mudanjiang local on May 25 and shared by the Epoch Times supports Huang’s account of residences being fully “locked down.” It shows government workers at the Shuguang Xincheng residential compound installing a metal bar on the gate of a residential building, sealing it off from the outside. A similar lockdown was documented last month in Harbin, the capital of Heilongjiang province, located about 200 miles northwest of Mudanjiang. There, one local filmed a residential unit that had been locked from the outside by authorities, who placed an official notice on the gate stating that people suspected of having coronavirus lived inside the sealed compound. At the time, Harbin had officially admitted to just 58 cases of coronavirus, despite enforcing the extreme lockdown measures.

Some Wuhan residents admitted to state hospitals for coronavirus treatment have said they were left in prolonged isolation during their stay under torturous conditions, with at least one person allegedly committing suicide due to maltreatment, Bitter Winter, a human rights magazine, reported on Thursday. According to the report, one Wuhan resident wrote an open letter criticizing the Chinese government after his coronavirus patient mother was left in agony from poor treatment at state hospitals and subsequently took her own life. The man says that his 75-year-old mother was assigned to an isolation unit at a Wuhan hospital after being diagnosed with coronavirus on February 9. “I feel blindsided and cheated by the government,” the man wrote in his letter, blasting the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) “propaganda machine” that “promote[s] … news about its solid attempts to fight the epidemic, how the epidemic was put under control, and how many patients were treated, fully recovered, and were released from the hospital.” He said his mother’s death proves the CCP coronavirus propaganda is a lie. “During her isolation, no doctor treated her at all, and no one gave her injections, medicine, or other most basic care to prevent the deterioration of her condition,” the man wrote. The man’s mother told him that she was not the only coronavirus patient left unattended in the isolation ward. According to her account, two older women assigned to her wing were “barely breathing” and “constantly soiled their beds,” but no one came to clean or check on them. Left along in such desperate conditions, the woman told her son that she “had no choice but to wait for her death.” After a week in the isolation ward, the woman was transferred to Wuhan’s No. 3 Hospital, where doctors again failed to administer her any treatment. The man wrote that doctors did nothing more than take his mother’s temperature each day. “On February 26, the hospital declared my mother cured of coronavirus, and she was transferred to a medical observation facility for 14 days,” the Wuhan resident says. According to the man’s account, his mother was discharged from the observation facility on March 11 despite a persistent fever that had not yet abated. The woman had also been suffering from an “unbearable” stomach pain that her son says was still present when she was discharged. The woman’s family then took her to another local general hospital in the hopes of finding treatment elsewhere. However, doctors there refused to admit the woman, claiming her condition “did not meet hospitalization standards.” The man says the family tried other hospitals but were unsuccessful. Without further recourse, the family took the woman home, despite her fever and “severe [stomach] pain.” At home without treatment, the woman grew desperate from her condition in the subsequent weeks. “My mother gave up all hope,” the man wrote in his letter. “On April 15, she ingested pesticide and killed herself.” Several accounts of coronavirus patients facing “isolation without treatment” have been documented on Chinese social media in recent weeks and months, with some describing the isolation wards as “death camps.” “The hospital repeatedly said they gave me the best treatment design, but in reality, they did nothing for me,” a 23-year-old university student from Wuhan wrote on her Weibo account (China’s version of Twitter) in March while in an isolation ward for coronavirus patients in Wuhan. The account was reportedly part of a suicide note, as the woman threatened to take her own life. “I’ll die in discontent!” she said. In April, another Wuhan resident whose parent died after contracting coronavirus in a Wuhan hospital on February 1 blamed the local government for the death. The Wuhan coronavirus was first documented in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Before authorities had publicly admitted there was an epidemic in Wuhan, Zhang Lifa took his father to a Wuhan hospital in January for medical treatment unrelated to the virus. While admitted, the man contracted the virus and later died. Zhang says the authorities’ “lies and cover-ups” during Wuhan’s initial coronavirus outbreak late last year were directly responsible for his father’s death.

A Cuban poet and political activist claimed this week that Cuban dissidents confined to their home during the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic are essentially under house arrest, with the Communist regime taking advantage of the conditions to further silence anti-government voices. Amaury Pacheco lives in Alamar – less than ten miles east of Cuba’s capital, Havana – with his large family. They have been confined to their home under strict coronavirus lockdown measures for several weeks, which should apply to most Cubans on the island, but police, dissidents say, have been more intensely enforcing the measures against them. A poet and vocal critic of Cuba’s Communist regime, Pacheco told the Spanish newspaper Diario de Cuba that he has come to understand firsthand how the government has taken advantage of mandatory restrictions on people’s movement during the pandemic to further repress political dissent. Forced home confinement during the pandemic has significantly hindered traditional methods of protest, according to Pacheco. Before, activists would stand up to repressive regimes in person, he said, using their bodies to occupy public space in a physical demonstration that spoke volumes. Historically, Pacheco says, “[w]e take to the street. We break the mantra that the street belongs to the revolutionaries. We give it another meaning. We set aside those old tropes and present our physical bodies in their place.” “[The new conditions] have created some anxiety for me because there are arrests [of dissidents],” he said. Pacheco continued: The government has taken advantage of Covid-19 [Chinese coronavirus] to convert our houses into prisons. I understand that there are many measures that are important, but a government that takes advantage of and treats all citizens as criminals … It detains activists, people who are against obscure decrees that go against freedom of expression. During and after Covid-19 [the Chinese coronavirus pandemic] what will we do? … Will our activism collapse because the government has gained ground and has detained us in our very homes? The artist said that during the pandemic, almost all political activism in Cuba has been pushed online. “[All the activism] has spilled over onto the internet. There is more communication now because people are there, Cubans in Cuba, and those in other parts of the world,” he said. Pacheco said that political writing and poetry that the Communist regime might not allow people to share publicly remains free to be published in online forums. “Now we present poetry online as perhaps we could not have presented it in public spaces. In that sense, it [the transition to online activism] has been a benefit,” the poet said. Pacheco says he and his wife, also an artist, are homeschooling their four children – ages 8, 9, 11, and 12 – during the pandemic, adding that they had already been supplementing their children’s state-mandated education prior to the lockdown. “The education they give at school is very bad. We have noticed in recent years that there were elements missing in [the state-mandated curriculum that] we have had to supply as parents,” the writer said. Homeschooling prior to the pandemic was illegal in Cuba. Schools serve as pivotal indoctrination centers, teaching allegiance and zeal for the Communist Party. Cuban officials have famously imprisoned parents for homeschooling. Last year, Pastor Ramón Rigal and wife Ayda Expósito, were sentenced to two years and a year and a half in prison for insisting on homeschooling their children to avoid their indoctrination with communist values. Expósito recently concluded her sentence. In his interview with Diario de Cuba, Pacheco also mentioned that he had witnessed the infamous bread lines that many Cubans are forced to stand in for state food rations. Pacheco said he and his family had stocked up on basic supplies prior to the pandemic and were fortunate enough not to have to wait in these lines yet. He said many people wait in long lines only to receive nothing as the food supplies run out before they reach the end of the line.

Authorities in Blackburn said they will “take action” over a gathering of Muslim men praying in the streets which constituted a “serious breach” of coronavirus lockdown measures. Police in Lancashire had granted “special permission … to perform the [Muslim] call to prayer” in Blackburn to mark Eid, according to a letter signed by Assistant Chief Constable Peter Lawson and local government leader Mohammed Khan. But the document, which was seen by BBC Asian Network, reportedly emphasised that individuals must “pray privately in their home” as “restrictions on congregational prayers had not been lifted”. “Not on the street, not in congregation with an Imam leading the prayer, not with amplified microphones and not with road closures,” the authorities specified. Eid prayers on the streets of Blackburn…forwarded as received. pic.twitter.com/aiP4e1gwa5 — Rahila Bano (@rahilabano) May 25, 2020  Blackburn with Darwen Council said they would “take action” against organisers of the gathering, which saw Muslim men praying in the street to celebrate the end of Ramadan with no regard to social distancing or other coronavirus regulations, after footage of the event was uploaded to social media. Sayyed Osman, the council’s director of adult services, suggested that “the whole community feels let down” by the event, which appeared to breach Wuhan virus guidelines on social distancing and public meetings. “No permission was given for any such gathering and we see this as a serious breach of the national lockdown,” he said, claiming that it was “only a very small minority” who had prayed on the street. “We are working with the police to take action against the individual who organised the gatherings.” Multicultural Blackburn is said to be one of Britain’s least socially cohesive places, with the “Muslim Asian and white communities were living worlds apart” in a kind of informal segregation, according to a BBC investigation in 2007. A follow-up investigation by the BBC in 2018 found that the situation had, if anything, significantly worsened, with the broadcaster — not normally keen to highlight the downside impact of diversity on the country — quoting one South Asian heritage migrant saying: “There were probably about half a dozen Asian families here [when I arrived], nowadays there’s probably half a dozen white families left” — with “very little prospect for integration”. In 2007 @BBCPanorama made a programme in Blackburn, which was becoming segregated along ethnic and religious lines. Now Panorama has returned and found a town that is even more divided. https://t.co/9mdybOfnV2 pic.twitter.com/LgDDrI9Eyr — BBC News Press Team (@BBCNewsPR) January 22, 2018  Breaches of lockdown rules became a major political issue in Britain, with Boris Johnson’s political advisor Dominic Cummings — who is loathed by the liberal media and establishment over his role in Brexit — has been subjected to a weeks-long witch hunt following claims he flouted restrictions. Breitbart London previously compared the media uproar over Cummings, which attracted international attention, to the lack of establishment interest when globalist Irish leader Leo Varadkar was pictured at a topless barbecue in the park with multiple friends. The picnic was dismissed as a “storm in a bag of cans” with the assertion that Varadkar “did no harm” being made in the Irish Times — a newspaper which previously printed multiple pieces condemning British prime minister Boris Johnson for his refusal to sack Cummings. In one article, which decried Britain and America as “racist” nations “full of white people”, it was claimed that Cummings having held on to his job had revealed “a British political establishment that is obnoxious, its corruption and lies hiding in plain sight”.

MOSCOW – Russia has recorded nearly 9,000 new cases of the coronavirus, roughly consistent with the increases reported over the past two weeks. The national coronavirus task force said Saturday that 4,555 Russians have died of Covid-19 and 396,575 infections have been confirmed overall. The relatively low mortality rate compared with other countries has prompted scepticism domestically and abroad. In a bid to dispel suspicions that authorities are trying to lower the death toll for political reasons, Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova explained Friday that Russia’s count contains only those confirmed to have died of the infection, but she also gave figures for people who tested positive for the virus but died of other causes. If all categories are counted as Covid-19 deaths, the nation’s total toll for April would stand at 2,713, or nearly 60 per cent more than the previously announced number.    

BERLIN (AP) – Chancellor Angela Merkel will not personally attend a meeting in the U.S. with the leaders of the world’s major economies if President Donald Trump goes ahead with it, unless the course of the coronavirus spread changes by then, her office said Saturday. After cancelling the Group of Seven summit, originally scheduled for June 10-12 at Camp David, Trump said a week ago that he was again considering hosting an in-person meeting of world leaders because it would be a “great sign to all” of things returning to normal during the pandemic. Immediately after that announcement, Merkel suggested she had not yet made up her mind on whether to attend in person or by video conference, but her office told the dpa news agency she has now made a decision. “As of today, given the overall pandemic situation, she cannot commit to participating in person,” her office said. It added that the chancellor would continue to monitor the coronavirus situation in case things change.

Greece released a list of 29 countries whose nationals will be allowed to visit the country on holiday but several countries such as Britain and Sweden were notably absent. Tourists from the approved countries who arrive in airports in Athens and Thessaloniki will be checked for Chinese coronavirus symptoms, with the checks based on the passport of the traveller and not where the flight originated. The list of approved travel countries was created after announcements by the European Air Safety Agency (EASA) and includes several European countries such as Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Denmark, along with countries outside of Europe such as New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, and even China. All travellers attempting to enter Greece from countries not on the list, according to a report by newspaper Proto Thema, will have to undergo a mandatory two-week quarantine upon arriving. The Greek Ministry of Tourism said that the new policy would go into effect on June 15th and is the first phase of opening the country back up to international travel. Danes Want to Re-open Land Borders to Everyone Except No-Lockdown Sweden https://t.co/A2nX8Gi4Xo — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 17, 2020  The second phase, expected to start on July 1st, will involve all airports in Greece accepting international flights and a second “red list” created of countries that have not managed to keep the spread of the virus under strict control. While the list includes countries like Austria, Germany, and Hungary, it does not include countries like the United Kingdom and Sweden where infection rates continue to grow. Sweden has also been largely isolated by neighbouring Scandinavian countries due to a large number of infections and deaths in the country as a result of the Chinese virus and their refusal to lock down. Mika Salminen, health safety manager at Finland’s Institute for Health and Welfare said that it was much riskier for the country to allow in Swedish tourists, as opposed to those from Denmark or Norway. “It is a political decision, but the actual difference in the spread of infection is a fact, and I suppose the government, of course, takes that into account,” he said. The British government, on the other hand, did lock down — but never implemented travel bans or mandatory periods of self-isolation on people coming into the country.

A new poll released by USA Today/Ipsos found that one in five, or 20 percent, of teachers say they are not likely to return to their schools should they reopen in the fall. The “parallel” online polls of the views of 505 K-12 teachers and 403 K-12 parents were conducted May 18-21. The polls’ credibility intervals, which are similar to a margin of error, are plus or minus five percentage points for the teachers’ survey and 5.6 points for the parents’ survey. According to the polls, 83 percent of teachers said their job is more difficult now, while 71 percent of parents said they believe teachers are working harder. However, a report at Education Week in April observed that teachers have had many more “flexible arrangements” during the coronavirus crisis. “The actual amount of time teachers are expected to instruct on a daily or weekly basis is shorter,” the report noted. “But they must reserve specific times for ‘office hours,’ when they are available to help students and parents individually.” In the USA Today/Ipsos teachers’ poll, 76 percent said online learning is causing children to fall behind academically, and 24 percent said public school teachers are paid fairly. However, less than half, or 46 percent of parents, said online learning is causing their children to fall behind, and 40 percent of parents said teachers are paid fairly. USA Today/Ipsos noted that, in a separate poll of parents, six in ten, or 60 percent, said they will likely pursue at-home learning in the fall even if their public schools reopen, including 30 percent who said they are “very likely” to continue at-home learning options. A RealClear Opinion Research poll released two weeks ago found 40 percent of families are more likely to choose to homeschool their children or engage in virtual learning even after schools reopen. Additionally, an EdChoice poll released in April found 52 percent of parents have a more favorable opinion of homeschooling since the school closures due to the coronavirus. “As our world has changed, almost everything we do has changed, including how we view and approach education,” said Cliff Young, president of Ipsos, in a statement. “Though Americans are optimistic about a return to in-person learning, there is angst among teachers, parents and America at large about how to keep our schools safe if the virus isn’t fully contained.”

Delaware Gov. John Carney (D) issued a cease and desist notice on Thursday threatening to arrest and fine a spa owner for planning to reopen the business in protest of the state’s stay-at-home order, issued to get a handle on the novel coronavirus outbreak. “Further failure to comply with the Governor’s order constitutes a criminal offense and may result in fines and imprisonment,” the Delaware Emergency Management Agency (DEMA), a component of the state’s Department of Safety and Homeland Security, declared in the May 28 cease and desist letter, first published by the Gateway Pundit (TGP). Although the state will begin phased reopening on June 1, the letter said the V Spa will not be allowed to open during Phase I because it is a “close contact personal services business,” adding: Your anticipated operation of a close contact persona services business prior to the termination of the State of Emergency is a direct violation of the Governor’s order and endangers public health. The Governor’s order has the force and effect of law. By the authority vested in the Delaware Emergency Management Agency (“DEAMA). DEMA formally mandates that you immediately Cease and Desist business at the V Spa …. Lauren Witzke, who is trying to unseat Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE), has been an ardent supporter of the V Spa owner. In a statement to Breitbart News, she lambasted the Delaware governor’s office for threatening to imprison and fine the business owner. “The COVID-19 shutdowns in the state of Delaware have gone on far too long. It’s no longer about public health and safety. It’s about political control and ensuring the Democrats’ proposed ‘Vote by Mail’ scheme to steal the 2020 election from President Donald Trump is implemented,” the America First Republican candidate proclaimed. COVID-19 is the disease produced by the Chinese coronavirus. “Governor John Carney and [Senate Minority Leader] Chuck Schumer [D-NY] lackey Chris Coons plan to allow Delawareans to starve while they attempt to rig the upcoming election,” Witzke added. Taking a page from the governor’s playbook, a local news outlet threatened to have Witzke arrested for trying to hold a press conference outside the television station after it refused to cover the cease and desist order issue. Witzke told TGP: As for WBOC, threatening to have a political candidate arrested for holding a press conference outside their news studio is flatly absurd, though I can’t say I’m surprised by the far-left media. They continue to act as PR [public relations] agents for the DNC [Democratic National Committee]. Maybe WBOC should try covering the news, instead of covering for Chris Coons. Witzke announced via Twitter that she is still planning to hold the press conference outside the station Friday evening. pic.twitter.com/CbgD56DRDM — Lauren Witzke for U.S. Senate (@WitzkeforDE) May 29, 2020  The Democrat-allied leftwing media has reportedly been attacking Witzke, who is running on policies similar to President Trump’s. All U.S. states have at least partially reopened, with the vast majority allowing their stay-at-home orders to expire.

There was no significant increase in Chinese coronavirus hospitalizations, fatalities, and the percentage rate of people testing positive for the disease in 21 states that eased lockdown restrictions on May 4 or earlier, including seven that did not implement a shutdown order at all, an ABC News investigation reportedly found this week. Health analysts consider the number of hospitalizations, fatalities, and the positivity test rate, particularly the seven-day average given the swings in the figures reported daily, to be good proxies for the severity of COVID-19, the new coronavirus disease. Eric Strauss from ABC News identified the 21 states as South Carolina, Montana, Georgia, Mississippi, South Dakota, Arkansas, Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Wyoming, Kansas, Florida, Indiana, Missouri, Ohio, and Nebraska. On Thursday, he wrote on Twitter: JUST IN: [ABC News] looked at 21 states that eased restrictions May 4 or earlier & found no major increase in hospitalizations, deaths or % of people testing positive in any of them. [SC, MT, GA, MS, SD, AR, CO, ID, IA, ND, OK, TN, TX, UT, WY, KS, FL, IN, MO, NE, OH] via [Arielle Mitropoulos]. About a handful of those states — Arkansas, Iowa, South Dakota, Utah, Oklahoma, Wyoming, Nebraska — did not implement a statewide stay-at-home order or any similar measure to stem the spread of the highly contagious and lethal COVID-19. All U.S. states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia are at least partially reopened, with the vast majority allowing their stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders to lapse. New Jersey is the only state that remains mostly shut down, except for limited re-openings for specific retail stores and construction industries, data compiled by the New York Times showed on Friday. The stay-at-home order in New Jersey, home the strictest statewide lockdown, is expected to expire June 5. Delaware’s lockdown measure will not expire until Sunday, but the state has allowed more limited re-openings than New Jersey. ABC News had yet to publish the results of its study as of Friday afternoon, but the alleged author, Mitropoulos, retweeted Strauss’s post about the investigation: JUST IN: @ABC looked at 21 states that eased restrictions May 4 or earlier & found no major increase in hospitalizations, deaths or % of people testing positive in any of them.

Strauss (@ericMstrauss) May 28, 2020  Breitbart News has determined that after a spike in cases reported each day soon after the state allowed non-essential businesses to reopen on May 1, Texas turned things around. Over the past weeks, the Lone Star state has seen a steady decline in the seven-day average of new coronavirus cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and positivity test rates reported daily. To justify decisions to allow non-essential businesses to reopen, U.S. state officials have been relying on a five or seven-day average number of cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and test positivity rates to account for daily swings in the raw figures. Like several other state leaders, “Gov. Greg Abbott is looking at two specific metrics to justify his decision to restart the Texas economy — the positive test rate and hospitalization levels,” the Texas Tribune noted. To make its determination that there was no COVID-19 spike in the 21 states that reopened early, ABC News likely relied on the seven or five-day average numbers given that the daily hospitalization and fatality figures, along with the rate of people testing positive, fluctuate day by day. The overall number of cases and deaths continue to increase in the United States. As of Friday afternoon, over 1.7 million U.S. residents had tested positive for COVID-19, and over 102,000 had succumbed to it, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker.

Friday on MSNBC, network anchor Chuck Todd said it “seemed” as if President Donald Trump was afraid to lead because he did not take questions from reporters following his White House announcement earlier in the day. After Trump left the podium without taking questions, Todd said, “All right, President Trump with a not taking questions at all. Deciding with his announcement on the various ways he’s going to attempt to punish China over their decision to essentially erase the treaty they originally agreed to with Hong Kong. Look, it’s not lost, I think, on a lot of people to see number one, Katy, he had nothing else to say. He went right to that, stuck to the teleprompter, and walked right out. I think that tells us how he’d like to engage in the Minnesota issue.” Co-host Katy Tur said, “I think you’re right there. There’s a city that is smoldering right now, there are people across this country, the black community is in pain, there is a pandemic, and the president tried to clear it all up, or at least clear his part in potentially inflaming those tensions with a tweet earlier today. Didn’t want to take any questions from reporters.” Todd said, “I got to ask, is the president afraid to lead right now? To not engage at all, I just— that seemed like he was afraid of this. He doesn’t know what to say.” He added, “We’re struggling as a country right now, and that’s — no matter what you think — the president of the United States can’t bring himself to say anything about a Midwestern city that’s smoldering.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

President Donald Trump on Friday announced at the White House that the United States would terminate its relationship with the World Health Organization. The president said that Chinese officials failed to report details of the coronavirus properly to the World Health Organization (WHO) and pressured the organization to mislead the world about the its dangers. “Countless lives have been taken and profound economic hardship has been inflicted all around the globe,” he said. Trump said that the WHO failed to act on reforms that the United States had demanded, prompting his decision to end America’s role with the organization. “We have detailed the reforms that it must make and engage with them directly, but they have refused to act,” he said. Trump said that the United States would use the hundreds of millions previously sent to the WHO to other international aid programs. “The world needs answers from China on the virus,” Trump says. “We must have transparency.” He noted that Chinese officials shut off people from leaving Wuhan during the peak of the coronavirus pandemic to other parts of China but allowed them to travel the world and spread the virus. “The death and destruction caused by this are incalculable,” Trump said. “We must have answers, not just for us, but the rest of the world.”

No less than the New England Journal of Medicine has dealt a body blow to America’s growing army of mask fascists with the news that “wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection.” The reasons for this are both simple and logical: We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection. Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes). The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal. In many cases, the desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic. So there you go… The only real way to catch the China Flu is to hang out with someone infectious for a protracted period of time, so it’s unlikely you will catch it walking along somewhere, like a store or sidewalk. Obviously, as the Journal points out, if you are a healthcare worker, you are going to be dealing with someone infectious indoors, in a closed setting, and not just passing by. So the Journal warns that the “mask is a core component of the personal protective equipment (PPE) clinicians need when caring for symptomatic patients with respiratory viral infections, in conjunction with gown, gloves, and eye protection.” Even so, the Journal’s warning for healthcare workers points out that a mask is still not very helpful “since it does not provide protection from droplets that may enter the eyes or from fomites on the patient or in the environment that providers may pick up on their hands and carry to their mucous membranes.” “What is clear, however, is that universal masking alone is not a panacea. A mask will not protect providers caring for a patient with active Covid-19 if it’s not accompanied by meticulous hand hygiene, eye protection, gloves, and a gown,” the Journal adds. The World Health Organization (W.H.O.) goes even further: “Masks should only be used by health care workers, caretakers or by people who are sick with symptoms of fever and cough,” said Dr. April Baller, a public health specialist for the W.H.O. Baller adds that the danger to a healthy person wearing a mask is a “false feeling of protection” — which is something the CDC warned of early on during this pandemic, back when we were told not to wear masks. Of course, the CDC has flip-flopped completely on the mask issue, which means that what we are now being told by the New England Journal of Medicine and W.H.O. contradicts the latest CDC guidelines, which, after telling us for weeks that masks are useless against the virus, now “recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.” Since its flip-flop, I have never really bought into the idea that American health “experts” like the CDC and Drs. Fauci and Birx were genuine in their flip-flop on the mask issue. It always seemed to me that public and media pressure forced them into caving. Even today, Fauci can’t bring himself to offer a full-throated mask endorsement, only that the mask is a “symbol” of what “you should be doing” … they are a “valuable safeguard” and part of “respect for another person.” This is a far cry from what he said in March: “There’s no reason to be walking around with a mask,” infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci told 60 Minutes. While masks may block some droplets, Fauci said, they do not provide the level of protection people think they do. Wearing a mask may also have unintended consequences: People who wear masks tend to touch their face more often to adjust them, which can spread germs from their hands. It would seem to me that the need to wear a mask should be based on how the virus in question operates. If, as the New England Journal of Medicine points out, you need to be in close contact with an infected person for up to 30 minutes in order to get infected with the coronavirus, the mask is unnecessary unless you’re in that situation. Out of concern for my wife, I’ve worn a mask since day one, even when Fauci was telling me not to… And I will continue to, at least for the foreseeable future, even though I hate the damn thing. Sadly, though, this latest science against wearing masks will get no traction in our corrupt corporate media or with the corrupt Democrat politicians who have embraced mask fascism with the unbridled glee that all self-righteous bullies embrace such things, embrace any opportunity to join a pious mob and feels a false sense of superiority while shaming and terrorizing others. Like the fact that the coronavirus is no more lethal to those 50 and under than the seasonal flu, the media will cover up this important information. Like the fact Democrat Govs. Whitmer, Cuomo, and Murphy poured infection into nursing homes, the media well bury this information. But here’s the thing… If you believe a mask will protect you, go ahead and wear a mask. But what do you care if someone else is wearing one or not? As long as you’re wearing one what does it matter? Why can’t we just leave each other alone? Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.

Some left-wing Democrat governors want to damage their states’ economies with extended coronavirus-related lockdowns, noted Rep. Greg Steube (R-FL), offering his remarks on Friday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow. Marlow described Florida’s response to the coronavirus outbreak as “a pretty big success story” largely ignored by news media. “I think that the death toll and economic toll [in Florida] have been significantly lower than comparably sized states like New York,” Marlow said. “[The] decision to cram infected patients back into nursing homes and not clean the subway system is so unbelievably heinous.” Americans will voluntarily be conscientious about their health in the context of the coronavirus outbreak without governmental decrees, assessed Steube. “It just goes to show that people will take their own personal responsibility to ensure that they’re being safe and they’re taking care of themselves and their families,” Steube said. Steube referenced a Thursday-published Tampa Bay Times article which declared that “Florida hasn’t seen a spike in coronavirus cases” following its economic reopening.  Coronavirus-related statistics from Florida as noteworthy given the Sunshine State’s large share of elderly residents, noted Steuebe. Steube stated, “I have the second-most elderly district in the entire country. Florida has some of the most elderly population, one of the most diverse populations, and we have actually more people than New York does.” Steuebe continued, “If you compare the [coronavirus] numbers in New York to the numbers in Florida, they’re staggeringly different.” According to an interactive map produced by the New York Times tracking coronavirus infections and deaths — citing “state and local health agencies and hospitals” as its data sources — Florida had 52,277 cases with 2,363 deaths. New York had 371,559 cases and 29,438 deaths. Steube remarked, “I believe we live in the country that provides freedoms, and we should not be telling people they can’t leave their houses to do the things that they need to do or to [shut down] a business owner.” Steuebe noted much of the news media’s alignment with left-wing and partisan Democrat politics regarding the coronavirus-related shutdowns. “It’s interesting to watch the mainstream media just completely criticize DeSantis when — if you look at the numbers — he’s probably had one of the biggest success stories in the entire country from a state that is very populous, very diverse and very old, yet they’re not going to talk about that,” Steube said. Steube determined, “I think that some of these left-wing Democratic governors want nothing more than to destroy their states’ economies. Look no further than Michigan. The things that are going on there are just atrocious, and they violate, in my opinion, our individual liberties and our constitutional rights.” Steube concluded, “Hopefully, these things will start to change significantly, and the DOJ will get involved in these overly abusive and overly burdensome orders.” Breitbart News Daily broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.

The president of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) told the USA Today editorial board she does not agree with President Donald Trump’s view that schools should reopen as soon as possible. In an interview published Thursday, Randi Weingarten accused Trump of creating a “false narrative that people either want to stay in place, locked down, or you open things up as if it was last June.” Weingarten said if there is a second wave of coronavirus infections during the summer, “all bets are off” for reopening schools. The union leader said the distance learning taking place since schools shut down “is something that we all know has not been good for kids.” She noted teachers have “worked really hard” to be flexible to do remote teaching but said online education “is not a substitute for the relationship building and the alchemy that happens in schools and in classrooms.” Weingarten added perhaps “a kid or two” will do well with virtual learning, but dismissed it as a potential ongoing education mode. However, she admitted she could envision some high schools opening one day a week since students of that age “may be able to do more in remote.” She responded to a question about when Americans would know if schools will open in time for the fall semester with the statement, “I think your question is, what’s going to happen in terms of school buildings.” Weingarten added: I think we’re going to know that based upon two facts. Will we get this (financial aid) package (from Congress)? Because if we don’t get that package, then school buildings are not going to reopen in the way that they need to. The second real issue, which is a big uncertainty, is whether there’s going to be a second wave. If a second wave crops up that you can’t contain, then schools won’t open in September. I want schools to open safely and responsibly, and as a union, we are doing everything in our power to prepare people to do that and to try to make it work. The union leader stressed again that schools will need more funding to open “safely and responsibly.” “It’s going to cost more money than we’re spending now,” she continued. Weingarten suggested some possible means of social distancing in schools. “You might have to halve the size of the school in terms of the number of kids that are there,” she said. “You might have to stagger morning and afternoon sessions. … You’d have to clean the school between sessions.” The AFT president acknowledged the possibility of “hybrid models” of school for some districts but emphasized that reopening will be a difficult, but necessary, feat. “[I]t’s not good for kids to be home like this,” she said. In response to her support to “road test” some possible innovations for schools during the summer months, Weingarten admitted some of her members have asked, “[W]hy are you pushing for this? And why are you pushing for summer school?” She said the fear and anxiety associated with the infection caused by the Chinese virus is “legitimate.” “This illness, excuse my language, it knocks the s–t out of you,” she said.

Consumer sentiment improved slightly in May boosted by a big improvement in views of current economic conditions. The University of Michigan’s index of consumer sentiment rose half a percentage point in May, according to the survey’s chief economist Richard Curtin. Consumer assessments of current conditions jumped 10 percent compared with April. The gauge of current conditions crashed in March and early April, falling by 40 points. But it appeared to stabilize in April, perhaps because of government payments to taxpayers, programs to stabilize employment, and enhanced unemployment benefits. Now it is on the rise again. “The CARES relief checks and higher unemployment payments have helped to stem economic hardship, but those programs have not acted to stimulate discretionary spending due to uncertainty about the future course of the pandemic,” Curtin said. Troublingly, consumer expectations continued to weaken in May as it became clear that the reopening of the economy would be slower than many expected when the lockdown orders were initially issued. Expectations began weakening in March but held up better than the current conditions metric, indicating that Americans were startled by the sudden crash in stocks and lockdown orders that brought much of the economy to a halt but expected a quick recovery. April saw a steeper plunge in expectations as the extent of the economic damage became clearer and lockdowns stretched on. In May, the expectations gauge fell another 6 percent to 65.9, the lowest level in six years, from 67.7 in the mid-month preliminary reading and 70.1 in the April reading. “It should not be surprising that a growing number of consumers expected the economy to improve from its recent standstill, or that the majority still thought conditions in the economy would remain unfavorable in the year ahead,” Curtin said. While the government’s aid programs have likely boosted consumer sentiment they are also likely the cause of rising inflation expectations. Recent data on prices, however, suggests that the economy is experiencing deflationary pressure from lower consumer spending. Bond yields and other market based indicators do not predict much inflation in the year ahead.

Liberal Democrat leader Sir Edward ‘Ed’ Davey is attempting to use the Chinese coronavirus pandemic as an excuse to delay Britain’s true Brexit from the European Union, arguing that a two-year delay is “just common sense”. “We are facing the deepest recession in 300 years [a]fter the most serious public health crisis in over 100 years,” he argued in a statement posted on social media. “With a climate emergency that demands action now Delaying Brexit by 2 years is just common sense,” he claimed — although the link between the pandemic and an alleged “climate emergency” was left unclear. The 54-year-old’s choice of words was revealing, as, formally Brexit has already happened, with the United Kingdom leaving the European Union in January 2020. However, it is now in a so-called “transition period” with the bloc in which it remains an EU member-state in all but name, still subject to its laws, its judges, its trade policy, and its migration regime, among other things — with the only real change being that Britain has lost its representation in EU institutions such as the European Commission and the supranational Court of Justice. We are facing the deepest recession in  300 years After the most serious public health crisis in over 100 years With a climate emergency that demands action now Delaying Brexit by 2 years is just common sense @LBC https://t.co/pp2K4lnbBf — Ed Davey MP 🔶🇺 #StayHomeSaveLives #ProtectNHS (@EdwardJDavey) May 28, 2020  Sir Ed’s proposal to extend the transition for two years — meaning that, the better part of a decade on from the British people’s vote to Leave the European Union, the country would still not be free of the bloc in a meaningful sense — is backed by a range of EU loyalist British opposition leaders, as well as the EU itself. Indeed, a plan to extend the transition was reportedly “all but agreed at official level” while Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his chief adviser Dominic Cummings were out of action with coronavirus infections — but this was “scuppered” when the later recovered and returned to work. Now that Cummings’ is under pressure to resign from his position over claims that a move from London to Durham during the lockdown to ensure his young son’s childcare needs could be met, however, the efforts of politicians to delay Brexit by the EU and British EU loyalists like Sir Ed have intensified, with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier writing an open letter to British opposition politicians to make it clear that a two-year extension is very much on offer. The official position of Boris Johnson’s government is that it will not agree to any extension — at least for now. Thank you @MichelBarnier for your letter today confirming the EU is open to a two-year extension to the Brexit transition period. Time is running out. @BorisJohnson must put his responsibilities to jobs and the economy first –  agree an extension to prevent another crisis. pic.twitter.com/b9NqjP1YwZ — Ian Blackford (@Ianblackford_MP) May 27, 2020 

Friday on Fox News, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow warned unemployment news was to get worse before it gets better due to the economic downturn resulting from the coronavirus pandemic. Kudlow, however, said there were other positive signs in the economy offering reasons for optimism. “You know, the things are looking better, OK?” he said. “Now, we are still in the pandemic contraction. We probably haven’t peaked in unemployment, and the numbers coming in the weeks ahead are going to be very poor here in the second quarter. It’s a lot of hardship, a lot of heartbreak, OK, a lot of anxiety, so it certainly isn’t over. But, but, but, but I will say this. The virus is flattening and coming downward. The openings are coming across the country. Businesses are opening. New business applications are opening. There’s kind of a list, Steve, of all the – you know, I call them glimmers of hope and growth. Cars are driving more. Gasoline prices are up. The Apple Mobility Index is up.” “We’re even seeing on the unemployment claims, which is a terrible number – close to 40 million – but it is slowing in its increase,” Kudlow continued. “So there’s some hopeful signs, and I think we’re going to move strong into the second half of the year with perhaps as much as 20 percent economic growth. We’ll talk about this with the business leaders and next steps on economic policy. You know, we’ve gone through the liquidity phase. Now we’re in the reopening phase. I think the next phase has to go back to old fashion Trumponomics — cutting taxes, deregulating, fair trade deals, things that grew the economy rapidly in the first three years plus and things that can grow the economy rapidly in the second half and onto next year. The president rebuilt the economy. He can do it a second time. We’ll have this whole conversation with the CEOs and the others.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor

The world’s alarmists took another hit with the news Denmark was able to reopen its schools and daycare centers without an increase in coronavirus infections. Reuters reports that after a one-month lockdown, “Sending children back to schools and day care centres in Denmark, the first country in Europe to do so, did not lead to an increase in coronavirus infections[.]” In fact, the “number of infected children aged between one and up to 19 has declined steadily since late April[.]” It should be added the Denmark schoolchildren pictured in the Reuters piece are not wearing masks, nor are the adults. There was what is described as a “slight uptick” immediately after the schools reopened, but it came too soon to be blamed on the reopening and was probably due to the increase in testing. There’s more good news out of Denmark: a “steady drop in daily infections, hospital admissions and deaths since early April has led Denmark to continue its reopening, with shopping malls, bars, restaurants allowed to reopen in May.” And here’s more bad news for coronavirus alarmists, courtesy of no less than ABC News… “ABC looked at 21 states that eased restrictions May 4 or earlier & found no major increase in hospitalizations, deaths or % of people testing positive in any of them.” Well, how about that… Regardless of all this, even if the infection rate increased in Denmark, it still makes no sense to keep children out of school, especially now we know the coronavirus is no more lethal to those under the age of 50 than the seasonal flu. As far as teachers and staff over the age of 50, if they are concerned about infection, they can wear a mask or find a job that will allow them to work from home. There is just no valid scientific or moral reason to keep anyone under the age of 50 locked down, most especially children who have the least to worry about with the coronavirus. They are probably in as much danger of dying in a car accident as they are from the coronavirus. Regardless, if we are not closing schools to “save lives” during the seasonal flu, we should no longer be shuttering our schools for the coronavirus when the risks are exactly the same for students. And let’s not forget the risks that come from these lockdowns, the lack of socialization and structure, the damage that does to children. Over and over and over again, the science continues to prove that the “experts” we wrong about almost everything. What we appear to have here is a disease that ravages the elderly, but what did we do? We pulled kids out of school, locked up the young people who are in almost no danger, shattered 40 million of their lives by killing their jobs. And those who are truly at risk — those who live in nursing facilities? Well, Democrat governors like Andrew Cuomo of New York, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, and Phil Murphy of New Jersey had the plague poured directly into those nursing facilities.

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas will soon allow outdoor pro sports events to have spectators, but the numbers will be strictly limited, under a new order Thursday from Republican Gov. Greg Abbott. Abbott revised a decision to let pro sports leagues host events without fans starting in June as part of the state’s move to reopen amid the coronavirus pandemic. Abbott’s new order allows outdoor stadiums to host fans up to 25% of their normal capacity. Leagues will have to apply to state health officials to be allowed to have fans. Indoor events will still be without spectators. The change came the same day Texas reported a one-day high in new cases with 1,855 reported Thursday. Texas now has 59,776 confirmed cases through nearly 990,000 viral and coronavirus antibody tests. It has 1,601 deaths, a one-day increase of 39. The actual number of cases is likely far higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. IndyCar is set to open its season at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth on June 6, but track president Eddie Gossage said that even under the new rule, the Genesys 300 race will still not include fans. “Nobody wants to have the stands filled with fans more than me but we’re just not in a position to do that yet,” Gossage said in a written statement, noting the race will be broadcast live on NBC. “While the state will permit us to operate at 25 percent of capacity, there are still too many unanswered questions for an event that is just one week away.” PGA Tour has previously said it plans to restart its season at Colonial in Texas on June 11-14 without fans attending. Major League Baseball has proposed starting its season in early July at regular-season ballparks, if necessary without fans. Abbott’s order, however, may not impact the Texas Rangers and the Houston Astros because “stadiums with retractable roofs are not considered to be outdoors,” health department spokeswoman Lara Anton said. State health officials did not immediately respond to questions on whether any leagues or event organizer have asked to be allowed to have spectators. The state has set up several guidelines, including a recommendation that spectators and employees keep at least 6 feet (2 meters) apart from anyone not from their household. If that is not feasible, other measures such as face coverings and sanitation protocols should be followed. Athletes will not be required to wear masks, but the guidelines encourage them to be worn on the sidelines.
The order does not address college sports events. For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death. However, most patients recover.

Friday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” network anchor Joy Reid addressed the scene in Minneapolis as violent protests have ramped up. Reid pushed back against the situation being labeled as a “riot” despite the looting and burning of buildings, adding people in Minneapolis are “risking COVID” to say “stop killing us” and “acknowledge that we’re people.” “The lack of sense that these are people — as black people right now, we feel hunted,” Reid explained. “Everybody I know, white, black, every race that I know is angry. No one I know is sleeping. People are stressed. People are afraid. But everybody black I know feels hunted. And that is not the way we’re supposed to feel in our own country. And I disagree with only one thing that was said: the word ‘riot.’ What happened in 1921 in Tulsa, when black people were massacred just for having a nice neighborhood, that was a riot. That ain’t a riot what we’re seeing right now in Minneapolis.” “What we’re seeing right there is frustration and anger and rage and an uprising,” she continued. “It’s the same thing that we saw in Ferguson. It is the same thing that we saw in Baltimore. Because when people get good and sick of being killed for nothing in their own country and treated like sub-humans in their own country, people get mad, and people get sick of it. People are risking COVID to explain to this country that we’re fed up. Just stop killing us. This is not a — this is not a huge demand. Black Lives Matter was a minimal demand. Just acknowledge that we’re people. Now, we’re just saying, ‘Just stop killing us.’ Whether it is police or ex-police or civilians, please, just stop killing us.” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent

Police are scrambling to track down hundreds of people who fled coronavirus quarantine centers in recent days in Zimbabwe and Malawi, the Associated Press (AP) reported on Thursday. In Blantyre, Malawi, over 400 people escaped from a quarantine center set up at a local stadium recently, many of them “jumping over a fence or strolling out the gate” reportedly while police officers and health workers watched on. When local reporters asked police and health workers why they had not stopped the patients from escaping, they said they “lacked adequate protective gear” to confront them. While the shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) to treat coronavirus patients in the region has been well documented, some of the people who left the center said they had bribed police to get out. According to the AP, at least 46 of the patients who fled had tested positive for Chinese coronavirus. The report identified some of the quarantine escapees as having recently entered Malawi from South Africa, which has the highest number of coronavirus cases on the continent with almost 125,000 infections. A source of regional economic power, many people from Malawi and Zimbabwe travel to South Africa seeking work. In Zimbabwe, law enforcement officers are “hunting down” over 100 people who escaped from quarantine centers, spokesman Paul Nyathi told the AP. The country requires a 21-day quarantine for people returning from abroad. “They escape and sneak into the villages … We are warning people to stop sheltering them. These escapees are becoming a serious danger to communities,” Nyathi said. Almost all of Zimbabwe’s 75 new coronavirus cases this week were traced to quarantine centers that detain, often involuntarily, hundreds of people returning from abroad. As in Malawi, many of the people returning to Zimbabwe had traveled to South Africa. Many also returned from neighboring Botswana, according to the report. This week, Zimbabwe Health Minister Obadiah Moyo told a special parliamentary committee that the mandatory quarantine centers have become “our source of danger,” according to the AP. Both Zimbabwe and Malawi have fewer than 200 documented cases of Chinese coronavirus, although the true numbers are likely higher due to deficient testing in the region.

Jihadis were more prolific during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan this year despite the Chinese coronavirus pandemic and the associated lockdowns, carrying out at least 242 attacks, about 30 percent more than the 187 last year, data compiled by Breitbart News reveals. Islamic terrorists carried out an average of about eight attacks per day this year, compared to an average of six daily assaults in 2019. Three weeks into Ramadan this year, it appeared the number of deaths and injuries would exceed those from the same period last year, but the attacks became less lethal towards the end. Breitbart News’ tally covers 30 days, starting from Ramadan’s first full day on April 24 through May 23. Edwin Mora/Breitbart News Jihadis killed at least 867 people and injured 813 others across 20 countries during the holy month this year.  On average, jihadis killed 29 people and maimed 27 others each day during Ramadan this year. Last year, however, the holy month was slightly bloodier, resulting in at least 911 fatalities (30 per day) and 1,006 injuries (34 per day). The 1,680 casualties this year represent a drop of over ten percent from the 1,917 last year. Jihadis have been responsible for nearly 10,000 casualties during the past five Ramadans combined: 2020 (867 killed; 813 wounded), 2019 (911 killed; 1,006 injured), 2018 (841 killed; 1,014 wounded), 2017 (1,639 killed; 1,704 wounded), and 2016 (421 killed; 729 wounded). Edwin Mora/Breitbart News The Afghan Taliban remains the deadliest (423 deaths; 379 injuries) group during Ramadan this year, again followed by the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) and its affiliates (228 killed; 258 wounded). However, ISIS was behind Ramadan’s bloodiest attack, killing 32 people and wounding 133 others during a funeral in Afghanistan on May 12. Primarily fueled by several ISIS attacks, May 12 became the bloodiest day (79 fatalities; 165 injuries) of the holy month. Although the ISIS-West Africa branch (ISWAP) allegedly broke away from the Nigeria-based Boko Haram group in 2016 over leadership issues, it has never been clear that ISWAP members were different individuals than those in the original Boko Haram. Analysts have often attributed the same attack to both groups, making it difficult to differentiate between the two. Breitbart News combined the deaths and injuries carried out by the two groups. This year, the Nigeria-based Fulani herdsmen jihadis, known to target Christian farmers, killed (61) and wounded (23) more people than al-Qaeda terrorists and their affiliates (55 fatalities; 15 injuries). On May 11, Fulani herdsmen killed 17 civilians, including a six-year-old who was hacked to death. The Fulani jihadis also wounded six others that day, including a three-year-old who was hot in the head. Some of the Ramadan jihadi culprits designated as “others” primarily include militants from the Iran-allied Shiite Houthis in Yemen and terrorist groups that operate in the Kashmir region claimed by India — namely Lashkar-e Tayyiba (LeT), Hizbul Mujahideen (HM), and Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM). Breitbart News was unable to determine the culprit for 26 attacks that killed 77 people and wounded 85 others (about 10 percent of all casualties), deeming the perpetrators “unknown.” Those included occurred in areas where terrorism is overwhelmingly the product of jihadist groups. Edwin Mora/Breitbart News The top five deadliest countries during Ramadan 2020 are Afghanistan (498 deaths; 563 injuries), Nigeria (100 deaths; 57 injuries), Syria (87 deaths; 26 injuries), Iraq (57 deaths; 68 injuries), and Niger (33 deaths; 12 injuries). Most of the casualties in Afghanistan appear to involve U.S.-backed security forces. It is often difficult to differentiate between civilian and security force victims, but the Afghan government estimated that the Taliban alone killed at least 146 civilians and maimed 430 others across 20 provinces during the holy month. Edwin Mora/Breitbart News The Afghan government and the Pentagon also noted that the Taliban increased attacks during the holy month, a time when jihadis urge their followers and supporters to embrace martyrdom. Despite losing its caliphate in Iraq and Syria, ISIS, which also stepped up attacks during the holy month, continues to wreak havoc in those two countries and beyond. Again this year, ISIS went on to target the food supply in Iraq during Ramadan, burning crops and even killing livestock. Even after the Taliban killed and maimed hundreds of Afghan civilians and security forces, Kabul agreed to a three-day ceasefire with the narco-jihadi group. The truce began on Sunday, the first full day of the Eid al-Fitr (“Festival of Breaking the Fast”) holiday that marked the end of Ramadan in many countries. Some jihadi groups, including the Taliban, targeted Muslims while they prayed inside mosques. The vast majority of Ramadan victims are Muslims, except for a handful in Western countries and several more in Nigeria. On May 21, a jihadi targeted a naval base in Texas, injuring a sailor before authorities took him out. This year, jihadis intensified the number of Ramadan attacks in Africa’s Sahel region. Breitbart News documented an estimated 15 kidnapping incidents as injuries this year. Despite the Ramadan attacks, violence is entirely dissonant with the holy month for most Muslims. Most of them follow the tradition of abstaining from eating, drinking, smoking, having sex, and other physical needs each day, starting from before the break of dawn until sunset during Ramadan. Breitbart News primarily gleans its tally from the Religion of Peace website and the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED). This report only includes incidents Breitbart News has corroborated online through news agencies, governments, and/or other entities that monitor jihadi activity. The overall number of attacks and the associated casualties could be higher because not all incidents are documented online, including some that take place in regions with no free press. It also omits attacks where the jihadi nature of the perpetrators is not explicit, including incidents where no group has taken responsibility in an area where terrorists of non-jihadist ideologies are also present. For the most part, the tally also excludes casualties suffered by jihadis. However, some of the documented incidents in Syria may inadvertently include deaths and injuries sustained by opposition groups with jihadi ties. Death and injury figures may change as some victims succumb to their wounds.

Jerusalem (AFP) — Start-up nation Israel, on its way out of coronavirus lockdown, is seeking to export lessons that have allowed it to emerge as one of the least-hit victims of the pandemic. Use of distance diagnostics, blood analysis, mobile phone tracking and tracing and mandatory wearing of face masks are among measures credited with giving the Jewish state an official COVID-19 death toll of around 280, equivalent to 31 per million inhabitants. That compares with around 310 deaths per million in the US, about 560 in Britain and 427 in France. In Israel, patients equipped with “oximeters” are contacted twice daily by medical teams who ask them to report their data. A decrease in blood oxygen levels shows a downturn in the condition of the patient who is brought swiftly to hospital. The quasi-governmental Jewish Agency, formed to encourage Jewish immigration to Israel, has formed a partnership with the country’s Weizmann Institute of Science and private health services provider Clalit Health Services, to try to export the Israeli model to Jewish communities abroad. “The basic idea is to try to explain to the Jewish community — which has been proportionally more affected than the average population in France, in the United States, mainly in New York — the experience of doctors and scientists in Israel,” Amos Hermon, a Jewish Agency executive, told AFP. “We think that Israel has taken the essential measures (to stem the crisis).” “In comparison with other countries, Israel has done very well… We therefore would like to share this knowledge, with other communities which have been very affected,” he added. Israeli officials, mindful of the Jewish festival of Shavuot which began on Thursday evening, have urged French Jews to delay opening their synagogues for the time being and urged setting up medical committees to monitor the health of their community, according to viewers of an online discussion between a Paris Jewish leader and Israeli officials. The Israelis recommended checking worshippers before they arrive at their synagogue, by using oximeters, enabling a quick and simple measuring of blood oxygen as a measure of health. “The basic idea is to have a doctor in daily contact with patients in order to assess the signs of deterioration in their state of health …. The oximeter is the tool,” notes Boaz Katz, from the Weizmann Institute. According to a study by Tel Aviv University, about 70 percent of people diagnosed with the virus in Israel have been infected with a strain from the United States, and 30 percent from Europe, mainly from France and Belgium.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey (D) requested on Thursday that “protesters” in the City of Lakes practice social distancing and wear masks to reduce coronavirus transmission. The municipal government claimed to provide hundreds of masks to the public for this purpose. Frey’s comments came during ongoing protests and riots in Minneapolis following the death of George Floyd, a man who died after a municipal police officer placed his knee on Floyd’s neck while handcuffed. The city government issued a statement on Thursday via its website with the mayor’s request. “The City encourages everyone to exercise caution to stay safe while participating in demonstrations, including wearing masks and physical distancing as much as possible to prevent the spread of COVID-19,” the statement reads. “The City has made hundreds of masks available to protesters this week.” Frey linked the unrest to slavery during remarks he made on Thursday: What we’ve seen over the last two days and the emotion-ridden conflict over last night is the result of so much built-up anger and sadness, anger and sadness that has been ingrained in our black community, not just because of five minutes of horror, but 400 years. If you’re feeling that sadness and that anger, it’s not only understandable, it’s right. It’s a reflection of the truth that our black community has lived. While not from lived experience, that sadness must also be understood by our non-black communities. To ignore it, to toss it out, would be to ignore the values we all claim to have. That are all the more important during a time of crisis. “This could be the marker,” added Frey. “This could be a point in time, when several years from now we can look back to know that we rose to right the wrongs of the past.

President Donald Trump on Thursday announced he is extending National Guard troops’ deployments in the fight against coronavirus until mid-August, which will allow them to qualify for certain benefits. “The men and women of the National Guard have been doing a great job fighting the CoronaVirus. This week, I will extend their Title 32 orders through mid-August, so they can continue to help States succeed in their response and recovery efforts,” Trump tweeted. The men and women of the National Guard have been doing a great job fighting the CoronaVirus.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 28, 2020  The National Guard troops’ federal deployments were scheduled to end on June 24, which for many would have been just shy of the 90 days of duty needed to qualify for early retirement and education benefits. Approximately 46,000 Air and Army National Guard troops are supporting the fight against the coronavirus that originated from China. The deployment is the largest use of the National Guard for a domestic operation since Hurricane Katrina, according to the National Guard. More than 51,000 Guard members responded to that natural disaster. However, whereas during Hurricane Katrina, the National Guard was deployed to one region, during the current fight, they are deployed in all 50 states, three territories, and the District of Columbia. “The National Guard is as busy as it’s been for a very long time, and I’m proud to say we are trained and we are ready,” said National Guard Bureau Chief Gen. Joseph Lengyel in a statement Thursday. “The men and women who put on this uniform expect to be called to duty and deployed around the world as part of the Army or Air Force. They expect to be called to duty for homeland emergencies, because that is a unique thing the National Guard does,” he said. National Guard members are assisting at food banks, meal deliveries, serving as medical staff, supporting medical equipment delivery, distributing personal protective equipment, supporting law enforcement, conducting traffic control, performing testing, cleaning facilities, and many other critical tasks all across the nation.

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) lifted the restrictions he placed on houses of worship in his state Thursday after two churches filed an emergency injunction pending appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. Within hours after two Romanian churches, represented by Liberty Counsel, filed the emergency injunction, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh ordered Pritzker to respond by 8:00 p.m. Thursday. With less than four hours before the deadline, the governor released “guidelines,” rather than mandates, for houses of worship that wish to resume church services following the coronavirus lockdowns. None of the suggestions are legally enforceable, explains Liberty Counsel. The guidelines state that the governor’s administration recognizes worship is central to the lives of many people as is “the spiritual and emotional value of prayer, community, and faith.” Pritzker’s guidelines still “strongly recommend” the continuation of “remote services, particularly for those who are vulnerable to COVID-19, including older adults and those with co-morbidities.” For those churches that wish to resume in-person worship, the guidelines suggest gathering outdoors in small groups, with less than ten people as the ideal choice. “Congregants who are living together sit together, at least six feet apart” from others,” the guidelines continue, adding the recommendations of face coverings and the avoidance of singing and “group recitation” of prayers. “Restrooms should be regularly sanitized and have sufficient soap and hand sanitizer,” state the guidelines. The governor’s office says high-risk behaviors to be avoided are those that involve person-to-person contact, such as greetings, hugs, handshakes, use of a common communion cup, and offering communion on the tongue. Liberty Counsel said it filed the emergency request to the Supreme Court due to a letter sent to churches on Saturday by the Chicago Department of Public Health: The city is threatening closure and “summary abatement.” In the threatening letter, Commissioner Allison Arwady, who declared the churches a “public nuisance” for holding services with more than 10 people, wrote: “I am authorized to seek to enjoin such nuisance or to cause the same to be summarily abated in such manner as I may direct….” The letter ended by stating that “the City will take steps necessary to abate, including Summary Abatement.” According to Pritzker’s “Illinois Restored” plan, it was not until Phase 5 of the plan, when “testing, tracing and treatment are widely available throughout the state,” and “either a vaccine is developed to prevent additional spread of COVID-19, a treatment option is readily available that ensures health care capacity is no longer a concern, or there are no new cases over a sustained period,” that gatherings, including religious services, of more than 50 people, would have been permitted. The River at Tampa Bay Church will hold an outdoor worship service on church property this Sunday, May 31, the day of Pentecost, beginning at 9:30 a.m. This will be the church’s first in-person worship service since @rhowardbrowne was wrongfully arrested. https://t.co/ecu5RYuqNW pic.twitter.com/hAXuqC54rJ — Liberty Counsel (@libertycounsel) May 28, 2020  “The unilateral actions of Gov. J.B. Pritzker is the classic example of tyranny,” said Liberty Counsel Chairman Mat Staver in a statement. “He knew he did not have authority to trample on the First Amendment rights of churches and houses of worship, but he did anyway and continued to do so until his case reached the U.S. Supreme Court.” Staver added that his organization wants “to make sure this tyranny and abuse never happens again.” Warning that Pritzker could easily reinstate his mandates, Liberty Counsel plans to file a reply to the Supreme Court, arguing that Pritzker’s “unconstitutional orders are capable of repetition yet evading review.” In a statement about the newly released guidelines for worship in Illinois, Kelly Shackelford, president and chief counsel at First Liberty Institute, said, “The massive religious discrimination and criminal threats against churches is over in Illinois.” “This was a disgraceful part of our history during the pandemic,” he continued. “We are grateful to President Trump for his leadership in urging Governors across America to restore religious liberty and allow Americans to return to their places of worship.”

Senators Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) are looking to end China’s pipeline of foreign students to fill spots at American universities and take American STEM jobs. In the wake of the Chinese coronavirus crisis, Cotton and Blackburn — as well as Rep. David Kustoff (R-TN) in the House — have filed legislation called the SECURE CAMPUS Act that ends the China-to-United States pipeline of Chinese nationals receiving student visas for STEM fields. “The Chinese Communist Party has long used American universities to conduct espionage on the United States,” Cotton said in a statement. “What’s worse is that their efforts exploit gaps in current law. It’s time for that to end.” In short, Cotton and Blackburn’s plan would: In 2019, nearly 117,000 Chinese nationals secured F visas to arrive in the U.S. as students — the most of any country in the world. https://t.co/A7ZfeKacsP — John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) April 28, 2020  Blackburn said in a statement: Beijing exploits student and research visas to steal science, technology, engineering, and manufacturing secrets from U.S. academic and research institutions. We’ve fed China’s innovation drought with American ingenuity and taxpayer dollars for too long; it’s time to secure the U.S. research enterprise against [China’s] economic espionage. As Breitbart News has chronicled, the U.S. legal immigration system remains hugely beneficial to China. From 2008 to 2018, more than 825,000 Chinese nationals arrived in the U.S. on green cards — an immigration status that provides them with permanent residency, a pathway to American citizenship, and eventually the ability to bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the country through the process known as “chain migration.” There are nearly 500,000 Chinese students in the U.S. in any given year — more than any other country — taking seats in university classrooms and looking to eventually obtain Optional Practical Training (OPT) visas to take entry-level jobs in white-collar professions. In Fiscal Year 2019, alone, Chinese nationals secured about 170,000 F, J, and M visas to arrive in the U.S. as students — more than any other country in the world.

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a federal lawsuit Wednesday challenging a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rule that requires women to have an in-person clinic visit in order to obtain drugs to induce an abortion. The ACLU filed the lawsuit in Maryland on behalf of the leftwing American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective, which claim the FDA rule that requires women to first have an in-person visit with the abortion provider is a “burdensome barrier.” The FDA regulates 20,000+ drugs. But it uniquely restricts one abortion-inducing drug – and it won’t lift those restrictions in a pandemic. So the ACLU is suing. My @vicenews latest:👇 https://t.co/uhxfhPrFBM — Carter Sherman (@carter_sherman) May 27, 2020  According to the organization, their complaint states, “Of the more than 20,000 drugs regulated by the FDA, mifepristone is the only one that patients must receive in person at a hospital, clinic, or medical office, yet may self-administer, unsupervised, at a location of their choosing.” ACOG says the FDA rules have “no medical basis” and “unnecessarily restrict access to care.” FDA’s medically unnecessary restrictions on mifepristone threatens to harm patients & their clinicians during a national crisis. It undermines the health care community's efforts to identify safe, effective ways to provide patients with the care they need. https://t.co/utC37UorOx pic.twitter.com/baQ1sRdkCE — ACOG Action (@ACOGAction) May 27, 2020  The organization adds the rules are “especially harmful” during the coronavirus pandemic because “forcing physicians to dispense this drug in person puts patients at increased risk of COVID-19.” Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers, however, have refused to stop providing elective surgical abortions in their clinics, claiming these are “essential” services, even as scarce personal protective equipment (PPE) has been needed by healthcare workers directly providing care to patients with the infection caused by the Chinese virus. “Like any lawyers, the ACLU pushes for their clients’ financial interests in a lawsuit designed to force the FDA to help abortion vendors make a quick buck,” Students for Life of America President Kristan Hawkins said in a statement sent to Breitbart News. “The FDA must hold the line on the health and safety standards in place that are meant to help women survive taking chemical abortion pills,” she added. “Using this COVID-19 crisis to force the sales of life-ending drugs in ways that risk women’s lives should embarrass the abortion industry. But perhaps that is asking too much of people who end life for a living.” In addition to claiming elective surgical abortions are “essential” for women’s health, industry giant Planned Parenthood announced during the pandemic its new tele-abortion service is now available in all 50 states. Acting CEO of Planned Parenthood Alexis McGill Johnson called her new tele-abortion service the “silver lining” of the coronavirus crisis. Planned Parenthood has been touting an increase in at-home abortions since its tele-abortion services began nationwide, though many physicians and pro-life advocates express concerns about the practice. Specifically, women are obtaining mifepristone illegally from other countries since it is not approved under the FDA Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). In early May, national pro-life leaders sent a letter to FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn, urging him to take action to block the illegal Internet sale of abortion-inducing drugs that are produced overseas and then shipped to the United States. In a press release, the leaders observed that, under REMS, the drug “cannot legally be sold in pharmacies or online due to the risk of serious complications.” However, websites such as AidAccess and Rablon sell and distribute the drugs regularly. “This is a medication that definitely has dangers associated with it,” Dr. Christina Francis, an Indiana-based OB/GYN and chairman of the board of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists (AAPLOG), told EWTN Pro-Life Weekly recently. Francis said some immediate complications of mifepristone could be “hemorrhage, the immediate possibility of infection, and the possibility of failure, where the pregnancy doesn’t fully pass from the medication and then leading to sometimes the requirement for emergent surgery for that woman because of either ongoing bleeding or the risk of infection.” Francis added that because of the uncertainties associated with the pandemic, many women “are being influenced by fear right now, and this is being perpetuated by the abortion industry.” One Planned Parenthood official in New York state touted that the organization’s new tele-abortion service is so much in demand that one mother began her drug-induced abortion “at home with her children running around behind her.” Dr. Meera Shah, chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood Hudson Peconic, told the Associated Press (AP), “We provided a medication abortion to an EMT while she was sitting in her ambulance. We provided abortion care to a mother who was at home with her children running around behind her.” Former abortionist Dr. Anthony Levatino explained in his videos about various abortion procedures that mifepristone blocks the action of progesterone, which the mother’s body produces to nourish the pregnancy. When progesterone is blocked, the lining of the mother’s uterus deteriorates, and blood and nourishment are cut off to the developing baby, who then dies inside the mother’s womb. The drug misoprostol (also called Cytotec) then causes contractions and bleeding to expel the baby from the mother’s uterus. Family Research Council President Tony Perkins wrote that, as a result of Planned Parenthood’s tele-abortion service, more women will have at-home “chemically-induced procedures that carry significant risks”: They tell women that it’ll be simple, natural, safe, and private process. They’ll recover in a day, maybe two. What they don’t tell them is that they might deliver a tiny, perfectly-formed child. Or that they’ll experience labor pains, heavy bleeding, vomiting, or lose consciousness. They don’t talk about the depression, anger, anxiety, panic attacks, and substance abuse that follow. Or the weeks to months of recovery time, usually managed alone. “This is Planned Parenthood’s ‘silver lining,’” Perkins said. “Babies who don’t have a chance at life, women who are haunted and harmed.”

Automated mailing of ballots to all persons on inaccurate voter rolls “is the definition of voter fraud,” said House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA), critiquing Democrat proposals to standardize mail-in voting during a Thursday interview on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow. Marlow noted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) calls to change voting laws under the pretense of public health during the coronavirus outbreak, including proxy voting for members of Congress related to legislation, as well as ballot harvesting and vote-by-mail measures for elections. “I want to connect some dots here, because Pelosi does not want the House to come back and be able to vote. She wants to have these proxy votes. I think this is all setting up the vote-by-mail narrative, or as we call it, ‘cheat-by-mail.'” Democrats want ballots sent to everyone without consideration of their legibility to vote, stated Marlow. “Democrats are going to use it to win this election and maybe future elections,” he added. Economic reopenings of cities and states following coronavirus-related lockdowns make it difficult for Pelosi to justify her advocacy for congressional proxy voting and various forms of remote voting in elections, assessed Marlow. “You’re seeing some Democrats in Washington that are trying to take advantage of a crisis,” Scalise replied. “We’ve heard that before. We’ve seen their playbook, and they’re trying to do it here.” LISTEN:
 Various Democrats, left-wing news media figures, and celebrities are calling for increased remote voting options — including vote-by-mail and ballot harvesting measures — as a public health endeavor to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Democrats’ voting reform proposals “literally would be federalizing elections,” determined Scalise, highlighting opposition to voter ID laws as a push to undermine election integrity. Marlow and Scalise differentiated between absentee voting and standardized mail-in voting. “We all want to be fighting for the right for every single American who’s legally allowed to vote to be able to vote once [per election],” Scalise stated. “Everybody ought to have that legal right, and I’ll fight for that for anybody.” Scalise continued, “If somebody who’s illegally registered to vote is casting a vote, that means they’re stealing your vote. They’re stealing the vote of people who are legally registered.” Scalise warned, “To say we’re going to automatically mail ballots to people who we know are on the rolls fraudulently, that is the definition of voter fraud, and it’s taking away the rights of law-abiding citizens, and it shouldn’t be allowed to go forward.” Scalise concluded, “States like California shouldn’t be the model for how to vote, when you saw — three weeks after election day two years ago — the person who won on election night is not the person being sworn in in Congress, because they were counting votes three and a half weeks after an election until they got the result they wanted. That happens in third world nations, but it shouldn’t be happening here in America.” Breitbart News Daily broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.

Seven-year-old Curtis Rogers, of Raleigh, North Carolina, created a social distance-style prom for his babysitter on Tuesday. Curtis knew his nanny, Rachel Chapman, would have to miss her senior prom due to the ongoing battle against the novel coronavirus pandemic. He decided that simply would not do and took matters into his own hands. “He planned a socially distant prom, complete with dancing & her favorite foods,” Rachel’s mother, Becky, tweeted on May 26. “I planned it out because Rachel probably wanted to see me a lot,” Curtis told ABC11. “She is also one of the best people I’ve known.” My daughter has been a nanny for this amazing kid for over a year. When he realized she wouldn’t have a senior prom, he wanted to throw her one.

At the time of this writing, it has over 36,500 likes and more than 4,400 shares. The aforementioned photos feature Rachel and Curtis sitting on opposite ends of a long table, with a pool noodle for measuring distance. Another shows the two standing six feet apart in suit and gown. “He was really excited for it to start and make sure he was ready to impress her,” Curtis’s mom, Elissa, said. “Rachel is one of our favorite people and she also helps around the house a lot,” she added. “So, Rachel’s like the best nanny ever.” Ms. Chapman echoed the sentiment: “He had all my favorite foods and everything,” she said. “I could tell he put a lot of thought into it.” And while apples, peanut butter, and Chick-fil-A may not be a traditional prom dinner, it was perfect for Curtis’s favorite person. Even so, the day was bittersweet. “I was kind of like, bummed putting my dress on because I was sad; I don’t get to wear it to my senior prom,” she said. “After leaving it and having that time with him because it was the first time I had seen him in two months, it was like, really fun, and I’m really glad that he did that.”

Thirty-eight House Republicans have joined nine Republican Senators in lobbying the White House to continue importing foreign workers to the United States even as more than 36 million Americans are jobless. In a letter to Trump, Republican lawmakers including Rep. Roger Marshall (R-KS) — running against Kris Kobach for Kansas’s open Senate seat — and New York Representitives Elise Stefanik and Peter King ask that businesses continue to be allowed to import blue-collar foreign workers through the H-2B visa program amid mass unemployment. Every year, U.S. companies are allowed to import 66,000 low-skilled H-2B foreign workers to take blue-collar, non-agricultural jobs. For some time, the H-2B visa program has been used by businesses to bring in cheaper, foreign workers and has contributed to blue-collar Americans having their wages undercut. The Republican lawmakers claim that even though a record number of Americans in many states are jobless, businesses are still suffering from labor shortages — a claim that is made year-round by the cheap labor lobby. The Republican lawmakers who signed the letter include: The Republicans write: On behalf of the thousands of small and seasonal businesses in our Districts that are struggling in this unprecedented and uncertain economic climate, we respectfully urge you to refrain from imposing any further restriction on the H-2B nonimmigrant seasonal guest worker program as part of any forthcoming executive action relating to immigration and/or economic recovery. The letter continues: This is evident as, despite active recruitment by seasonal employers, very few US workers are seeking and accepting seasonal temporary jobs. Therefore, it is important that the H-2B program continue to be available to our seasonal employers as a failsafe in the event that we see a rapid drop in unemployment and a return to the extremely tight labor markets of just a few months ago. Such flexibility to meet business needs is critical to rapid, solid and fulsome economic recovery. [Emphasis added] … As such, we urge you to maintain the continued, uninterrupted operation of the H-2B program with the continued requirement that all employers only have access to it based upon their proven and certified need within the statutory cap. [Emphasis added] The full letter can be read here: GOPs Ask for H-2B Visa Prog… by John Binder on Scribd  Likewise, this week, nine Republican Senators sent a letter to Trump asking the administration to allow businesses to import more foreign workers. Specifically, the Senators said businesses must be able to exempt themselves from some existing labor regulations so long as they claim they cannot find qualified Americans to do the work. The Republican Senators who signed the letter include: Today, federal employment data reveal that there is no labor shortage of working- and middle-class Americans who want a job. There are currently more than 36 million Americans out of work, spurred by the Chinese coronavirus crisis. The H-2B visa program has been widely used by businesses to drag down the wages of American workers in landscaping, conservation work, the meatpacking industry, the construction industry, and fishing jobs, a 2019 study from the Center for Immigration Studies finds. When comparing the wages of H-2B foreign workers to the national wage average for each blue-collar industry, about 21 out of 25 of the industries offered lower wages to foreign workers than Americans. In the construction industry, wage suppression is significant, with H-2B foreign workers being offered more than 20 percent less than their American counterparts. In the fishing industry, foreign workers were offered more than 30 percent less for their jobs than Americans in the field. In the meatpacking industry, foreign workers got 23 percent less pay than Americans. Every year, the U.S. admits about 1.2 million legal immigrants on green cards to permanently resettle in the country. In addition, another 1.4 million foreign workers are admitted every year to take American jobs John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter at @JxhnBinder. 

Texas had seen a steady decline in the seven-day average of new Chinese coronavirus cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and test positivity rates as of Thursday afternoon, a couple of weeks after a spike in new daily cases reached its peak, marking the highest single-day figure, and the state set a new record for deaths. The drop in the seven-day average came after Gov. Greg Abbott (R) allowed the state’s stay-at-home order to expire on April 30, and non-essential businesses began a phased reopening the following day. To justify decisions to allow non-essential businesses to reopen, U.S. state officials have been looking at the seven-day average of cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and test positivity rates to account for daily swings in the raw figures. Most of the United States, including Texas, issued statewide lockdown measures, commonly known as stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders, to stem the spread of the highly contagious and deadly COVID-19 disease produced by the coronavirus. Soon after Gov. Abbott lifted Texas’s stay-at-home order, the state experienced an increase in the sheer number of new cases and deaths reported each day. On May 14, Texas recorded its second-deadliest day (51) since the first COVID-19 fatality in the state on March 16, data from the state’s health department showed. The following day, Texas documented the highest single-day tally of new cases (1,818) since it recorded its first case on March 4. In the weeks that followed, however, the seven-day average of new cases and deaths has been steadily going down, the state data revealed, echoing assessments by mainstream media outlets. The seven-day average number of hospitalizations and test positivity rates have also seen a steady, but modest decrease. Analysts consider the number of hospitalizations to be an essential measure of the severity of the ongoing outbreak. According to data from the Texas Department of Health, about 70 percent of Texas’s hospital beds were occupied as of Thursday afternoon, with 15,315 regular and 1,592 intensive care unit (ICU) beds still available. Currently, there are 1,692 lab-confirmed COVID-19 patients at Texas hospitals, occupying only about three percent of the available beds. The national average of coronavirus cases per one million U.S. residents, at 5,323, is more than double the 2,045 per one million in Texas, according to Worldometer. Furthermore, the 55 deaths per one million Texans are about six times lower than the national average of 312 per one million. The raw number of new daily cases in Texas has seen a substantial increase in the last few days, more than doubling from 440 on May 25 to 1,361 yesterday, state data showed. That change could push the seven-day average number of new cases up going forward if the amount reported daily keeps increasing. However, the sheer number of new daily deaths has remained relatively low in recent days. Meanwhile, the raw number of hospitalizations reported each day had also seen a modest decline. Gov. Abbott’s office has attributed the rise in new daily cases to a substantial increase in the states’ testing capabilities, as shown by data compiled by the Texas Tribune. More tests have allowed the state to detect more cases. “Gov. Greg Abbott is looking at two specific metrics to justify his decision to restart the Texas economy — the positive test rate and hospitalization levels,” the Texas Tribune noted. As of Thursday afternoon, about seven percent (57,921) of the total 855,674 tests administered by health officials in Texas had come out positive, marking a decrease from the estimated eight percent two weeks ago, on May 13, the COVID Tracking Project revealed. According to the White House reopening guidelines, a state can reopen if it reports a downward trajectory of the positive test rate over 14 days, even if the daily case count is on the rise. Texas has seen a gradual decline in the percentage of tests coming back positive. More people continue to test negative than positive. The cumulative number of cases and deaths continue to increase in the Lone Star state. As of Thursday afternoon, over 57,900 people in Texas had tested positive for COVID-19, and over 1,500 had succumbed to it.

Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Mike Lee (R-UT) spoke at a webinar hosted by the Heritage Foundation on Wednesday about what Congress’s next move should be in a post-coronavirus America. Both said any future legislation should be about recovery in the form of tax cuts and regulatory easing to help small businesses get back to work. Small businesses in America account for 99.9 percent of businesses in the United States, with 500 or less employees, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Cruz said he refers to the more than $2 trillion dollars the feds have doled out to help Americans and small businesses survive in the wake of the virus not as stimulus funding but as relief funding. “They were designed to provide emergency relief — short term emergency, short-term emergency bridge loans for individuals and families and small businesses to help them get through the immediate crisis they were facing,” Cruz said.  Cruz said the amount of money Congress has spent “takes your breath away,” and he disagrees with Democrats who want to hand out more money. “Where we are now, I believe the next legislation should be recovery legislation,” Cruz said. “It should be focused not on relief, not on spending more money and just shoveling more money at the problem,” Cruz said. “You can’t fix it that way.” He went on: Instead, the next stage should be focused on tax reform and regulatory reform. In other words, lessening the burden on small businesses and job creators. The only way out of this mess, economically speaking, is to get people back to work, which means we need to be looking at policies that help the small businesses that are just starting to open up their doors again; that are just starting to see customers again. We’ve got to unleash the engine of the American free enterprise system —the only thing strong enough to overcome this economic catastrophe. Cruz said examining regulations is a good starting point: One place to start is every regulation, state regulations, local regulations, that have been suspended because of the crisis, to deal with the crisis, I think we should all start with the presumption that those regulations should stay suspended going forward. That’s if it was deemed helpful for that regulation to be suspended during the time of crisis then it should still be helpful during recovery. I really think that’s what our focus needs to be is how do we empower small businesses to drive free enterprise forward and turn our economy around and get people back to work. Lee agreed with Cruz and added the value of limited government at a time like this. “One of the many things he said that is right and appropriate for our time is that we’re not going to fix our economy with more government spending,” Lee said. “We’re not going to fix our economy with more government programs.” “What we need is to get government out of the way so that Americans can start helping each other again,” Lee said. Both lawmakers are working on legislation to address these concerns, including the Right to Test Act to give states authority to approve and distribute tests during a national health emergency and the Prime Act to gives states more authority in regulating meat processing plants instead of federal control, which during the coronavirus has led to bottlenecks in the food supply chain. About this Lee said: We have to remember that the federal government was never intended to be this all-encompassing regulatory body that would regulate even purely local activities like labor, mining, manufacturing, and agriculture. It certainly wasn’t meant to be the comprehensive exclusive regulator of things like meat packing, and yet it is the federal commandeering of the meat packing licensing and regulatory business in this nation that has resulted in bottle neck. The Mercatus Center at George Mason University agrees with Cruz and Lee and wrote a proposal about some of the regulations that were lifted and should remain so, including the FDA approval process, Transportation Security Administration’s limits on hand sanitizers, tariffs on medical equipment imports, restrictions on telemedicine practices, restrictions on scope of practice for nurse practitioners, and state certificate-of-need laws, or certificate-of-need (CON) laws that require healthcare providers to first obtain permission before they can open or expand their facilities.  The proposal read, in part, “This list is not comprehensive; more suspended rules at the local, state, and federal levels are coming to our attention on a daily basis.This is not surprising, simply because so many rules have accumulated over the past 50 years. This regulatory accumulation has been well documented by the RegData Project, which, among other variables, measures the number of regulatory restrictions contained in US federal regulation. According to the project’s most recent dataset (RegData 3.2), the volume of federal regulations has increased by more than 150 percent in the past 50 years. In 1970, there were about 400,000 regulatory restrictions on the books. Today, there are more than 1,000,000 regulatory restrictions in effect.” Follow Penny Starr on Twitter
