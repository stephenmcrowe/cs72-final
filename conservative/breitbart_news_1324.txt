Reebok, an apparel brand owned by Adidas, ended its business partnership with CrossFit following the fitness company’s CEO mocking a declaration of “racism” as “a public health issue.” The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, an organization located at the University of Washington and funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, tweeted on Saturday that “racism is a public health issue.” Greg Glassman, CrossFit’s CEO, responded via Twitter, “It’s FLOYD-19.” It's FLOYD-19. — Greg Glassman (@CrossFitCEO) June 6, 2020  After Glassman’s tweet, Business Insider sought a response from Reebok. Business Insider described the tweet as “controversial,” “tone-deaf,” “racist,” and “insensitive.” Business Insider obtained a response from Reebok via a statement: “Recently, we have been in discussions regarding a new agreement, however, in light of recent events, we have made the decision to end our partnership with CrossFit HQ. We will fulfill our remaining contractual obligations in 2020. We owe this to the CrossFit Games competitors, fans and the community.” Reebok aligned itself with the Black Lives Matter campaign. Its website currently has an animated banner with the following message: Without the Black community, Reebok would not exist. America would not exist. We are not asking you to buy our shoes. We are asking you to walk in someone else’s. To Stand in solidarity. To find our common ground of HUMANITY. In May of 2019, CrossFit criticized Facebook’s arbitrary censorship practices. The company declared it would “no longer support or use Facebook’s services until further notice.” The company also stopped using Facebook-owned Instagram and WhatsApp platforms. CrossFit is an exercise and fitness brand that licenses its trademark to partnered gyms. The company’s business model also sells training certifications and sponsors the CrossFit Games, an annual athletic fitness competition. It was estimated to have a $4 billion valuation by Forbes in 2017. Follow Robert Kraychik on Twitter @rkraychik.

An activist at the Black Lives Matter protest in London on June 7th was filmed and pictured attempted to set fire to the flags which adorn the Cenotaph, the United Kingdom’s national war memorial. The Cenotaph — “empty tomb” — was dedicated the memory of “The Glorious Dead” in the wake of the First World War, and is the focus of ceremonies honouring the fallen from throughout the British Isles and the former British Empire, of all colours, at several points during the year, Its vandalisation with “BLM” graffiti on June 6th — the anniversary of the D-Day landings — while many veterans remained unable to attend memorial ceremonies due the coronavirus lockdown, caused considerable public upset, and this escalation of the efforts to desecrate it are likely to inflame feeling still further.

Mea culpa: I spent a lot of time on these here digital pages defending Dr. Anthony Fauci. Brother, was I wrong. Fauci is a stone-cold liar. And if he’s not a stone-cold liar, his only defense is that he is a fraud. Either way, shame on him … and me. For months Fauci has been everywhere, all over TV, urging Americans to lock themselves down, to abandon their jobs, their sick and dying family members, the small businesses they spent their lives getting off the ground; he urged us to drive our economy into the dirt, pull children who desperately need structure out of school, forgo once-in-a-lifetime graduations and graduation parties, cancel weddings and vacations… Fauci’s message was clear, militant, terrifying, and relentless: If you don’t do these things, if you don’t sacrifice these things, if you don’t give up your liberty and prosperity, you are no better than a serial killer. The coronavirus is a unique and deadly killer, a particularly infectious and fatal disease unlike anything we’ve seen in more than a century. And because Fauci became America’s trusted scientific (and moral) authority, because he assured us he spoke only as a scientist and infectious disease expert, because he assured us he would always tell us like it is, and do so at any cost because public health was his only priority, look at what happened… A woman was arrested for reopening the business that fed her family. Christians were persecuted for attending church in the safety of automobiles. Teens were held up to national ridicule for behaving like teens in Florida and the Ozarks. Countless Americans suffered untold anguish after hospital visits were forbidden and funerals canceled. Everyday Americans were relentlessly demonized for daring to speak out or even question the Holy Writ of Fauci… And God help those who came out to protest the lockdowns, because bitter, power-hungry tyrants such as Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI) and the hate-filled media that empower her, waved the Holy Writ of Fauci to justify smearing these Americans as racists and punishing them with lockdown extensions. Heh, heh, heh… Take that, Deplorables! All this was allowed, all the inhumanity, all the flagrant violations of our Constitutional rights, all these Kafka-esque rules that protected Big Businesses like Walmart and further empowered massive corporations like Amazon, while small business withered and died. Democrat New York Mayor Bill de Blasio was finally allowed to openly practice his antisemitism… All this was excused and even made virtuous by the Holy Writ of Fauci and the Cult of Personality he allowed to build up around his heroic fidelity to facts, science, and public health. Well, we now know Fauci is either a fraud or liar. We know this because for ten whole days Fauci said nothing as the Perfect Infection Storm hit America, as massive violations of social distancing and lockdowns took place all across the country (including the Ground Zero of new York City). There it was, everywhere… Fauci’s nightmare scenario come to vivid life: crowd after massive gathering after mob after parade… Protesters and rioters shouting, shoulder to shoulder — and Fauci said nothing… And when he did finally speak out, it was to squeak on some local radio station. Worse still, Fauci said nothing as the very same sanctimonious health care workers and “experts” who used the emotional blackmail of “We’re at work for you, stay home for us” came out in full-throated support of leaving home and gathering in massive crowds. So, which is it… Is Fauci a fraud or liar? Was all his talk about concern for public health, his duty to tell it like it is no matter the personal or political fallout, just a big lie? Is he a fraud who still believes these mass gatherings are a nightmare scenario, but is unwilling to use his massive public platform to say so out loud because shaming protesters who hold the “approved” views among America’s hideous elite would risk Fauci feeling the disapproval of those elites? Or is he a liar, does he in fact know the coronavirus is nowhere near as deadly as he played it up to be? Is he a liar who mislead us into agreeing to destroy our amazing economy in order to undermine the Bad Orange Man’s re-election? Either way, Fauci’s a sociopath. Either he’s a sociopath who furthered his political ambitions and abused his authority and public trust to talk hundreds of millions of Americans into shattering their own lives and mental wellbeing when there was no real danger, or he’s a sociopath who chooses the good opinion of elites over raising the alarm to save the lives of thousands and thousands of protesters, and the countless millions those thousands will infect. What kind of man raises the alarm about the fact the black population is disproportionately killed by this virus and then remains silent as the black population gathers en masse, and remains silent as his fellow healthcare workers openly encourage the mass gathering of black America? I’m almost as disgusted with myself for trusting Fauci as I am with him. Never again will I trust the “experts.” Fuck them. Fuck them all forever. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

The statue of wartime prime minister Sir Winston Churchill in Parliament Square has been vandalised again, with fresh graffiti branding him a “racist”. Footage shot earlier in the day shows a small band of patriots ringing the statue to protect it, surrounded by a small but growing mob baying “Churchill was a racist!” at them while police officers milled around nearby. They must have been forced to abandon their efforts at some point, however, with video published near the time of this article’s publication showing the statue festooned with protest placards, the name ‘CHURCHILL’ scored out in black spray-paint, and the words ‘Was a Racist’ scrawled underneath it. Sunday’s vandalisation is somewhat ironic, as on Saturday — when the Churchill statue was also vandalised, along with the statue of Abraham Lincoln and the Cenotaph — far-leftists were using the D-Day anniversary as an opportunity to claim Churchill and the Allied forces who stormed the shores of Normandy as “the original antifa”. Vandalising Churchill monuments in London is unlikely to be the way your political cause makes progress in #Britain. pic.twitter.com/2Cl78THtlX — Kyle Orton (@KyleWOrton) June 7, 2020  “These revolting people have Churchill to thank for being in a free country able to protest,” remarked Brexit Party chairman and entrepreneur Richard Tice on the anti-Churchill demonstrators. “Where are [Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Home Secretary Priti Patel, and Mayor Sadiq Khan] in condemning these thugs,” he demanded. Prime Minister Johnson has yet to make any remark on the violence at the ongoing Black Lives Matter protests, which saw a number of police officers injured outside his official Downing Street residence off Whitehall on Saturday, despite the fact that they fly in the face of the anti-coronavirus measures he has imposed on the wider country for months now. “Do we have a leader?” asked Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage in response to the silence. “[Boris Johnson] is supposed to be a Churchill fan, but he says and does nothing,” he observed. “He is not half the man.” These revolting people have Churchill to thank for being in a free country able to protest.

Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” former Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said transmission of coronavirus is likely to have occurred at the nationwide protests over the killing of George Floyd. Partial transcript as follows: BRENNAN: Dr. Fauci said in an interview on Friday said that these protests are a perfect setup for the spread of the virus. So even though these protesters are young and wearing masks, you believe this will ignite more of an outbreak? GOTTLIEB: Well, look, we’re certainly going to see transmission coming out of these gatherings. There’s no question about that. The prevalence in the United States of infection right now is about one in two hundred people so you can estimate how many people probably have the infection in these gatherings. I think the- the- the idea of reducing the risk from these protests is a shared responsibility. There’s steps that the protesters can take and you see many of them wearing masks in these protests and understanding the risks. There’s also things authorities can do, I think, to reduce the risks in terms of how they de-escalate these situations. The best science we have on this question comes from a recent study that came out of Germany, where there are large gatherings in Germany in a small region there, and they looked at what the spread was coming out those gatherings. Now, mind you, these were festive gatherings, but there were large outdoor gatherings nonetheless. And the science showed that there was about a two and a half times increase in the rate of transmission as a result of bringing people together in large gatherings. So we have some scientific basis to understand that these- these kinds of settings do create risk. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

White House trade advisor Peter Navarro said on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures” that he would like to see protest signs that say “China lied American died,” of coronavirus. He also acknowledged on Sunday that looters and rioters were “bad hombres” and “a pack of animals.” Navarro said, “Let’s be clear what the Chinese Communist Party is doing right now behind this crisis that they forced on the world, they’re sinking ships in the South China Sea, invading India, trying to steal our vaccines. I know I will be criticized for what I’m about to say. I would like to see one sign out there that says China lied, Americans died. The bigger context here as we struggle to get back to full economic strength is that China has a plan to take us over and take the world over. That’s not hyperbole. All you need to do is look at what they’re doing, what the reaction is. Let’s remember what they did. They spawned that virus. They hid the virus. They sent it on airplanes around the world, to seed America and the rest of the world. Now we’ve got 100,000 Americans dead, and we’ve got 40 million Americans on the unemployment line, trillions of dollars of economic wealth destroyed.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

The Lancet — one of the world’s oldest, best known, and most respected medical journals — has formally retracted a paper which claimed that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is ineffective and potentially dangerous in the treatment of Chinese coronavirus. The paper — ‘Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without a macrolide for treatment of COVID-19: a multinational registry analysis’ — received widespread publicity across the mainstream media because it was the biggest and most damning study about HCQ. Supposedly based on the records of 96,032 patients in 671 hospitals, the study claimed that coronavirus patients who took HCQ were more likely to die than those who took nothing. It was so damning that the World Health Organization (WHO) immediately halted all its trials of HCQ. France banned its use altogether in treatments for Covid-19. But arguably the main reason the study got so much publicity was because HCQ has been championed by President Donald Trump. Trump has admitted to taking HCQ himself as a prophylactic against the Chinese coronavirus. So here was a perfect opportunity for his many critics in the mainstream media to make him look ignorant and foolish. This story by the BBC was fairly typical, headlined ‘Trump drug hydroxychloroquine raises death risk in Covid patients, study says’. It began: The drug U.S. President Donald Trump said he was taking to ward off Covid-19 actually increases the risk of patients with the disease dying from it, a study in the Lancet has found. In other words, the MSM was in no doubt where the real significance of the Lancet study lay: it represented a humiliation for Trump. Trump’s ideological enemies were quite unable to hide their glee. Senator Ed Markey (D-Mass.) tweeted that “the science is clear and the president, as usual is dangerously wrong”. The science is clear and the president, as usual, is dangerously wrong. https://t.co/kUfJ1b6YnB — Ed Markey (@EdMarkey) May 22, 2020  This antipathy towards Trump was very much shared by the Lancet, which, for 25 years, has been edited by a hard-left activist Richard Horton. As Rebecca Weisser notes in a piece for Spectator Australia, Horton has a long track record of championing fashionable leftist causes: Horton’s causes célèbres include publishing an inflated Iraq War death toll, a letter on Gaza from pro-Hamas doctors and calling for physicians to join Extinction Rebellion. Horton and the Lancet are also, it goes almost without saying, fanatical proponents of the man-made global warming narrative. Last month, the Lancet published an editorial urging Americans to “put a president in the White House…who will understand that public health should not be guided by partisan politics.” This month, however, it has been exposed as having engaged in what look very much like “partisan politics” itself. The way the Lancet has suddenly taken a paper of “such consequence” only to discard it “like a used tissue” has been described as ‘one of the most consequential retractions in modern history’. Oddly it was the left-wing Guardian that blew the whistle. A writer for its Australian edition, Melissa Davey, rang round Australian hospitals and found that the real Australian data did not tally with the claims made in the study. This raised serious questions about the credibility of Surgisphere, the hitherto unknown analytics company which had produced the study. As the Guardian reported: Why was a once-respected medical journal prepared to run a study from so dubious a source having apparently submitted it to so little scrutiny? As Toby Young, among others, argues at Lockdown Sceptics, the decision appears as if it had more to do with political activism than with disinterested science. The question is, why did the “independent” fact-checkers fail to spot this bit of fake news when they’ve been so quick to jump on anything purporting to show HCQ is effective? Could it be that they’re not actually independent at all, but Establishment lackeys determined to discredit anything that suggests COVID-19 isn’t the deadly pathogen it’s made out to be by governments around the world, particularly if it emanates from the White House? With suspiciously convenient timing, within 24 hours of the Lancet retraction, yet another study — from the University of Oxford, part of the so-called Recovery Trial — allegedly debunking hydroxychloroquine was publicised in the mainstream media. In the Telegraph, the story was reported under the headline ‘Researchers halt trial into hydroxychloroquine after they found it was “useless” against coronavirus’. Immediately underneath, an anti-Trump standfirst: ‘This could be the end of the road for a drug touted as a ‘game-changer’ by U.S. president Donald Trump’. Well it could. Except, almost immediately, doubts were being raised about the reliability of this trial too, especially with regard to the dosage of HCQ used. I found the study. Looks like the study's #HCQ doses were also very high, typical for anti-HCQ studies designed and conducted to reach their predetermined biased conclusions. No surprise, the Gates Foundation helped fund the study… https://t.co/mH1cxX0lTz — TBT (@TbTtruthbetold) June 5, 2020  Of course it’s quite possible that the many doctors (such as France’s Didier Raoult) who claim to have used HCQ successfully as a treatment for Covid-19 — often in conjunction with zinc — may yet be confounded by a definitive study. But it’s equally possible that Trump — and those doctors — may yet be vindicated.

A 44-year-old Costa Rican migrant caused thousands of euros of damage after rioting in a Rome hospital and trying to steal a pistol from a hospital security guard. The incident took place at around 6 p.m. after the man, who has lived in the Italian capital for several years, was brought to the hospital by an ambulance. After arriving in the emergency room he began punching a glass door and then broke the window with a fire extinguisher. After destroying the glass window, the man attacked medical machines and then tried to seize a pistol from a security guard but was unsuccessful, Il Giornale reports. The security guard then went outside and fired a gunshot in the air in an effort to intimidate the man but the 44-year-old continued his rampage. The man was eventually subdued by local Carabinieri officers who arrived on the scene and deployed pepper spray. The Costa Rican migrant is set to be charged with vandalism, attempted robbery and an aggravated threat to a public official.

According to Dr Alberto Zangrillo, the head of intensive care at the San Raffaele hospital in Milan, Italy has beaten the coronavirus entirely. Referencing a recent study, Professor Zangrillo claimed that “in reality, from the clinical point of view, the virus no longer exists.” The comments were met with scepticism from some officials such as Franco Locatelli, the head of Italy’s supreme health council, however, who commented: “I can only express great surprise and absolute puzzlement over the statements made by Professor Zangrillo.” “Just look at the number of new cases confirmed every day for evidence of the persistent circulation of the virus in Italy,” he added.

The shutdowns related to the coronavirus pandemic hurt Hispanic and African American employees more than white employees, according to the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics data, released in last Friday’s jobs report. The report‘s data table show that while white employment fell by 12.7% since February, Hispanic employment fell by 18.5% and black employment fell by 16.3%. (All three groups saw job gains in the positive May report, though the black unemployment rate rose slightly because there were disproportionately more black workers entering the workforce.) The reason for the racial differences in job losses is likely due to the concentration of different groups in different industries. Hispanics, for example, represent 17.6% of the total working population. But they represent 27.1% of the employees in the restaurant industry, which was largely shuttered due to the lockdowns. They also represent 37.6% of the employees in the car washing industry, which was also hit hard as people ceased travel for all but essential reasons. Similarly, black Americans represent 12.3% of the total working population, but 29.0% of employees in barber shops, which were closed down, and 22.1% of the car rental industry, which all but stopped. They also represent  21.9% of the employees of the animal slaughtering industry, which was impacted by coronavirus. Few of these industries allow remote working. Democrats and journalists tended to be more enthusiastic about shutting down the economy, with the White House Press Corps repeatedly urging President Donald Trump to criticize Republican-led states, such as Florida, that had not imposed draconian stay-at-home orders. Los Angeles City Controller Ron Galperin recently noted: “Job losses have particularly impacted people of color, and a recent national survey by the USC Dornsife Center for Economic and Social Research found that African Americans and Latinos were more likely to have lost their jobs than whites.” The USC Dornsife survey, released in April, reported: “People of color, especially African Americans, are more likely to have lost their jobs since mid-March. Nationally, 15% of whites said they had lost their jobs, whereas 18% of Latino and 21% of African Americans reported job losses.” Joel B.

Senior Chinese Communist Party officials released a lengthy report Sunday on the nation’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, claiming a rigorous and lengthy investigation shows China provided information to the world in a timely and transparent manner at all times. China “wasted no time” in sharing information such as the genome sequence for the new virus with the World Health Organization as well as relevant countries and regional organizations, according to the report as seen by the state-run Global Times. Further, the report outlines China “did not delay or cover up anything” and stands as a moral exemplar for the world to follow in future pandemic responses, given its “decisive victory” over the virus. National Health Commission Chairman Ma Xiaowei announced the astonishing exoneration. He claimed there were many unknowns in the early stage of the outbreak and it took time to gather evidence and define the characteristics of the new virus, claims that run countrary to countless allegations China obfuscated from the moment the virus was first discovered in the city of Wuhan last November. China Lied, People Died: Five Eyes Report Details CCP Coronavirus Cover-up https://t.co/sHLCxA7ZRt — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 2, 2020  “The Chinese government did not delay or cover up anything,” Ma Xiaowei said. “Instead, we have immediately reported virus data and relevant information about the epidemic to the international community and made an important contribution to the prevention and control of the epidemic around the world.” The report, which ran 66 pages in the English version, saluted China’s success in reducing the daily increase in new cases to single digits within about two months and the “decisive victory … in the battle to defend Hubei Province and its capital city of Wuhan” in about three months. China was forced to conduct the investigation after an Associated Press report found the genetic map of the virus was held back for more than a week in January, delaying its identification in a third country and the sharing of information needed to develop tests, drugs and a vaccine. The World Health Organization (W.H.O.) echoed Beijing by claiming there was “no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.” Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in #Wuhan, #China🇳. pic.twitter.com/Fnl5P877VG — World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) January 14, 2020  Meanwhile, the highly contagious disease spiraled out of control inside the Communist country.

A senior member of Australia’s parliament has taken protesters to task for massing on city streets across the country, saying their defiance of public health rules endangered the lives of others by being “reckless” and “irresponsible” at a time of a pandemic. Senator Mathias Cormann, finance minister in the conservative coalition government,  said those who took to the streets in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Hobart and other regional centers over the weekend risked a second outbreak of the Chinese coronavirus. “I think it is incredibly selfish,” Cormann told local outlet Sky News. “It’s incredibly self-indulgent.” <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> Australia has had 7,255 cases of the coronavirus and 102 deaths, avoiding the higher tolls seen elsewhere because of border closures and strict social distancing since March. Small outbreaks, however, still emerge. The national Black Lives Matter protests in Australia, called in support of those in America protesting the death of George Floyd,  came despite calls by authorities for people to stay at home and obey social-distancing rules that allow only for small groups to gather. Cormann later told reporters many Australians had lost their jobs, the economy had suffered and people had been unable to attend funerals of loved ones in order to stop the virus. “But we are going to have a mass gathering of tens of thousands of people in complete breach of the rules that apply to everyone else, it is absolutely reckless and irresponsible,” he said.

He said he hoped the rallies would not lead to a new wave of infections, SBS News reports. “We don’t know whether people will be infected,” Hunt told ABC radio on Sunday. “But if there is someone who is infectious in the midst of a crowd like that, that can have a catastrophic impact.”

During an interview with the Fox Business Network on Friday, White House Economic Adviser Kevin Hassett stated that there will “definitely” be a phase four stimulus package and Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia told the Fox News Channel’s “Cavuto Live” on Saturday that “it’s probably not the case that we’ve seen the last bill” to deal with the economic challenges resulting from the coronavirus. During the interview with Hassett, host Charles Payne asked, [relevant exchange begins around 1:45] “Will there be another stimulus package?” Hassett responded, “Yeah, there definitely will be. But one of the things that the president has instructed the team to do is to watch the numbers carefully, get as many real-time numbers as we can and have a menu of options for him that’s conditional on how the economy’s doing.” He continued that, depending on what the job numbers look like, “I could imagine it would be a much different phase four bill than if we had a whole bunch of months like April. And so, the president is doing exactly the right thing, which is, he built a bridge that basically lasts until about the end of July. And so, we’re going to use that time to monitor the economy and think about what the best policies are. But I’m sure there will be a phase four deal. Because there are things like liability protection and so on that really have to happen.” Scalia said that he would advise that the government watch “carefully, over the next few weeks, and then assess what more, if anything, needs to be done.” (h/t Forbes) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

On Friday’s “PBS NewsHour,” New York Times columnist David Brooks stated that the United States is in the midst of a “climactic shift.” Brooks began by saying Ferguson, terrorism, and the 2016 election started opening up riffs in American society, then the coronavirus pandemic and George Floyd’s killing exposed those divides further. He continued, “And then you get this generational turnover. You’ve had a generation of people under 35 who’ve seen the financial crisis, who’ve seen a bit of the war in Iraq maybe, but who’ve seen nothing on global warming. And so, this is a generation that is fed up. And, frankly, a lot of people in the African American community are fed up. The word I keep hearing is exhausted.” Brooks concluded, “And so, I do think, when you calculate the depth of the ravines that are being exposed, with the generational change, with a sense of America finally turning to race as maybe the central storyline in our history — or our story right now, these are just big, epic shifts. And I do think it’s like one of those big shifts that happen periodically in American history, ’68 or 1890 or 1830. And I think we’re in the middle of something…I think it’s not just a moment. It’s a climactic shift.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

On Saturday, protesters told Frey he was no longer welcome to demonstrate against Floyd’s death after he refused to commit to defunding Minneapolis’s police department. Last week, Frey urged demonstrators to practice social distancing and wear masks to reduce coronavirus transmission following protests and riots. Frey, who wore a mask for his Twitter profile photo, framed Floyd’s death in racial terms. Video of my full remarks from earlier this morning. "Being Black in America should not be a death sentence.

Thousands of protesters took to the streets of New York City on Saturday in the wake of George Floyd’s death, where they marched under a sign that made it clear that facial coverings should be used during the coronavirus pandemic. The protest, which was captured on video by Breitbart News in Lower Manhattan, lasted several hours and featured hundreds who had no facial coverings and largely ignored social distancing guidelines that have been put in place by state and local governments. Protesters marched down the street under a sign that read, “Outside with No Mask? Fuhgeddaboutit” and chanted “No justice, no peace” as they moved forward. The sign mimicked a New York accent pronumciation of “forget about it” and was part of a Public Service Announcement that stated that facial masks should be worn while traveling outside of your home. The same protest that occurred on Saturday featured protesters who replaced the chant “No justice, no peace” with “F**k Donald Trump, F**k Donald Trump.” Others in attendance chose to use the opportunity to promote voter registration, urging those who were New York citizens and not registered to vote to do so.

On Friday’s “MSNBC Live,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) stated that if we had improved testing, “we could open up a lot more quickly” and that he is “so proud of these young kids in the streets.” Schumer also expressed concern that protesters were putting themselves and others at risk from coronavirus, and said that “The answer here is testing.” Schumer said that travel, entertainment, and retail industries are hurting the hardest, “and if we don’t get massive testing, which is the real answer here. If people had instantaneous tests and knew, when they entered a place, that everyone was tested and the people who were inside didn’t have COVID, we could open up a lot more quickly. That’s in our bill, too.” Later, Schumer stated that he is “so proud of these young kids in the streets. … Trump would like people to think all the demonstrators are violent rioters. That’s a tiny number, and they of course should be punished. No one wants the violence. But the vast majority are people looking for change, to deal with the gaping sore that’s been on the American body politic since our founding, and that is racial injustice, racism. And I am very hopeful that people across the country are seeing that and we can get some real, strong action.” Host Stephanie Ruhle then asked Schumer, “But how concerned are you about their health? It was just a week ago, we were looking at all the people who disregarded social distancing rules Memorial Day weekend, and we worried that they were going to put themselves and so many others at a health risk. Do you not have that concern now?” Schumer responded, “Yeah, well, sure. The answer here is testing. The Trump administration has been an abject failure in getting adequate tests. If we had adequate tests, people who knew they had COVID would stay in. Everyone else could go about their business protesting if they so wished, going to stores, going to work.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

More than 1,200 health professionals have signed a letter saying that they approve of protests against racism during the Chinese virus pandemic, because it is “vital to the national public health.” The health professionals added, however, that protesting lockdown orders is still dangerous, and is also “rooted in white nationalism.” According to the letter, “White supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to COVID-19.” A group of healthcare and medical professionals wrote an open letter expressing their support for protests against racism in the wake of the death of George Floyd — despite the pandemic that so many health officials have been warning the public about — adding that such protests against racism should not be shut down due to coronavirus fears, reports CNN. “As public health advocates, we do not condemn these gatherings as risky for COVID-19 transmission,” wrote the health professionals in their letter. “We support them as vital to the national public health and to the threatened health specifically of Black people in the United States.” “We can show that support by facilitating safest protesting practices without detracting from demonstrators’ ability to gather and demand change,” they continue. The letter goes on to state that their support for protests against racism during the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic should not “be confused” for them also having support for protests against lockdowns in response to the Chinese virus. “This should not be confused with a permissive stance on all gatherings, particularly protests against stay-home orders,” state the health professionals, who go on to bizarrely claim that such protests are also “rooted in white nationalism.” “Those actions not only oppose public health interventions, but are also rooted in white nationalism and run contrary to respect for Black lives,” reads the letter. “White supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to COVID-19,” affirm the health professionals in their letter. “We created this letter in response to emerging narratives that seemed to malign demonstrations as risky for the public health because of Covid-19,” explain the authors — most of whom are from the University of Washington’s Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The letter was also signed by over 1,200 other health professionals who claim that they concur with the sentiments. “We believe that the way forward is not to suppress protests in the name of public health but to respond to protesters demands in the name of public health, thereby addressing multiple public health crises,” they further explain. The health professionals go on to advise that protesters engage in “social distancing” and “public masking” while they “call attention to the pervasive lethal force of white supremacy.” The letter also mentions that while the health professionals are in support of such protests, people should nonetheless “prepare for an increased number of infections in the days following a protest.” You can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo, and on Instagram.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) on Saturday announced that New York reached the lowest number of coronavirus hospitalizations and deaths since the start of the pandemic and stated on social media that they have “crushed” the curve, adding that New York City will be entering the first phase of reopening on Monday. “We did the impossible. On Monday NYC will open phase one. We didn’t just flatten the curve — we crushed it,” Cuomo stated: We did the impossible. On Monday NYC will open phase one. We didn’t just flatten the curve — we crushed it. #NYTough — Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) June 6, 2020  The Empire State reached a significant milestone on Saturday as the governor announced the lowest number of hospitalizations and deaths since the start of the pandemic weeks ago. Total hospitalizations on Friday slipped to 2,603 “from a record-high of 18,825 during the peak of the pandemic, and 35 people in New York passed away due to COVID-19, down from a record-high of 800 just eight weeks ago,” per the governor’s website. “Our metrics are all, today, very good. We are going to open the valve more than we originally anticipated because the metrics are so good,” Cuomo said on Saturday. “Compared to where we were, this is a big sigh of relief”:  As a result of the downward trend in coronavirus metrics, places of worship — including churches, synagogues, and mosques — will be able to reopen and operate at a 25 percent capacity during the state’s second phase of reopening. “Places of worship in the seven regions that have already entered phase two – the Capital Region, Central New York, the Finger Lakes, the Mohawk Valley, the North Country, the Southern Tier and Western New York – can reopen beginning tomorrow, June 7th,” according to the state’s website. “This is an acceleration for us because we are doing so well on the metrics, but people still have to stay smart,” Cuomo said. New York City, which was hit particularly hard by the virus, is “on track” to enter into the first phase of reopening Monday, June 8, as percent of positive coronavirus tests “has dropped from a high of 57 percent per day to two percent per day within the city.” New York State reported 381,019 positive cases and 30,066 deaths as of Saturday, the majority of which stem from New York City.

June 6 (UPI) — California Gov. Gavin Newsom has declared that TV and film productions may resume in the state on Friday. The industry has been largely shut down since mid-March due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed about 108,000 people in the United States to date. Productions will be “subject to approval by county public health officers within the jurisdictions of operations following their review of local epidemiological data including cases per 100,000 population, rate of test positivity, and local preparedness to support a health care surge, vulnerable populations, contact tracing and testing,” the California Department of Public Health said in a statement issued by the governor’s office Friday. It is unclear which TV shows and movies might go back to work on or around that date, however, since protocols still need to be approved, union agreements signed and protective measures put in place. Changes on set that are expected are coronavirus testing for casts and crews, regular temperature checks, improved hygiene and sanitation, and live audiences only when they wear masks and social distance.

Photographs show activists at the illegal Black Lives Matter protests in London have defaced the Cenotaph, which honours the fallen, on the 76th anniversary of D-Day. Sited on Whitehall near the Prime Minister’s official Downing Street residence, the Cenotaph — “empty tomb” — is Britain’s national war memorial, constructed and dedicated to the memory of “the glorious dead” in the First World War. It remains the focus of the country’s most significant acts of remembrance down to the present day, particularly on Armistice Day and Remembrance Sunday, and with June 6th being the 76th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy it would have, in normal times, likely been the focus of ceremonies honouring veterans of all colours across Britain and the former British Empire. Such ceremonies have been suspended virtually worldwide, however, as people are prevented from attending large memorials or even a typical funeral — but this did not stop Black Lives Matter supporters from staging a thousands-strong, closely-packed, and ultimately violent protest, ostensibly over George Floyd’s death on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean in Minneapolis.

Prior to defacing the Cenotaph, attendees at the Black Lives Matter protest — which both the Health Secretary and the Home Secretary urged people to stay away from, given it is unlawful and could lead to a resurgence of the coronavirus in Britain’s multicultural capital — had vandalised not just the statue of wartime leader Sir Winston Churchill in Parliament Square, but also the statue of Abraham Lincoln, the U.S. leader who was assassinated for leading the war to free America’s slaves in the 1800s.

Bars, gyms, day camps, schools, and campgrounds will be permitted to begin reopening the week of June 7 in counties that meet the California Department of Public Health criteria regarding coronavirus cases and hospitalizations, a department guidance released Friday detailed. The department’s statewide, industry-specific guidance allows sectors that have remained closed for weeks to reopen with certain modifications in place. The guidance provides broad instruction for professional sports, retail, schools, and shopping centers to resume operations. “The rules on schools and day camps will apply statewide. But only counties that have met certain thresholds on the number of cases, testing and preparedness will be allowed to start reopening the other sectors,” KPIX reported: 📢 #California has announced new guidance to help counties plan for the reopening of schools, childcare, and entertainment as well as new monitoring data to support local communities in a timely response to outbreaks: https://t.co/CbektJrGRb — CA Public Health (@CAPublicHealth) June 6, 2020  The state’s health department provides criteria for counties to proceed in reopening. Requirements include “stable hospitalizations of COVID individuals on a 7-day average of daily percent change of less than 5% OR no more than 20 COVID hospitalizations on any single day in the past 14 days” and “less than 25 new cases per 100,000 residents in the past 14 days OR less than 8% testing positive in the past 7 days.” The guidance also has requirements for testing capacity, contact tracing, and the potential for a hospital surge. The Golden State, which has a population of nearly 40 million, had 126,510 positive cases of the virus and 4,550 related deaths as of Saturday morning. A bulk of those cases and deaths stem from Los Angeles County.

The government of Equatorial Guinea joined Burundi in announcing the expulsion of the World Health Organization’s (W.H.O.) representatives there, citing a document that alleges they falsified the number of cases of the Chinese coronavirus. The Equatorial Guinea Foreign Ministry document, obtained by Agence France Presse (AFP), accused W.H.O. Representative Triphonie Nkurunziza of “falsifying” the country’s coronavirus figures after she claimed the country had been “severely affected” by the pandemic. “The government has asked her to go, we have received a document – she is accused of falsifying COVID-19 figures,” a source at the W.H.O. office told AFP. According to Dr. Nkurunziza, the Central African nation has recorded more than 1,000 coronavirus cases and 12 deaths nationwide, a relatively high figure given the population of just 1.4 million. “By population we estimate it to be one of the severely affected countries in terms of the number of cases,” the W.H.O.’s regional director for Africa Matshidiso Moeti told reporters this week. “The government has asked the W.H.O. to replace its representative Triphonie Nkurunziza in Equatorial Guinea,” she added. “We are currently working on doing that. I’d like to emphasize very much that we are committed to working with the government, particularly working to support the people.” Addressing the Senate late last week, the country’s Prime Minister Pascual Obama Asue said: “We don’t have a problem with the WHO, we have a problem with the WHO’s representative in Malabo.” Despite being declared persona non-grata, Nkurunziza currently remains in the capital of Malabo because there are no outbound flights. Led by President Teodoro Obiang since a 1979 military coup, Equatorial Guinea is one of Africa’s most authoritarian states with one of the region’s worst human rights records. In April 2016, Obiang declared himself the winner of the country’s presidential election with a staggering 93.7 percent in an election that the U.S. denounced as “neither free nor fair.” According to the State Department’s report on the country, major human rights violations include “torture; arbitrary detention by government agents; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; political prisoners; arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy; significant problems with independence of the judiciary; the worst forms of restrictions on free expression, press, and the internet, including violence, threats of violence, or unjustified arrests or prosecutions of journalists, censorship, site blocking, and the existence of criminal libel laws.” Equatorial Guinea follows fellow African nation Burundi in expelling W.H.O. representative Walter Kazadi Mulombo and several of his officials. Their removal was also dubious political circumstances after they raised concerns about holding mass political rallies in the run-up to last month’s presidential election. They were ordered to leave the country on Friday. Follow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.

Activists defaced and scaled Abraham Lincoln’s statue in Parliament Square, London, at a Black Lives Matter rally held in defiance of Britain’s anti-coronavirus regulations. Video from protest, estimated to be 15,000-strong at the time of publication, shows the Lincoln statue defaced with the graffiti reading “BLM” and naming George Floyd, Mike Brown, and other individuals said to have been killed wrongfully by the police. One side of Lincoln’s pedestal has also had a banner and several placards duct-taped to it, reading “RACISM IS A PANDEMIC TOO”, “SILENCE IS VIOLENCE”, “BLM”, and “ABOLISH THE POLICE”. Separate footage shows protesters physically scaling the statue to cheers from the closely-packed crowds, which assembled in defiance of Home Secretary Priti Patel and Health Secretary Matt Hancock warning that such gatherings were unlawful and could send coronavirus infections soaring again.

“Progressive” ideology always rests on a conviction that the current “regressive” system is comprehensively unjust and must be destroyed by exploiting its weaknesses.  The most famous proponent of such tactics in recent years has been the late Saul Alinksy, the intellectual godfather of the modern Democrat Party, but former Soviet journalist and KGB informant Yuri Bezmenov laid out an even more concise strategy for subversion in a 1984 interview. Alinksy’s seminal book specified 13 Rules for Radicals, but Bezmenov had only four “stages of ideological subversion,” and they will sound very familiar to anyone following the current wave of left-wing riots, or the politicized final stages of the coronavirus panic before it: Demoralization, Destabilization, Crisis, and Normalization.  Bezmenov defined ideological subversion, or “active measures” as the KGB preferred to call it, as a “slow brainwashing process” to “change the perception of reality of every American to such an extent that despite their abundance of information, no one is able to come to sensible conclusions in the interests of defending themselves, their families, their community, and their country.” Stage 1: Demoralization Bezmenov said the first stage, Demoralization, could take 15 to 20 years to complete because “this is the minimum number of years it takes to educate one generation of students.” “Marxist-Leninist ideology is being pumped into the soft heads of at least three generations without being challenged or counterbalanced by the basic values of Americanism, American patriotism,” he warned in 1984, judging that the demoralization process had been “basically completed” by that point. “Actually, it’s over-fulfilled, because demoralization now reaches such areas where previously, not even Comrade Andropov and all of his experts would even dream of such tremendous success,” he added, referring to former KGB head and Soviet leader Yuri Andropov. “Most of it is done by Americans to Americans, thanks to a lack of moral standards.” Bezmenov explained that demoralization is important because it robs the targeted population of its ability to process valid information. Even when demoralization targets are “showered with authentic proof” of contrary positions, they simply “refuse to believe it.” Demoralization is quite obvious among today’s young people, whose faith in their country has been systematically destroyed throughout their lives by the education and media establishment. To take a recent high-profile example, the New York Times’ fraudulent “1619 Project” argued that “American history” actually began with the arrival of black slaves in North America and the Revolutionary War was fought by the colonists to preserve slavery. Although comprehensively debunked by actual historians, and even the original author has admitted her core thesis was not true, the 1619 Project is now part of some school curricula.   Another word for demoralization is guilt. Americans are routinely compelled to feel guilty about their society and national history. Guilt is the most powerful force in left-wing politics and academia. People will not accept the radical expansion of punitive government power unless they feel guilty and deserving of punishment. Stage 2: Destabilization The second stage, Destabilization, is much faster, requiring only two to five years under KGB doctrine. In this stage, the fundamentals of the targeted population’s economy, political system, and culture would be attacked, while the demoralized population could not mount much of a defense.  Bezmenov in 1984 found it “absolutely fantastic” how much influence Marxist-Leninist ideas had developed in the American economy and military. In essence, a demoralized population becomes willing to believe the worst criticisms of its own society, while learning to see defenders of that society as their enemies, while avowed enemies become natural allies. The defenders are held to strict standards, while anything goes for the most strident critics.  Whatever Bezmenov saw in the destabilized American society of the early 1980s with respect to the Soviet Union, it’s easy to see how the American Left has destabilized entire segments of modern society after demoralizing them. They see enemies everywhere, while no pro-American authority can be trusted. It’s hard to imagine a better illustration of demoralization followed by destabilization than hordes of anti-capitalist activists texting each other on their iPhones. Not coincidentally, hostile foreign powers like Communist China and Iran are reaching out to destabilized American communities and offering themselves as guides and allies. Their sales pitches aren’t exactly smooth, but they definitely are making an effort. A destabilized population becomes obsessed with hypocrisy as the ultimate political sin. They believe the best ideas – individual liberty, sovereign rights, capitalism, even the rule of law – are presented insincerely by sinister powers who seek to exploit and manipulate them. The precious resource of goodwill disappears from society as everyone comes to believe their neighbors hate them and cannot be trusted. Demoralized people lose faith in their nation, history, and ideals; destabilized people lose faith in each other. Stage 3: Crisis Once a society has been destabilized, Bezmenov said the time would be ripe to create a Crisis, which he estimated would take six to eight weeks in the Eighties. With turbo Internet speed, the modern era can punch out a crisis much faster than that. A crisis has the obvious benefit of panicking demoralized, destabilized people into abandoning their legal protections and constitutional ideals. During the coronavirus panic, people who brought up those ideals were treated like lunatics. The pendulum swung the other way with blinding speed during the riots. In the span of one week, the right to peaceable assembly went from a crazed defiance of common-sense lockdown rules to an urgent matter that utterly transcended the deadly pandemic. Suddenly, angry political demonstration magically cured the coronavirus, or made the projected wave of sickness and death into a purely secondary concern. If you wanted to work at the store so you could feed your family in late March, you were selfishly trying to “kill my Grandma to pad your bank account.” If you wanted to burn the store down in early June to protest white supremacy, nobody mentioned their imperiled grandmothers. The more subtle benefit of a crisis is that it tends to de-legitimize aspects of the existing system that have already been softened up by the long process of demoralization and destabilization. Those who control the organs of public communication have the power to decide which aspects of the system are supposedly indicted by the crisis.  For example, the dominant media Left will go to great lengths to avoid painting the coronavirus as an indictment of the flabby, blinkered, bureaucratic Big Government that grew over the past few decades, and it will not discuss the failures of left-wing mayors and governors. On the contrary, the pandemic was used to attack the competence of Republican governors who turned out to be entirely correct in their actions, as in Florida and Georgia. During the riots, the media is completely uninterested in discussing the incompetence of left-wing officials who allowed violence to rage out of control with deadly consequences. Somehow the lesson of wanton violence that killed people and destroyed countless livelihoods became “let’s get rid of the police altogether.” The threat of a crisis is essential for terrorizing the middle class into accepting a political agenda that is actively hostile to its interests, which leads to the fourth stage of subversion: the offer to make the pain and fear go away by accepting political domination. Stage 4: Normalization “After a crisis, with a violent change of the power structure and economy, you have a so-called period of Normalization that may last indefinitely,” Bezmenov said, arriving at the fourth stage of subversion. “Normalization is a cynical expression borrowed from Soviet propaganda,” he explained. Interestingly, it also happens to be the core theme of the 2020 Democrat presidential campaign. “When the Soviet tanks moved into Czechoslovakia in 1968, Comrade Brezhnev said, ‘Now the situation in brotherly Czechoslovakia is ‘normalized.’ This is what will happen in the United States if you allow all the schmucks to bring the country to crisis, to promise people all kinds of goodies and a paradise on Earth, to destabilize your economy, to eliminate the principle of free-market competition, and to put a Big Brother government in Washington, D.C. with benevolent dictators like Walter Mondale, who will promise lots of things – never mind whether the promises are fulfillable or not,” Bezmenov cautioned. As things turned out, Walter Mondale never got his chance to be a benevolent dictator, and to some extent Bezmenov’s four-step model of subversion could be applied to almost any political campaign. They almost all begin with telling voters things are awful, crises have erupted, and normality can be restored only by voting for the challenger (or preserved only by voting for the incumbent). Bezmenov, however, was insistent that American left-wing professors and civil-rights leaders were deliberately running Andropov’s strategy with a conscious effort to achieve destabilization, the step that truly distinguishes ideological subversion from the usual promises to put a chicken in every pot. “They are instrumental in the process of subversion only to destabilize a nation,” he said of the academics and activists. “When their job is completed, they are not needed anymore. They know too much. Some of them, when they get disillusioned, when they see that Marxist-Leninists come to power, obviously they get offended. They think that they will come to power. That will never happen, of course. They will be lined up against the wall and shot.” The American version of this process probably would not end with the mass execution of inconvenient intellectuals, but there is a parallel in what would happen to the intellectual supporters of the current riots if the Democrats win in 2020. They would discover that the victorious Democrat Party is not at all interested in their systemic criticisms of public union employees, such as police officers. Many bones would be thrown to activist groups to purchase their loyalty – and, much more importantly, the loyalty of their leaders – but not the one concession they ostensibly care about the most: a system that makes it easier to discipline and fire government employees. This metaphorical lining up and shooting of intellectuals is already happening with Lockdown Forever enthusiasts, who only a few days ago were hammering out passionate arguments that American businesses must remain shuttered for weeks or months to come, and anyone who dared to question their dire warnings was a selfish monster willing to kill other people’s grandmothers to pad out their 401k accounts. In the blink of an eye, Lockdown Forever went from the vital engineers of a politically useful crisis to inconvenient obstacles for the new crisis, nationwide riots.  Most of the lockdown gurus sensed this shift in the political winds and quickly trimmed their sails, hammering out new screeds that claimed protesters are probably immune to the coronavirus somehow, or even more incredibly, that another outbreak would be a small price to pay for righteous political activism: Dozens of public health and disease experts have signed an open letter in support of the nationwide anti-racism protests. "White supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to COVID-19," they wrote.https://t.co/EewPNgDSu3 — NPR (@NPR) June 2, 2020  These are the same medical activists who were shrieking in March that the coronavirus could kill millions of Americans if lockdowns were not imposed immediately, and just a few weeks ago, left-wingers were obsessed with calculations that showed COVID-19 is exceptionally deadly to the black community. But suddenly the risk of millions of deaths, 70 percent of them purportedly likely to be black Americans, means nothing compared to the vital urgency of protesting against “white supremacy.”

The British government has made wearing masks mandatory on public transport as part of the country’s lockdown measures, with fines for violations. However, the move came after thousands of far-left protesters and rioters were free to break social distancing rules in London without punishment. Transport secretary Grant Shapps made the announcement on Thursday that from June 15th, wearing masks will be compulsory under “conditions of travel” for trains, buses, and other forms of public transport. Those not wearing them may be refused to board or even face fines. Mr Shapps said: “Alongside transport operators, this will be enforced by the British Transport Police if necessary, but I expect the vast majority of people won’t need to be forced into this.” The face-covering may be a store-bought or homemade mask or even a scarf. Young children and those with disabilities or who have difficulty breathing are exempt. The British Medical Association (BMA) and London’s left-wing mayor, Labour’s Sadiq Khan, have called for the requirement to be rolled out to restaurants, shops, pubs, and other enclosed public spaces. PICS: Antifa, Black Lives Matter Flood London Despite Lockdown, Police Do Little https://t.co/ySrdWGyW0R — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 31, 2020  The United Kingdom still maintains some of the strictest lockdown rules in the world. Britons facing additional requirements in order to simply be allowed on public transport comes as images in the media showed thousands of Black Lives Matter and Antifa protesters marching in close proximity through London, largely without masks, in almost total disregard for the rules other law-abiding citizens are expected to follow. The reaction of London’s Metropolitan Police was to “encourage” protesters to remember that “there are still restrictions in place to prevent its spread, which include not gathering outside in groups of more than six people”. Rather than demanding protesters obey the rules, however, many London police officers instead kneeled to Black Lives Matter protesters, including outside of the Prime Minister’s Downing Street residence. Wednesday’s demonstration then quickly descended into violence, with rioters assaulting and punching police officers yards from the prime minister’s official residence. Just days before, peaceful anti-lockdown protesters in London’s Hyde Park were arrested for “breach of Covid-19 regulations” with some fines being issued. Exclusive Video: Peaceful Anti-Lockdown Protestors Arrested at Demonstration in London https://t.co/NsbvSCHBdl — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 1, 2020  Whether or not being faced with the blatant hypocrisy will cause Britons to reject en masse the enforcement of mask-wearing remains to be seen. However, Breitbart London’s James Delingpole believes that the recent Black Lives Matter protests have “killed” lockdown. Writing on Friday, Delingpole observed: But how do all these strictures square with the events of the last few days, in which thousands of people, in Hyde Park and elsewhere, have been permitted to gather in huge crowds in support of Black Lives Matter in flagrant contravention of all social distancing rules? Well they don’t, obviously, and anyone with half a brain can see this. He pointed out the “official hypocrisy, double standards, and general stupidity” of the government’s lockdown position, saying: So, for example, as I discovered the other week, if you’re protesting against the lockdown the police will turn up mob-handed and threaten you with arrest for inadequate social distancing. But if you’re part of menacing mob claiming to be outraged by an incident that happened 4,000 miles away across the Atlantic in an entirely different legal jurisdiction, then as far as the authorities are concerned no action need be taken short of arresting people physically beating up police officers. “I think the Black Lives Matter protests — certainly the UK version — are dangerous, stupid and wrong for a number of reasons,” he concluded. “But I’m grateful to them for one thing: they’ve made it quite impossible for anyone with even half a brain to see the ongoing lockdown as anything other than a ridiculous joke.” Australian media in London confronted and chased by the mob live on-air yesterday.   UK media not interested in showing it. Remarkable.  pic.twitter.com/rSOT6W1Atb — Michael Heaver (@Michael_Heaver) June 4, 2020 

SAINT-LAURENT-SUR-MER, France (AP) – At least the dead will always be there. All too many have been, for 76 years since that fateful June 6th on France’s Normandy beaches, when Allied troops in 1944 turned the course of World War II and went on to defeat fascism in Europe in one of the most remarkable feats in military history. Forgotten they will never be. Revered, yes. But Saturday’s anniversary will be one of the loneliest remembrances ever, as the coronavirus pandemic is keeping almost everyone away — from government leaders to frail veterans who might not get another chance for a final farewell to their unlucky comrades. Rain and wind are also forecast, after weeks of warm, sunny weather. “I miss the others,” said Charles Shay, who as a U.S. Army medic was in the first wave of soldiers to wade ashore at Omaha Beach under relentless fire on D-Day. Shay, 95, lives in France close to the beach where he and so many others landed in 1944. He knows of no U.S. veterans making the trip overseas to observe D-Day this year. “I guess I will be alone here this year,” Shay said before he performed a Native American ritual to honour his comrades by spreading the smoke of burning white sage into the winds lashing the Normandy coast Friday. The eerie atmosphere touches the French as well as Americans. “The sadness is almost too much, because there is no one,” said local guide Adeline James. “Plus you have their stories. The history is sad and it’s even more overwhelming now between the weather, the [virus] situation and, and, and.” The locals in this north-western part of France have come out year after year to show their gratitude for the soldiers from the United States, Britain, Canada, and other countries who liberated them from Adolf Hitler’s Nazi forces. Despite the lack of international crowds, David Pottier still went out to raise American flags in the Calvados village of Mosles, population 356, which was liberated by Allied troops the day after the landing on five Normandy beachheads. In a forlorn scene, a gardener tended to the parched grass around the small monument for the war dead, while Pottier, the local mayor, was getting the French tricolour to flutter next to the Stars and Stripes. “We have to recognize that they came to die in a foreign land,” Pottier said. “We miss the GIs,” he said of the U.S. soldiers. This protest in London now has nothing to do with George Floyd.  It is anarchy in the face of weak leadership.  To desecrate The Cenotaph tells us these people hate our values, our culture and our country. Enough. pic.twitter.com/CtfKtg1Aqq — Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) June 3, 2020  The pandemic has wreaked havoc across the world, infecting 6.6 million people, killing over 391,000 and devastating economies. It poses a particular threat to the elderly — like the surviving D-Day veterans who are in their late nineties or older. It has also affected the younger generations who turn out every year to mark the occasion. Most have been barred from travelling to the windswept coasts of Normandy. Some 160,000 soldiers made the perilous crossing from England that day in atrocious conditions, storming dunes which they knew were heavily defended by German troops determined to hold their positions. Somehow, they succeeded. Yet they left a trail of thousands of casualties who have been mourned for generations since. Last year stood out, with U.S. President Donald Trump joining French President Emmanuel Macron at the American cemetery in Colleville-sur-Mer, on a bluff overlooking Omaha Beach. A smattering of veterans were honoured with the highest accolades. All across the beaches of Normandy tens of thousands came from across the globe to pay their respects to the dead and laud the surviving soldiers. The acrid smell of wartime-era jeep exhaust fumes and the rumble of old tanks filled the air as parades of vintages vehicles went from village to village. The tiny roads between the dunes, hedges and apple orchards were clogged for hours, if not days. Heading into the D-Day remembrance weekend this year, only the salty brine coming off the ocean on Omaha Beach hits the nostrils, the shrieks of seagulls pierce the ears and a sense of desolation hangs across the region’s country roads. “Last year this place was full with jeeps, trucks, people dressed up as soldiers,” said Eric Angely, who sat on a seawall wearing a World War II uniform after taking his restored U.S. Army jeep out for a ride. “This year, there is nothing. It’s just me now, my dog and my jeep,” the local Frenchman said. Three-quarters of a century and the horrific wartime slaughter of D-Day help put things in perspective. Someday, the COVID-19 pandemic, too, will pass, and people will turn out to remember both events that shook the world. “We don’t have a short memory around here,” Pottier said with a wistful smile. I don’t care what the cause, or how deep the anger, there is simply no excuse for denigrating the Cenotaph, a war memorial to mark the millions who died for the liberty that today’s generation take for granted  The Fallen’s lives matter, too 🙏🏻 pic.twitter.com/jZdCGvpKLc — Martin Daubney (@MartinDaubney) June 3, 2020  ___ Virginia Mayo contributed.

On Friday’s broadcast of CNN’s “AC360,” host Anderson Cooper said that protesters are “putting themselves at greater risk” from coronavirus because “That is how urgently people want real and lasting change” and remarked on the White House not arranging its chairs for a press conference for social distancing by saying, “So much for all those warnings by Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx and the Coronavirus Task Force.” Cooper said, “For 11 days now, we have been hearing the call for change in this country. It’s coming from the ground up, from people of all races and backgrounds and in the middle of a pandemic. Just think about that for a minute as you look at the live demonstrations on your screen. Not only are people risking their safety by speaking out and confronting police, which is something most people never do in their lives, they’re also putting themselves at greater risk from a virus that’s already killed 109,000 people in this country, a virus which is still here, still transmittable, still killing people all around the world. That is how urgently people want real and lasting change in the wake of George Floyd’s killing by police nearly two Mondays ago. It’s how badly they want an end to what has been a long-running and deadly injustice to African Americans in this country, and to redeem the country’s long-standing promise of equal justice under the law.” He later added that the chairs at the White House’s press conference earlier in the day were “deliberately not arranged for social distancing. Because, in the words of the deputy press secretary, it looks better. So much for all those warnings by Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx and the Coronavirus Task Force. The president has clearly decided the virus is not a winning topic for him anymore.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

Friday, during an interview that aired on Huntsville, AL radio’s WVNN, Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) discussed how his East Texas congressional district was handling the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, and what he foresaw as overcoming the impact could mean. During the discussion, Gohmert also referenced the Hong Kong flu (H3N2) pandemic of the late 1960s and how different his experience with that was compared to coronavirus. “[I] was just in high school, had just got in high school back during the Hong Kong flu, ’68, ’69,” he said. “I’ve been reading a lot about that, and I remember the talk about it. We lost 100,000 or so Americans back then to that virus. We didn’t have a vaccine for it, much like coronavirus didn’t have a vaccine. But, I don’t remember any business being shutdown.  I don’t remember anybody being told they had to wear a mask or anything.” The Texas Republican congressman explained that given the willingness of the country to accept requirements and restrictions put in place by governmental bodies to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus in current-day America seemed to show the country was much more “tolerant” of government power. “I know we’ve done more and improved more, but I think Americans now are much more tolerant of having big government tell them what they can and can’t do, especially the millennials are more accustomed to telling them what they can or can’t do,” Gohmert continued. “I see that as the difference between now and past pandemics. There will probably be a little resurgence — hopefully not much more than this one. A lot depends on us.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor

New York City, New York rioters arrested for crimes considered “low-level” will not face any charges after nights of rioting, looting, and setting fires. Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance says his office will not prosecute any rioters who were charged with crimes like unlawful assembly or disorderly conduct. The announcement means the overwhelming majority of hundreds of rioters in New York City will likely not face any criminal prosecution. Vance’s office said in a statement The prosecution of protestors charged with these low-level offenses undermines critical bonds between law enforcement and the communities we serve.Days after the killing of George Floyd, our nation and our city are at a crossroads in our continuing endeavor to confront racism and systemic injustice wherever it exists. Our office has a moral imperative to enact public policies which assure all New Yorkers that in our justice system and our society, black lives matter and police violence is a crime. We commend the thousands of our fellow New Yorkers who have peacefully assembled to demand these achievable aims, and our door is open to any New Yorker who wishes to be heard. Only rioters who were arrested and where there is evidence that they contributed to attacks on police officers, looting, or destruction of property will face criminal charges. Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s (D-NY) “bail reform” law — which eliminated bail for a number of nonviolent and violent crimes in New York state — is successfully freeing at least 400 rioters and looters from jail without ever having to pay bail. The bail reform law eliminated bail for suspects accused of second-degree manslaughter, aggravated vehicular assault, third-degree assault, promoting an obscene sexual performance by a child, criminally negligent homicide, aggravated vehicular homicide, and about 100 other crimes. In March, New York City Police Department (NYPD) officials said that in the first 58 days of the year, close to 500 suspects who would have been kept locked up in jail if not for the new bail reform laws had been rearrested for committing an additional 846 crimes. Nearly 300 of these crimes included murder, rape, robbery, felony assault, burglary, grand larceny, and grand larceny auto. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Jihadists in Indonesia are calling for violent attacks on Chinese-run businesses amid surging anti-Chinese sentiment in the Muslim-majority nation. In the midst of an economic recession caused by the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, foreign workers in Indonesia compete for dwindling local jobs with Indonesians. This has seeded resentment toward the Chinese, who make up the majority of Indonesia’s foreign workforce, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported on Thursday. Sofyan Tsauri, a former al-Qaeda terrorist who served five years in prison for helping to arm terror groups and now supports Indonesia’s counterterrorism efforts, said on Monday, “Some jihadis have called for the burning and robbing of Chinese shops.” He made the comment following his participation in a webinar on Monday by the Indonesian think tank Center for Radicalism and Deradicalization Studies, the SCMP reported. According to Sofyan, jihadis have called for attacks on Chinese businesses on social media platforms, including Facebook, for the past six months. The calls to action have been made by members of Indonesia’s Islamic State affiliate, Jemaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), members of al-Qaeda, and other jihadist groups operating in Indonesia. Sofyan said that jihadis were already preparing to launch a terror attack in Indonesia, implying that it was a question of when, not if, they strike. “[An attack] has to be anticipated and not be dismissed. There needs to be caution,” Sofyan warned, adding that regions of Indonesia where jihadis have been known to operate – such as the islands of “Sulawesi, Sumatra, and West Java”– should exercise vigilance. He explained that the ongoing Chinese coronavirus pandemic has caused serious vulnerabilities to crop up within Indonesia’s government and society, creating optimal conditions for the terrorists to strike. As examples, Sofyan cited the general distraction of the national government in dealing with the public health crisis and the swelling of anti-Chinese sentiment among Indonesians, itself a result of the pandemic-induced economic recession. According to the SCMP, in April, Indonesia’s Manpower and Transmigration Ministry said that 2.8 million people had lost their jobs as a direct result of the economic recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic, adding that an additional 70 million “informal workers” were “at risk” of unemployment. As of May, a total of 98,900 foreign workers were active in Indonesia’s workforce, less than 0.1 percent of Indonesia’s total workforce of 124 million, the SCMP reported. Of foreign workers, the Chinese accounted for the largest group – 35,781 workers– followed by the Japanese at 12,823, and South Koreans at 9,097. China invests heavily in Indonesia and is the nation’s second-largest foreign direct investor. In 2019, Chinese companies invested $4.7 billion in Indonesia. Though long-standing, Indonesian resentment toward Chinese foreign workers has increased significantly during the current recession. According to the report, many Indonesians have recently criticized the government for allegedly favoring Chinese workers over locals in allotting work contracts, prompting the government to respond. In early May, lawmakers in southwestern Indonesia’s Sulawesi province denied the planned arrival of 500 Chinese foreign workers contracted by Chinese metalworking companies in Indonesia hoping to employ them instead of locals. Although the Chinese companies had already managed to secure work permits for the group from Jakarta’s central government, the act was overridden by Indonesia’s Ministry of Manpower, which postponed the workers’ arrival, citing concerns that it would spread coronavirus. Mohd Adhe Bhakti, the executive director of Indonesia’s Center for Radicalism and Deradicalization Studies, warned that if the Indonesian government fails to stand firm in denying the entry of foreign workers, especially the Chinese, to the country, terrorist attacks in the near future are “highly possible.” Speaking to the SCMP, Bhakti pointed to an attack on Monday of a police station in South Kalimantan, in which a police officer was killed with a sword by a group of suspected pro-Islamic State terrorists. The incident occurred on Pancasila Day, a public holiday celebrating the birth of Indonesia’s secular, national ideology. Bhakti says that the attack’s occurrence on a national holiday was no coincidence, as terrorists prefer to stage attacks on dates of symbolic significance. He advised Indonesians to remain alert to future terror attacks on major holidays. In the past, jihadis have planned or carried out terror attacks during the Christmas holiday and on New Year’s Eve. Last Christmas, the Indonesian government deployed 200,000 police officers to guard against threats of violent attacks from jihadis during the Christian holiday.

In a unanimous 7-0 decision, the Michigan Supreme Court sided with 77-year-old barber Karl Manke over Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Friday. Whitmer and Attorney General Dana Nessel have been relentlessly pursuing Manke, attempting to force the closure of his shop during the coronavirus pandemic. Great Lakes News reported on Facebook late Friday that the Court ruled unanimously in favor of the Owosso barber — a stunning decision, given the narrow 4-3 ideological split in favor of conservatives.  According to Great Lakes News, Manke’s attorney, David Kallman, called it the “biggest, most lopsided victory of his career.” Whitmer and Nessel fined Manke and stripped him of his license after he repeatedly refused to close his business in defiance of Whitmer’s executive orders. A Michigan Court of Appeals upheld that Manke’s license suspension was valid, but the Supreme Court decision reversed that. Manke was defiant after the Appeals Court ruling and told WILX, “I’m still open, still working until they cut my hands off.” Breitbart News caught up with Manke during the recent “Operation Haircut” protest. He said the response during the protest and the support for his stand was “overwhelming,” and called himself “a Michigan small town barber that just wants to work.” “This is an oppressive move on this governor’s part,” Manke said, observing that it “reflects almost a police state.” “I refuse to stand down on this,” he said. “I wasn’t this rock star three weeks ago,” Manke told Breitbart News, but Whitmer made him one. He thanked God for the development. “I’m still standing up. I still have that courage,” Manke said. Manke’s full speech at the protest was aired on The Kyle Olson Show:  Kyle Olson is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Chinese authorities are concealing information surrounding yet another outbreak of the Chinese coronavirus in northeastern Harbin, according to local residents who spoke with the Epoch Times. Residents told the Times that they knew of at least five people who have died of the coronavirus whose cases authorities have not disclosed publicly. One interviewee under treatment added that, at one hospital, there are around 30 patients who are yet to make a full recovery and remain in isolation. The statements contradict Chinese officials, who claim that the last coronavirus patient was discharged on May 16 from the hospital where he was being treated. “We are very anxious, but the doctors said they have no solutions,” patient Zhang Lng was quoted as saying. “They didn’t give us any medicine, and are hoping our bodies recover by ourselves.” The virus began spreading in the central Chinese city of Wuhan last year and spread across the country before infecting people around the world. Having been the first country to face the pandemic, Chinese health officials declared in April that they had largely defeated the virus and could begin returning to life as normal. However, there have been multiple reports of allegedly minor outbreaks spreading across several Chinese provinces, including Heilongjiang, of which Harbin is the capital. Communist officials appear eager to cover these up, presumably to strengthen the narrative that China was one of just a handful of countries to successfully manage and eradicate the virus. Last month, the Chinese Communist Party’s senior medical advisor warned that the country could face a second wave outbreak of infections due to a lack of immunity among the broader population. “The majority of … Chinese at the moment are still susceptible to the Covid-19 infection, because of a lack of immunity,” Zhong Nanshan, the Communist Party’s most prominent medical mouthpiece during the outbreak, told CNN. “We are facing a big challenge. It’s not better than the foreign countries I think at the moment.” China is widely understood to have covered up key information about the virus before it threatened the world, a decision that likely cost thousands of lives and enormous damage to the global economy. A recently leaked report compiled by the Five Eyes intelligence alliance determined that the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) turned a blind eye as Chinese authorities went about “disappearing” whistle-blowing doctors, censored information about the outbreak, destroyed samples of the virus in laboratories, and refused to hand over samples to international experts, thus delaying ongoing efforts to develop a cure or a vaccine for the virus.

During an interview with WTOP on Friday, White House Coronavirus Task Force member Dr. Anthony Fauci stated that the recent protests are “a perfect setup for further spread” of coronavirus and told people “if you can avoid the demonstration, if you can, fine. If you can’t, make sure you wear a mask.” Fauci responded to a question on what goes through his mind when he sees crowds gathering and people being hit with tear gas and other things that cause them to cough on each other by stating, “What runs through my mind is what does every time I hear about or see the congregation of large crowds at a time and in an area — a geographic area where clearly there is active infection transmission. It’s a perfect setup for further spread of the virus in the sense of creating these blips, which might turn into some surges. So, I get very concerned, as my colleagues in public health, when they see these kinds of crowds. I mean, obviously, not only are they congregating physically close to each other. But often, when they start screaming and demonstrating, which is part of the process of demonstrating, I’m not criticizing that, but I’m saying what it’s going to be leading to is a likelihood that you might have situations where you would force the spread of infection, and that’s really of concern.” Fauci declined to say that such a scenario is “likely. … But there certainly is a risk. I would say that with confidence, that when you have the congregation of crowds, as we’ve been seeing now. I mean, I’m here in Washington, D.C., and you look at the TV, and you see what’s going on, particularly, and the situation in which there is a lot of confusion and some — a little bit of chaos, people running back and forth, taking their masks off, being close in proximity. That absolutely poses a risk that there might be spread of infection.” He added that people have the right to demonstrate, “but it’s a delicate balance. Because the reasons for demonstrating are valid, and yet, the demonstration itself puts one at an additional risk. So, the only thing we can do as public health officials is to keep warning people, be careful. If you are going to go out, please make sure you wear a mask, and you keep the mask on at all times. Because I’ve seen, on TV, as the demonstrations start to heat up, people might take their masks off when they’re starting to yell and scream and demonstrate. Keep your mask on. First of all, if you can avoid the demonstration, if you can, fine. If you can’t, make sure you wear a mask.” (h/t Business Insider) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

The Las Vegas strip began to breathe new life on Thursday as some casinos started to reopen after 78 days without gambling because of the Chinese coronavirus lockdown. In the wee hours of Thursday, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported: Nevada casinos reopened for gaming at 12:01 am. Thursday, ushering in guests eager to try their luck 78 days after resorts were closed because of the COVID-19 [disease caused by the coronavirus] pandemic. Certain amenities, including buffets and shows, remain closed. Not all properties will reopen Thursday, and those that do will follow a new set of health and safety protocols. Guests can expect to see lots of plexiglass, masks, and social distancing reminders.    The Las Vegas casinos that opened their doors did so as part of Nevada’s phase two reopening process, which began May 29. Yahoo Finance noted: Led by the reopening of casinos held by Wynn Resorts, Caesars Entertainment, MGM Resorts, and Las Vegas Sands, Thursday marked a return to operations at many of Sin City’s most frequented attractions. Even MGM’s famed Bellagio’s fountains were roaring again to the tune of Elvis’ Viva Las Vegas. But as the coronavirus pandemic threat continues, analysts are warning that a total return to normalcy for gaming stocks might not be as quick as hoped. Despite a slow trickle back to booking activity, Morningstar senior equity analyst Dan Wasiolek estimates it could take until 2023 before Las Vegas revenues return to pre-COVID-19 levels.

Amazon has reversed its refusal to publish an e-book from author and former New York Times reporter Alex Berenson, a prominent critic of the ongoing Chinese virus lockdowns. The e-commerce giant chose to approve Berenson’s book following coverage from Breitbart News, as well as backlash from figures on social media including Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk. In its email to Berenson, Amazon initially informed the author that it would not be publishing the book. “Due to the rapidly changing nature of information around the COVID-19 virus, we are referring customers to official sources for health information about the virus. Please consider removing references to COVID-19 for this book,” said Amazon. Berenson told Breitbart News that his book, Unreported Truths About COVID-19 And Lockdowns Part 1: Introductions and Death Counts and Estimates, was merely “an introduction and a discussion of death coding, death counts, and who is really dying from COVID, as well as a worst-case estimate of deaths with no mitigation efforts.” “I briefly considered censorship but assumed I wouldn’t have a problem both because of my background, because anyone who reads the booklet will realize it is impeccably sourced, nary a conspiracy theory to be found, and frankly because Amazon shouldn’t be censoring anything that doesn’t explicitly help people commit criminal behavior.” Amazon spokeswoman Sarah Elison now says the book was removed in error, according to the Washington Post.  On Twitter, Musk called Amazon’s decision “insane” and called for the online retailer to be broken up, calling it a “monopoly.” Time to break up Amazon. Monopolies are wrong! — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 4, 2020  “I think Elon’s decision to highlight the censorship spurred Amazon to move quickly. It’s possible they would have backed down eventually, but his tweets made their position indefensible,” said Berenson.

NBC News’ Peter Alexander, a member of the White House Press Corps, shouted a question at President Donald Trump during a Rose Garden press conference on Friday morning: “How would a better economy have protected George Floyd?” The president held the conference to celebrate Friday’s unexpectedly good May jobs report, showing that the U.S. economy had added 2.5 million jobs, rather than losing some 8 million jobs, as expected. The unemployment rate fell to 13.3% rather than rising to 20%. After the president finished his remarks, he prepared to sign an extension to the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which the administration credited for much of the rebound in the jobs numbers. Trump said that a growing economy was “the greatest thing that can happen for race relations.” Shortly thereafter, NBC’s Alexander shouted his question: “”How would a better economy have protected George Floyd?” Floyd was killed by police on Memorial Day, after he was arrested for allegedly trying to use a counterfeit $20 bill. He had lost his job due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Chicago Tribune noted: Before he died after being pinned for minutes beneath a Minneapolis police officer’s knee, George Floyd was suffering the same fate as millions of Americans during the coronavirus pandemic: out of work and looking for a new job. Floyd moved to Minneapolis from his native Houston several years ago in hopes of finding work and starting a new life, said Christopher Harris, Floyd’s lifelong friend. But he lost his job as a bouncer at a restaurant when Minnesota’s governor issued a stay-at-home order.
… Harris said Floyd was laid off when Minnesota shut down restaurants as part of a stay-at-home order. He said he spoke with Floyd on Sunday night and gave him some information for contacting a temporary jobs agency. The president did not take that question, or any other. An undated photo provided to the Associated Press by a friend of Floyd’s showed him at work as a security guard: This undated file photo provided by Christopher Harris shows George Floyd. Floyd died May 25, after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck until he stopped breathing. (Christopher Harris via AP, File) Many of the new jobs consisted of people returning to their workplaces after temporary layoffs due to the pandemic. Black unemployment remained steady in May, despite improvements for whites and Hispanics. Joel B.

Catholic League president Bill Donohue slammed New York mayor Bill de Blasio Friday for his irrational coronavirus lockdown rules and anti-religious animus. Dr. Donohue underscored the arbitrary nature of de Blasio’s provisions on what is allowed and not allowed in New York City during coronavirus. While the mayor has severely curtailed religious practice in the city, he has defended the rights of citizens to form huge gatherings to protest, even violently, and obviously without social distancing or masks (except perhaps antifa masks). “What if, instead of protesting, a very small group of people want to go to a church, synagogue, mosque, or temple?” Donohue asked. “They don’t want to protest, just pray. They pledge to stay six feet apart. They promise not to engage in violence. Can they do so? No.” When a reporter for a Jewish newspaper called out the mayor for the irony of allowing throngs to take to the streets in a mass assembly, but denying permission for a small church service, he got indignant, Donohue notes. “Four hundred years of American racism, I’m sorry, that is not the same question as the understandably aggrieved store owner or the devout religious person who wants to go back to services,” de Blasio replied. The upshot, Donohue writes, is that de Blasio has decided to “privilege” protesters, many of whom are well-off white folks, “all because he thinks that protesting racism justifies jettisoning his shutdown.” The hypocrisy grows even thicker because of the mayor’s own, well-known racism, Donohue notes, since he has adopted racial quotas, repeatedly promoting policies that discriminate against Asian Americans by denying them seats in New York’s public schools. De Blasio has also denied black and Hispanic parents the advantages of school choice, quashing the opportunities for charter schools and other avenues toward educational advancement. Perhaps most disturbing, however, is the mayor’s hostility toward religious faith. “This is a man who raised money for the communists in Nicaragua when he was young, and traveled, illegally, to Castro’s Cuba for his honeymoon, lying to his own children about where it took place,” Donohue writes. The mayor also boycotted the St. Patrick’s Day Parade for years and recently lashed out at Rev. Franklin Graham “because the minister thinks marriage should be between a man and a woman.” “This is the profile of an extremist,” Donohue concludes. “He throws the health of New Yorkers overboard to allow for a jammed protest he likes, and then invokes his health edict to ban people of faith from attending their house of worship.” Follow @tdwilliamsrome

The Supreme leader of Afghan terror group the Taliban may have recently died from the coronavirus, Afghanistan’s Khaama Press reported on Tuesday, citing information from a report by the American magazine Foreign Policy. According to the report, sources with knowledge of development within the Taliban’s ranks confirmed to Foreign Policy that the jihadi leader Mullah Hibatullah Akhundzada tested positive for coronavirus. The acting director of the Taliban’s military operations, Mawlavi Mohammad Ali Jan Ahmad, told the magazine Akhundzada is “sick but is recovering.” Khaama Press points out that at least three other Taliban figures told Foreign Policy under the condition of anonymity that Akhundzada died while receiving treatment for coronavirus symptoms. The Taliban has refused to officially comment on its leader’s health status so far. According to Khaama Press, recent unconfirmed reports indicate that Mullah Yaqoob, the son of the Taliban’s late founder, Mullah Mohammad Omar, has been appointed as the interim leader of the Taliban, further strengthening support of the claims that Akhundzada has died. Reports last month indicated that Mullah Yaqoob had been appointed as the Taliban’s military chief following a reorganization of the terrorist group’s leadership, suggesting Yaqoob was already primed to assume a top role. News of the Taliban leadership shuffle comes shortly after the Afghan government released hundreds of Taliban prisoners last week in response to a reportedly unexpected ceasefire called by the Taliban during the Islamic holiday weekend known as Eid al-Fitr at the end of May. On May 26, the Afghan government said it planned to release 900 Taliban prisoners in the following days. The Afghan government says it expects the Taliban to reciprocate by releasing members of Afghan security forces currently detained by the terrorist group. The prisoner exchange was proposed in February by the U.S. as a way to build goodwill between the two sides; the Taliban refuses to recognize Afganistan’s government as legitimate, claiming it is the country’s true ruler. This has lead to repeated breakdowns in peace talks set up by foreign supporters of a peaceful Afghanistan, such as the U.S.

Zimbabwe police arrested 1,312 people nationwide on Tuesday for violating coronavirus quarantine measures as authorities reinforce lockdown restrictions, Zimbabwe’s state-owned newspaper The Herald reported on Thursday. National police spokesman Paul Nyathi confirmed Tuesday’s arrests to the newspaper. Security officials cited a “growing laxity” in people’s adherence to restrictions on movement as the main reason for the high number of arrests over the 24-hour period. Since March 31, law enforcement officials in Zimbabwe have arrested a total of 52,041 people for violating quarantine measures. According to the report, Zimbabwe police said they are making “special efforts” to track down escapees from coronavirus quarantine centers, a growing problem in the country that poses a major public health risk. On May 29, Zimbabwe police said they were “hunting down” over 100 people who escaped quarantine centers, which the national health minister referred to as “our source of danger” when describing the breakouts at the time. On Thursday, authorities said 158 people had escaped from quarantine and police had tracked down and arrested 26 of them. Police have also been cracking down on people entering the country illegally and said they had arrested 97 “border jumpers.” Zimbabwe requires people returning from abroad to enter a 21-day quarantine period at state-run quarantine centers to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Nearly all of Zimbabwe’s new coronavirus cases last week were linked to these quarantine centers. They reportedly hold hundreds of people returning to the country from abroad, sometimes involuntarily. Most of Zimbabwe’s returning travelers left the country seeking work in neighboring South Africa, the regional economic hub, or in Botswana, with which it also shares a border. “The total number of escapees from various quarantine centers in provinces across the country is now 158,” Nyathi said on Thursday. “Escapees who have been arrested are now 26 following the arrest of a 40-year-old woman who absconded from Vuti Quarantine Center in Mashonaland West. Since May 16, police have arrested 97 border jumpers and smugglers.” “We continue to urge the public to be health and security conscious and assist the police and other security services in the maintenance of law and order,” Nyathi added. On Tuesday, Zimbabwe’s government ordered troops and police to reinforce coronavirus lockdown measures in the capital, Harare, amid a recent surge in coronavirus infections which had “more than tripled” to 203 as of June 2, according to national health authorities.

The unemployment rate fell to 13.3 percent and payrolls unexpectedly rose by 2.5 million workers as the easing of restrictions on business activity and government aid led to new hiring in May. The U.S. unemployment rate fell below last month’s record-high 14.7 percent, which was the highest on record in data going back to 1948. Economists estimate that the unemployment rate reached 25 percent during the Great Depression, although that predated the scientific economy-wide record keeping the government now deploys. The job gains mark a sudden turnaround from a month earlier, when the economy shed a staggering 20.5 million jobs, by far the worst monthly decline on records back to 1939. Economists had expected the unemployment rate to rise to nearly 20 percent and the economy to shed an additional 8 million jobs. The mandatory closures of many businesses and stay-at-home orders slammed what had been a very healthy labor market hard. The economy added jobs for 113 straight weeks through February, a record streak of growth. The unemployment rate was 3.5 percent in February. And yet job creation was running very hot, with the economy adding an average of 211,000 new jobs each month. The government has undertaken unprecedented efforts to support employment and provide aid to those who have lost their jobs. Around 150 million taxpayers received stimulus payments of up to $1200 for adults in their household plus additional amounts for children. The Treasury’s Paycheck Protection Program is backing $669 billion of loans to small businesses that can be forgiven if borrowers do not lay off workers. The federal government has been providing an additional $600 on top of state unemployment benefits, paying some Americans more than they earned on the job. Recent data suggest the labor market has been stabilizing and is now improving. The number of people applying for unemployment benefits has declined every week since hitting a record high 6.8 million in March. Last week, this number fell to around 1.8 million. Over 40 million new claims have been made for unemployment since the wave but ongoing claims are just over 20 million, indicating many Americans have been rehired after losing jobs. In May, employment in leisure and hospitality jumped by 1.2 million after falling by 7.5 million in April and 743,000 in March. Bars and restaurants hired an additional 1.4 million workers following a combined 6.1 million in job losses in April and March. Construction employment jumped by 464,000 in May, gaining back almost half of April’s decline. Dentist offices added 245,000 jobs. Health care employment overall rose by 312,00. Retail shops added  368,000 jobs in May, after a loss of 2.3 million inApril. Over-the-month job gains occurred in clothing and clothing accessories stores were 95,000. Auto dealers added 85,000. General merchandise stores added 84,000. Manufacturers added 225,000 jobs, about evenly split between the durable and nondurable goods components. Twenty-eight thousand of those were in auto making plants.

“When the facts change,” said 20th-century economist John Maynard Keynes, “I change my mind.” State governors and public health officials should follow this example in light of recent CDC data showing that Covid-19 is much less deadly than originally thought. The CDC recently revised its death rate estimate down to just 0.4 percent. And for many demographics, it is far less than that. Public officials should pivot from “flattening the curve” to “flattening the fear.” The data demonstrate that younger and otherwise healthy Americans face little risk of dying from this disease. Most people should immediately get back to living their daily lives without fear, boosting our beleaguered economy. One percent of counties in the country account for more than half of all Covid deaths. Ten percent of counties account for more than 90 percent of all deaths. Nearly half of the counties in the country haven’t experienced a single coronavirus death. Yet safe counties are often beholden to state reopening timelines based on conditions in major cities where Covid is often far more prevalent. Keeping these areas that have been relatively untouched by the coronavirus closed for business is a violation of residents’ basic civil liberties and is unnecessarily contributing to our dire economic situation. According to a recent analysis by Avik Roy at Forbes, 42 percent of all coronavirus deaths have come in nursing homes. In many states, nursing homes and assisted living facilities account for far more than half of all deaths—81 percent in Minnesota and 70 percent in Ohio. If governments pursued a tailored Covid response moving forward, protecting nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and the most vulnerable, we could dramatically reduce the Covid death rate while letting the vast majority of Americans resume something akin to a normal life. We can isolate the few to protect the many instead of isolating the many to protect the few. Like location, age is also a strong risk indicator. According to the most recent CDC data, more than 80 percent of all Covid deaths are among those over 65 years old. Those aged under 55 account for just seven percent of all Covid deaths. And the overwhelming majority of deaths are among those with at least one other underlying medical condition. It’s irrational for young and healthy people to live in fear of this disease. The original intent of flattening the curve was to not overwhelm our healthcare system. By working together, we have accomplished this goal. With this accomplished, government officials, business leaders, and the media must now flatten the fear—the consequences of which are just as dire as the disease. Our nation is paralyzed because people are paralyzed by fear. Over the last ten weeks, more than 40 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits, and one-third of small businesses won’t reopen. These numbers represent real people with lost paychecks and shattered dreams. Economic consequences breed societal problems. Alcohol and drug abuse have skyrocketed, with hard liquor sales up by about 75 percent. Prescriptions for anti-anxiety medication are up by about one-third. Community experts worry about associated spikes in domestic violence and suicides. The national Disaster Distress Helpline saw a 338 percent increase in call volume in March compared with February. Suicide rates generally rise by about one percent for every one percentage point increase in unemployment. Patients are avoiding necessary care due to unnecessary hospital restrictions against seeing non-emergency patients. Oncologists, who treat cancer patients, have recently seen their patient counts fall by nearly half. Sadly, we will have more victims of Covid who never had the virus. Extending stay-at-home orders could cause “irreparable damage,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the lead member of the White House coronavirus task force, on May 22nd. “I don’t want people to think that any of us feel that staying locked down for a prolonged period of time is the way to go.” The facts are in. Covid poses a low risk to ordinary Americans, yet Covid fear poses an enormous risk to our society. Flattening the fear will not only save lives and livelihoods but help prevent the unraveling of the fabric of American life. Alfredo Ortiz is the president and CEO of the Job Creators Network. C.L.

TEL AVIV – Eighty-seven schools around Israel have closed over coronavirus cases and nearly 10,000 students and staff members are in quarantine.  Of those, 300 people have been diagnosed to be sick with the virus, the Education Ministry said. The development comes amid an uptick in cases that began last week with 115 new infections in a 24-hour period – the highest in a month. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday announced “any school where a virus case is diagnosed will close.” the Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement. In addition, foreigners on their post-high school gap year, including yeshiva and seminary students, will no longer be permitted to enter the country, Interior Minister Arye Deri announced. The statement from Netanyahu’s officer said the prime minister had “directed Education Minister Galant to work on achieving solutions for protection and distancing for pupils and teaching staff. Cases that are found will continue to be dealt with. The Prime Minister instructed that the situation be monitored and assessed.” Gallant maintained the current infection rates do not justify shutting all schools down and added that doing so constituted “an irresponsible blow to students, parents and teachers.” Israel had 17,429 confirmed cases and 291 deaths as of Thursday morning.

On Thursday’s broadcast of CNBC’s “Mad Money,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) touted the Heroes Act and said that “If we want to open up the economy, and we all do, we need to defeat the virus, and that’s testing, tracing, treatment, and isolation.” Pelosi said, “Well, first of all, let me just say that the Heroes Act is an answer, in many ways, to the challenge that our economy faces. If we want to open up the economy, and we all do, we need to defeat the virus, and that’s testing, tracing, treatment, and isolation. And we don’t have a vaccine and we don’t have a cure, but we do have a method to defeat the vaccine – excuse me, the virus. And we have to do that. So, that’s one way to open the economy.” She continued, “The other way is to honor our heroes. Let’s keep these people working. The money that we’re putting into state and local governments to pay our healthcare workers, our first responders, our sanitation, transportation, teachers, and the rest are keeping people working. Otherwise, the states will have to fire some and raise taxes or some combination thereof. So, this is about the economy. It’s about stimulus. And the third is putting money in people’s pockets.” Pelosi later added that she wants to see money spent “to bolster the working families in America who have lost their jobs because of no fault of their own, whom [the] virus is debilitating in terms of getting the economy moving again, until we test, trace, treat, and isolate, as we wear our masks.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

Riots erupted in Western Mexico where protesters set fire to one police officer and physically clashed with several others. Rioters also set fire to multiple police vehicles. The incidents were not over the BLM protests in America, but to protest the death of a local day laborer who was allegedly killed by police for not wearing a coronavirus mask. The riots began on Thursday evening in Guadalajara, Jalisco, when hundreds of protesters took to the streets demanding justice over the death of Alejandro Giovanni Lopez at the hands of local police officers in May.

While state officials did not reveal the violation behind the arrest, relatives claim it was for not wearing a coronavirus facemask. Police officers are believed to have beaten and tortured Lopez until he eventually died. One of Lopez’s relatives took a video of the arrest and shared it on social media where the police officers can be seen striking the day laborer.

During the week, the case gained national attention in Mexico and even Oscar-winning director Guillermo Del Toro took to social media to demand justice and to invite the public to protest. @FiscaliaJal @EnriqueAlfaroR @CNDH @FGRMexico A mas de un mes, no hay respuestas, no hay arrestos.

Amazon failed to protect its employees from the coronavirus at a New York warehouse facility, according to a lawsuit filed by three employees from the warehouse. AFP reported that the complaint filed in federal court Wednesday said the “relentless pace of work at Amazon facilities” led to poor working conditions and that company policies “discourage workers from leaving their workstations to wash their hands and from taking the time to wipe down their workstations.” The legal action comes after one employee from Amazon’s Staten Island, New York, facility was fired for speaking out about the company’s response to the coronavirus. Amazon, however, claimed the employee was disobeying protocol about what to do in the pandemic. One of the three workers in the suit claimed they caught coronavirus “from workers who were explicitly or implicitly encouraged to continue attending work and prevented from adequately washing their hands or sanitizing their workstations,” according to the lawsuit. The three workers and their families are seeking a number of changes, including a more transparent leave and sick time policy, better contact tracing for infected workers, and back pay for quarantine leave. The complaint alleges that Amazon continued to allow workers on the job even after they made contact with infected individuals. Amazon, which received high praise during the early part of the pandemic for hiring 175,000 additional employees to deal with increased demand, says it has improved its health and safety at its facilities. “We are saddened by the tragic impact COVID-19 has had on communities across the globe, including on some Amazon team members and their family and friends. From early March to May 1, we offered our employees unlimited time away from work, and since May 1 we have offered leave for those most vulnerable or who need to care for children or family members,” a spokesperson for the tech giant said in a statement. “We also invested $4 billion from April to June on COVID-related initiatives,” the statement continued, “including over $800 million in the first half of this year on safety measures like temperature checks, masks, gloves, enhanced cleaning and sanitization, extended pay and benefits options, testing, and more. This includes two weeks paid leave for any COVID diagnosis or quarantine, and launching a $25 million fund to support our partners and contractors.” But Amazon has had trouble putting its money where its mouth is. The company recently ended hazard pay for its warehouse workers instituted after the outbreak of the coronavirus while Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos had a net worth increase of $32 billion since January. The company’s record on censorship has also led much to be desired. Amazon recently banned a book about the coronavirus from lockdown critic Alex Berenson after Bezos and company suggested that he, “Please consider removing references to COVID-19 for this book.” When Berenson refused, they banned his book from being featured on Amazon’s Kindle Direct Service.

Beijing’s decision to hide the severity of the novel coronavirus during the early stages of the outbreak, a move that allowed the disease to spill over to other countries, has rendered communist China an “existential threat” to the globe, a survivor of the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre proclaimed on Wednesday. China is the birthplace of the lethal and highly contagious Chinese coronavirus. Referring to China’s coronavirus “cover-up” during a Tiananmen remembrance event online on Wednesday hosted by Students for a Free Tibet, Fengsuo Zhou, a survivor of the massacre and founder of Humanitarian China, declared, “With this communist party in power, the world is doom to repeat such a disaster.” “This totalitarian regime, its globalization, and digital power, it cannot coexist with the universal values we love,” he added.  “Today’s China, under the CCP [Chinese Communist Party], it has become an existential threat to the world because there’s a pandemic we are all suffering from all over the world,” the Tiananmen massacre survivor explained. “This was because of a cover-up because there’s no freedom of people who can talk. There’s no way.” His comments came on the eve of the 31st anniversary of the incident in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square in which Chinese communist troops thwarted student-led protests in a bloody crackdown on June 4 and 5, 1989. Demonstrators were calling for democracy, free speech, and a free press, among other things. Although there is no official count, as the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has endeavored to keep precise information about the incident a secret, estimates place the number of casualties in the thousands. Alluding to China’s muzzling of whistleblower doctors who did not toe the CCP line of keeping silent about COVID-19, Zhou noted during the event on Wednesday: Even the doctors, for example, very early [in the coronavirus outbreak], end of last year, Dr. Li Wenliang, discovered that this was striking like SARS [Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome]. He raised alarms to his internal circle — his friends, and family – warning them and he was censored. Later he died of it, months later, and that’s why it spread to so many people and now. So many killed and so many infected. Health officials have named the coronavirus itself SARS CoV-2. The Trump administration has lambasted Beijing for allowing the lethal and highly contagious novel coronavirus to spread by mismanaging its response and covering up the extent of the outbreak during its early stages, with the help of the China-influenced World Health Organization (W.H.O.), a United Nations entity. U.S. intelligence and independent assessments have determined that China did cover up the severity of the coronavirus. Beijing reportedly muzzled and jailed whistleblowers and critics in a move that allowed the disease to spread and ravage other countries. Both China, the birthplace of the novel coronavirus, and the W.H.O. have denied the assertions. In late May, Trump announced he was severing ties with the W.H.O., ending U.S. taxpayer-funded aid to the U.N. agency for not doing enough to stop the spread of the virus. America is the agency’s top source of funding. The Trump administration has also taken action to prevent China from stealing research for vaccines and treatments to combat the Chinese coronavirus.

Chinese dissidents and human rights advocates gathered online Wednesday evening for a candlelight vigil to remember those killed during the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, urging the world not to look away or tolerate communist China’s crimes. The Victims of Communism Memorial Fund, a human rights organization dedicated to carrying the memory of those afflicted by left-wing totalitarianism, organized and broadcast the event. Given ongoing Chinese coronavirus social distancing measures, speakers “attended” the event from separate locations. The event occurred in the shadow of vandals, acting amid a nationwide wave of radical leftist violence, defacing Washington, DC’s, Victims of Communism memorial – a statue of the “Goddess of Liberty,” which Tiananmen protesters hoisted in the square before the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) rolled its tanks in.  In addition to discussing the lasting legacy of the pro-democracy advocates killed on June 4, 1989, in Beijing, the speakers noted that the communist policies that led to the complete erasure of the Tiananmen Square massacre from the Chinese internet, Chinese history books, and the Chinese public memory in the country are behind the obfuscation that resulted in extended delays in alerting the world to the potential threat of the newly discovered coronavirus in Wuhan, China. “Unfortunately, the evil regime of the Chinese Communist Party [CCP] is still raging on the land of China, and it is still using brutal and cruel methods to suppress and persecute the Chinese people,” Chen Guangcheng, a Chinese human rights attorney and former political prisoner, said at the vigil. “Not only we must not forget the CCP’s June 4th massacre, but we must also record each and every crime that the CCP has done to persecute the Chinese people over the past 30 years, and be prepared to hold them accountable.” “The appeasement policy must come to an end,” he added. Chen made the case that the communist regime’s “existence poses great threats to the freedom, security, and health of the people around the world. … in short, if the CCP evil regime is not destroyed, the world would not have real security and freedom.” “When a regime runs roughshod on its own people, it will sooner or later bring disasters beyond its border in one way or another,” Jianli Yang, the founder and president of Citizen Power Initiatives for China, said at the event, making the argument that an appropriated outraged global responses to the Tiananmen massacre would have prevented an emboldened China from deceiving the world on the coronavirus pandemic. “It is a well-established fact that if, when the coronavirus first broke out in Wuhan, there had been any space in society and government to sound the alarm – if the government had not suppressed the truth and misled the world – hundreds of thousands of lives would have been saved,” Yang said. “By the same token, if the Chinese communist regime, instead of slaughtering the Tiananmen protesters, had accepted their request of political reform, the world would not have been plunged into the catastrophe we are experiencing today.” Leaked Chinese documents show that the first diagnosed cases of novel coronavirus in Wuhan were identified in November 2019. China did not make public the discovery of a new virus until January, and multiple reports have revealed evidence that Beijing pressured the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) to hide evidence that the virus was transmissible from person to person. Pastor Bob Fu, the head of the Christian human rights organization China Aid, asserted that Beijing is using “the same pattern of lying, covering up, and afflicting so many millions of lives” in its response to the pandemic as it did with the crackdown in 1989. The Chinese Communist Party has been claiming [throughout] the past 31 years that nobody had been killed in Tiananmen Square, so they are good at telling lies and covering up,” Fu said. “A year ago, the Chinese communist regime unleashed this coronavirus, the Communist Party virus, to not only afflict millions of Chinese, but still afflicting millions, hundreds of millions of citizens around the globe.” “Because of that, millions of American children and throughout the world are not able to go to school. Millions of moms cannot send their children, cannot bring their children to churches, the synagogues, to mosques. This is a crime against humanity,” he affirmed. The Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation concluded the event by offering in absentia its Human Rights Award to Chen Qiushi, a citizen journalist who disappeared, likely detained by Chinese political police, while attempting to report on the reality in Wuhan at the height of the outbreak there. Participants then all lit candles in their homes in honor of those who died fighting for basic human dignity 31 years ago. Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.

On Thursday morning, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer told protesters to wear a mask and stay six feet apart. Later in the day, she appeared to violate her own rules. “I encourage everyone who is protesting, if you are out demonstrating or out congregating at all, please wear a mask and please try to stay six feet away from others,” she said on Mojo In The Morning. Whitmer, who is angling to be Joe Biden’s vice presidential running mate, participated in a protest in downtown Detroit over the death of George Floyd. She marched along as the closely packed large group chanted, “Hands up, don’t shoot,” and “This is what democracy looks like.” Whitmer, wearing a cloth mask, was standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Bishop Charles Ellis and Lt. Gov. Garland Gilchrist. VIDEO: Hundreds marching today in a walk to honor the life of George Floyd.

Tiffany Brown claimed the “unity march” didn’t violate Whitmer’s latest order because it states, “Nothing in this order shall be taken to abridge protections guaranteed by the state or federal constitution.” “That includes the right to peaceful protest,” she said.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer told radio show Mojo In The Morning on Thursday that she understands the “Defund Police” sentiment being pushed on social media by young people in the wake of George Floyd’s death. “What would the world be like without police?” Whitmer was asked by one of the hosts.  “I understand the frustration and the sentiment,” the governor responded, adding that “the youth of our country are going to take up the lead soon,” but that she’s “concerned about the sweeping observations people have.” The hosts noted U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) shared similar anti-police views on Twitter, such as this that she retweeted: Trump has given a green light to cops and militias to beat, maim and kill people with impunity.  He has now illegally activated the military to maintain power and use force on civilians. The red line has been crossed too many times.  He must resign.  Our lives depend on it. pic.twitter.com/DLmBwHKgfU — Movement 4 Black Lives (@Mvmnt4BlkLives) June 2, 2020  Whitmer touted quotas in the Michigan State Police, saying she has created an “equity and inclusion office,” which will increase minority applicants to “at least” 25 percent and the female trooper pool by 20 percent. As the appearance concluded, the governor was confronted by a caller who said he was “insulted” when Whitmer told residents that they should “Google” how to cut their own hair amid the ongoing lockdown of the state. He told her 49 other states are allowing salon services, a stat she disputed. “I made an off-hand comment about if you needed a trim you could Google it,” Whitmer said. She said barbers and stylists are “professionals.” “If my comment offended people, I do apologize for that. It certainly wasn’t my intent.” The caller also asked Whitmer what data she is looking at to inform her decisions. She didn’t answer that question. Kyle Olson is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) on Thursday said he is hoping to “get to ‘yes'” on having the Sunshine State host the Republican National Convention in August. “But to just rule out a convention at this stage, I think, is a mistake,” DeSantis said during a Thursday appearance on Fox & Friends. “So we’ve said we want to get to ‘yes’ on it, and I think you’ll be able to do it.” “We understand that there’s a virus. What can we do to be able to have activity in a way that’s safe?” the governor, who is moving the bulk of the state to stage two of reopening on Friday, told the network. “To just say no to everything, I don’t think is going to work. So we want to be able to do it, and I think we could do it in a safe way,” he added, urging officials to “be creative”: The last thing you would want is [for] delegates [to] go and end up getting ill … but I think that there’s probably ways we can do it. So, ‘We want to get to yes on it’ has basically been my message. Let’s be creative, and let’s figure out a way to do it. President Trump on Tuesday announced that he is in search of a different place to host the upcoming Republican National Convention — an announcement that followed North Carolina officials failing to guarantee that the convention would be able to proceed in Charlotte as planned due to coronavirus-related concerns: Had long planned to have the Republican National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, a place I love.

The convention is slated to take place August 24-27.

No new cases of the novel coronavirus have been reported among those who flocked to the Lake of the Ozarks over Memorial Day weekend, a top Missouri health official revealed on Wednesday. “The answer, to our knowledge, is no,” Dr. Randall Williams, Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, said on Wednesday when asked if there were emerging cases stemming from the crowded weekend. Concerns escalated after throngs of partygoers flocked to the Lake of the Ozarks, ignoring both social distancing guidelines and the broader call to avoid large crowds. One of the attendees, who reportedly visited various bars, restaurants, and an outdoor swimming pool, later tested positive for the virus and may have been contagious during the getaway: No covid concerns at the lake of the ozarks😳 #loto pic.twitter.com/Yrb4UNM64u — Scott Pasmore (@scottpasmoretv) May 24, 2020  Positive COVID-19 patient was at crowded Lake of the Ozarks bars over Memorial Day weekend https://t.co/L5AASU2YBR — KMOV (@KMOV) May 29, 2020  At the time, the St. Louis Metropolitan Pandemic Task Force warned that the crowds could cause “needless suffering and potential strain to our health care systems.” “Without a doubt, this type of activity, this type of behavior increases the risk of transmission, which means it can only go in one direction,” Dr. Alex Garza said at the time. St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson also sharply criticized the crowds, deeming their actions “irresponsible and dangerous.” Despite that — and the lack of adherence to guidelines, no new cases stemming from the Lake of the Ozarks partiers have been reported. According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, during Wednesday’s press conference, officials also detailed the overall decrease in positive cases and the “big drop in the number of hospitalizations from COVID-19.” “Our hospitals are not overwhelmed. Our positivity rate continues to decline. People are recovering, and we are moving forward,” Gov. Mike Parson (R) said. The revelation comes as protests, sparked by the death of George Floyd, broke out in the streets after weeks of lockdown orders and social distancing guidelines, which warn against large gatherings. “We don’t know what will happen to these numbers after we see the results of lots of people being together in very large groups during the demonstrations and protests,” Mayor Krewson said, signaling concern. “Some folks were wearing masks, some folks weren’t. But certainly, folks were not social distancing,” she added. “So we’ll see — fingers crossed — let’s hope that doesn’t result in a big bump up.” “As far as whether hospitals are able to breathe a sigh of relief after Memorial Day gatherings, Garza said officials ‘will give it a couple more days,'” the Dispatch added.

A person with knowledge of the situation says the NBA’s Board of Governors has approved a 22-team format for restarting the league season in late July at the Disney campus near Orlando, Florida. The format calls for each team playing eight games to determine playoff seeding plus the possible utilization of a play-in tournament for the final spot in the Eastern Conference and Western Conference postseason fields, said the person who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Thursday because the league had not yet revealed the vote result publicly. It is the most significant step yet in the process of trying to resume a season that was suspended nearly three months ago because of the coronavirus pandemic. There are numerous other details for the league to continue working through — including finalizing specifics of what the testing plan will be once teams arrive next month at the ESPN Wide World Of Sports complex and the calculating the financial ramifications of playing a shortened regular season. Another person, also speaking to AP on condition of anonymity because the details of the ongoing talks have not been publicly released, said the National Basketball Players Association and the NBA are continuing to work on a “lengthy” medical protocols document. The details of that document will be shared with teams once those discussions are completed, said the person, who added that teams should receive them in plenty of time for them to prepare for expected mid-July arrivals at the Disney-ESPN complex. If all 22 teams that are going to Disney play their allotted eight games before the postseason begins, the NBA would play 1,059 games in this regular season. That means 171 regular season games would be canceled, which could cost players around $600 million in salary. Those 22 clubs would play somewhere between 71 and 75 regular season games if the Disney portion of the schedule is completed, down from the customary 82-game slate. The teams who didn’t qualify for the restart will see their seasons end after having played somewhere between 64 and 67 games. But one of the biggest hurdles is now cleared, and if things go according to plan an NBA champion for a season unlike any other will be crowned in October. The season could go into that month if the league goes ahead with its plan for the same playoff rules as usual, that being every round utilizing a best-of-seven format. Thursday’s move by the board of governors — one that came, coincidentally, on the same day this season’s NBA Finals would have started if these were normal times — was largely a formality. The NBA considered countless restart options after suspending the season on March 11, whittled that list down to four possibilities last week and from there the 22-team plan quickly began gaining momentum. The 22-team plan includes all teams that were holding playoff spots when the season was stopped, plus all other clubs within six games of a postseason berth. Milwaukee, the Los Angeles Lakers, Boston and reigning NBA champion Toronto had already clinched playoff berths. Now with only eight games remaining for each team, it means that eight other clubs — Miami, Indiana, Philadelphia, the Los Angeles Clippers, Denver, Utah, Oklahoma City and Houston — have postseason spots secured, and Dallas virtually has one as well. That leaves nine teams vying for three remaining playoff berths. In the East, Brooklyn, Orlando and Washington are in the race for two spots. In the West, Memphis, Portland, New Orleans, Sacramento, San Antonio and Phoenix will jostle for one spot. If the gap between eighth place and ninth place in either conference is four games or less when the shortened regular season ends, those teams will go head-to-head for the No. 8 seed. The team in ninth place would have to go 2-0 in a two-game series to win the berth; otherwise, the No. 8 seed would advance to the postseason. Thursday’s decision also means that the seasons for Atlanta, Cleveland, New York, Golden State, Minnesota, Detroit, Chicago and Charlotte are over. The Knicks will miss the playoffs for the seventh consecutive season, the third-longest current drought in the league behind Sacramento and Phoenix — who still have chances of getting into the playoffs this season. And with the Hawks not moving on, it also means Vince Carter has almost certainly played the final game of his 22-year NBA career — the longest in league history. Carter, the first player in NBA history to appear in four different decades, has steadfastly insisted that he is retiring after this season. He appeared in 1,541 NBA games, behind only Robert Parish (1,611) and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (1,560) on the league’s all-time list.

The vast majority of counties in Florida are moving into the next stage of reopening on Friday, Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) announced on Wednesday. Almost the entire state will be moving into the second phase of reopening after a month in phase one. Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach, which were hit particularly hard by the novel coronavirus, will be excluded. However, they can seek approval to enter into the second phase of reopening with a letter from the county mayor or administrator. DeSantis explained on Wednesday: We started with phase one about a month ago but we only did the 64 counties, excluding the three large southeast Florida counties and the reason why we did that was those southeast Florida counties represented I think at that time about 60 percent of all the cases hospitalizations and fatalities, they still represent the bulk of those. The governor already eased some of the restrictions lifted in phase two, allowing salons and barbershops to operate at a limited capacity. Nonetheless, phase two allows bars and pubs to operate at a 50 percent capacity inside and full capacity outside, and restaurants will be able to offer top-bar seating. Phase two also allows retail stores and gyms to operate at full capacity while maintaining sanitization and social distancing guidelines. Entertainment businesses are also permitted to operate at 50 percent capacity. That includes movie theaters, bowling alleys, concert houses, playhouses, and auditoriums. People are still encouraged to avoid gatherings of more than 50, and DeSantis’s administration advises that employees of nursing homes and long-term care facilities undergo coronavirus testing “on a routine basis”: pic.twitter.com/jJRHYVjLFx — Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) June 3, 2020  pic.twitter.com/lrbjQE1uhZ — Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) June 3, 2020  pic.twitter.com/jjGNSTcFyC — Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) June 3, 2020  For more information on Phase 2 in Florida, see the full presentation here: https://t.co/OhtQbk99Vk pic.twitter.com/W7z98lgkil — Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) June 3, 2020  Florida, which has a population of over 21 million, had 60,183 total coronavirus cases and 2,607 related deaths, according to the Florida Department of Health’s numbers on Thursday.

Amazon, the world’s dominant online distributor of books and e-books, censored a book about the Chinese virus from lockdown critic and former New York Times reporter Alex Berenson. Jeff Bezos and company gave Berenson a suggestion on how to adjust his approach: “Please consider removing references to COVID-19 for this book.” After widespread criticism of the company, Amazon reversed its decision and has agreed to publish Berenson’s e-book. Berenson’s book, titled Unreported Truths About COVID-19 And Lockdowns Part 1: Introductions and Death Counts and Estimates, was to be the first in a series of short e-books about the coronavirus. The author planned to publish via Amazons’ Kindle Direct service, which allows authors to self-publish electronic books. But Amazon said no. In an email from Amazon that the author published on Twitter, the online retail giant informed the author that the book “does not comply with our guidelines,” and that Amazon customers are being referred to “official sources” about the virus. “Due to the rapidly changing nature of information around the COVID-19 virus, we are referring customers to official sources for health information about the virus. Please consider removing references to COVID-19 for this book.” Oh fuck me. I can’t believe it. They censored it. pic.twitter.com/GfPEr7OiV2 — Alex Berenson (@AlexBerenson) June 4, 2020  Berenson is well-known for his 2019 book Tell Your Children: The Truth About Marijuana, Mental Illness and Violence, which challenged the prevailing liberal orthodoxy that cannabis has little to no harmful effects. Berenson’s book argued that the drug is in fact linked to mental illness and violence. In comments to Breitbart News, Berenson explained the topic of his now-censored e-book on the coronavirus, calling it “An introduction and a discussion of death coding, death counts, and who is really dying from COVID, as well as a worst-case estimate of deaths with no mitigation efforts.” Berenson added, “I briefly considered censorship but assumed I wouldn’t have a problem both because of my background, because anyone who reads the booklet will realize it is impeccably sourced, nary a conspiracy theory to be found, and frankly because Amazon shouldn’t be censoring anything that doesn’t explicitly help people commit criminal behavior. (Books intended to help adults groom children for sexual relationships, for example, should be off-limits – though about 10 years ago Amazon did not agree and only backed down from selling a how-to guide for pedophiles in the face of public outrage.)” “I have no idea if the decision was made by a person, an automated system, or a combination (i.e. the system flags anything with COVID-19 or coronavirus in the title and then a person decides on the content),” said Berenson. “I am considering my options, including making the booklet available on my Website and asking people to pay on an honor system, but that will not solve the problem of Amazon’s censorship.” “Amazon dominates both the electronic and physical book markets, and if it denies its readers a chance to see my work, I will lose the chance to reach the people who most need to learn the truth — those who don’t already know it.” For updates on Berenson’s book and upcoming works, you can follow him on Twitter. Following the publication of this article and widespread pressure on social media, Amazon reversed its decision and agreed to publish Berenson’s book.

Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D) joined a large gathering of protesters in Harrisburg on Wednesday, just weeks after slamming local leaders and business owners as “cowardly” for moving to reopen their counties and businesses outside of his far-reaching lockdown orders. Wolf, who threatened business owners who signaled they would move to reopen their businesses outside of his guidelines, marched with protesters in Harrisburg on Wednesday, seemingly unbothered by the stark violations to his own orders. Dauphin County, home of Harrisburg, moved to the yellow phase last week, which prohibits large gatherings of more than 25: I want Pennsylvanians to — as safely as possible — get back to the activities they most enjoy. Remember that as long as #COVID19 is a threat, no social activity outside your home where you will run into others is completely without risk of catching this virus. pic.twitter.com/Y7OeoqNl02 — Governor Tom Wolf (@GovernorTomWolf) May 30, 2020  Photos show Wolf congregating with a large crowd, which is prohibited under the yellow phase of reopening. Another participant in the background can be seen holding a sign reading, “Blue Lives Murder”: I’m at today’s March Against Injustice and Gun Violence 2020 in Harrisburg in solidarity with our community. Black lives matter. Racism must end. I am here to listen. pic.twitter.com/MoTYi7AtuW — Governor Tom Wolf (@GovernorTomWolf) June 3, 2020  Governor Wolf is walking with protestors in Harrisburg.

May 11 business owners were called cowards for wanting to reopen their businesses, and today the governor is actually marching in that. Is that not in violation of your order and his order for large gatherings?” a reporter asked. “The governor has always said that people have the right to protest and to demonstrate and the right of free speech,” Levine, whose birth name is Richard, said. “And so overall, we want large gatherings — such as maybe a party or some type of concert — to be under 250 people. But we are not restricting people’s right to protest,” Levine continued. “There are obviously significant social issues, you know, that are present that people feel that they need to have a voice, and so the governor is always supportive of that and is participating in that,” he added: This is why you have reporters at press conferences. Levine is asked about @GovernorTomWolf calling officials coward and then marching today in Harrisburg. Wait for the end. pic.twitter.com/6VkaYyMpwr — Real_Dave_La_Torre 🍿 (@David_LaTorre) June 3, 2020  Wolf made waves last month after accusing business owners and leaders, clamoring to reopen amid his restrictions, of engaging in a “cowardly act.” He also said that lawmakers “urging businesses to risk their lives and risk the lives of their customers or their employees by opening prematurely” were “engaging in behavior that is both selfish and unsafe.” “To those politicians who decide to cave in to this coronavirus, they need to understand the consequences of their cowardly act,” Wolf said, lecturing business owners as well. “By opening before the evidence suggests you should, you’re taking undue risks with the safety of your customers,” the governor warned. “That’s not only morally wrong; that’s also really bad business,” he continued, threatening them with the loss of their health department certificate, liquor license, or certificate of occupancy.

The former head of Britain’s foreign secret intelligence office, Sir Richard Dearlove, has claimed that coronavirus originated in a Chinese laboratory and escaped, quoting a study that found some elements of COVID-19 had been “inserted” and did not evolve naturally. He also suggested that the academic community suppressed the original paper because it was explicit in its blame of China. Scientists from around the world maintain that the virus originated in either bats or pangolins before spontaneously jumping to humans. However, the 75-year-old former spy chief referenced a Norwegian-British study that points to a man-made interference in the virus. According a paper written by Professor Angus Dalgleish of St George’s Hospital, University of London, and Norwegian virologist Birger Sørensen seen by The Telegraph, scientists had found “inserted sections” on the virus’s surface. It had “unique fingerprints” which could not have been a result of natural evolution but likely “indicative of purposive manipulation” in a lab capable of producing “chimeric viruses of high potency”. Sir Richard said the study was a “very important contribution to a debate which is now starting about how the virus evolved and how it got out and broke out as a pandemic”. He told the newspaper that the study will “shift the debate”, causing countries to “rethink how it treats its relationship with China and how the international community behaves towards the Chinese leadership”. The paper has not been without controversy, with one scientist, John Fredrik Moxnes of the Norwegian military, seeking to have his name removed from it. Other members of the scientific community have dismissed the findings. The original version of the paper was not accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Academic journals had rejected it on the grounds that it was “unsuitable for publication”. Sir Richard, however, suggested that this reception to the first paper may be due to its politically incorrect findings. The former spy chief revealed that the article had been rewritten several times. An earlier version, seen by the newspaper, said it was factually correct to call coronavirus the “Wuhan virus” (Wuhan having two labs studying bat coronaviruses). It had also said that they had proven “beyond reasonable doubt that the Covid-19 virus is engineered”. “We are aware that these findings could have political significance and raise troubling questions,” the original paper had said. After being rewritten to reduce explicit blame on China, the paper was eventually accepted for publication in the Quarterly Review of Biophysics Discovery. China Lied, People Died: Five Eyes Report Details CCP Coronavirus Cover-up https://t.co/sHLCxA7ZRt — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 2, 2020  “This [the first] article was submitted to a… journal, which refused it within a week of receiving it, and in the same period accepted for publication two or three Chinese articles that relate to the virus, within 48 hours,” Sir Richard told The Telegraph’s Planet Normal podcast published on Wednesday. “So I mean, as this debate about the virus develops, I think all this material is going to be in print and is going to embarrass a number of people, I think. Let’s suggest that the Chinese maybe have too much say in their journals, in what appears and what doesn’t.” China has maintained that it was not responsible for the outbreak. But reports in recent months have revealed that China had deliberately destroyed evidence about the origins of the virus and “disappeared” whistleblower scientists who spoke out about coronavirus. The coronavirus pandemic coincides with growing tensions around Hong Kong as well as the rising concern of the security risks of engaging Huawei in building the UK’s 5G. Mr Dearlove called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to reverse his decision on Huawei, saying: “It’s important that we do not put any of our critical infrastructure in the hands of Chinese interests. So telecommunications, Huawei, nuclear power stations, and then things that, you know, we require and need in a crisis, like PPE. “We have allowed China so much rope that we are now suffering the consequences, and it’s time to pull the rope in and to tighten the way we do business. It’s very, very important that we keep a keen eye on this and do not allow the Chinese to, as it were, benefit strategically from this situation that has been imposed on all of us.” EU Kowtows to China, Revises Coronavirus Disinfo Report After Pressure from Chinese Communist Party https://t.co/BVGmBzWBxw — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 25, 2020 

While I no longer believe in polls, I do believe in trends, and the current polling trends for President Trump are terrible. Over the past seven or eight weeks, according to the reliable RealClearPolitics Poll of Polls… Trump’s job approval has sunk from 47.3 percent to 43.5. His disapproval number has jumped from 49.5 percent to 54 percent. The public’s approval of Trump’s handling of the coronavirus has completely flipped, from 51 percent approve to just 43 percent approve — from 45 percent disapprove to 54 percent disapprove. Against Joe Biden in their upcoming 2020 match-up, Trump went from a 4.4 point deficit to what is now nearly an eight-point deficit. And let’s not forget that in 2016, the national polls called the race right. Though not as sharp, the trend is the same in the swing states — moving away from Trump. But… It is important to remember how wrong the state polling was in 2016. The good news in the polling, and it’s not a small thing, is enthusiasm. In the June 1 Washington Post poll, Biden beats Trump by ten points, 53 to 43 percent. In late March, Biden was only up two points, 49 to 47 percent. But on the issue of enthusiasm, 90 percent of Trump’s voters are enthusiastic, compared to just 74 percent of Biden voters. The other two pieces of good news are that Slow Joe Biden is a terrible politician and there’s plenty of time and a million news cycles between now and Election Day. If you don’t believe the polling trends, stop reading here, because I do believe the trends, and I’m going to analyze why I believe Trump’s numbers are sinking… During a crisis, a president really only has one job: to project steadiness. That’s it. That’s all the American people really want from their leaders. That’s why Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-NY) can screw absolutely everything up with his coronavirus response and still enjoy huge approval numbers. That’s why Iraq could fall completely apart on former President George W. Bush in 2004 and he still won his reelection. That’s why a radical like Barack Obama could beat war hero John McCain, who came off as erratic and neurotic. Calm, cool, unruffled, and steady is the key… Trump either refuses to behave in his own best interest during the dual crises of the coronavirus and these riots, or he’s incapable of behaving in a way that’s in his own best interest. You know, I like Trump being Trump … when times are good. When 100,000 people are not dying, when the economy is not imploding, and when dozens of Democrat-run cities are not on fire, Trump being Trump makes my day. I like that he hits back at the media, hijacks the news cycle with his Twitter feed, and blasts back twice as hard at his critics. I not only like it; I think it’s good politics, most especially when Deep State Traitors like James Comey are trying to legitimize a coup. I’ll tell you something else I have no problem during normal times… If Trump wants to troll the execrable Joe Scarborough over a dead intern. I’ll pop the popcorn. That scumbag Scarborough and his Trophy Wife have been falsely accusing Trump of everything from being a Russian spy to genocide… In normal times, during good times, I would find that hilarious and just. When 100,000 Americans are dead, and the economy is imploding, and dozens of Democrat-run cities are on fire, I find it childish, selfish, and self-destructive. As is encouraging your supporters to show up in what will almost certainly be a violent confrontation in front of the White House. As is repeatedly shouting “LAW & ORDER!” out of nowhere. As is re-tweeting a guy who says the “only good Democrat is a dead Democrat.” As is continuing to engage in grudges, grievances, silly insults, and petty fights. What’s even more frustrating is that Trump’s done a solid job managing both the coronavirus and the riots. He’s also said a lot of the right things, but his refusal to calm down, project steadiness, and rise above it all is undermining all the good work. Trump’s problems all started right here — he was doing just fine and earning solid approval numbers handling the coronavirus until he allowed the corporate media to bait him into overriding his own message and burying vital information the public needed under those endless and godawful briefings where he wrestled with the media pigs for hours. To what end? Why? As far as I’m concerned, that was all Trump’s fault because he allowed his (perfectly understandable) hatred for the media to get the best of him, and the result was not only the implosion of his own approval ratings, but necessary public information imploding in a fit of presidential pique. Over the past six or so weeks, he’s at least put an end to those destructive briefings, but the presidential steadiness is still not there … because Lil’ Joey Scarborough said something mean. For five years, Trump has told us he is perfectly capable of acting presidential if he wants to, but when sliding poll numbers can’t make him want to act presidential, I start to wonder. When projecting steadiness and calm would go a long way towards beating the bastards Trump wants so badly to beat and he still doesn’t, I start to wonder. I’m still going to crawl over glass to vote for the guy, but I’m pretty disgusted right now. Forty million people are out of work, our cities are on fire… Trump needs to do better, for the country’s sake and his own. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.

The British government is reportedly talking with Japanese firm NEC and South Korean company Samsung about diversifying the UK’s options for technology, in another strong signal that Britain is serious about pulling Chinese Huawei out of her telecommunications networks. British officials spoke with NEC in May about bringing the Japanese company into Britain’s 5G market through a trial programme called “5G Create”, according to a source speaking to Bloomberg. The Johnson administration is also reportedly speaking with South Korean company Samsung about developing 5G infrastructure, according to the Bloomberg report published on Wednesday. The British government has been under pressure from international allies after Johnson gave the go-ahead to Huawei to build 35 per cent of the UK’s next-generation 5G network. Five Eyes intelligence-sharing partners the United States and Australia have warned that engagement of the effectively state-owned Chinese company was a security risk, with Huawei able to build a backdoor into British networks, which can be used by Beijing spies. Last month, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), part of the signals intelligence service the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), announced that it would conduct a security review of Huawei’s involvement in Britain’s 5G following U.S. sanctions on the company. Tory rebels who are against the prime minister’s plans to employ Huawei hope that the report is a means of formally cutting ties with Huawei over the 5G deal. China Trying to Drive Wedge Between UK and U.S. with Huawei, Says Senator https://t.co/JDmkm8dADu — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 3, 2020  Prime Minister Johnson declined to deny on Wednesday he is looking for a way out of the arrangement, which has not yet been passed into law. He said during Wednesday’s Downing Street press briefing: “On high-risk vendors in our critical national infrastructure… we’ve got to make sure that we have solutions for the UK that protect UK security.” But periphery reports strongly suggest that has changed his mind. Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Dominic Raab is reportedly leading up “Project Defend”, which will examine the UK’s economic resilience. It will report on vulnerable supply chains that are strategic for national security but which may be dependent on foreign countries, including China. The review was reportedly activated after the UK struggled to source medical equipment during the coronavirus lockdown, with items like masks and ventilators coming from the communist superpower. It is believed the review will be used as a blueprint for self-sufficiency. An earlier report had revealed that the UK was reliant on China for 71 “critical goods” categories including electronics, personal protective equipment (PPE), and pharmaceuticals. Even if the UK does pull Huawei out of future 5G plans, the Chinese tech firm still makes up around one-third of the country’s 4G mobile network service antennas and is used by major providers EE, Three, and Vodaphone. British officials have also therefore been tasked with drawing up plans to pull Huawei out entirely by no later than 2023. Mr Johnson is also said to be exploring state financial aid for tech companies to replace dependence on Chinese tech firms. The need to shore up and protect British companies come after Nigel Farage had warned that Chinese interests are lining up for a “fire sale” of British tech businesses affected by the economic downturn caused by the Wuhan coronavirus, with senior Conservatives echoing those concerns.

A racehorse named for Dr. Anthony Fauci reached the finish line at a safe enough distance from others that would have made his namesake proud. Fauci the 2-year-old colt finished a distant second to a horse named Prisoner and was well ahead of third-place Indoctrinate in his much-anticipated debut Wednesday at Belmont Park. In a sport known for topical names, Fauci is the first of a series of horses inspired by the coronavirus pandemic and the latest tribute to the respected director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Social Distancing, Self Isolation, Flatten the Curve, Herd Immunity and No Spectators have also been registered with the Jockey Club. Co-owner Phillip Antonacci picked the name Fauci in mid-March after the 79-year-old started doing daily coronavirus briefings from the White House. The Antonacci family, like Fauci, is Italian-American and from Brooklyn. “We wanted to honor the service that he’s given to the whole world: beside COVID, fighting all the other infectious his whole life,” Antonacci said. “Throughout the whole thing, he seemed like a voice that knew what was going on and, without trying to be too political, kind of calmed things and provided real data behind what was going on.” Antonacci hoped to name a filly after Dr. Deborah Birx. In the end, though, Antonacci said he didn’t have horse good enough to name after the coordinator of the White House’s virus task force. This colt who debuted Wednesday was named Fauci in part because his owners thought he’d be a special horse. Trainer Wesley Ward has seen that since the then-unnamed horse got to his barn in September. “He’s a beautiful colt, done everything right on the track in the mornings, got a beautiful mind on him to where he’s not fractious or anxious and seems very, very intelligent,” Ward said. “He’s just a real easygoing guy. Not much bothers him.” Antonacci has sensed a lot of hype surrounding the horse because of his name. Since the global pandemic began, Dr. Fauci’s likeness has been used for a plush doll, a bobblehead and a donut, and he has a namesake beer. And now a thoroughbred. “He’s a really, really good horse,” Ward said. “Especially with the name that’s been assigned to him, you know that he’s got to live up to the name.” Ward said depending on how Fauci comes out of his first race, he could be headed to Royal Ascot in England for the Coventry Stakes in mid-June. Fauci’s debut coincided with the first live horse racing in New York since March and amid protests nationwide following death of George Floyd in Minnesota. Jockeys stood for a moment of silence to pay respects for those who died of COVID-19 and in tribute to medical professionals, then took a knee in the paddock prior to the first race as a show of solidarity with protesters in the wake of Floyd’s death. “There’s a lot going on in the world right now and we wanted to show respect to all causes, and to all people, and to show that we here at (the New York Racing Association) support everybody,” jockey Reylu Gutierrez said. “Horse racing, in general, supports all ethnicities. Horse racing is a worldwide sport and it doesn’t matter what color you are, what religion you are, or what ethnicity you are. What matters in horse racing is that we are one.”

Despite starting a gradual return to normal activities this week, Mexico recorded the most Coronavirus fatalities in one day. Mexico ranks seventh in the world for deaths and fourteenth for cases. During their daily news conference, Undersecretary of Health Hugo Lopez Gatell and his staff revealed that Mexico currently has 101,238 confirmed cases and another 44,869 undergoing testing. The nation has recorded 11,729 fatalities tied to the virus. Al 03 de junio de 2020 hay 101,238 casos confirmados, 16,829 confirmados activos y 44,869 sospechosos por #COVID19. Se han registrado 157,354 negativos, 11,729 defunciones confirmadas, 948 defunciones sospechosas y fueron estudiadas 303,461 personas. 1/3 pic.twitter.com/Xlwbbo0KRx — Hugo López-Gatell Ramírez (@HLGatell) June 4, 2020  The government figures show that Mexico recorded 1,092 fatalities in one day, the most to date. Mexico also recorded the most new daily cases with 3,912. Mexico still ranks high globally despite admitting to undercounts. The nation has only conducted a total of 303,461 tests. Lopez Gatell admitted that some of his figures only include cases from government hospitals. This discrepancy has led several state health officials to release their own figures which show between 20-40 percent more cases. Ildefonso Ortiz is an award-winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.

Actress Alicia Silverstone revealed that she has been taking baths with her nine-year-old son while isolated in quarantine due to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. “My son and I take baths together, and when he’s not with me, I take a bath and that really feels nourishing and comforting,” the Clueless star said in a recent interview with the New York Times. This does not appear to be Silverstone’s only headline-making (if not head-scratching) parenting method, as the report added that the actress has also put her son, Bear Blu, on a vegan diet, and that she has even “bird fed” him — chewing food in her own mouth first, before passing it to him to eat. The report added that a spokesperson for Silverstone clarified that Bear Blu prefers a vegan diet. Moreover, in her 2014 book, The Kind Mama, on diet, lifestyle, and parenting, the Ass Backwards actress explained that her son — who was just a few years old a the time — had “never had a drop of medicine,” as Silverstone does not agree with immunization. “People said lots of different things, and I was sort of ‘the freak,'” said the Clueless actress. “And I guess I’ll take pride in that because it is hard to be the person that’s speaking out, and it is hard to be the person that is saying the thing that isn’t what everybody else wants to hear.” In sharing her daily routine while in quarantine, Silverstone said she “always bring[s] everything back to diet.” “When I don’t eat well, I don’t feel well, and then my moods go all over the place,” Silverstone told the New York Times. The report added that while in quarantine, Silverstone also lost her friend and former co-star Mark Blum, who died of the Wuhan coronavirus in March. “It’s a really sad, scary time for so many people,” she said.

TEL AVIV – Israeli researchers have developed a “disinfection tunnel” which they say could enable mass gatherings by spraying visitors with a sanitizing water-based liquid.  The walk-through tunnel, the joint venture of scientists at Bar Ilan University and the Karmiel-based industrial automation company, RD Pack, would reduce the danger of crowds at synagogues, hospitals, schools, sporting events and concerts even while a pandemic rages. The tunnel has the ability to spray thousands of people with an aerosol using electrochemical technology that eliminates bacteria and viruses, including microbes from the coronavirus family. The tunnel itself is made of aluminum and polycarbonate. “When people walk through the tunnel, their whole body gets sprayed with the disinfectant, which works fast and efficiently, and provides the complete sterilization of a person,” said Eran Druker, business development manager at RD Pack. According to the university researchers, the disinfectant is both safe for the environment and for use on humans. “This disinfectant substance is extremely effective, 100 times more so than a regular disinfectant, and the advantage is that the substance is also unstable,” Izaak Cohen, who developed and patented the disinfectant together with Eran Avraham and Doron Aurbach, said. “Due to the substance being unstable, it is more friendly to the environment. Other disinfectants are more stable and remain on you, and can cause all sorts of burns. The more stable they are, the less friendly they are to both you and the environment.”  Dr. Izaak Cohen, a researcher at Bar-Ilan University, walking through the sanitation and disinfection tunnel  (Photo: Yoni Reif) The tunnel is currently awaiting approval from the Health Ministry. “The objective is to create an active process that does not interfere with daily routine,” Druker said. “People think that coronavirus is over, but it is still with us. As people are no longer proactive in disinfection and cleaning, we are creating the opportunity for disinfection and breaking the chain of infection.”  

During an interview with Newsmax TV’s “Spicer and Co.” on Wednesday, President Trump stated that social distancing is needed, it’s too soon to go back to normal, and criticized Democratic elected officials for being “tough as hell on keeping people locked up in their houses” and “very weak” on handling riots and looting. Host and former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer asked, “I haven’t heard a lot about social distancing and gathering since all of these large protests and riots. [Does] that mean that social distancing is over?” Trump responded, “No. It’s not over.” He added, “We want to be back to normal, but it’s a little bit soon, but I watch these protesters, and they’re the ones that are all claiming social distancing, everything else, it’s really interesting. They do that, and then they’re jumping on top of each other by the thousands when they’re screaming and ranting and raving, which is not a good thing. I mean, we’re going to have to see how that works out.” Trump also stated that it’s “very interesting with these liberal mayors, liberal Democrats — and governors, how they’re tough as hell on keeping people locked up in their houses. But when it comes to ending the crime and those stores being broken into, and the looting…they’re very weak on crime.” He also said that the initial shutdowns were needed. Because without them, far more people would have died. Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

A report published Wednesday evening indicated George Floyd had coronavirus approximately two months before his death, though multiple autopsies did not attribute his death to the illness. Ed O’Keefe of CBS News said on Twitter that the official autopsy found George Floyd had coronavirus, which could be a significant development in the case if medical officials follow their pattern of categorizing deaths related to the disease. JUST IN: Official autopsy report finds #GeorgeFloyd had #coronavirus. Hennepin County Medical Examiner's full report says he tested positive April 3. — Ed O'Keefe (@edokeefe) June 4, 2020  According to O’Keefe, who cited the Hennepin County Medical Examiner, Floyd tested positive on April 3rd. Multiple autopsies were completed and arrived at differing conclusions. CBS News reported: Dr. Allecia Wilson, one of the pathologists who conducted the independent autopsy, said Monday afternoon that Floyd died as a result of mechanical asphyxiation. But the report released later Monday by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s office said Floyd died of “cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint and neck compression.” The manner of death was ruled homicide, but the office noted that “is not a legal determination of culpability or intent.” A preliminary autopsy report cited earlier by prosecutors said the county medical examiner’s review “revealed no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation.” In April, Minnesota, along with many other states, began attributing deaths to coronavirus if no test was done and the deceased was suspected of having the illness. Via the Minnesota Department of Health: If a diagnosis of COVID-19 is suspected or likely “ …it is acceptable to report COVID-19 as ‘probable’ or ‘presumed’.” That could have an impact on Floyd’s suspected cause of death. There have been several instances around the country where an individual had COVID-19, but died under unrelated circumstances, and the death was blamed on the virus. In May, a Colorado man had a blood alcohol level of .550 and died of alcohol poisoning, but his cause of death was later changed to coronavirus, Fox News reported. Michigan counted deaths “with COVID-19,” as opposed to “of COIVD-19,” leading some to accuse the state of cooking the numbers. In Alabama, “a bedbound patient with aspiration pneumonia in one lung and a person with a buildup of fluid and partial collapse of one lung” had their deaths attributed to coronavirus, according to the Washington Post. “In this country, we’ve taken a very liberal approach to mortality,” Dr. Deborah Birx said at a press briefing on April 7th. “The intent is, right now, that … if someone dies with COVID-19, we are counting that as a CODID-19 death,” she said.

Former Rep. Allen West (R-FL) highlighted Facebook and Twitter’s politically-driven and arbitrary censorship of information, contrasting the platforms’ facilitation of operations executed by Antifa and Black Lives Matter while censoring disagreement with public health authorities’ positions. West joined Tuesday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with host Rebecca Mansour and special guest host Ed Martin to discuss ongoing unrest, protests, and riots following the death of George Floyd. West remarked, “What infuriates me more than anything else is that these social media platforms are being used by groups like Antifa and Black Lives Matter to organize, to get out their orders and instructions, but when we had everyday Americans that wanted to have rallies about the unconstitutionality of these stay-at-home orders and the lockdowns and shutdowns — I call it illegal martial law and house arrest — Facebook and Twitter threatened to censor them … Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey need to stop making decisions based upon their ideological agendas.” LISTEN:  “[The killing of George Floyd] was heinous,” West stated. “It was offensive. It was evil. It was tyrannical and despotic to see someone put their entire weight in their left knee on the carotid artery of a man who was handcuffed, and his crime was forgery — $20 bills — not armed robbery, not attempted murder, or aggravated assault. So, he was not armed or any danger to any of those four police officers that were there around him.” West continued, “There is no excuse for what we see happening in America. It just goes back to the Rahm Emanuel mantra of never letting a good crisis go to waste.” “Antifa is a domestic terrorist group,” West declared, “and we need to peel the onion back. We need to find the leadership. We need to find the resourcing. Black Lives Matter is no better. Black Lives Matter does not show up in Chicago or any of the other major urban population centers across the country run by Democrats, where you see black-on-black crime. They say nothing about the atrocious fact that 20 million black babies have been murdered in the womb thanks to Planned Parenthood, which was founded by a white supremacist and a racist.” West went on, “I see people cherry-picking and using the theme of racism and being a racist to fit an ideological agenda, and we have got to have strong voices to stand up and push back against this. If we cannot maintain law and order in our streets, then we’re going to see the undermining of our constitutional republic.” “We now have a domestic enemy,” West said. “We have an enemy that, without a doubt, has declared that they want to undermine this constitutional republic. They want to replace it with a governing system that is completely different.” West added, “We cannot have these seditious organizations and groups that are running amok in the United States of America and recruiting people.” November’s elections present a choice between individual sovereignty and collective enslavement, determined West. “It comes down to understanding the right and true relationship between the individual citizen and the institution of government,” West said. “In the United States of America, the individual citizens — if you read our Declaration and our Constitution — are sovereign. And why is the individual sovereign? Because their inalienable rights come from their creator, God, not from man.” West articulated a fundamental distinction between left-wing ideology and conservatism. “There are people that believe that the institution of government should be supreme and sovereign over the individual, and that’s not what we have in America,” West explained. “We have to decide, are we going to be individually sovereign or are we going to be collectively subjugated?” West went on, “We have to decide, do we want to be victors or do we want to be victims? We have to decide, do we want to be economically empowered or do we want to be economically enslaved? There is no greater time in the history of the United States of America to draw a clear delineation in these two very different philosophies of governance.” West concluded by noting the links between Antifa, Black Lives Matter, and the Democrat Party. “Barack Obama said we’re five days away from fundamentally transforming the United States of America, and they believe that they can do that,” West recalled. “That’s why you see them out there on the streets, using fear, intimidation, coercion, and violence to get the ends that they want.” Breitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.

As of June 16, President Donald Trump’s administration will bar all passenger planes originating in China from entry to the U.S. The order, announced by the U.S. Department of Transportation, applies to Air China, China Eastern Airlines Corp, China Southern Airlines Co, Hainan Airlines Holding Co, Sichuan Airlines Co, and Xiamen Airlines Co. Despite the agreement to restrict travel, airlines have continued to regularly ferry passengers from the origin point of the novel coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, both Delta and United have requested permission to resume flights to China, though the country “remains unable” to say when it will “allow U.S. carriers to reinstate scheduled passenger flights,”  according to a formal order signed by the Transportation Department top aviation official Joel Szabat. In a statement on Wednesday, Delta said “we support and appreciate the U.S. government’s actions to enforce our rights and ensure fairness,” while United said it looks forward to resuming passenger service between the United States and China “when the regulatory environment allows us to do so.” The decision will enforce a level of parity between both sides, eliminating the lopsided permissions currently in effect. “We will allow Chinese carriers to operate the same number of scheduled passenger flights as the Chinese government allows ours,” the department said in a separate statement. Additionally, China will no longer be allowed to use charter flights to “further [increase] their advantage over U.S. carriers in providing U.S.-China passenger services.”

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with survivors of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre at the hands of Chinese communist troops on Tuesday afternoon, amid strained relations between the United States and China over the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic and Hong Kong protests. The meeting came two days before the 31st anniversary of the incident in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, where Chinese communist troops thwarted student-led protests in a bloody crackdown on June 4 and 5, 1989. Protesters were calling for democracy, free speech, and a free press, among other things. There is no official death count for the number of victims of communist violence that day, as the Chinese Communist Party has endeavored to keep precise information about it a secret. Most estimates suggest thousands of peaceful protesters, many students, killed by Chinese military forces. Beijing played down the number of casualties, estimating the events led to the death of 241 people (including soldiers) and wounding of 7,000 others, the Encyclopedia Britannica noted. China reportedly sentenced many of those detained in Tiananmen Square to varying lengths of time in prison and executed others. “In the years since the incident, the government generally has attempted to suppress references to it,” Britannica added. “Public commemoration of the incident is officially banned.” In a statement on Wednesday, Morgan Ortagus, a spokesperson for State, revealed that Pompeo met with four of the Tiananmen protesters. Ortagus stated: Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo was honored to meet yesterday with Wang Dan, Su Xiaokang, Liane Lee, and Henry Li – four of the thousands of brave participants in the heroic protests for democracy that were brutally put down by the Chinese Communist Party on June 4, 1989. pic.twitter.com/W6ATJykhre — Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) June 3, 2020  A traditional Chinese-language report from Channel News Asia (CNA) first identified the four participants in the meeting with Pompeo. According to the State Department’s public schedule, Pompeo met with the Tiananmen Square massacre survivors at 2:30 p.m. on Tuesday, June 2. Although China has officially banned public commemoration of the Tiananmen events, Hong Kong residents have held an annual vigil on the anniversary of the crackdown, even after the region reverted to Chinese administration. This year, however, China will not allow Hong Kong to mark the massacre’s anniversary, Pompeo said, describing the move as unprecedented. On Monday, Pompeo wrote on Twitter that the pro-Beijing Hong Kong government did not approve the June 4 Tiananmen vigil, saying: For the first time in 30 years, Hong Kong authorities denied permission to hold the [Tiananmen Vigil]. If there is any doubt about Beijing’s intent, it is to deny Hong Kongers a voice and a choice, making them the same as mainlanders. So much for two systems. It starts; so soon. For the first time in 30 years, Hong Kong authorities denied permission to hold the #TiananmenVigil. If there is any doubt about Beijing’s intent, it is to deny Hong Kongers a voice and a choice, making them the same as mainlanders. So much for two systems. — Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) June 2, 2020  In recent weeks, Hong Kong has been home to pro-democracy protests increasingly challenging the Chinese Communist Party’s tightening grip on the region after Beijing moved to crush the island’s autonomy. U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has lambasted China’s move, threatening to take action against the Asian giant, like stripping Hong Kong of special trading privileges. Under the “One Country, Two Systems” policy signed after Britain handed the island over to Beijing, Hong Kong was granted autonomy while its residents enjoy quasi-democratic freedoms inconceivable in China. Officially, Hong Kong is a special administrative region of communist China. Since taking office as Secretary of State in 2018, Pompeo has issued statements in early June condemning the Tiananmen Massacre. This year is no different. Ortagus, Pompeo’s spokeswoman, stated on Wednesday: Today we honor the brave Chinese people whose peaceful calls for democracy, human rights, and a corruption-free society came to a violent end when the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) sent the People’s Liberation Army into Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989, armed with tanks and guns. … Thirty-one years later, the total number of missing or dead Tiananmen protesters is still unknown. The United States continues to applaud their aspirations, and the American people stand with the families still grieving their lost loved ones, including the courageous Tiananmen Mothers who have never stopped seeking accountability for their children’s deaths, despite great personal hardship and risk. We reiterate our call for a full, public accounting of those killed or missing. We mourn the victims of June 4, 1989, and we stand with the people of China who continue to aspire to a government that protects human rights, fundamental freedoms, and basic human dignity. Pompeo’s meeting with Tiananmen survivors will likely fuel tensions between China and the United States in the South China Sea and beyond. Today, the U.S. protests the PRC’s unlawful South China Sea maritime claims at the @UN. We reject these claims as unlawful and dangerous. Member States must unite to uphold international law and freedom of the seas. #FreeAndOpenIndoPacific https://t.co/h6UCoBnnnb — Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) June 2, 2020  The demonstrations, which reportedly began in May 1989, and the subsequent repression at the hands of Chinese communist troops spilled outside of Beijing to cities across the country and beyond in events that came to be known as the May Fourth Movement. American officials instituted sanctions on China over the 1989 massacre. U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has accused China of allowing the lethal and highly contagious COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, to spread by mismanaging its response and hiding the extent of the outbreak during its initial phase. China, the birthplace of the coronavirus, denies the assertions.

The media is reporting that “health experts” signed an open letter supporting the protests that have, in many American cities, devolved into violent riots that have destroyed neighborhoods and businesses, because “white supremacy is a public health issue” that has contributed to the spread of the coronavirus. The protests were sparked by the death of a black man, George Floyd, who died in police custody in Minneapolis on Memorial Day. The letter is, in fact, signed by physicians, medical organizations, and academics, but scores of others who are described as “community stakeholders” also signed the document. “White supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to COVID-19,” the letter says. The letter also says that while large protests could spread the virus and some of the recommendations like social distancing still apply, “do not disband protests under the guise of maintaining public health for COVID-19 restrictions.” On the other hand, the letter said protesters should not be arrested because crowded cells could spread the virus and that protesters should “demand that law enforcement officials also respect infection prevention recommendations by maintaining distance from protesters and wearing masks.” The letter also tells people they should donate to pay for the bail of people arrested at protests or riots. “We continue to support demonstrators who are tackling the paramount public health problem of pervasive racism. We express solidarity and gratitude toward demonstrators who have already taken on enormous personal risk to advocate for their own health, the health of their communities, and the public health of the United States. We pledge our services as allies who share this goal,” the letter says. The letter talks about police “violence” but not the violence in some protests, including some protesters who set businesses on fire and looted businesses. Dozens of public health and disease experts have signed an open letter in support of the nationwide anti-racism protests. "White supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to COVID-19," they wrote.https://t.co/EewPNgDSu3 — NPR (@NPR) June 2, 2020  Taxpayer-funded National Public Radio (NPR), however, did not include much of the details in its report on the letter, instead turning to a source that did not sign it, Dr. Elaine Nsoesie, an assistant professor of global health at Boston University. “Data is showing that blacks and Latinos have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 in many states,” Nsoesie said. “Racism is one of the reasons this disparity exists.” “Racism is a social determinant of health,” Nsoesie said. “It affects the physical and mental health of blacks in the U.S. So I wouldn’t weigh these crises separately.” Follow Penny Starr on Twitter.

Remember when the Internet and TV commercials and public service announcements were all filled with healthcare workers holding up signs that said “We’re Here For You, Stay Home for Us”? Do you remember all that emotional blackmail? It was all over the place. The message was basically this: Dear Ungrateful Commoner: We’re out here risking our lives on the front lines, and we selfless and brave healthcare heroes need you to remain on lockdown and lose your jobs and your businesses and give up everything that makes life living,  for us… Cuz we’re brave and awesome, so we need you to destroy the economy that might get the Orange Bad Man reelected, even though, if you’re under 50, the coronavirus is no more lethal than the flu Remember all that sanctimonious, anti-science garbage? Well, guess what… It was all bullshit. Many of us knew that at the time. But now we know that our oh-so precious healthcare workers also knew it was bullshit, because look at them now… No, really, look at them now openly encouraging mass gatherings of people. Tell me if I got their science correct… You’re killing grandma and making life harder for all of your precious healthcare heroes if you leave your home to attend church, use the swings at a local park, play a game of basketball, gather in groups of ten or more, or attend a house party… But if you leave your home and completely ignore every social distancing rule to attend a massive gathering of humanity to protest, riot, loot, and burn Democrat-run cities — well, according to these very same healthcare heroes, that’s no problem at all. You know, cuz burning down predominantly black neighborhoods is fighting the virus of racism in a country that just elected a black president and enjoyed the lowest black unemployment rate in history — at least until we all told you to stay home … for us. Seriously, look at our “We’re Here For You, Stay Home for Us” healthcare heroes now.

"White supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to COVID-19," they wrote.https://t.co/EewPNgDSu3 — NPR (@NPR) June 2, 2020  Overnight, we went from America’s health experts telling us that attending church will kill grandma to America’s health experts telling us “they support the demonstrations — because racism also poses a dire health threat.” In other words, all of the so-called science was tossed out the window as soon as a pet cause made that necessary. Don’t waste any energy getting angry… Just remember this the next time our healthcare “experts” try to shove you around and control you with their “science.” America’s experts are only experts when it comes to lying, to manipulating us with fear into a box where they can boss us around. If anything, take away something positive from this… As I said yesterday, we owe a debt of gratitude to the rioters. After all, it was America’s left-wing terrorists in Antifa and Black Lives Matter who exposed the lockdowns as a left-wing hoax, as a total fraud, as purely political. And I don’t know about you, but the rioters who exposed this aren’t rioting in my neighborhood. They’re not rioting out here in Rural America. Nope, the only place they’re rioting and looting and burning is in Democrat-run cities. So those stupid enough to vote for Democrats are getting what they voted for, while the rest of us learned an important lesson about how phony, dishonest, and partisan our healthcare “experts” are. It’s all good.  Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.

Venezuela’s rightful president Juan Guaidó announced an agreement with Nicolás Maduro’s socialist regime and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO, a subsidiary of the World Health Organization) on Tuesday to seek assistance in dealing with the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. The agreement, signed Monday in Caracas, will establish the necessary “priorities” for dealing with the pandemic, including the rapid detection of cases, epidemiological surveillance, and the effective treatment of those infected. “Both parties propose to work in coordination, in coordination and with the support of PAHO, in the search for financial resources that contribute to strengthening the country’s response capacities in the face of the new coronavirus,” the Maduro regime’s Communication Minister Jorge Rodríguez said in a state television address on Tuesday. “The coronavirus does not respect or discriminate against gender, orientation, or political party,” he continued. “So this is good news, a good start so that we can deepen our work together to combat the coronavirus.” Guaidó confirmed on Twitter that after “months of fighting and insistence, we have finally convinced the PAHO to provide the necessary donation to the National Assembly to handle the pandemic in Venezuela.” “Our politics is based on saving lives, in dealing with the emergency, and ending this dictatorship,” he added. Neither side has confirmed the estimated amount required for the plan and has not reported under what conditions the resources would be distributed. Luego de meses de insistencia y lucha, logramos que la OPS reciba la donación aprobada por la AN para atender la pandemia en Venezuela. Nuestra política se centra en salvar vidas, en atender la emergencia y salir de la dictadura. Urge el Gobierno de Emergencia Nacional. https://t.co/4QHmH34psf — Juan Guaidó (@jguaido) June 3, 2020  In a statement, Guaidó’s team assured that the agreement allows money to put emergency funds “into the hands of international organizations” and not the socialist regime. They added that the donation had been “approved” by the country’s National Assembly, the country’s last legitimate lawmaking body. This fact does not appear in the document released by Rodríguez, who accused the opposition leader of trying to “politicize something that does not have to be politicized.” Despite its alleged commitment to removing the Maduro regime from power, mainly through the imposition of crippling economic sanctions, Washington celebrated the “coordinated association” agreement between the two sides. “It is an important step, but only a democratic transition will save Venezuela from catastrophe,” the U.S. Embassy said in a statement. Gobierno Interino de @JGuaido firmó acuerdo con la OPS de asociación coordinada con el régimen para enfrentar el #COVID19, priorizando necesidades urgentes de atención médica de venezolanos. Es un paso importante, pero solo transición democrática salvará Venezuela de catástrofe https://t.co/GdcmWdTJRa — Embajada Virtual de los EE.UU., Venezuela (@usembassyve) June 3, 2020  The agreement raises further questions about the veracity of Venezuela’s official coronavirus figures. Health authorities claim that just 1,819 people have contracted the disease, leading to 18 fatalities. The country’s decrepit “universal” healthcare system and the vulnerability of its poverty-stricken population arouse suspicion regarding the numbers. The PAHO has previously faced accusations of enabling slave labor in relation to Cuba’s slave doctor system, in which the Castro regime forces doctors to work abroad while taking a large percentage of their pay. In 2012, the PAHO was a signatory to a deal signed by Brazil’s socialist leadership and Cuba’s regime to introduce a program known as “Mais Médicos” (More Doctors) and received a payment from the Brazilian government as a result. The deal signed this week underlines Guaido’s rapidly dwindling authority as Venezuela’s legitimate yet effectively powerless president, which has led him to repeatedly try to enter negotiations with the Maduro regime in return for supposed concessions. After several rounds of discussions, Guaidó conceded that he had given up negotiating with such a “deadly dictatorship.” A nationwide survey taken at the time found that 87.6 percent of Venezuelans opposed any form of dialogue with Maduro.

Stocks rose on Wednesday as investors glimpsed signs that the economy had bottomed, coronavirus infections are waning, more government aid is likely, and President Donald Trump’s move to quell riots in D.C. may have stemmed the civic unrest around the country. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 527 points, or 2.05 percent. The S&P 500 moved up 1.36 percent, its fourth day of gains. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 0.78 percent, climbing within two percent of the all-time high hit in February. All 11 sectors of the S&P were up. Industrials and financials were the best performing sector, rising by 3.91 percent and 3.83 percent respectively. Communications services and consumer staples were the worst, rising by just one-fifth of a percent. The top gainer on the Dow was Boeing, followed by American Express, J.P. Morgan Chase, and Exxon Mobil. Home Depot, Walmart, Intel, and United Health were the only Dow stocks to lose for the day.  

NEW YORK (AP) — Major League Baseball rejected the players’ offer for a 114-game regular season in the pandemic-delayed season with no additional salary cuts and told the union it did not plan to make a counterproposal, a person familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity Wednesday because no statements were authorized.
Players made their proposal Sunday, up from an 82-game regular season in management’s offer last week. Opening day would be June 30 and the regular season would end Oct. 31, nearly five weeks after the Sept. 27 conclusion that MLB’s proposal stuck to from the season’s original schedule. MLB told the union it had no interest in extending the season into November, when it fears a second wave of the coronavirus could disrupt the postseason and jeopardize $787 million in broadcast revenue.
While management has suggested it could play a short regular season of about 50 games with no more salary reductions, it has not formally proposed that concept. Teams and players hope to start the season in ballparks with no fans, and teams claim they would sustain huge losses if salaries are not cut more. The sides agreed to a deal March 26 in which players accepted prorated salaries in exchange for $170 million in advances and a guarantee that if the season is scrapped each player would get 2020 service time matching what the player accrued in 2019. That deal called for “good faith” negotiations over playing in empty stadiums or at neutral sites. The union has said no additional cuts are acceptable. MLB’s proposal on May 26 would lower 2020 salaries from about $4 billion to approximately $1.2 billion, establishing a sliding scale of reductions. Players at the $563,500 minimum would get about 47% of their original salary and those at the top — led by Mike Trout and Gerrit Cole at $36 million — would receive less than 23%. The union’s offer would have salaries total about $2.8 billion, leaving each player with about 70% of his original salary.

Amazon announced this week that it is ending its two-dollar pay increase for warehouse workers instituted after the outbreak of the Chinese virus. Meanwhile, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has enjoyed a net worth increase of $32 billion since January. According to a report by Business Insider, Amazon is killing the two-dollar pay raise that warehouse workers received at the outset of the Chinese virus pandemic. Although Amazon warehouses were overwhelmed with demand in March and April, reports suggest that Amazon’s warehouse operations have mostly returned to normal. Some warehouse employees even claim that they recently been asked to take voluntary time off. In short interviews with Business Insider, Amazon warehouse workers around the nation expressed their frustration with the company’s decision to end the pay raise. “The $2 an hour won’t have much effect on my life — I find kind of laughable,” one warehouse worker in New Jersey said. “There are others though who can really use it and with the present circumstances they should actually be increasing it instead of taking it away.” “It just kills me that the company cares nothing about what a pay cut will do to morale,” a South Carolina Amazon worker said. “Almost everyone is very disappointed and angry,” one Amazon warehouse worker in Indiana said. “We want the pay until the masks go away.” Breitbart News reported in April that America’s billionaire executives have seen significant increases in their wealth during the coronavirus pandemic. At the same time that 26 million Americans were forced to file for unemployment, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Tesla CEO Elon Musk saw their wealth increase by ten percent. Stay tuned to Breitbart News for more updates on this story.

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday factory orders in April fell 13.0 percent, the biggest month-to-month fall in records dating to 1992. Orders fell 11 percent in March, revised down from the initially reported then record-setting 10.3 percent decline. The decline was slightly less than the 14 percent forecast by economists. Business investment was weaker than it looked in last week’s initial reading. Orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft, a proxy for business investment, fell 6.1 percent compared with the prior estimate of a 5.8 percent decline. Durable goods orders were revised down from a 17.2 percent decline to a 17.7 percent decline. Wednesday’s data included the first look at nondurable goods orders. These fell 9 percent. The overall picture is one of an economy in deep contraction in April and March. But data since then suggest the economy probably hit rock bottom in that period and has been recovering as businesses have been permitted to reopen.  

President Donald Trump in an interview on Tuesday mocked former Vice President Joe Biden for continuing to wear a mask. The president pointed to a speech that Biden gave on Tuesday about race relations, where the former vice president removed his mask. “He took his mask off for the first time in a while, I haven’t seen his face for a long time,” Trump said. Trump spoke about Biden in an interview with Fox News host Brian Kilmeade on Wednesday morning. The former vice president has religiously worn his mask in recent months, even while delivering remarks or even while maintaining social distance outdoors. Trump mocked Biden for putting the mask back on while he was speaking. “Actually, then he started speaking through the mask again, he feels comfortable with a mask on I think, even though there was no one near him, which is interesting,” Trump said. Biden criticized Trump for fanning the “flames of hate” and trafficking in “fear and division” for political gain. But Trump mocked Biden for successfully reading a speech written by his staff after leaving his basement quarantine. “That speech was written, he didn’t say that, he repeated the words, that’s all, that speech was written for him because he doesn’t speak like that,” Trump said.

Polling across six swing states shows a tightening presidential race, as President Trump and Joe Biden (D) find themselves neck and neck, according to a Change Research/CNBC survey released this week. Change Research conducted the poll May 29-31, surveying 3,958 likely voters in six battleground states Trump won in 2016 — Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Biden holds just a one-point advantage over the president across the six states — a lead within the poll’s +/- 1.56 percent margin of error. The individual results indicate a tight race across the board. Trump leads in Pennsylvania by four points and Arizona by one point, while Biden leads in Florida by three points, Michigan by two, and North Carolina by one. Both are tied in Wisconsin, seeing 45 percent support each: Joe Biden has a 7-point lead over Donald Trump nationally (48% Biden, 41% Trump). That is up from his 3-point lead two weeks ago and his greatest lead to date. Across the six battleground states Trump won in 2016, Biden now leads by 1 point (47% Biden, 46% Trump). This is a 3 point shift in the margin since our last wave and the first time Biden has led. Biden and Trump are at parity in Arizona (+1 Trump), North Carolina (+1 Biden), and Wisconsin (even), Biden leads in Florida (+3) and Michigan (+2), and Trump leads in Pennsylvania (+4). #NEW @CNBC /@ChangePolls:#Pennsylvania Trump 50%Biden 46%___#Arizona Trump 45%Biden 44%___#WisconsinTrump 45%Biden 45% — Political Polls (@PpollingNumbers) June 3, 2020  NEW @CNBC/@ChangePolls  Florida:Biden 48% Trump 45%__Michigan:Biden 48% Trump 46%__North Carolina:Biden 46% Trump 45% — Political Polls (@PpollingNumbers) June 3, 2020  While the election remains several months away, experts and critics appear to be taking recent polling data with a grain of salt, as many pollsters and establishment media outlets failed to accurately predict Trump’s victory in many of those battleground states and, ultimately, his shocking defeat of Hillary Clinton in 2016. The survey coincides with the country’s gradual reopening following coronavirus shutdowns, which has been inundated by protests, many of which have turned violent. Trump addressed the nation in a Rose Garden speech on Monday, vowing to restore law and order in the event that state leaders fail to adequately act and stop the lawlessness dominating their streets. While Biden has criticized violent protests, he has also blamed police for escalating tension. “There’s no place for violence, no place for looting or destroying property or burning churches or destroying businesses,” he said in part, adding, “Nor is it acceptable for our police, sworn to protect and serve all people, to escalate tension, resort to excessive violence.”

TEL AVIV – An employee at the Prime Minister’s Office has been confirmed with coronavirus, potentially compelling Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to go into self-quarantine for the third time in as many months. The development comes amid an uptick in cases that began last week with 115 new infections in a 24-hour period – the highest in a month. The infected PMO worker, a technical staffer, was in a room with Netanyahu, Israeli media reported. “A worker at the office tested positive for coronavirus,” the statement from Netanyahu’s office said. “At the moment, an epidemiological investigation is being conducted, at the end of which appropriate guidelines will be given to those who came in contact with him.” Netanyahu entered self-quarantine on two occasions over the past three months, once in March after an advisor was diagnosed with the virus, and again in April when then-health minister Yaakov Litzman contracted it. The PMO worker was infected by a family member linked to a student at the Gymnasia Rehavia high school in Jerusalem, where more than 130 students and staff members were confirmed to be coronavirus carriers. Thousands of students and their families went into quarantine as 21 schools around the country racked up cases. The Health Ministry warned Sunday that it might order the shuttering of all high schools if outbreaks continue. According to the first Israeli antibody study, between two and three percent of the population has contracted the virus. That figure, representing up to 270,000 Israelis, is at least 10 times higher than the number of confirmed cases. Researchers conducted serological tests on blood samples of 1,700 Israelis.  

On Tuesday, Oklahoma State star linebacker Amen Ogbongbemiga said he tested positive for the coronavirus after he attended a protest in Tulsa. The six-foot-one, 21-year-old player made his announcement in a tweet on Tuesday. “After attending a protest in Tulsa AND being well protective of myself, I have tested positive for COVID-19. Please, if you are going to protest, take care of yourself and stay safe,” he wrote. After attending a protest in Tulsa AND being well protective of myself, I have tested positive for COVID-19. Please, if you are going to protest, take care of yourself and stay safe. — Amen Ogbongbemiga (@closedprayer) June 3, 2020  Ogbongbemiga reportedly discovered his diagnosis after being tested on Monday when he returned to the Oklahoma State campus to resume training with the school’s football program, ESPN reported. Now, instead of resuming his training, he will be quarantined in special housing and will undergo frequent testing until he is cleared of the virus. Still, it seems unlikely that Ogbongbemiga contracted the virus at a protest he only attended the day before. The coronavirus does not develop that quickly. Last year, the Canadian-born Ogbongbemiga was voted defensive MVP for the OSU Cowboys, and was ranked sixth in the Big 12 conference with 100 tackles. He also ranked fifth in the conference with tackles for loss taking 15.5 yards from his opponents Follow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry dismissed leaked World Health Organization (W.H.O.) documents on Wednesday as “seriously inconsistent with facts” after the Associated Press revealed the agency had concerns that the Communist Party was hiding pivotal information on the Chinese coronavirus. The AP reported on Tuesday that the leaked documents it had access to showed that senior W.H.O. officials were extremely frustrated in the early days of the pandemic with China for, among other things, delaying sharing information on the virus’s genome for over a week. In the months following the initial announcement of the discovery of a new virus, reports revealed that Chinese Communist Party officials had destroyed early samples of the virus obtained from Wuhan, where it originated, making it impossible for scientists to study its early evolution. The AP report also revealed W.H.O. officials complaining that Beijing was sharing information with the global agency “15 minutes before it appears on CCTV,” the communist state broadcaster, and that some feared a public rebuke of China would result in the Communist Party physically harming its doctors and scientists. “I don’t know where these ‘internal documents’ come from, but I can assure you that certain reports were seriously inconsistent with facts,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian – who rose to prominence on the world stage for claiming, without evidence, that the U.S. Army may have caused the Chinese coronavirus pandemic – asserted on Wednesday. “Since the outbreak of COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus], China has been acting with openness, transparency, and a high sense of responsibility,” Zhao said. “We have been in close and good communication and cooperation with W.H.O. and its office in China. We will continue to support W.H.O. in leading the global fight against the virus with concrete actions and work with the larger international community to uphold global public health security.” Zhao stopped short of denying the accuracy of the AP report or denying the authenticity of the documents the AP alleged to have access to, suggesting that Beijing does not have evidence that the W.H.O.’s alleged private concerns did not actually occur. Instead, Zhao left open the possibility that W.H.O. officials were, in fact, frustrated and concerned over Communist Party obstruction of scientific development to fight the virus, and branded their concerns “inconsistent with facts.” The Global Times, one of China’s most belligerent English-language state propaganda outlets, also did not offer any refutation of what the AP alleged about the W.H.O., failing to use the word “alleged” when relaying that the AP “cited recordings of internal U.N. meetings and internal documents claiming the W.H.O. publicly praised China in a bid to pull more information out of the Chinese government.” “Although the W.H.O. continued to publicly commend China, the recordings show they were concerned China was not sharing enough information to assess the risk posed by the new virus, costing the world valuable time,” the AP report asserted on Tuesday. Among the transgressions the W.H.O. documents show officials accusing China of committing were observing the party “sat on releasing the genetic map, or genome, of the deadly virus for over a week after multiple government labs had fully decoded it, not sharing details key to designing tests, drugs, and vaccines.” The internal documents showing that China stalled for as much as two weeks on sharing information like the genome of the novel coronavirus directly contradicts one of the most vocal points of pride in the Communist Party’s version of the Chinese response to the pandemic. While reports have indicated China knew of coronavirus cases as early as November 2019, the regime released the genome in late January, nearly a month after it shut down the wet market in Wuhan it claimed was the origin of the virus and after it alerted the W.H.O. to the existence of that virus. Chinese regime propagandists have insisted disclosing the genome of the virus occurred at nearly record time. The AP report also claimed W.H.O. officials felt threatened, according to their internal documents, by the Chinese regime, to compliment Beijing or risk losing all access to any information. Non-compliance with regime praise, they reportedly considered, may also lead to violence against Chinese scientists who may have disagreed with Beijing’s secrecy. Chinese officials are known to have arrested at least eight health workers in the early weeks of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan for posting advice on social media on how to contain a contagious disease. At the time, both Beijing and the World Health Organization were insisting that the Chinese coronavirus was not transmissible from human to human. The AP report follows a similar report from Reuters last month claiming that senior officials within the W.H.O. were frustrated and concerned about Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus’ insistence on complimenting and defending China on the world stage. “We knew how it was going to look, and he can sometimes be a bit naive about that, but he’s also stubborn,” an anonymous W.H.O. official told the news agency. “The [W.H.O.] advisers encouraged Tedros to use less effusive language [in praising China] out of concern about how he would be perceived externally, the person familiar with the discussions said, but the director-general was adamant, in part because he wanted to ensure China’s cooperation in fighting the outbreak,” Reuters asserted.
The German newspaper Der Spiegel published a report shortly before Reuters revealed that German intelligence agencies had reason to believe Chinese dictator Xi Jinping pressured Tedros to delay declaring the coronavirus epidemic a pandemic – meaning no global community was safe – and not to announce that the virus was contagious.

Zimbabwe’s ruling leftist party, Zanu-PF, will stage anti-U.S. demonstrations on Thursday at the United States Embassy and the European Union Ambassador’s office in direct violation of the country’s ban on large gatherings to contain its worsening coronavirus outbreak, New Zimbabwe reported on Tuesday. Zanu-PF’s national political commissar Victor Matemadanda confirmed the planned demonstrations at a press conference in the capital, Harare. Matemadanda said he “invited” Nelson Chamisa, president of the opposition party Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), and his supporters to join the anti-U.S. demonstrations. On Sunday, U.S. National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien described Zimbabwe, China, and Russia as “foreign adversaries.” He accused them of using social media to stoke unrest and “sow discord” in America, currently enduring violent and, in some cases, deadly riots nationwide following the recent death of a black man named George Floyd while in police custody in the state of Minnesota. The officer involved in his death was arrested. In response, Zimbabwe’s foreign ministry spokesman James Manzou reportedly summoned U.S. Ambassador to Zimbabwe Brian Nichols on Monday to “explain” O’Brien’s remarks. After the meeting, Nichols reminded Zimbabwe’s ruling party of its longstanding record of violations against human rights. He said: Mr. Floyd’s killer was charged with murder in days. Every American official, from our president to Minneapolis African-American Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, has vowed to deliver justice. Zimbabweans surely wonder when, after so many years, Patrick Nabanyama, Itai Dzamara, and Paul Chizuze will get justice? Americans will continue to speak out for justice whether at home or abroad. The ambassador referred to missing Zimbabwean political activists from opposition parties who have disappeared without a trace in recent years after standing up to the ruling party. News of the planned demonstrations comes as Zimbabwean troops and police reinforced coronavirus lockdown measures in Harare on Tuesday, tightening control of people’s movement amid a recent surge in coronavirus infections. Zimbabwe health authorities say the number of cases has “more than tripled” to 203 over the past few days, Reuters reported on Tuesday. President Emmerson Mnangagwa had recently eased Zimbabwe’s lockdown since it was first imposed at the end of March to curb the spread of the deadly virus. The MDC accuses the ruling party of taking advantage of the government’s restrictions on movement during the pandemic to target its members, calling Tuesday’s reimposed lockdown in Harare politically motivated. “So if this is about Covid-19 [Chinese coronavirus] why is it only happening in Harare? This appears to be more about politics than medicine or health,” MDC senator David Coltart wrote on Twitter. The MDC says Mnangagwa’s Zanu-PF party is “trying to suppress protests over a worsening economy” and attempting to “stop MDC supporters from gathering at the courts” where the MDC leader’s lawyer was due to appear after being arrested by ruling party authorities on Monday.

Health officials in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have confirmed a new outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in the country’s northwest, Voice of America (VOA) reported on Monday. The revelation comes as health authorities struggle to contain a separate Ebola outbreak in eastern DRC. The country is also currently battling a Wuhan coronavirus upsurge and the world’s largest measles outbreak, according to the report. Authorities identified the center of the new Ebola outbreak as Mbandaka, the capital of the DRC’s Equateur province. The city is home to over one million people and is known as a transport hub, located on the Congo River. At a press conference on Monday, DRC health minister Eteni Longondo said “four people have already died” from Ebola in Mbandaka, Al Jazeera reports. “The [DRC’s] National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) has confirmed to me that samples from Mbandaka tested positive for Ebola,” the minister said at the briefing. Equateur province previously battled an Ebola spike from May-July 2018 that killed 33 people. “This is a province that has already experienced the disease. They know how to respond. They started the response at the local level [on Sunday],” Longondo said. According to the report, health authorities in eastern DRC have been battling an Ebola flare-up that began in 2018 and has killed 2,280 people. This outbreak emerged in North Kivu province in August 2018. It then spread to the neighboring Ituri province, the site of ongoing inter-ethnic violence which further complicates the disease’s spread there. A recent U.N. report said that from March to May, over 200,000 people were displaced by violence from tribal hostilities in Ituri province. In March, DRC health officials had expected to declare the Ebola outbreak in Eastern DRC officially over after the last known Ebola patient was discharged from treatment. On April 10, however, a new case of Ebola was recorded in North Kivu province. The ongoing epidemic in eastern DRC is the world’s second-largest Ebola outbreak on record and the country’s single worst. The severity of the outbreak has exhausted the country’s hospitals. In March, a U.N. report declared the DRC’s healthcare system to be “on life support.” A recent coronavirus flare-up in the DRC further threatens the country’s public health. At press time on Tuesday, the DRC had recorded 3,326 infections and 72 deaths from the Chinese coronavirus.

Businesses in the United States shrank their payrolls by 2.76 million, according to a report Wednesday from ADP and Moody’s Analytics. This was far better than expected and indeed outside of the range of estimates. Economists had estimated the ADP private payrolls figure to show a loss of between 3.3 million and 11 million, according to Econoday. The median estimate was for a loss of 8.6 million jobs. April’s payroll figure was revised to show a smaller job loss, 19.6 million instead of the earlier reported 20.2 million. The report suggests the labor market may be healthier than it has looked to many economists. It is possible that businesses kept many workes on in anticipation of reopening in May or hired workers back. The Trump administration’s Paycheck Protection Program, which makes loans to small businesses that can be forgiven if they do not layoff workers, is also likely supporting employment more effectively than expected. It is also possible that the ADP report may not be accurate in these wild times. In the past, it has missed some big shifts in the economy. ADP estimates that Friday’s non-farm payroll number from the U.S. government will show a contraction of 8.6 million jobs. That is slightly higher than the Econoday consensus expectation of a loss of 7.7 million jobs. The hospitality and leisure category, the hardest hit in April, shrank by 105,000 jobs, according to the report. That was the best performing sector and likely reflects the deep cuts in prior months. There just were not that many jobs left to lose. Trade and transportation was the worst performing category in the services in May, losing 826,000 jobs. Overall the services sector lost 1,967,00o jobs. The good producing sector lost 794,000, with 719,000 coming from manufacturing.  

Teenage climate worrier Greta Thunberg has been watching the tumultuous riots that have erupted across America over the past week and voiced disappointment at what she sees. Late Sunday night she took to Twitter to register her displeasure and issue a call for “global structural change”: Devastating to see the development taking place in the USA.Centuries of structural and systematic racism and social injustice won’t go away by itself.We need a global structural change.The injustices must come to an end. #BlackLivesMatter pic.twitter.com/V5NWJFm0Qh — Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) May 30, 2020  The call to social action by the teen came just three days before she restarted her global campaign against all manner of “climate sins” by lashing the Danish capital Copenhagen for channeling waste water overflow into the sea. As Breitbart News reported, Thunberg expressed anger that these actions are coming from “the same Copenhagen who claim they’ll be climate neutral by 2025,” doubtless a disappointment to her and her supporters who see global climate action as a necessity for the very survival of the planet. Thunberg’s return to castigating the world for climate errors both real and perceived comes after an admission in March it’s “extremely likely” she contracted the Chinese coronavirus but subsequently “basically recovered” from it. The 17-year-old said she and father exhibited coronavirus-like symptoms at the time and chose to self-quarantine for two weeks following a trip through western Europe. Now she has added the U.S. to her expanding list of global concerns.

BERLIN (AP) – Europe’s unemployment rate ticked up modestly last month, contained by use of labor programs that have kept millions of workers on payrolls and as some people stopped looking for work, official data showed Wednesday. The jobless rate in the 19 countries that use the euro rose to 7.3% in April, the first full month when pandemic lockdowns hit the continent, from 7.1% in March, statistics agency Eurostat said Wednesday. Europe’s rise in unemployment has been moderate by international standards because employers are making extensive use of government-backed short-time work programs that allows them to keep employees on the payroll while they await better times. In Germany, Europe’s largest economy, the federal labor agency pays at least 60% of the salary of employees who are on reduced or zero hours. Some 10.66 million people were registered for that program in March and April, and 1.06 million followed in May, the labor agency said — though it stressed that this doesn´t mean all of them were actually put on short-time work. Germany has a population of 83 million. The European jobless figures also appear flattered by the fact that some unemployed people likely stopped looking for work and stopped counting as jobseekers. That seems to be the case in a country like Italy, where the jobless rate actually fell, to 6.3% from 8% in seasonally adjusted terms. In Germany, the unemployment rate rose modestly to 6.3% from 5.8% according to its own labor agency measures. On Wednesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s governing coalition was spending a second day hammering out a stimulus package meant to help kick-start the economy. It’s expected to be worth as much as 80-100 billion euros ($89-112 billion). Germany already is offering a total of more than 1 trillion euros in aid via various packages, which include money to tide small companies and individual entrepreneurs through virus-related closures and to pump capital into bigger companies where needed. The crisis has derailed the government´s dedication to keeping its budget balanced, long a point of pride. After six years in the black, it is borrowing 156 billion euros to finance the existing rescue packages and cover an expected shortfall in tax revenue. Germany started loosening coronavirus restrictions on April 20, about a month after they were introduced, and the easing has gathered pace since. However, the economy went into a recession in the first quarter and that is expected to deepen in the current quarter.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has claimed that “herd immunity” from the Wuhan coronavirus will be achieved by Autumn of 2021 at the earliest. Josep Jansa, an epidemiologist at the ECDC, said that the Chinese virus continues to change rapidly and that the agency has been reluctant to give solid advice for issues like international travel. But he said that the ECDC has offered indicators to EU member states on what stage of the infection they may be in. The epidemiologist added, during an interview with Finnish broadcaster YLE on Monday: “People have learned to do the right thing in terms of hygiene. This first wave is also waning. We believe that the situation will calm down by the summer.” Jansa went on to speak of the negative consequences of the virus, saying: “The situation has serious consequences for society. Unemployment, debt, poverty are rising. It is very difficult for very many people. Many have lost relatives. Some have lived in complete isolation, and it affects mental health.” Swedish Virus Deaths 'Catastrophically High' But Herd Immunity Not on Horizon https://t.co/dCU3qCmaY5 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 23, 2020  While most countries enacted lockdown measures to stop the spread of the virus, Sweden did not and has been seen by some as adopting an approach to achieve so-called “herd immunity”. A report from last month revealed that only 7.3 per cent of Stockholmers, the area in Sweden most affected by the virus, had antibodies against the virus, the number reduced to just 3.7 per cent nationwide. Jansa said herd immunity, which can require up to 60 per cent of the public to have antibodies, is unlikely to be seen anywhere in the world in the coming months. “Herd immunity will not be achieved until the Autumn of 2021, not here in Stockholm either. There will be some degree of protection, but herd protection requires that 60 per cent of people have contracted the disease,” he said.

Those protesting the police involved death of George Floyd can now receive funding if they are injured, bail money if they are arrested, and money to pay for coronavirus-related medical bills thanks to Saturday Night Live star Chris Redd, who announced a fund he set up for what he called “front line protesters.” “I’m working on a relief fund for front line protestors who may contract COVID19 over the next couple of weeks due to body to body contact. I would hate for my people fighting for justice struggle later because of it. If you would like to help, let’s connect!,” Redd said on Monday. By Tuesday night, the fund was live and well on its way to reaching its goal of $250,000. And here we go!!!!https://t.co/M4VTgrjnpS — Chris Redd (@Reddsaidit) June 2, 2020  The fund’s mission statement? As thousands of people take to the streets to protest racial discrimination and the many Black Lives lost at the hands of injustice,  we also have the unfortunate fact that this deadly pandemic is still upon us. The lives at risk of the injustice being fought against are also the most vulnerable to COVID-19. Many will not be in position to pay the inevitable cost associated with their brave efforts. This fund is to assist those that contract this disease while protesting and other protest related injuries as many are being attacked while speaking out. Monies raised, the fundraiser says, will help get protesters tested, help with coronavirus-related medical bills, and will provide bail money should protesters be arrested. Chris Redd is just the latest Hollywood star to either donate or help raise funds for those taking to the streets to protest across the country. The fund went live on the heels of a dark week in America, as mass looting, vandalism, and terror were rampant across the country. In New York City, where Chris Redd lives, NYPD Chief of Department Terence Monahan said his officers “made 700 arrests” on Monday night. “So, if there were 2,000 out here. We put handcuffs on 700 of them. The problem being is that they’re back out here again tonight,” Monahan said. The looters, Monahan said, are “using the cover of protests to fill their pockets.” As of this writing, Redd’s fund has raised more than $66,000.

ROME — Dr. Alberto Zangrillo, the head of intensive care at the San Raffaele hospital in Milan, told Italian media Sunday that Italy has beaten the coronavirus and it is counterproductive to keep attention focused on it. Speaking on the RAI 3 television network, Dr. Zangrillo said that “the swabs performed over the last 10 days showed a viral load that was absolutely infinitesimal in quantitative terms compared to the ones carried out on patients a month or two ago.” Professor Zangrillo was citing a new study by Massimo Clementi, director of the Microbiology and Virology Laboratory at the San Raffaele hospital, which is due to be published shortly. The Lombardy region, where the hospital is located, has been Italy’s hardest hit in terms of absolute numbers of those infected by the coronavirus as well as in fatalities. The study shows that, “in reality, from the clinical point of view, the virus no longer exists,” Zangrillo said. The doctor declared that his conclusions are corroborated by studies from Milan’s Vita-Salute San Raffaele University as well as by Italian virologist Dr. Guido Silvestri, chair of pathology at Emory University in Atlanta, who has stated that the retreat of COVID-19 “continues undaunted.” Zangrillo also said that to continue drawing attention to the coronavirus can wind up looking “ridiculous” from the perspective of clinical virology. Italian officials, who have gone to great lengths to encourage caution, reacted swiftly to Dr. Zangrillo’s comments. “I can only express great surprise and absolute puzzlement over the statements made by Professor Zangrillo,” said Franco Locatelli, the head of Italy’s supreme health council. “Just look at the number of new cases confirmed every day for evidence of the persistent circulation of the virus in Italy.” In point of fact, however, there were only 318 new cases discovered in all of Italy during the 24-hour period from June 1-2, despite aggressive testing, true to the ongoing trend in reduction. On June 2, the number of active cases of coronavirus in Italy dropped below 40,000 for the first time since late March, to a total of 39,893, continuing a declining trend of some 10,000 per week. Deaths with coronavirus during the same 24-hour period fell to 55 out of an average 1,800 deaths per day in Italy from other causes. Globally, 360,412 people have died with the coronavirus, according to Johns Hopkins University, putting it roughly in the range of worldwide deaths from the 2008-2009 swine flu, estimated at between 151,700 and 575,400 people. Coming to Zangrillo’s defense, Dr. Matteo Bassetti, director of the infectious diseases clinic at the San Martino hospital in Genoa, said Monday that the virus seems to have lost much of its lethal force. The coronavirus “may now be different: the firepower it had two months ago is not the same firepower it has today,” he said. Follow @tdwilliamsrome

During a press conference on Tuesday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) said that while he is concerned that protesting in New York City might cause a resurgence of coronavirus cases, “grappling with an extraordinary crisis, seated in 400 years of American racism…is not the same question as the understandably aggrieved store owner or the devout religious person who wants to go back to services.” De Blasio was asked why he was merely recommending that protesters stay home, while retail stores were banned from opening and religious services with more than 10 people were banned and whether there were different rules for different people. He responded, “We’re in the middle of a national crisis, a deep-seated national crisis. There is no comparison. I’m sorry, I do feel for the store owners. I really do. … And I’m so happy that on Monday, we’re going to start to open up.” After talking about the coronavirus numbers, de Blasio said that religious leaders in the city have said they wouldn’t move prematurely. He also expressed concern that there might be a resurgence of the coronavirus because of the protests, and that he wishes people would stay home in the name of health. He added, “But this is the other piece of the equation, when you see a nation, an entire nation, simultaneously grappling with an extraordinary crisis, seated in 400 years of American racism, I’m sorry, that is not the same question as the understandably aggrieved store owner or the devout religious person who wants to go back to services.” De Blasio also stated that the protests have only taken place over a few days are taking place outdoors and there’s less risk than having people indoors.

Donald Trump Jr. on Monday wondered why the establishment media’s obsession with restrictions spurred by novel coronavirus virtually disappeared, asking why such outlets are no longer condemning “mass gatherings that would have been so deadly due to COVID 19 just a few days ago” as rioters take to the streets. “Why is the media no longer concerned, and often almost gleeful, about all the mass gatherings that would have been so deadly due to COVID 19 just a few days ago?” Trump asked, noting the shift in coronavirus coverage as weeks of emphasizing social distancing abruptly came to a halt. “I guess these people magically aren’t ‘killing their grandmas’ by going outside anymore?!?” he added: Why is the media no longer concerned, and often almost gleeful, about all the mass gatherings that would have been so deadly due to COVID 19 just a few days ago? I guess these people magically aren’t “killing their grandmas” by going outside anymore?!? 🙄 — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) June 1, 2020  Many progressive personalities who condemned Americans taking part in the peaceful Reopen America protests across the nation — and who criticized the president for urging states to reopen — are refusing to extend the same critiques to protesters flocking to the streets this week and participating in demonstrations that have been, largely, dominated by violence and looters. “@realDonaldTrump already has the smell of death on him, and he is going to get more people killed with his ignorance, cowardice, chaos & incompetence. Period. This ain’t a carnival game,” actor Jeffrey Wright said in April: 👉🏾@realDonaldTrump already has the smell of death on him, and he is going to get more people killed with his ignorance, cowardice, chaos & incompetence. Period. This ain't a carnival game. Liberate America.✊🏾🇺🇸 — Jeffrey Wright (@jfreewright) April 17, 2020  Actor Ron Perlman implied that Trump was guilty of negligent homicide for his tweets promoting the liberation of states, and pop star Pink blasted Americans who gathered to demand leaders to reopen the country so they could get back to work: Maybe we should all protest the protesters?Hand out waivers for people to sign that says if they get sick they wave their right to healthcare.then they also agree to pay hospital bills of any single person they come in contact with. I feel like I’m living in the movie IDIOCRACY. — P!nk (@Pink) May 2, 2020  She has not extended the same proposal to this week’s protesters. Social distancing guidelines and restrictions limiting the gatherings of large groups still remain in place in most parts of the country. However, many members of the establishment media have demonstratively eased their calls for coronavirus-era safety precautions as chaos, in the name of “justice,” consumed U.S. streets.

A police lieutenant colonel has become the latest Russian official to mysteriously fall from a window amid the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, local media reported Monday. The 45-year-old woman, identified solely as Yulia B. by local authorities, allegedly fell from the fifth floor of Moscow City Clinical Hospital No. 24 on the evening of May 30th, where she was being treated for the coronavirus. She was described as a senior expert for the Forensic Center of the Interior Ministry, a government agency. Initially, reports suggested that she had died on impact, although these have since been contradicted by claims that she survived, but is currently being treated at an intensive care unit. According to Komsomolskaya Pravda, the policewoman left her ward to go into the corridor and consequently “fell” from the window and landed on the grass below. There has been no information on what caused her to fall. The incident comes after three Russian health workers fell out of windows over the past two months in mysterious circumstances during the coronavirus outbreak. All three of them had also expressed concerns about the Kremlin’s response to the pandemic. The most recent of these victims is 37-year-old Alexander Shulepov, who last month fell from the second floor of a hospital in rural Voronezh, breaking several ribs and suffering a skull fracture. He is understood to have survived his injuries. In April, the acting head doctor of a hospital in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk, Elena Nepomnyashchaya, died soon after another supposed fall from a window at the hospital where she was in charge. Before the incident, she had complained about her staff being forced to treat coronavirus patients without the necessary personal protective equipment (PPE). The previous day, Dr. Natalya Lebedeva — the head of the emergency medical service at Star City, where the majority of Russia’s cosmonauts are trained — allegedly committed suicide by jumping from the building after failing to contain the outbreak. The hospital insisted her death was merely a “tragic accident.” Falling or defenestration from buildings appears to have become a signature manner of death for numerous government critics in Russia over the past decade. Before this year’s incidents, the most recent case was that of the 32-year-old investigative journalist Maxim Borodin, who was thrown out of a fourth-floor window in April 2018 after investigating Russia’s military involvement in Syria. Having initially slow to pick up cases, Russia has now become one of the countries most badly hit by the coronavirus. As of Tuesday, Russian health authorities had recorded 423,741 coronavirus infections and 5,037 deaths, although some analysts believe the figure could be much higher as a result of lack of testing or even government coverups.

The massive protests over the death of George Floyd across the United States, which have devolved into rioting and looting mostly at night, cast doubt on the partial reopening of several non-essential businesses in cities plagued by the unrest as of Tuesday. Moreover, coronavirus testing sites have shut down in at least four states — Pennsylvania, Florida, California, and Illinois, over the violent protests, “limiting cities’ ability to track the virus just as thousands of people participate in crowded demonstrations across the country,” Politico reported Monday. Tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets in cities across America, with many rioting and looting at night, to express anger over the death of George Floyd, a black man, at the hands of the Minneapolis police. Two independent autopsies have deemed Floyd’s death a homicide. Now-fired white police officer Derek Chauvin kneed Floyd’s neck for several minutes. The mass gatherings in dozens of cities have prompted fears by government leaders and health experts of a spike in cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, which has disproportionally plagued minority populations. Many of the demonstrators have disregarded coronavirus mitigation policies imposed by local and state governments, particularly social distancing. The delayed reopenings could intensify the coronavirus negative impact on the economy, including the job market for minorities. In the nation’s capital on Monday, Mayor Muriel Bowser said the city is “very concerned” about the potential for a COVID-19 spike in the wake of several days of massive protests and riots, the local Fox 5 News reported. The mayor has scheduled D.C. to continue its phased reopening of non-essential businesses this week after starting the process last Friday, May 29. District officials have been relying on the community spread metric to make reopening decisions. While the city has excluded COVID-19 ­cases at confined facilities when calculating the community spread of the virus, Dr. LaQuandra Nesbitt, the city’s top public health official, said the city would take cases from the mass gatherings into account, the Washington Post revealed. Dr. Nesbitt proclaimed: As we ramp up our contact tracing, we will try as best as we can to link their exposure to having participated in one of these events, but it could be tricky to do so. If people are going to work, if they are going to dine in at the outdoor restaurants and we do a complete interview of all the activities that they participated in, we may be able to link their activity or participation to one of these protests. D.C. officials said Monday they would announce the criteria for lifting the additional restrictions on non-essential businesses later in the week. On Sunday, the Seattle Times reported that in that city, there is “fear the weekend’s destruction could make recovery even more difficult for businesses already wounded by the pandemic shutdown.” “This isn’t going to make that any easier,” Jon Scholes, CEO of the Downtown Seattle Association, told the Seattle Times. “It’s something we’ve just never seen in downtown Seattle.” In California, some businesses are also considering postponing the reopening over the demonstrations. Santa Clara County Public Health Officials eased the shelter-in-place order last Friday, allowing in-store retail, outdoor dining, and other opportunities. However, store owners received an urgent alert by the Alameda Business District, warning them to “consider boarding up their storefronts,” ABC 7 News reported on Tuesday. Other regions in California are also delaying the reopening until further notice. On Monday, the Los Angeles Times reported: South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa has postponed its planned reopening following the significant protests, violent clashes between demonstrators and police, and looting that have rocked Southern California in recent days. The upscale mall had planned to throw open its doors for customers Monday following a lengthy coronavirus-related closure but, in an online message, officials said the reopening would be delayed to an unannounced date. On Monday, CNBC pointed out that the demonstrations might derail Nevada’s scheduled reopening of casinos on Thursday. “Las Vegas is getting ready to launch a ‘Welcome Back’ ad campaign to encourage visitors to come. But now guests will have to weigh not only the risks of coronavirus but also of civil unrest,” the news outlet noted. “The current circumstances are tragic and negative for any business that requires physical access — certainly casinos would be included,” David Katz, a gaming industry analyst at Jeffries, told CNBC. The protests turned riots may also impact the planned reopening of casinos in Missouri, the news outlet added. In places like Chicago, where Mayor Lori Lightfoot (D) said the city would move forward with its third-phase reopening plans for Wednesday despite the protests and rioting, businesses may not be ready to reopen their doors. On Monday, the Chicago mayor reportedly acknowledged: I’m concerned about businesses all over the city who were preparing and saw the additional resources that they were putting in to opening up their businesses, community groups that were ready to start fully engaging with them. For many of those people, those resources and efforts were reduced to kindling or went down in flames. Minnesota Tim Walz (D) declared on Saturday that a spike in coronavirus cases is “inevitable” after the protests and riots.

The Associated Press (AP) on Tuesday reported on leaked documents from the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) that showed its officials were well aware China was withholding vital information about the coronavirus in January, even as W.H.O. leadership extravagantly praised China for its transparency. The AP report described a massive disconnect between W.H.O.’s public statements and the private frustration of its officials as the Chinese “sat on releasing the genetic map, or genome, of the deadly virus for over a week after multiple government labs had fully decoded it, not sharing details key to designing tests, drugs, and vaccines.” The report noted that even after a Chinese lab seemingly broke with Communist Party officials and published the genome of the Wuhan coronavirus, “China stalled for at least two more weeks on giving W.H.O. the details it needed, according to recordings of multiple internal meetings held by the UN health agency in January.” “Although the W.H.O. continued to publicly commend China, the recordings show they were concerned China was not sharing enough information to assess the risk posed by the new virus, costing the world valuable time,” the AP report said.  One W.H.O. official ruefully noted that the international health organization was getting vital information about the coronavirus “15 minutes before it appears on CCTV,” the Chinese state television network. The AP oddly insisted these revelations “do not support the narrative of either the U.S. or China,” even though it is exactly the narrative of the U.S. that China withheld information and gave W.H.O. false information, and W.H.O. spread those falsehoods while commending Beijing for its high degree of cooperation. The AP writers seemed to think W.H.O. should get a break because its officials were privately seething in frustration, rather than enthusiastically “colluding” with Beijing as willing agents of its political agenda. For example, some of the emails uncovered by the AP show W.H.O. officials worrying that if they openly accused China of wrongdoing, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) would stop cooperating entirely, and might even commit violence against Chinese scientists who were trying to help. That’s hardly a refutation of the U.S. narrative, since American critics have long suspected W.H.O. played softball with China – putting hundreds of thousands of lives around the world at risk – because it knew Beijing was ready to play hardball with them. It also does not speak well of W.H.O. that its officials refused to discuss the report with Associated Press interviewers unless they could be supplied with “audio or written transcripts of the recorded meetings, which could not be supplied while protecting sources.” In other words, they would not say anything unless they knew they had been caught red-handed spreading false information about a historically devastating pandemic to the world. The leaked documents also confirmed that W.H.O. knew the CCP was preventing Chinese scientists from discussing the coronavirus and ordering the destruction of samples, which is a direct contravention of W.H.O. protocols. W.H.O. Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was fully aware of these issues, but deliberately chose not to mention them when he finally declared a global health emergency at the end of January, instead gushing over the “incredible things” China had supposedly done to “limit the transmission of the virus to other countries.” Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) was quick to note that the AP report confirmed some of the worst suspicions critics held about both W.H.O. and the Chinese government. “Now we know for sure that Communist China hid critical data that could have altered the global response to the pandemic,” Scott said on Tuesday. “Communist China was more concerned with their global image than with saving lives. And instead of exposing Communist China’s deceit to the global community, the World Health Organization praised their response and was complicit in China’s cover-up.” “The W.H.O. clearly is not qualified to handle a worldwide health crisis, which is why I’m leading an investigation into their failures that led to the spread of the coronavirus,” Scott continued. “The president was right to cut funding to the WHO, and now the U.S. must take steps to hold Communist China accountable for the spread of the virus.”

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) dismissed growing impatience with her economic lockdown orders Monday and recommended residents take to the Internet to learn how to cut their own hair. Whitmer is easing some restrictions in the coming weeks, but has not budged on allowing barber shops and hair salons to legally reopen. Hair salons will still not be open, even though the stay-at-home order has been lifted. Governor Whitmer suggests people Google how to cut hair. Read More: https://t.co/Y78IJOJAnM pic.twitter.com/5nY400hblt — Mid-Michigan NOW (@midmichigannow) June 1, 2020  “Like me, you need a haircut desperately? A couple more weeks of this and we may be back in a place where we’re able to do that safely,” she said. “It’s still going to require strict protocols. It’s still going to require every one of us keeping our guard up and doing the right thing,” she continued, saying she hopes to take more steps before July. “But we’ve got to follow the data. And so if you’re one of those people that’s going to Ohio, I hope, I pray,” she said, holding up a mask, “that you’re doing your part not to bring COVID-19 home.” For those who have not traveled, she said, “Google how to do a haircut or throw your hair in a ponytail or curl it and get through the next couple of weeks so we can resume some of these things.” Whitmer’s Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs requires 1,800 hours of coursework “satisfactorily” completed in order to obtain a barber license in Michigan. Last Wednesday, a coalition of more than 350 salons, barber shops, and spa owners unveiled an eight-step plan to safely reopen their establishments. “Michigan’s licensed cosmetologists, barbers and their team members are capable, ready, and excited to get back to work meeting the needs of our clients,” Lisa Dennison, a regional director for Michigan Supercuts and Cost Cutters salons, said, WDIV reported. “Our salons have always met detailed health and safety standards, and we’ve developed a comprehensive plan to go even further to keep everyone who walks through the door healthy. We urge Gov. Whitmer to lift her ban on our jobs immediately.” Kyle Olson is a reporter for Breitbart News.

The establishment media and Democrats are encouraging Americans to go out and riot, which proves the coronavirus lockdowns are purely political. Item: You can’t social distance when you riot. Item: You can’t social distance when you protest. So we now know these lockdowns and all this crap about social distancing was a lie, because what you have here are the media encouraging their own viewers to riot and protest, and Democrats encouraging their own voters to riot and protest… And I think it’s safe to assume if the media and Democrats believed the coronavirus would kill their viewers and voters, they would not encourage such a thing. Here are some perfect examples… The hideous Gretchen Whitmer, the hideous Democrat governor of Michigan, spent weeks gleefully punishing her own constituents for the sins of going to church, buying garden seeds, getting a haircut, and holding house parties… Anyone who dared ignore Gretchen’s Kafka-esque outlawing of the very things that make life worth living, were harassed, fined, arrested, and basically terrorized by the State — all in the name of the threat of the coronavirus. And God help those who dared protest her tyranny, God help those protesters, who she shamed, blamed, and used to extend her anti-science lockdowns. Well, well, well — will you look at the hideous Gretchen now… Suddenly large gatherings and the coronavirus is no real problem in Michigan! How else to explain why the hideous Gretchen all of a sudden turned around to support large gatherings (unless, of course, you’re going to church). So we can at least thank the rioters for exposing the hideous Gretchen for the tyrant she really is. What’s more, after the rioters encouraged her to come out in favor of large gatherings, Gretchen’s entire rationale for lockdowns collapsed to a point where she finally surrendered on Monday and put an end to them. Thank you, rioters! And then there’s Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who led by example to prove lockdowns and social distancing are purely political by taking it to the streets! Yep, there she was, a walking-talking (but not very bright) piece of proof America’s political class know these lockdowns are a joke… There she was protesting outside the White House on Saturday with a large group of people who were definitely not practicing social distancing… There she was, openly violating Washington DC’s lockdown orders… Once again, let’s thank the rioters for exposing the truth. What more proof do you need than that, than a U.S. Senator violating these anti-science lockdowns? Well, how about the media’s turnaround? For two months you’ve had CNNLOL, MSNBC, the New York Times, and the Washington Post literally shrieking at anyone who dared go to church, the beach, or a house party… But now, thanks to the rioters, the media have all come out in full-throated support of violating lockdowns and ignoring social distancing. The facts about these pointless lockdowns are this… If you’re under the age of 50, the coronavirus is no more lethal than the seasonal flu. Almost all of these rioters are under the age of 50, so there is no real threat. Hell, those in their teens and twenties are probably in more danger of dying in a car accident than of the Chinese Flu. Bottom line: there is no reason to keep anyone but the elderly in quarantine. But in order to keep us locked down, in order to ensure Trump’s economy went south and they could institute cheat-by-mail, Democrats and the media (but I repeat myself) refused to inform us of those facts. Thanks to the rioters, we are finally liberate from that lie. When the rioters flooded into dozens of Democrat-run cities, Democrats like Whitmer and Harris, and fake news outlets like CNN and MSNBC, had no choice but to end their opposition to lockdowns and stupid social distancing rules. What else could they do? They had to support their left-wing terrorist allies in Antifa and Black Lives Matter. So what we have now are Democrats eating each other alive with all this blue on blue violence, which has no effect whatsoever on those of us in Red America — well, other than the fact that these riots have  finally forced and end to the coronavirus tyranny. So… That’s called a win-win. And when you add in the fact that Democrat and media support for these riots proves beyond any doubt there is no need for cheat-by-mail, that’s called a win-win-win.  Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

Nigel Farage has said that China’s increasingly aggressive foreign policy stance since it let the Wuhan virus loose onto the world must force Prime Minister Boris Johnson to get tough on the communist country. Leaked documents from the World Health Organization (WHO) revealed that China had withheld vital information on coronavirus in the early days of the outbreak. While for a fortnight afterwards, China delayed sharing critical information to the WHO on human-to-human transmission, according to records obtained by the Associated Press and reported on Tuesday. The latest report of a Chinese coverup of the deadly pandemic has handed the West more impetus to get tough on China. Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, in particular, has been consistent in calling for the British government to take a stronger position on the communist state’s transgressions on the global stage. Speaking to The Sydney Morning Herald on Tuesday, Mr Farage noted that China had shown its “true colours” in recent weeks, with its increased aggression towards those who call for the eastern powerhouse to take responsibility for the spread of the virus. Last month in retaliation for Canberra calling for an independent investigation into the virus’s origins, China put an 80 per cent tariff on Australian barley. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has also called for an international probe into origins of coronavirus. The calls were timed with several reports that the UK is planning to pull out of a deal for the all-but-state-owned Huawei to build 35 per cent of the UK’s 5G network, which intelligence allies warn represents a security risk. In response, Chinese state-owned media said that the UK would pay a “price” for expelling the tech firm. Report: UK Likely Funding Chinese Communist Military Through Joint University Projects https://t.co/Sh74XVN5kf — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 2, 2020  The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has also threatened “countermeasures” after the UK offered to extend visa rights — resulting in a pathway to citizenship — for Hong Kongers in response to China’s parliament rubberstamping a ‘security’ law that would effectively crack down on democracy advocates in the city. “The cat’s out of the bag, we now know what we’re dealing with,” Mr Farage told The Sydney Morning Herald. “The truth of it is if we are really going to get tough with China and we want to try and hurt China’s ability to become this global superpower then we’re going to have to face the facts that in the short term this will cost us too,” the Brexiteer said, hinting that China might make good of its threats, likely compatible to the economic sanctions it levelled against Australia. Amidst the intimidation, Mr Farage said: “It’s not something we can do that’s cost-free; it isn’t cost-free but, in terms of strategy, in terms of geopolitics, this is the biggest geopolitical struggle since the fall of the Berlin Wall 30 years ago.” Mr Farage has already committed to boycotting “mass-produced Chinese rubbish” and urged fellow Britons to do the same. After coronavirus exposed Britain’s reliance on China for medical equipment, the government said that would be exploring self-reliance from the communist state as well as looking to aid the growth of British tech companies to wean the UK’s telecommunications networks off of Huawei by 2023, with the company already imbedded in Vodaphone’s, EE’s, and Three’s infrastructure. Boris ‘Changed His Mind’ on Huawei, as Govt Explores Support for British Tech: Reports https://t.co/fqhpajZ0Io — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 1, 2020  Last week, U.S. President Donald Trump, who takes a hard line on China, postponed the G7 summit, suggesting that he might instead host a “G11”. Comprised of the usual G7 members — the U.S., UK, Italy, Germany, France, Canada, and Japan — Russia, South Korea, India, and Australia may also be invited, signalling the American president is looking to bolster support in the zone surrounding the communist superpower. The UK’s defence committee chairman Tobias Ellwood has also proposed the formation of an “Atlantic Charter 2.0” with the United States and Britain “leading the pursuit to design a new and defendable international architecture”. “Its purpose would be to establish a fresh international framework to promote and defend human rights, democracy, and trade (including digital) in contrast to the closed model envisioned by Beijing,” Mr Ellwood said on Tuesday. Mr Farage warned, however, that if Mr Johnson does not take this opportunity to stand up to the Communist tyrant, the Brexiteer is ready to return to frontline politics to campaign for Britain to do so instead. “And of course if the Brexit Party does have to reactivate you can rest assured that China will be up there in one of the top two or three policies,” Mr Farage said. “With my base, the debate on China has started [but] it’s still got a long way to go.” Exclusive: ‘Freedom and Autonomy in Hong Kong is Dead’ Says HK Watch Founder https://t.co/Xksx9OY0pd — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 28, 2020 

Green Party mayor Femke Halsema, who was photographed at a protest without a mask, has been accused of “spitting on” residents over her handling of the mass demonstration. A protest march in Amsterdam took place on Monday, with residents coming out in sympathy with Black Lives Matter protests in the United States and organisers saying they also wanted to bring attention to racism in Europe, as well. Among the thousands who turned out was the hard-left Green Party mayor of Amsterdam Femke Halsema, who mingled with the tightly-pressed crowds and was photographed without a mask covering her face. Dutch government coronavirus lockdown rules make a 1.5 metre spacing between pedestrians in public a legal requirement, but only strictly require masks be worn while on public transport — a demand backed up by police action and fines. Hoe is dit nog uit te leggen aan al die Amsterdammers die – ook financieel – lijden onder de coronaregels die wél door Femke #Halsema zijn gehandhaafd? pic.twitter.com/6by9rX4kBw — Forum voor Democratie (@fvdemocratie) June 1, 2020  The appearance of the mayor, and the fact the protest was able to take place at such a large scale at all while the country is otherwise being strictly controlled over coronavirus, has led to heavy criticism, reports Het Parool. All partner parties of the nation’s centre-right coalition government have condemned the event, remarking the images of so many Dutch residents out and protesting in public would undermine public faith in the coronavirus restrictions. Geert Wilders, leader of the Dutch Party for Freedom — a noted anti-mass migration campaigner who lives under constant police supervision because of his outspoken criticism of Islamism — noted Tuesday that “Halsema must go!” and told Ongehoord Nederland that it was unacceptable for the mayor of a great city to behave like a street activist and that she had shown no respect for the rules the rest of the Dutch people are expected to live by. Dutch journalist at the state NOS broadcaster Joris Van Poppel noted on Tuesday that ultimately, the mayor’s future would be decided in two weeks’ time if there was a sudden spike in coronavirus infections traced back to the demonstration she allowed to go ahead. Responding to criticism, Mayor Halsema said she only expected hundreds, not thousands, to turn up to the rally. To disperse it would have required police to deploy “with a hard hand”, and she was not willing to do that. Supporters of the mayor protested on Twitter that because many people at the demonstration wore face masks, outrage about the event was hypocritical. The apparent hypocrisy of the mayor’s protest appearance has been underlined by prominent Amsterdam residents, who compare the mayor attending the protest unmasked this week with her blocking the annual Second World War commemorations that were due to take place on May 4th. Rather than the typical annual commemorations of the Netherlands being liberated from Nazi occupation on May 4th-5th, which sees mass crowds laying flowers in the same city square as Monday’s demonstration, a small number of dignitaries including Mayor Halsema, the Dutch king, and a single survivor of the war laid flowers in an empty square instead. Amsterdam theatre producer Albert Verlinde was cited by Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad as expressing that frustration when he said: “Ms Halsema personally intervened so there should be only one survivor on the [Amsterdam city square] to lay flowers and now she allows this, while hard-working entrepreneurs and well-meaning Dutch do their utmost to comply with the 1.5-metre rule… Halsema spits in our faces.”

Liberty University announced this week that it had zero Chinese virus cases on campus during the spring semester. The university was criticized by mainstream media outlets over its decision to reopen the campus open in March at the outset of the outbreak. University President Jerry Falwell Jr. wrote in a letter to students, ““We are thankful to God that nobody who lived in a campus residence hall or who worked in a campus office tested positive for the virus.” According to a report by the College Fix, Liberty University reported zero cases of the Chinese virus despite criticism that the university prematurely reopened their campus to students in March when they returned from spring break. At the same time, most universities and colleges around the nation had already decided to suspend campus operations to mitigate the spread of the virus. But this week, Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. told students that no students or staff contracted the Chinese virus during the spring semester. “We are thankful to God that nobody who lived in a campus residence hall or who worked in a campus office tested positive for the virus,” Falwell said in a message to students. “No positive COVID-19 test anywhere in our region was linked to Liberty students who returned to their dorm rooms after Spring Break.” “The only COVID cases in the university community were employees working from home or offices off-campus and their infections were all traced to contacts in the local community with persons infected with COVID who were not related to Liberty,” Falwell added. During an interview on Fox News, Falwell Jr. said that their approach to the Chinese virus crisis should be a “model” for other universities. Student Carter Chapman argues that the university was able to maintain standard campus operations by restricting large gathering and access to common areas. “All classes were moved online and all university buildings were open but were restricted to ten people at a time,” said Chapman. “There were no places to sit and relax as all tables, chairs and booths were taped off and closed due to the virus.” Stay tuned to Breitbart News for more campus updates.

Maine Democrat Gov. Janet Mills reversed her decision last week to allow restaurants in the state’s southern counties to reopen June 1, suggesting to owners they sell already purchased perishable foods to prisons at the government contract rate. Just days before restaurants in Cumberland, York, and Androscoggin Counties were slated to reopen to allow for indoor dining with health and safety measures in place, the governor reversed course, claiming an uptick in COVID-19 cases in the region. “A date for the reopening of dine-in services in these counties is yet to be determined,” the Mills administration said. Mills’ decision to block the restaurants from reopening as the vacation season is underway, caused an uproar among business owners who had already purchased sufficient food for potential customers, called back employees, and implemented health and safety measures, the Maine Examiner reported: Mills was the recipient of further backlash, however, when she advised restaurant owners stuck with perishable foods of the “opportunity” to sell their provisions to the Maine Department of Corrections (MDOC) “at a price equivalent to the price paid for the same items through MDOC’s food contract.” In a statement to Breitbart News, Maine Rep. Larry Lockman (R) said Mills “imposed martial law lite” on Mainers back on March 18. “Her dictatorship has been marked by no less than 55 executive orders,” he said. “The first one forced restaurant owners statewide to close their dining rooms, without any prior notice, and toss the contents of their food lockers into the dumpster. Now she’s sucker-punched dining establishments in Maine’s three southern-most counties with her flip-flop on re-opening.” The Mills administration said in a statement released Saturday MDOC would “support” the restaurants: The MDOC has capacity to purchase perishable and non-perishable food items, except for dairy, at a price equivalent to the price paid for the same items through MDOC’s food contract. Purchased food will be served to staff and inmates. Restaurants interested in selling to MDOC would need to be a registered vendor (PDF)with the State of Maine. Payments to vendors typically take two weeks. “I hope this move will provide some measure of relief to businesses in these counties as we work to protect public health, keep Maine people healthy and alive, and mitigate the spread of this deadly virus so we can safely reopen,” Mills said. “There is no scientific basis for these orders,” Lockman said. “It’s all about the arbitrary exercise of unchecked executive power by an unreconstructed 1960s radical who posed as a moderate to win election in 2018.” As the Bangor Daily News reported Tuesday, to date, 284 Mainers have been hospitalized with the infection caused by the Chinese coronavirus, and 89 people have died. There have been 2,349 confirmed and likely cases in the state. Those who have fully recovered from the illness number 1,586, leaving 674 active and likely cases, a drop from 684 on Sunday. Last week, a federal judge allowed to stand Mills’ order requiring tourists to self-quarantine for two weeks after entering Maine, which is known as “Vacationland.” The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a statement of interest in support of a lawsuit by campground and restaurant owners. According to a statement by Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband of the Civil Rights Division: The United States Constitution requires government to protect the privileges and immunities of all citizens in our nation. These privileges and immunities include the right of Americans to travel freely anywhere in our country, and state governments cannot limit the right of out-of-state Americans to travel to their state unless doing so is substantially related to protecting the public safety. The Department of Justice remains committed to defending the constitutional rights of all Americans no matter where they live. The department will continue to be especially vigilant of any infringement on the right to travel that unduly harms the ability of Americans to earn a living and support their families. In response to the DOJ’s statement of interest, Mills said, she was “deeply disappointed – and frankly disgusted – that the U.S Department of Justice is making a concerted effort to undermine the health of the people of Maine.” The governor added the DOJ did not raise similar objections “when the President and his own task force took steps to limit travel.” Mills said the required quarantine for visitors is “a proven tool to prevent the spread of this deadly disease.” “It seems to me that [the DOJ’s] only actual ‘interest’ here is, at best, political or, at worst, to harm Mainers, not defend them,” she stated. Lockman, however, said, “Jackboot Janet has effectively killed Maine’s summer tourist season, and, with it, hundreds, perhaps thousands of family-owned independent businesses.” “I’m afraid the damage to Maine’s fragile small-business economy will be permanent and irreversible,” he added.

As Mexico returns to normal activities, health officials revealed the country surpassed 10,100 fatalities from Coronavirus (COVID-19). The most recent figures rank Mexico seventh globally for fatalities and 14 for confirmed cases despite widespread allegations of under-counting. During a nightly news conference, Mexico’s Undersecretary of Health Hugo Lopez Gatell and staff revealed the most recent numbers showing 93,435 confirmed cases and 10,167 fatalities. Al 01 de junio de 2020 hay 93,435 casos confirmados, 16,303 confirmados activos y 38,497 sospechosos por #COVID19.

The real scope of the pandemic could be much worse since Lopez Gatell and his staff are widely accused of under-counting cases. Lopez Gatell admitted his figures only accounted for government hospital patients. That practice pushed several states to release their own figures showing between 30 to 50 percent more infections. Mexico continues to see between 2,500 to 3,200 new cases per day. The country began its return to normal activities on Monday where businesses in some regions are allowed to resume operations in a limited capacity.

PARIS (AP) – Parisians who have been cooped up for months with takeout food and coffee will be able to savour their steaks tartare in the fresh air and cobbled streets of the City of Light once more – albeit in smaller numbers. The city famed for its vibrant cafe society and coffee culture will get some of its pre-lockdown life back as cafes and restaurants partially reopen Tuesday. The Paris City Hall authorized the opening of outside seating areas, but indoors will remain closed to customers until at least June 22. Dampening the mood of new freedom, social distancing of one meter (about three feet) between tables will be obligatory and drastically reduce the numbers. For the city well-known for its tiny chairs and fashionably-small 50-centimeter-wide (20-inch-wide) round tables that often touch, this will lower capacity in some outside areas by over half. To help matters, the normally space-restricting Paris City Hall is now allowing restaurateurs to be expansive – and have issued an authorization for them to enlarge their outside areas, or create one, without the normal legal red tape until Sept. 30. To do this, they will have to sign a charter promising to respect “pedestrian traffic, the cleanliness of the premises, safety or even noise reduction vis-à-vis residents.” But some restaurateurs have said that they haven’t received the charter, and the details remain fuzzy and confusing.

In one of his restaurant-bars La Belle Hortense, he said that out of a normal capacity of 126 people, there will just be room for eight. “It´s a start,” he conceded, but “two in three outside tables had to be removed.” Customers will have the freedom to eat without wearing a mask, but as soon as nature calls they will be required to don one to go to the inside bathroom. Some have complained that the government´s speedy announcement of the plans, just five days before reopening, were also problematic. “It was confirmed on Thursday, and with the holiday weekend it´s been almost impossible to order all the necessary products from Rungis,” Denamur said, referring to the Paris region´s principal food market.

ROME — Italians across the country are increasingly fed up with the bureaucratic slowness of returning life to normal after strict lockdowns, according to a survey. A survey of Italians during the final week of May reveals the highest levels of anger as a predominant emotion since the lockdowns began in early March. While feelings of uncertainty and vulnerability both diminished in the last week of May, these were replaced by growing ire at the government’s reluctance to relinquish its stranglehold on society. As Italians feel more and more confident in their overall health situation, they are losing hope in the future, reveals the survey, conducted by the marketing research company SWG. Survey by SWG market research company The underlying malaise and increasing rage were in evidence this past weekend, as protests erupted up and down the peninsula, from Milan to Sicily. The anger is chiefly directed at Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and many of the demonstrators called for his resignation as well as respect for the constitution, which guarantees basic freedoms. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> According to an analysis by Roberto Arditti, the president of Kratesis, a strategic management consultancy firm, the evident growing discontent among Italians is a powder keg that will explode if government does not accelerate a return to normal. While we have witnessed a decline in the primary emotions that dominated the long lockdown phase, only one has grown, that of anger, Arditti observes. The anger, which has increased from 17 percent in mid-March to 23 percent today, is still manageable, but only if swift action is taken, he states. According to Arditti, there are two primary causes of the rising resentment, namely the proverbial slowness of the public administration, that seems unable to take immediate action when it is called for, as well as recent discussions over continued isolation of certain regions, which risks provoking deeper divisions in the country. If the response to the current crisis are slow in coming, “the anger of the Italians could turn into a tsunami,” Arditti said. Italy is set to open up to interregional and international travel on Wednesday, but continuing restrictions on hotels, coffee bars, restaurants, and firms has made going back to business difficult and in many cases impossible. Last week, the iconic restaurant Dal Fortunato near the Pantheon in Rome posted large notices outside the building saying that there is no way for the establishment to reopen under current conditions.

On MSNBC on Monday, Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf (D) defended imposing an 8:oo p.m. curfew on the city by stating that the looting on Sunday, which impacted minority neighborhoods where people had already been hurt by the coronavirus. She also stated that while protests on Monday had been peaceful up to that point, if people don’t disperse when the curfew time comes, they will be arrested. She argued that such an action is needed, and “these types of demonstrations are really endangering public health.” Schaaf said that the protest on Friday, “was used as really a foil by people that were intent on doing damage and violence. But then last night was extremely different. We had groups all over our city, vandalism, looting, in, particularly, neighborhoods that are the most impacted by the coronavirus. Our neighborhoods in East Oakland and the Fruitvale where our African American and Latino communities live and depend on these businesses. They were hit last night.” She added that “there are two different things going on and let us not conflate them. There is legitimate protest and anger and grief over yet another killing of a black man at the hands of police, and this is within the context of the larger travesty of racism in America. And there is a group that is taking advantage of this moment to commit illegal acts, to do damage, to steal, to cause chaos. And we believe that those are two very different groups of people.” She concluded that the protests going on at the moment were a “beautiful, peaceful, family demonstration in solidarity with George Floyd and the quest for justice in our country. It’s going along beautifully. We are facilitating that peaceful demonstration, but when 8:00 comes tonight, we will be very clear that people must disperse. We will warn them. We will give them a safe way to exit an area. But if they do not, we will arrest them, and that is what we believe is necessary under these unprecedented conditions. And remember, you know, we were the very first region in the country to shut down our economy, to impose shelter-in-place, because of the coronavirus. So, our core small businesses are already suffering. We also believe that these types of demonstrations are really endangering public health.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

Violent protests erupted this weekend between “antifascist” radical leftists and supporters of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro across the country’s largest cities. The large organized “act against fascism and in defense of democracy” in Sao Paulo was reportedly organized by fans of the Corinthians soccer club. “We need to retake this space. The street is ours. We’ll be back next week,” one protester said as he was applauded by others, according to O Globo. The march attracted supporters of conservative President Bolsonaro, many of whom came dressed in the yellow and green colors of the Brazilian flag. AGORA NA AVENIDA PAULISTA.Ato contra o fascismo e em defesa da Democracia. O ato foi chamado pela Gaviōes da Fiel e vai unir outras torcidas organizada. “Hoje é o primeiro e vai se espalhar pelo Brasil” Por Lina Marinelli/jornalistas livres#fascistasnãopassarão pic.twitter.com/u2iS6VsZ3E — Jornalistas Livres (@J_LIVRES) May 31, 2020  The arrival of the conservative counter-protesters prompted Brazilian police to place a cordon between them to keep the peace. The two groups then proceeded to shout insults at each other. Conservatives reportedly began shouting, “go to Cuba!” to the leftist protesters, while the leftists replied, “go take chloroquine, cattle!” Bolsonaro has been a supporter of research suggesting that the drug chloroquine may be useful in combatting the Chinese coronavirus, a claim that has become a point of tense contention along ideological lines. One of the two health ministers Bolsonaro has fired during the pandemic claimed the president wanted to officially label chloroquine safe for use against coronavirus. “Go to Cuba” became a common slogan against the left in Bolsonaro’s 2018 campaign, a reply intended to highlight the ties between the Castro regime and the past presidents belonging to the socialist Workers’ Party (PT), Dilma Rousseff and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. In Rio de Janeiro, hundreds of protesters converged on the square in front of the state government palace Sunday chanting, “I can’t breathe! I can’t breathe!” an apparent reference to the riots in the United States in response to the death of Minnesota resident George Floyd, killed by a police officer. The Rio de Janeiro protest compared police brutality in the United States to that within Rio’s favelas, or slums, with signs calling on the police to “Stop killing us” and declaring that the “favela asks for peace.” “We are here today because we want to live,” one activist named Santiago told Voice of America. We are here today because we are tired of this genocidal state. We are here to say no more, no more!” In Brasilia, Bolsonaro attended an event organized by his supporters in continued protest against the lockdown measures imposed in response to the Chinese coronavirus by local authorities around the country. Having arrived on horseback and without a facemask, he did not make any remarks but instead greeted those in attendance, holding children in his arms and posing for selfies with his supporters.

As of Monday, health authorities have confirmed close to half a million confirmed cases of coronavirus and over 28,000 deaths, although some analysts believe these figures are below the actual number due to widespread lack of testing.

Over 70 people violently stormed the Karachi Civil Hospital in Pakistan on Friday night after alleging that the hospital administration “delayed handing over the body” of a coronavirus victim to his family, Pakistani newspaper Dawn reported on Saturday. At least one doctor was injured in the attack after she was “slapped” by one of the victim’s relatives, with one hospital official describing the mob as “beating doctors” during the assault. The mob vandalized the medical facility and “forcibly took away the body” of the victim. In videos taken of the mob at the hospital’s entrance, dozens of people are seen removing medical equipment, such as stretchers, from the facility and “breaking the sanitizer gate” at the entryway, Dawn reported. A local journalist for Pakistani newspaper the Express Tribune shared video footage of the mob attack, reporting that “the attackers had iron rods [and] knives” and shouted, “There is no corona[virus]. This is all a drama of doctors.” Karachi police and hospital officials said that a male patient was brought to the hospital early Friday morning “complaining of a heart problem” and died while being treated, according to Dawn. Suspecting the patient had coronavirus, the doctors conducted a test, which came back positive. The man’s relatives refused to accept the test results, accusing the doctors of declaring him to be positive for coronavirus “even though he was normal.” They then claimed the hospital was purposefully delaying the release of the man’s body and mobbed the facility late Friday night to forcibly retrieve it. Responding to allegations that the medical facility had delayed the release of the body, the hospital’s medical superintendent, Dr. Khadim Hussain Qureshi, told Dawn that doctors at Karachi Civic had followed the national government’s standard operating procedures (SOPs) for handling bodies of people who die from coronavirus. “We are government servants. We only follow what the government tells us,” he said. “It takes time for the [coronavirus test] result to be received,” he added. Qureshi expressed concern over the mob’s violent assault on doctors: What kind of ethics are these? Doctors are already putting their lives in danger to save people; the public should support them. The way they have resorted to beating doctors … if doctors refuse to work, who will save [the people]? A senior Karachi police official speaking to Dawn anonymously said that the hospital administration had not approached police to file a “first information report” (FIR), or the basic document to report a crime in Pakistan. He said that the police had decided to register a criminal case against the people involved in the attack over “charges of rioting and creating hindrances in official work.” Karachi police officials have also asked the hospital administration to supply CCTV footage of the incident so that authorities may identify and arrest suspects, according to the report. On May 14, a similar attack occurred at a different Karachi hospital, with a mob of at least nine people vandalizing a hospital ward and forcibly retrieving the body of a coronavirus victim they believed to be withheld from family by hospital authorities. Police arrested at least nine people involved in the attack and said no one was injured during the incident. Pakistan’s failing healthcare system struggled to treat citizens prior to the coronavirus pandemic due to the country’s poor infrastructure. Now, amid a recent increase in coronavirus cases and with the nation’s lockdown restrictions on peoples’ movement recently lifted, Pakistan’s hospitals are overwhelmed with the burden of treating a surging number of infections. National health authorities have warned they may be forced to reinstate a lockdown following the most recent spike in cases caused by the Eid al-Fitr Islamic holiday weekend at the end of May. At press time on Monday, Pakistan had recorded 72,460 infections and 1,543 deaths from the Chinese coronavirus. However, a lack of medical supplies such as testing kits and personal protective equipment (PPE) coupled with a general reluctance to test properly by the national government means Pakistan has tested just a small fraction of the population. The true number of coronavirus cases is likely much higher than reported.

President Trump activated the full D.C. National Guard on Sunday afternoon to protect life and property, after rioting throughout the weekend, the defacement of  monuments, and the setting fire to a historic church near the White House. A spokesman for the D.C. National Guard said “hundreds” of National Guardsmen — soldiers and airmen — are now added to other D.C. National Guard units that had been activated over the past four days. Trump was able to activate the National Guard forces versus a governor doing so, as D.C. is not a state and there is no governor to act as the approving authority. He activated them on Sunday at 5:00 p.m. D.C. National Guard Commanding General Army Maj. Gen. William J. Walker will command the Guardsmen. He will decide how to deploy and disperse them around the city to protect personnel and property, according to the spokesman. The Guard will be working with the U.S. Park Police, the federal police force for the district’s federal parks and monuments. They are working “24/7,” said spokesman Air National Guard Capt. Edwin Nieves, Jr. Nieves said the National Guardsmen may be armed by the order of the President for personal protection since they are not acting in a law enforcement role. They will also be wearing personal protective equipment and using crowd control equipment such as shields. The tasking for the National Guard across the country comes amid their mission to also assist with the fight against the coronavirus.   Follow Breitbart News’s Kristina Wong on Twitter or on Facebook.

Hong Kong police branded the city’s annual memorial for the victims of the Communist Party massacre at Tiananmen Square, Beijing, a “major threat to public health” on Monday, refusing to offer a permit. Every year since the massacre, beginning in 1990, Hong Kong has organized a candlelight vigil in honor of those killed during the 1989 massacre in Beijing. The vigil usually takes place in the city’s large Victoria Park, attracting thousands of people. Police have allowed the move without objection — including after China took over Hong Kong in 1997 — until this week. Hong Kong’s pro-China officials extended restrictions of public gatherings meant to contain the spread of the Chinese coronavirus last month, scheduling them to end June 5. When organizers submitted a request to hold the annual vigil on June 4, police said no. “Public assemblies are a high-risk activity due to large crowds gathering,” the police department said in a letter rejecting permission for the vigil. “Police believe that the event will not only increase participants’ chances of contracting the virus but also threaten citizens’ lives and health, thus endangering public safety and affecting the rights of others.” The letter was addressed to the organizer of the event, Richard Tsoi, vice-chair of Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China. Tsoi told reporters that his group may file an appeal, though they had also begun encouraging people to engage in a socially distanced candlelight vigil by holding candles at their doorsteps. The local broadcaster RTHK also highlighted impassioned comments from alliance Secretary-General Lee Cheuk-yan at a press conference on Monday in which he called the vigil a “litmus test” for One Country, Two Systems, the policy China agreed to govern Hong Kong under after the end of British rule. The policy prevents China from imposing Communist Party laws on the city and prevents the city from asserting national sovereignty. “In a way it’s a litmus test of one country two systems, if they suppress us, it means that one country two systems is no more,” Lee said, expressing concern that observance of the anniversary at all may soon be illegal. Hong Kong has seen a return of the pro-democracy protests that swept the region last year in the past month, as authorities were forced to ease coronavirus restrictions due to a lack of significant numbers of cases. The latest wave of protests is against a “national security” law passed by Beijing’s National People’s Congress, the Communist Party legislature, which allows Beijing to arrest and imprison Hong Kong residents for crimes such as “treason” and threats against the national security of China. As the Congress did not specifically enumerate elements of these crimes — but most dissent within China is tantamount to treason — Hongkongers have expressed alarm that they no longer possess freedom of expression. At the press conference Monday, Lee noted that vigil attendees typically chant, “end one-party dictatorship,” which may now be illegal. Lee also disparaged the alleged public health concerns to ban the vigil as “totally unreasonable and unscientific.” “We will mourn individually. We hope that there will be candles lit up in various districts across the city including ours at Victoria Park,” Lee announced. “Each candlelight vigil is self-initiated and does not constitute an assembly.” Hong Kong currently bans public gatherings of over eight people, so the organizers are hoping that small groups of eight will pop up throughout the city with candles. In addition, the Alliance has announced an online “vigil” and moment of silence that night. The Tiananmen Square massacre of June 4, 1989, killed an untold number of people, believed to be at least in the thousands, who had gathered peacefully in the nation’s capital to demand pro-democratic reforms. In 1989, the influence of the Soviet Union was waning in much of the world and uprisings against communist regimes spreading. Communist Party officials in Beijing responded by killing as many as possible, including many young people and students, in a military assault Beijing celebrated as recently as last year. Outside of Hong Kong, the Communist Party strictly censors searches related to the massacre. On June 4, even trying to conduct online searches for words like “today” could yield no results. In an exception, state media covered the massacre last year approvingly, a rare acknowledgment it ever occurred. Without mass killings, “China would have followed the way of the Soviet Union and collapsed,” an “expert” told the state-run Global Times. “That incident was a political turbulence and the central government took measures to stop the turbulence which is a correct policy,” China’s defense minister General Wei Fenghe said last year. “The 30 years have proven that China has undergone major changes China has enjoyed stability and development.” Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.

Monday at a press conference, Gov. Charlie Baker (R-MA) accused President Donald Trump of “bitterness, combativeness, and self-interest” amid the protests and looting in reactions to George Floyd’s death and the coronavirus pandemic. Earlier during a conference call, the president said governors and mayors were “weak” for not jailing protesters. Baker said, “I heard what the president said today about dominating and fighting. I know I should be surprised when I hear incendiary words like this from him, but I’m not. At so many times during these last several weeks, when the country needed compassion and leadership the most, it simply was nowhere to be found.” He continued, “Instead, we got bitterness, combativeness and self-interest. That’s not what we need in Boston. It’s not what we need right now in Massachusetts. And it’s definitely not what we need across this great country of ours either.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Government leaders and health experts fear the novel coronavirus, which has disproportionally plagued minority populations, could spread rapidly during mass protests over the death of George Floyd. On Sunday, Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) warned during NBC News’s Meet the Press that the protests, which tend to descend into rioting and looting at night, could “compound” the deadly and highly contagious COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus: I’m concerned that we had mass gatherings on our streets when we just lifted a stay at home order and what that could mean for spikes in coronavirus cases later. In fact, I’m so concerned about it that I’m urging everybody to consider their exposure — if they need to isolate from their family members when they go home and if they need to be tested — because we have worked very hard to blunt the curve. And while I saw some people with masks last night, others didn’t. When I saw some people social distancing, other people were right on top of each other. So we don’t want to compound this deadly virus and the impact it’s had on our community. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) expressed a similar sentiment on CNN’s State of the Union, saying he is “a little bit concerned” about the protests fueling the further spread of the coronavirus. He proclaimed: Right now, the immediate concern is to lower the temperature, stop the looting, and potentially keep our citizens safe from the riots that are going on. But the next step is to worry about this, what we have been focused on for the past couple of months, is the safety — dealing with this coronavirus. And there’s no question that, when you put hundreds or thousands of people together in close proximity, when we have got this virus all over the streets, is — it’s not healthy. There’s about a 14-day incubation period. So, two weeks from now across America, we’re going to find out whether or not this gives us a spike and drives the numbers back up again or not. Over the weekend, Breitbart News reported that some political leaders, namely in Minnesota and New York, fear that the mass protests and riots are an ideal breeding ground for COVID-19. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) expressed concerns about the riots’ impact on coronavirus, declaring on Saturday that “it’s inevitable” the demonstrations will lead to an increase in cases. “I am deeply concerned about a super-spreader type of incident,” the Democrat governor said. “We’re going to see a spike in COVID-19. It’s inevitable.” Minnesota State Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm issued a similar warning last Thursday. “We know, large gatherings do pose a risk in any epidemic, but certainly where we stand today with the state of COVID-19 spread in our community,” she said. “Knowing that we have community spread, we just want to again encourage folks who gather to be mindful of the risk.” Officials in New York, considered the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States, shared Gov. Walz’s fears about the potential for a rise in coronavirus among protesters. On Saturday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) proclaimed: I would still wish that everyone would realize that when people gather, it’s inherently dangerous in the context of this pandemic, and I’m going to keep urging people not to use that approach, and if they do, they focus on social distancing and wearing face coverings. “The last thing we would want to see is members of our community harmed because the virus spread in one of these settings,” he added. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) echoed De Blasio over the weekend, saying protestors and rioters “don’t have a right to infect other people.” On Monday, Cuomo indicated the demonstrations could jeopardize the state’s huge gains against the deadly virus. The protests and riots sweeping cities across the nation, including New York City, “could potentially be infecting hundreds and hundreds of people, after everything that we have done,” the governor noted. He added, “We have to take a minute and ask ourselves, what are we doing here?” Public health experts also warned that the crowds participating in the protests across American, numbering at the very least in the tens of thousands, could cause a surge in COVID-19 cases. Dr. Howard Markel, a medical historian who studies pandemics, told the New York Times: Yes, the protests are outside, but they are all really close to each other, and in those cases, being outside doesn’t protect you nearly as much. Public gatherings are public gatherings — it doesn’t matter what you’re protesting or cheering. That’s one reason we’re not having large baseball games and may not have college football this fall. “There are a huge number of asymptomatic carriers, and that makes it hugely risky,” he added. In an interview with CBS News’s Face the Nation, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), predicted that mass demonstrations would lead to new “chains of transmission.” Floyd died last Monday after a Minneapolis after Derek Chauvin, a now-fired white police officer, kneeled on his neck for several minutes in an incident caught on camera. Floyd was unarmed. On Friday, authorities charged Chauvin with third-degree murder and manslaughter.

The government has effectively made it illegal for people who don’t already live together to have sex, as that would be considered a “gathering”, and against the coronavirus lockdown social distancing laws. New amendments to the lockdown law loosen most of the major restrictions than had been put in place in March, including easing restrictions on senior citizens and those with underlying health conditions. Schools can reopen on Monday, and people can gather outside, including in gardens, in numbers of up to six as long as social distancing is still maintained. But a new line to the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) Bill adds on Monday: “No person may participate in a gathering which takes place in a public or private place indoors, and consists of two or more persons.” It says elsewhere, according to The Mirror, that “no person may, without reasonable excuse, stay overnight at any place other than the place where they are living”. The law means that both the person visiting and the person whose house is being visited could be fined £100, or £50 if paid within 14 days. Lawyers went to work on Twitter to discuss the interpretation of the law, with Human rights barrister Adam Wagner writing on Sunday: “I can’t believe I’m about to tweet this. From tomorrow sex between two (or more) people in a private place who do not live in the same household is a ‘gathering’ between 2 or more people and is therefore illegal.” However, George Pertez QC put forth that if the visitor was a prostitute, then that might be permissible “as that is reasonably necessary for work purposes”. Professor Lockdown Resigns After Breaking Own Lockdown Rules to Meet Left-Wing 'Open Marriage' Lover: Report https://t.co/N8LmFZSrKS — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 5, 2020  Police, however, will not have the power to forcibly enter your home to stop you having intercourse with a lover from another address. A spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the Metro that police could only enter a property “where they suspect serious criminal activity is taking place under separate and existing laws”. The spokesman added that police would continue “exercising their common sense and engaging with the public”. The Police Federation of England and Wales had said in April that it wanted increased powers to forcibly enter private houses to see if there were illegal gatherings. Constabularies and police forces across the country had come under criticism for their tyrannical approach to enforcing the lockdown. Such examples have included pouring black dye into a body of water in a beauty spot to deter swimmers, using a drone to follow dog-walkers, and shaming people for going for a drive out of boredom or families who walked to the shops together. Last month, the Crown Prosecution Service said that it was going to review every fine and prosecution made under the coronavirus legislation after it was found that the law had been applied either incorrectly or in a heavy-handed manner. The government’s scientific adviser Neil Ferguson, the author of the UK’s lockdown measures, resigned from his post after it was revealed that he had broken lockdown to have at least two liaisons with his married lover. Police said at the time that they would not be investigating further Mr Ferguson’s lockdown breach.

MADRID (AP) – Spain on Monday reported no official deaths from the new coronavirus in a 24-hour period for the first time since March. The development is “very, very encouraging,” emergency health response chief Fernando Simón said. Also, Spain recorded only 71 new COVID-19 infections over the past 24 hours, he told a news conference. “We are in a very good place in the evolution of the pandemic,” Simón said. “The statistics are following a trend. They are going in the right direction.” Spain reported its first two deaths on March 3. Another was reported two days later. Spain´s number of infections and death jumped exponentially. On April 2, it recorded 950 deaths in 24 hours – the peak death toll. The official death toll now stands at 27,127, with 240,000 confirmed cases. Spain was the second European country after Italy to be forcefully hit by the pandemic before it also spread death in France and Britain. One of the world´s strictest lockdowns was put into place in mid-March and managed to eventually reduce the pressure on hospitals after some were overwhelmed with patients suffering from the virus. The lockdown is gradually being relaxed as the medical situation improves. The Spanish government has warned, however, that the threat is not over and that the loosening of restrictions could be reversed. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said last weekend he will be asking parliament for an extension of the government´s special emergency powers for another two weeks. That enables authorities to order people to stay home. Simon said recent hot spots caused by people holding unauthorized “fiestas” can potentially bring a major new resurgence. “We are still at risk. Any of these outbreaks can mean a new wave of infections,” he said. “We must remain cautious.”


Sadiq Khan has written a letter to the government in which he called for an extension to the Brexit transition period to avoid “needless and hazardous” impacts during the economic crisis spurred on by the Chinese coronavirus. The Europhile mayor of London wrote to the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove — the minister in charge of the country’s Brexit talks with the European Union — saying that an “extension to the transition period is now urgently needed to give businesses and public services some certainty” during the coronavirus crisis. “The last thing the country needs as it tries to find a way back from the devastation wreaked by coronavirus is more chaos and uncertainty,” he wrote, per City A.M. “I urge the government to put political ideology aside and pursue the pragmatic route of seeking an extension to the negotiations so that we and our European partners can focus on recovery from Covid-19,” he added. The move by Khan comes in opposition to the party line set out by Labour leader Keir Starmer, who said last week that the issue of Brexit was “over” and pledged not to campaign to rejoin the EU. “We’ve left the EU, and therefore the Leave/Remain argument is over and the only argument now is what sort of a deal we have with the EU and what sort of deals we have with the rest of the world,” Starmer said. Brexit Day: Sadiq Khan ‘Heartbroken’ Britain is Finally Leaving the EU https://t.co/dPn7dmP2Ba — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 31, 2020  Khan’s attempt to stymie the UK from reclaiming full independence from the bloc comes after the EU’s trade negotiator, Michel Barnier, wrote a letter to a group of Europhile MPs, saying that the bloc would support extending the transition period by up to two years. The proposed delay would effectively postpone Brexit until 2023 — seven years after the British people voted to leave. A government spokesman said in response to the mayor’s letter: “An extension to the transition period would bind us into future EU legislation, without us having any say in designing it, but still having to foot the bill as we would still have to make payments into the EU budget.” “The EU themselves have said that their next budget will be unusual, and we would have no say in what it would go towards. “We need to be able to design our own rules, in our best interests, to manage our response to coronavirus – without the constraints of following EU rules,” the spokesman added. Teams of negotiators from the UK and the EU will meet this week and meetings between Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are scheduled for next month. The top negotiator for the UK, David Frost, has pledged that if there is no progress made, Britain will walk away from talks and begin preparing to trade with the bloc on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms. “It’s the firm policy of the government that we will not extend the transition period and, if asked, we would not agree to it,” Frost said. London Mayor Sadiq Khan says "structural racism" in Britain has led to more racial minorities dying from coronavirus. https://t.co/sAUVrZc4Fr — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) April 22, 2020  Follow Kurt on Twitter at @KurtZindulka

First Lady Melania Trump on Monday spoke out against the violent protests blighting major cities across the country. “Saddened to see our country and communities being damaged and vandalized,” she wrote on Twitter. “I ask everyone to protest in peace and focus on taking care of one another and healing our great nation.” Saddened to see our country & communities being damaged & vandalized. I ask everyone to protest in peace & focus on taking care of one another & healing our great nation. — Melania Trump (@FLOTUS) June 1, 2020  The first lady continues to condemn the rioting and vandalizing on social media. “Our country allows for peaceful protests, but there is no reason for violence,” she wrote on Friday morning. She also urged Americans to continue working to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. “I’ve seen our citizens unify and take care of one another through COVID19 and we can’t stop now,” she wrote. She also offered her sympathies for the family of George Floyd, who died after a police officer pressed his neck with his knee for several minutes while putting him into custody. Floyd’s death sparked protests across the country. “My deepest condolences to the family of George Floyd,” she wrote. “As a nation, let’s focus on peace, prayers & healing.” Saddened to see our country & communities being damaged & vandalized.

ROME — Pope Francis has called for priority to be given to persons rather than to the economy in responding to the coronavirus pandemic. “I make an appeal: that nobody lacks healthcare,” the pope said during his Regina Caeli message in Saint Peter’s Square Sunday. “Care for people, instead of saving for the economy. Care for people, who are more important than the economy.” “We people are temples of the Holy Spirit, the economy is not,” the pontiff insisted. The pope has often proposed a dichotomy between opting for people or opting for the economy, but it is not apparent how this clean differentiation works. The economy does not exist independently of people and when people lose their jobs and their savings, it is these real people and those who depend on them who suffer as a consequence. According to a series of reports, in fact, poor people are suffering disproportionately from the economic downturn caused by the extreme measures adopted to counter the coronavirus pandemic. While many affluent people have reserves of savings and can get by even without working for a while, the poor do not have this luxury since a great many live from paycheck to paycheck. One recent report predicted that the rise in the suicide rate caused by lockdowns and job losses in Australia will exceed deaths from the Wuhan coronavirus by a factor of ten. Researchers from Sydney University’s Brain and Mind Centre said they expect a 50 percent rise in the national suicide rate because of the economic and social impact of government responses to the virus, which will drive deaths to as much as ten times higher than those causes by the coronavirus itself. Italy, on the other hand, has reported large numbers of people who are paid under the table and therefore have no unemployment benefits when they are unable to work. Some 300,000 people are paid under the table in Sicily alone, out of 3,700,000 in all of Italy, and most now find themselves without any income, a situation that the Mafia could exploit as people get desperate, warned Leoluca Orlando, the mayor of Palermo, Sicily. “Discomfort and malaise are growing and we are recording worrying reports of protest and anger that is being exploited by criminals who want to destabilize the system,” Mr. Orlando said in late March. “The more time passes, the more resources are exhausted,” he said. “The little savings people have are running out.” “In the south, there is a very fragile socio-economic balance, where black market work, mafias, and crime thrive,” noted the former president of the Italian Senate, Pietro Grasso. “There is a portion of population that leaves the house in the morning with the sole aim of feeding their family, without a reference point. All these families now have no chance of finding a solution to their livelihood,” he said. Last week, the Italian newspaper Il Giornale reported that nearly a third of the country’s businesses will not reopen and millions will remain without work or income, part of the long-term human cost of Italy’s nationwide coronavirus lockdown. In the United States as well, a number of social commentators have suggested that the damage caused by lockdowns could be worse than those of the virus itself. “Many large companies can withstand a few weeks without revenue but that isn’t true of millions of small and mid-sized firms,” one Wall Street Journal op-ed noted. The human cost of government-mandated shutdowns in terms of job losses and bankruptcies will “exceed what most Americans imagine,” the article stated, adding that shuttering the national economy will result in “a tsunami of economic destruction that will cause tens of millions to lose their jobs.” In a 2015 press conference Pope Francis confessed that he has “a great aversion” toward the economy because his father was an accountant and used to bring his work home with him on the weekends, and that, in fact, he does not actually “understand” the economy very well. If this is indeed the case, humility and good sense would seem to dictate that sweeping statements denouncing attention to economic recovery in favor of helping “people” would be better left unsaid. Sometimes, saving the “people” means saving the economy that puts food in their mouths and clothes on their backs. It is hard to imagine a more effective strategy for helping real people than by putting them back to work. Follow @tdwilliamsrome

AP MADRID – Spain´s national statistics office said that it received zero international tourists in April after the nation had closed its borders at the height of its coronavirus outbreak. In April 2019, 7 million tourists spent 7 billion euros ($7.8 billion) in Spain. Spain is waiting until July to reopen its border for foreign tourists. In the meantime, authorities are encouraging Spaniards to vacation inside at home. Tourism is a pillar of Spain´s economy. Eighty million annual visitors generate 12% of Spain´s gross domestic product and help employ 2.6 million people. Amid the global economic slowdown provoked by the pandemic, Spain´s government forecasts its economy will shrink by 9% and unemployment to reach 19% this year. Meanwhile museums are reopening in the Netherlands. AP reports: In the Netherlands, some of the most beloved museums in the world reopened to the public, with Rembrandt´s The Night Watch and Van Gogh´s Sunflowers back on show. And out of gratitude, visitors to the Van Gogh museum even received a real sunflower upon their departure. At the Mauritshuis in the Hague, the gaze of Vermeer´s Girl with the Pearl was also enticing visitors to come back. All such treasures had been hidden from the public for over two months as the nations was forced into lockdown measures for the coronavirus. At the most famous institution, the Rijksmuseum, visitors even got to hear that the blockbuster show “aravaggio-Bernini. Baroque in Rome” was being extended until September. Museums all over the world have been struggling to get through the pandemic crisis and UNESCO has said that one in eight might have to close their doors for good. Some of the major institutions in Europe have been losing over 2 million euros ($2.2 million) a month. Rembrandt´s The Night Watch

On Monday morning, certain states in Mexico will be given permission to return to a “new normal” as they restart from lockdown. The push to reopen comes as the country climbs to seventh place globally for Coronavirus fatalities. During a daily news conference, Mexico’s Undersecretary of Health Hugo Lopez Gatell said the nation will follow a color-coded system based on the number of cases in each state. Most of Mexico is listed “red” as the virus spreads with an approximate fatality rate of 11 percent. La Nueva Normalidad del 1 de junio no significa que miles de personas puedan salir a la calle como antes. Las autoridades sanitarias estatales podrán aplicar disposiciones adicionales para evitar contagios, no al contrario. pic.twitter.com/L890A3mp9T — Hugo López-Gatell Ramírez (@HLGatell) May 31, 2020  The most recent federal figures show a current total of 90,664 confirmed cases and 9,930 deaths. Mexico recently surpassed Belgium for seventh place in fatalities. Al 31 de mayo de 2020 hay 90,664 casos confirmados, 16,962 confirmados activos y 36,803 sospechosos por #COVID19.

Despite the sharp increase in official figures, federal authorities are still widely accused of under-reporting the true scale. Lopez Gatell admitted that some of the figures in his reports only account for cases in government hospitals. This discrepancy pushed several states to release their own statistics that show between 30-50 percent more cases. Ildefonso Ortiz is an award-winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.

Democrats locked young people down for no valid reason for an indeterminate amount of time and now we got riots. Huh? How about that? What did you idiots expect? Did you think you could lock down millions and millions and millions of young people for no valid reason, give them no reopen date — rob them of their jobs, of school, of structure; remove the social outlets — sports, bars, parties — that allow them to burn off energy and aggression, to blow off steam, and there would be no consequence? Worse still, and exclusively in the Democrat-run states and cities that have so far seen the worst violence (Minneapolis, Los Angeles, Chicago, Detroit, New York), young people are still locked down, and they’re locked down with no end in sight because their idiot political leaders (all Democrats) keep moving the goalposts and still refuse to offer a clear reopening deadline to grab hold of. And then there is the simple fact young people were and are locked down for no valid scientific or moral reason. It’s just a fact that if you’re under 50 years of age, the coronavirus is no more fatal than the seasonal flu. Nevertheless, even though people in their teens and twenties are probably in more danger of dying in a car accident than they are of the coronavirus, we shut them down, we shattered their lives… We locked them down, annihilated whatever structure they had — we killed their source of income, told them they couldn’t gather, couldn’t go to camp, they lost graduation ceremonies that can never be repeated and graduation parties they dream of all year… We boarded up the basketball hoops, poured sand in the skateboard parks, closed the parks and beaches, eliminated church functions, outlawed parties… Hell, we outlawed just hanging out and playing grab-ass with your buddies, which is the perfect way to blow off some steam. And in many of these Democrat-run cities, there’s still no end in sight. Just when the citizens of these states and cities believe their Democrat leaders are going to set them free, it’s two more weeks, two more weeks, two more weeks… This is madness. The curve is bent and has been bent for more than a month. Remember that? Remember when we were told we had to lose our jobs and social lives and everything that makes worth living to bend the infection curve, to ensure our health care systems weren’t overwhelmed? Remember when we were told that was The Goal? Well, the curve is not just bent, it’s flattened, and in 98 percent of the country the system was never in any danger of being overwhelmed… But here we are, two more weeks and two more weeks and two more weeks, and there are still Democrat governors who still have their citizens locked down… And for no good reason —  unless you believe keeping entire cities locked down to damage the economy to get Rapey Joe Biden elected is a good reason. Listen, I’m not saying that there would not have been some violence after what those cops did to George Floyd (cops who are part of a police department that’s been run by Democrats for 48 years). Another Ferguson or Baltimore was certainly possible without these pointless lockdowns. But, come on, this no longer has anything to do with Mr. Floyd. Listen, when you’re teenager or a twenty-something who’s been locked down for weeks, and have lost faith the lockdown will ever end, a little of the ol’ ultra-violence looks pretty good, like a choice way to finally blow off that steam, socialize, and feel a part of something other than your iPhone and crappy apartment. Plus, these riots are media approved! That’s the best part! The media will scold and shame you for going to the beach, attending church, enjoying a block party, or hanging out at the park. That’s verboten. But as soon as people started gathering to riot… Well, did you notice how the very same media that shamed churchgoers and kids partying in the Ozarks turned around to justify and excuse massive crowds of people gathering and socializing? You see, according to the media (who set all the rules), pick-up basketball is evil, looting and burning is moral. What the hell did you expect to come from that? “Woe to those who call evil good and good evil.” Listen, don’t get me wrong… I don’t really care about any of this. You see, I live in Rural America… Y’all want to vote for the Democrats who lock people down until they blow up, that’s your choice. Y’all want to support a media that encourages people to burn down your neighborhood, that’s your choice. It’s a free country. You get what you vote for and you fools got riots. Out here in Red America, we all we got is peace and quiet… Out here in Red America, these riots are merely a reality show called TOLDJASO. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

One of the witnesses who reported Dominic Cummings for allegedly breaking lockdown drove 250 miles during it himself, while another now admits he made up a sighting of the adviser — supposedly as a joke. Retired teacher Robin Lees reported Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s chief adviser to the police after seeing him near Barnard Castle, where he had made a short drive to see if he was well enough for a longer journey back to London. Durham Constabulary, which did not find that Mr Cummings’ initial trip from London broke the lockdown rules, has said the Barnard Castle outing may have been a “minor breach”. However, the Mail on Sunday now suggests that the man who reported Mr Cummings to the police force “broke lockdown regulations himself by making a 526-mile round-trip from Barnard Castle to London to bring his university student daughter to the family home. “My daughter came back from Canada and isolated in London. She never came home for seven weeks. I didn’t break any lockdown rules. I went and collected her after we were told we could,” Lees insisted to reporters, referring to an easing of travel restrictions on May 11th to allow people to drive as far as they pleased — although the Mail on Sunday notes that “this was only if they were going to an outdoors location and as long as the social distancing protocol was observed.” “I tell the truth and I do not like this intrusion into my family and this is absolutely nothing to do with them,” Lees complained — somewhat ironically, given Cummings did himself move from London to Durham to make sure his 4-year-old would not be without childcare if he and his wife were incapacitated by their coronavirus infections. “I do object to my family being involved. This is nothing to do with my family, right? I have had a lot of stuff on Twitter,” Lees added. ‘Social distancing’   pic.twitter.com/yEHWYmjxvA — Michael Heaver (@Michael_Heaver) May 24, 2020  The revelations come as another supposed witness to Cummings’ movements during lockdowns, Remain supporter Tim Matthews, reveals he outright fabricated his sighting of Cummings — lending credence to the Brexiteer’s insistence that allegations of a second trip to Durham are wholly false. “I made that up afterwards, a few days ago in fact,” Matthews admitted. “I modified it for a little bit of comedy value,” he added, referring to Strav running app data which he doctored in order to make it look as though he was in an area where Cummings was alleged to have travelled. “I undid it later, I’m sorry. A bit of comedy value even if it was really inappropriate,” Matthews added.

ROME — Pope Francis urged Christians Sunday to work for unity and warned them of the triple threat of narcissism, victimhood, and pessimism. In homily on the feast of Pentecost, which commemorates the coming of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles, the pope said that there are three main enemies “always lurking at the door of our hearts: narcissism, victimhood, and pessimism” and each of these has been present during the coronavirus pandemic. “Narcissism makes us idolize ourselves, to be concerned only with what is good for us,” he said in St. Peter’s Basilica. “The narcissist thinks: ‘Life is good if I profit from it.’ So he or she ends up saying: ‘Why should I give myself to others?’” This temptation has been especially evident during the health crisis, he suggested, where selfishness and a retreat into one’s own concerns has been in evidence. “In this time of pandemic, how wrong narcissism is: the tendency to think only of our own needs, to be indifferent to those of others, and not to admit our own frailties and mistakes,” he said. “But the second enemy, victimhood, is equally dangerous,” the pontiff continued. “Victims complain every day about their neighbour: ‘No one understands me, no one helps me, no one loves me, everyone has it in for me!’” Like narcissists, professional victims are self-centered, but this malady reveals itself in a slightly different way. “How many times have we not heard these complaints! The victim’s heart is closed, as he or she asks, ‘Why aren’t others concerned about me?’” he said. “In the crisis we are experiencing, how ugly victimhood is! Thinking that no one understands us and experiences what we experience.” The third enemy is pessimism, according to which nothing is going well in society, politics, or the Church, Francis said. “The pessimist gets angry with the world, but sits back and does nothing, thinking: ‘What good is giving? That is useless.’” This temptation has also manifested itself during the pandemic, the pope concluded, and shows itself especially in exaggerating the problem and believing that nothing will ever return to normal. “At this moment, in the great effort of beginning anew, how damaging is pessimism, the tendency to see everything in the worst light and to keep saying that nothing will return as before!” he said. “When someone thinks this way, the one thing that certainly does not return is hope.” These three enemies disguise an unnamed idolatry, the worship of a false god, Francis said. The narcissist’s idol is the mirror, the “mirror-god,” he said, while the victim worships the “complaint-god” and the pessimist worships the “negativity-god,” each of which leads to a loss of hope and of appreciation for the gift of life. “We need the Holy Spirit, the gift of God, he said, because He “heals us of narcissism, victimhood and pessimism” and heals us from “the mirror, complaints, and darkness.” Follow @tdwilliamsrome

ROME — Pope Francis said this weekend the coronavirus pandemic should transform people’s lives for the better, opening the way for a “more Christian society.” “When we get out of this pandemic, we will not be able to continue doing what we have been doing, and how we have been doing it. No, everything will be different,” the pope said in a video-message for the Christian feast of Pentecost, commemorating the coming of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles. “Out the great tests of humanity — and among them the pandemic — people come out either better or worse. They do not come out the same,” Francis said in his Spanish-language address. Having suffered the lockdowns, people should be more attuned to the needs of others, he said, and more disposed to tackle the “pandemic of poverty.” “All the suffering will have been useless if we do not build together a fairer, more equitable, more Christian society, not in name, but in reality, a reality that leads us to Christian conduct,” he continued. “If we do not work to end the pandemic of poverty in the world, with the pandemic of poverty in each of our countries, in the city where each one of us lives, this time will have been in vain.” “Today more than ever we need the Father to send us the Holy Spirit,” the pope said, because the world needs true witnesses to Jesus. “Today the world suffers, it is wounded. We live in a very wounded, suffering world, especially the poorest, who are discarded,” he said. “When all our human securities have disappeared, the world needs us to give it Jesus. It needs our witness to the Gospel, the Gospel of Jesus.” “We do not save ourselves. No one is saved alone. Nobody,” Francis said. “We know it, we knew it, but this pandemic that we live has made us experience it in a much more dramatic way.” “We have before us the duty to build a new reality,” he added. “The Lord will do it and we can collaborate, since he says, ‘I make all things new.’” Follow @tdwilliamsrome

NEW YORK (AP) — Major League Baseball players proposed a 114-game regular season Sunday, up from 82 in management’s offer, but no additional pay cuts beyond the one they agreed to in March, a person familiar with the plan told The Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because no details were announced. Opening day in the coronavirus-delayed season would be June 30 and the regular season would end Oct. 31, nearly five weeks after the Sept. 27 conclusion that MLB’s proposal stuck to from the season’s original schedule. The union offered scheduling flexibility to include more doubleheaders. Players, like MLB, would increase postseason teams from 10 to 14. While management proposed an expanded postseason for 2020 only, the union offered it for this year and next. A player would receive about about 70% of his salary under the union plan. MLB’s offer Tuesday included a sliding scale in which those at the $563,500 minimum would get about 47% and those at the top — led by Mike Trout and Gerrit Cole at $36 million — would receive less than 23%. All players would have the right to opt out of the season under the union plan. Those who meet qualifications for high risk or reside with a person who qualifies as high risk would receive salary and major league service. Others who opt out would receive major league service time but no salary. If the postseason is not held because of a second wave of the pandemic, the union plan calls for $100 million of the approximately $2.8 billion in salary to be deferred with interest, payable in November 2021 and November 2022. Only players whose original 2020 salaries were $10 million or more would be subject to having money deferred. The union estimates high-payroll teams would have up to $7 million in payroll relief, the person said.

Several peaceful protestors — including the brother of former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn — were arrested at an anti-lockdown demonstration at Speakers’ Corner in London. On Saturday, at least five protestors were arrested by police for allegedly breaking the national lockdown rules by gathering in Hyde Park. Piers Corbyn, a British meteorologist and the brother of the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, sarcastically told police officers that he came to the park for a “picnic”. The climate change sceptic and anti-lockdown activist claimed in a speech: “We’ve got to take back control of the National Health Service (NHS) from this Covid operation. In April, as many people committed suicide in the whole year, there are more people dying because of the Covid lockdown than it is saving.” “The National Health Service has become a Nazified propaganda machine for ‘contagion’. They’re telling us — they said the Jews had contagion — they’re saying everybody in this country could have possible contagion. So, therefore, they can be followed and locked up, ghettoized. We have the Nazification of the National Health Service and we oppose it absolutely,” Corbyn added. After his short speech, Mr Corbyn was arrested by police, who took him away in a van. Mr Corbyn was also arrested earlier this month during a similar anti-lockdown protest in Hyde Park. At the May 16th protest, Breitbart London’s James Delingpole was threatened with a fine and possible arrest by a member of London’s Metropolitan Police for attending the event, despite his “key worker” status as a journalist. There have been over 14,000 fines issued by police during the lockdown since it was introduced on March 23, by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. One protester told Breitbart London: “Isn’t it extraordinary that in the whole history of the world, we’ve never had such a thing as ‘lockdown’ before, so where did that idea come from? Well, it came from Wuhan didn’t it? “So the rest of the world looks at this concept of lockdown — based on these completely erroneous figures — and thinks ‘Well we’ll copy it’. So with that, the Communist Party [of China] have managed to take down the global capitalist system institutions without even firing a bullet,” she concluded. In response to the demonstration, a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police said: “A small number arrests have been made at each site for breach of Covid-19 regulations and some fixed penalty notices issued.” PICS: Antifa, Black Lives Matter Flood London Despite Lockdown, Police Do Little https://t.co/ySrdWGyW0R — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 31, 2020  Follow Kurt on Twitter at @KurtZindulka    

A Cleveland business owner whose cupcake shop got destroyed on Saturday night by rioters said that during the Chinese virus pandemic, she couldn’t have imagined her business getting “hit worse than ever.” Colossal Cupcakes — a popular vibrant and colorful cupcake shop located in the heart of downtown Cleveland, Ohio — was completely “destroyed” by rioters on Saturday evening, according to a report by Fox 8 News. “A gunshot went off and the main window went down. Protesters started pouring into the store,” said Kelly Kandah, the owner of Colossal Cupcakes, to Fox 8. Kandah, who lives nearby her cupcake shop, said that she rushed to the store to close it down upon hearing that rioters were on the move in the city. At the time of closing, four employees were still inside the shop. “I thought if they saw me there, they wouldn’t want to hurt anyone,” said Kandah. “But they started throwing bricks and paint cans and stuff at me and the staff. We hurried and rushed into the back bathroom but they kept coming through the windows.” From there, the store owner barricaded herself with her four employees inside the bathroom and locked the door. She then called the police. “It was horrible,” she said. “We were just listening to them destroy everything. I was so scared in so many ways.” Kandah said that she and her employees remained locked inside the bathroom, only to come out after hearing that police had entered the cupcake shop. “Everything is gone or destroyed,” said Kandah of what remains of her store. “The chandeliers are ripped down, the actual cupcake cases are gone. They took our princess chairs and used them to destroy other cases.” “There is nothing left in there, just glass,” she added. “We just got through what I imagined would be our hardest time, the COVID crisis,” said Kandah. “I never imagined we could get hit worse than ever.” Other businesses in the area were also broken into on Saturday night, including the Cleveland Indians Team Shop and CVS, according to Fox 8. Riots taking place in cities across the country appear to be in response to the death of George Floyd, who died on Monday after former police officer Derek Chauvin was seen pressing his knee onto Floyd’s neck. On Friday, the state of Minnesota announced that Chauvin was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Following Floyd’s death, days of protests ensued, which quickly devolved into the violent riots that are now taking place across the country. The riots have involved looting, buildings being set on fire, businesses destroyed, the White House going on lockdown, and people being beaten and killed. The riots have prompted the mayors of several cities across the country to issue curfews in an attempt to quell the chaos, with some even calling on their state’s governor to activate the National Guard for help. On Saturday, Ohio governor Mike DeWine activated the state’s National Guard to help respond to the violent riots in Cleveland. On Sunday, President Donald Trump announced that the United States will be designating the violent leftist group Antifa as a terrorist organization.

The chairman of the Republican Party in New Mexico on Saturday lambasted the state’s Gov. Michelle Lujan-Grisham (D), suggesting she is a hypocrite for violating her coronavirus lockdown order to make a frivolous jewelry purchase and accused her of lying about it. Asked about the governor breaking her own lockdown rule back in April, Steve Pearce told Breitbart News Saturday host Matthew Boyle, “All across the country Democrat governors think of themselves above the law.” “I think that’s the pattern that we’re seeing,” he added later. “This sense of entitlement. This sense of not having to live by the same rules that they impose on the rest of us is really angering a lot of people and is devastating to New Mexico’s economy.” He went on to accuse Lujan-Grisham (pictured), a potential running mate for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, of lying about violating her stay-at-home order. “Her staff said well [the jewelry] was actually delivered at the curb and then they changed their story — well it was actually delivered to the home of one of the staffers,” Pearce explained. “All of that stuff was not permitted in New Mexico at the time.” He pointed out the state forced a business in Albuquerque to shut down for making curbside sales, consistent with what the governor claimed to have done to get her jewelry in the same city. “An Albuquerque nursery was doing the same thing showing pictures online. People would come and pick up a plant at the curb,” he said. “They were shut down” around the time that the governor made the jewelry purchase under similar circumstances back in April. “The governor’s office is now saying innovative businesses could’ve done the same thing [make curbside sales] if they had any ingenuity about them, just total lies coming out of the governor’s office,” Pearce declared. “And that’s what should make people mad that number one, you do it, number two you get caught, and number three you lie about it.” Our Governor is the latest Democrat to decide that the rules they impose on their citizens to address the COVID-19 pandemic don’t apply to her. A bombshell report reveals that the governor violated her own stay-at-home order to stock up on some high-end jewelry. — New Mexico GOP (@NewMexicoGOP) May 27, 2020  On April 6, New Mexico Health Secretary Kathy Kunkel issued a public health order, prohibiting non-essential businesses like jewelry stores from making any in-person sales. It was not until May 1 that the health order allowed retail curbside pickup. The governor made the jewelry purchase in April. In an interview with the Albuquerque Journal, Nora Meyers Sackett, a spokeswoman for Lujan-Grisham, argued the governor did not violate the lockdown order because it was “contact-free purchase.” She claimed a friend of the governor picked up the purchased item form outside the home of one of the jewelry store’s employees. Ultimately, the governor claimed she purchased the jewelry during the shutdown to “support a local business.” The GOP chief agreed with the Breitbart News Saturday host that Gov. Lujan-Grisham is distracted by her desire to be Biden’s vice president, and has taken her eye off the ball of helping New Mexico residents deal with the coronavirus. “I think she’s trying to stamp some sort of invisible credentials the rest of us don’t see,” Pearce said.

Michel Martin, the black host of National Public Radio’s Weekend Edition Saturday, said “protesters” in Minneapolis have been subjected to tear gas and other enforcement while “mostly white protesters” who gathered in Wisconsin and Michigan last month to push for governors to allow businesses to reopen after the coronavirus lockdown were “heavily armed” and “occupied” the state capitols. The report comes as riots break out in Minnesota and across the country after the death of George Floyd at the hands of police officers on Memorial Day. “This hour, we’ll have the latest from Minneapolis and an update on protests nationwide,” said Martin on the taxpayer-funded media outlet’s weekly program. “But first, we want to take a moment to note how the unrest over Floyd’s death comes at an extraordinary time for America, as the country takes the first tentative steps to reopen from a pandemic lockdown, a crisis in which black and brown Americans have experienced disproportionate sickness, death and economic harm.” “It’s also a moment where other disparities are in full view,” Martin said. “For example, recent protesters in Minnesota have been subjected to tear gas, and President Trump has spoken of using the military to restore order, while last month, heavily armed, mostly white protesters in Wisconsin and Michigan occupied state capitals to demand that businesses be allowed to reopen, at times openly confronting law enforcement.” “Few arrests took place,” Martin said, followed by a soundbite of one of those protesters from last month saying, ‘The guns are fine. We are allowed to bring guns. We are allowed to bring them here.” “President Trump called those protesters very good people and said this about them,” Martin said, followed by an edited soundbite from President Donald Trump. “They seem to be very responsible people to me, but it’s – you know, they’ve been treated a little bit rough,” Trump said in the selected soundbite. “Yesterday in a tweet, President Trump referred to the protesters in Minnesota as thugs, writing the word in all capital letters,” Martin said.

As far as Washington Nationals pitcher Max Scherzer is concerned, there is no reason to continue talks with the league about pay cuts during the negotiations for a revamped 2020 baseball season. Scherzer, who is one of the player reps in talks with Major League Baseball about the scheme to launch a truncated 2020 season, now seems very pessimistic about an agreement being reached. The Nats player issued a statement on Wednesday: After discussing the latest developments with the rest of the players, there’s no reason to engage with MLB in any further compensation reductions. We have previously negotiated a pay cut in the version of prorated salaries, and there’s no justification to accept a 2nd pay cut based upon the current information the union has received. I’m glad to hear other players voicing the same viewpoint and believe MLB’s economic strategy would completely change if all documentation were to become public information. pic.twitter.com/nWKtqGSQo4 — Max Scherzer (@Max_Scherzer) May 28, 2020  Scherzer is a member of the eight-player MLBPA executive subcommittee. The other members include Andrew Miller (Cardinals), Daniel Murphy (Nationals), Elvis Andrus (Rangers), Cory Gearrin (Twins), Chris Iannetta (Yankees), James Paxton (Yankees), and Collin McHugh (Red Sox). A major stumbling block for the negotiations is that the teams have closed their books, and the numbers are unavailable for the players to look at to double-check what the league is saying about the effects the COVID-19 pandemic is having on finances. The player’s union is reportedly preparing a counter-proposal to the league’s offer for a 2020 season featuring a more than 100-game schedule and guaranteed prorated salaries. However, if Scherzer’s sentiment is pervasive, then it looks like the two sides are still not in the same ballpark on negotiations.

Jim Bognet, a former Donald Trump administration official, told Breitbart News Saturday swing district Democrat Rep. Matt Cartwright (D-PA) is “out of touch” on the coronavirus pandemic as well as the George Floyd protests and riots. Bognet (pictured) hopes to unseat Cartwright in Pennsylvania’s eighth congressional district, a pivotal swing district that could help Republicans recapture the House in 2020. The eighth district Republican primary is on June 2. Bognet said his campaign has garnered significant momentum ahead of the congressional primary. Bognet told Breitbart News Saturday host Matthew Boyle, “We are in great shape, we’re gaining a lot of momentum, you can feel the energy and excitement. People are really enthusiastic about coming out and voting for President Trump to get him more votes than ever before in Pennsylvania. We know we are going ahead looking into the fall, that we are going to be ground zero. We need to win Pennsylvania; the campaign can feel the energy, reaching thousands of voters every day on the phones.”  Boyle noted Bognet had been ahead of the curve on many issues, such as calling for a travel ban from China in the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak. Bognet said Republicans need to take back seats such as Pennsylvania’s eighth district because a Republican-controlled House will protect President Donald Trump from future impeachment shams. “I ran for this office to protect President Trump,” Bognet said. “If we don’t get a Republican House, he will be impeached again in 2021.  We can never let that fiasco, sham, and tragedy happen again. So that is my mission.” Bognet said Trump has worked to improve the lives of the black community and the death of George Floyd was a tragedy; however, he cautioned rioting would not heal the nation’s wounds. He said, “It is a tragedy, national tragedy, George Floyd died. It made me sad; it was very disturbing. I was so glad that President Trump reached out to his family, to offer some solace. And Trump has done amazing things for the black community,” including criminal justice reform. Bognet continued: But there is no excuse for rioting. There is no excuse for burning down your own city. There is no excuse for Antifa agitators to come in, whip people up and try to have mayhem and destruction happen. It’s so sad because you know who it hurts, Matt? It hurts the people in that community. It hurts their brothers and sisters who poured their lives into building laundromats and small shops and businesses, and they burn, and then I saw a guy crying as his business was burning down last night. That was horrible. Bognet said this moment could serve as a catalyst for future criminal justice reform. He added that in a similar manner to the coronavirus response, Democrat Gov. Tom Wolf and Cartwright have not led on criminal justice. Bognet said, “This can be a moment where we get some really positive reforms done. You see police misbehavior? We have to go after it. Because it besmirches the name of the 99.99 percent of good cops. And what I saw the other day was disturbing to a large degree I’m very glad that they brought charges. We cannot allow our neighborhoods to be burned down and when these blue state governors and blue state mayors, instead of taking decisive action, like I think President Trump would have if he was a governor, you know Matt, we’ve seen it with Gov. Wolf, and we’ve seen with Matt Cartwright, they are so out of touch they don’t even know what’s going on in the ground. We’ve seen it with coronavirus, and now we’ve seen it with these riots, the people in these communities are going to feel the pain from this.” Breitbart News Saturday airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 10:00 A.M. to 1:00 P.M.

As the world grapples with the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, ongoing turmoil in the Middle East and Beijing’s brutal interventions in Hong Kong, the organization once charged with offering solutions to such problems is sidelined with nobody listening to its calls for “peace, harmony and global unity.” U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has bemoaned a “lack of leadership” during the world’s worst series of crises since 1945. “Where we see power, we sometimes do not see the necessary leadership,” he said recently. AFP reports even after more than two months of negotiations, the 15 Security Council members are still unable to reach agreement on a resolution supporting a call from Gutteres for a global cease-fire while the world battles the Chinese coronavirus. At the U.N., there is a sense the globalist body is drifting and dysfunctional, even as it continues to plead for more money to fund its operations: <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> “In the past, when you had disagreements among members of the Council, it was compartmentalized,” said a U.N. official, speaking on grounds of anonymity to AFP. “So your adversary one day on a particular issue was your best ally the next day on another issue. What we see now is everything spilling over. “So there are camps, or there are disagreements which just spill over from one issue to another,” the official said, clearly alluding to the situation in Hong Kong, where tough new Chinese security legislation has pitted the two leading permanent members of the U.N. against each other. “The tensions between the U.S. and China are really problematic” for the world body, meaning the Security Council is “not able to move forward on a range of things,” the official added. At a press conference Thursday, Guterres expressed his regret the coronavirus pandemic had not evoked a greater sense of unity from world powers. “If the present crisis shows something, it is our fragility. Collective fragility. When we are fragile, we should be humble. When we are humble, we should be united and in solidarity,” he said, in remarks directed to members of the Security Council. As Breitbart News reported, Guterres has been working for months to secure a global ceasefire to enable countries to stop the spread of the virus that first appeared in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year. Today I am calling for an immediate global ceasefire in all corners of the world. It is time to put armed conflict on lockdown and focus together on the true fight of our lives – the #COVID19 pandemic.https://t.co/F6JRA6ekvZ pic.twitter.com/7WgtFMk5GC — António Guterres (@antonioguterres) March 23, 2020  Oxfam International is just one global charity to register its frustration with the U.N.’s impotence, publishing a report saying the globalist cause has been totally ignored. The cease-fire remains unattained due to the Security Council’s “diplomatic failure” to collectively broker a resolution amid the deadlock, the Oxfam report observed, and its absence is expatriated by years of investment in peace-building and countries continuing to sell weapons for use in war-torn regions. “We expect leadership from the council as well as many of those countries who say they support a cease-fire, but who nevertheless remain active participants in conflicts around the world conducting military operations, selling arms and supporting third parties,” Oxfam Interim Executive Director Jose Maria Vera said in a statement. The U.N. recently called for $2 billion to be transferred from wealthy countries to the poor via the globalist body as an aid in tackling the global pandemic which fell short. The slim financial response prompted another call for funds last month, lifting the target to $6.7 billion to accommodate the U.N.’s all new, specially updated global plan to counter the viral epidemic. Trouble is, nobody is listening to a word the U.N. says, even as it burns through those member financial contributions and a yearly budget of $3,073,830,500 it approved for itself to cover the year 2020.

TEL AVIV – Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday offered Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro help and cooperation to combat the coronavirus in the South American country, which is not the epicenter of the pandemic. According to a statement from his office, Netanyahu expressed “solidarity of the Israeli people with the Brazilian people over the spread of the corona pandemic in Brazil.” The Israeli leader also “offered cooperation with Brazilian industries in manufacturing the medical equipment necessary to deal with the pandemic,” the statement said. Netanyahu also offered to organize discussions between the two countries’ teams of experts in order to pass along Israel’s accumulated experience in dealing with the virus. Bolsonaro, for his part, congratulated Netanyahu on forming his new government and said he expects to continue strengthening bilateral relations together. Brazil has confirmed about 375,000 coronavirus cases, second only to the U.S. Because of the lack of testing, the real number is also believed to be much higher. The countries share warm ties. In a visit to Jerusalem last year, Bolsonaro professed his love for Israel in Hebrew, telling Netanyahu, “Ani ohev et Israel,” or “I love Israel.”

SKOPJE, North Macedonia (AP) — North Macedonia has decided to extend a state of emergency for another two weeks because the coronavirus pandemic shows no sign of slowing down. President Stevo Pendarovski announced the extension of on Saturday following a meeting of the National Security Council. The country´s health authorities reported five new deaths and 35 infections in the previous 24 hours, days after the government allowed bars, cafes and restaurants to reopen. The government does not plan to make the establishments close again. North Macedonia had a total of 2,146 confirmed virus cases as of Saturday, including 131 deaths.    

IVANO-FRANKIVSK, Ukraine (AP) – Wearing a white biohazard suit, a face shield and a blue mask over his mouth and nose, the Rev. Yaroslav Rokhman is hard to recognize as a priest when he visits terminally ill patients at a Ukrainian care centre. But his words still bring comfort to the dying. Rokhman, a clergyman in the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, is pleased just to be performing one of a cleric’s most heartfelt duties again. As the coronavirus pandemic’s grip slowly recedes in Ukraine, priests received clearance on May 22nd to resume religious services and to visit the sick and bereaved. “Patients missed the support and spiritual care. They needed a priest. They needed to pray and talk,” he said while attending to patients at a palliative-care facility in Ivano-Frankivsk, a city 450 kilometres (270 miles) west of the capital of Kyiv. Galina Shamineva, a 34-year-old mother of two with cancer, was heartened to see Rokhman, his intimidating protective gear notwithstanding. “I feel good — all thanks to you,” she said from her bed. “I really needed to be able to confess and partake in the sacrament.” Rokhman spoke to Shamineva in a soothing way and made the sign of the cross with his gloved hands. “Sometimes I cry, but I never give up. I’m fighting ’til the last breath,” she told him. In Chernivtsi, one of the Ukrainian cities hit hardest by the virus, the Rev. Vasyl Gasynets has returned to conducting services at his Greek Catholic church, wearing vestments along with a mask while giving Holy Communion. Members of the congregation also were masked as they stood near each other, as did some choir members as they sang. “Our church was clean before the pandemic. And it’s clean during the pandemic. We respect our people. We want everyone to be healthy,” Gasynets said. “We want them to believe that in the house of God, Jesus Christ, Holy Church, everything is clean.” Regulations to prevent the spread of the virus widened a religious fault line in Ukraine. The Orthodox Church of Ukraine and the Greek Catholic Church complied with government restrictions on holding services. But the rival Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which is affiliated with the Russian Orthodox Church, resisted. After the Russia-linked church allowed people to attend Easter services, authorities filed criminal cases against five priests. If convicted, they face prison sentences of up to eight years. At the church’s world-renowned Pechersk Monastery in Kyiv, more than 100 clerics were infected with the virus, and at least three died. Ukrainian authorities reported 393 new confirmed cases on Saturday, down from some 500 new cases a day earlier in May. The country has recorded a total of more than 23,000 confirmed cases and 696 deaths.  

A United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) report has revealed that as many as 650,000 migrants are currently waiting in Libya, ready to cross the Mediterranean Sea to Europe. The report notes that the Chinese coronavirus pandemic could have a major impact on mass migration, but the outbreak has also made such movements increasingly difficult to predict. “The global crisis caused by the pandemic is unprecedented and it is difficult to predict its impact on human trafficking and migrant smuggling,” the report stated, adding that the severe economic consequences of prolonged lockdowns could fuel a surge of migration from various countries, Il Giornale reports. The UN report states: “This suggests that the travel and movement restrictions caused by Covid-19 are not stopping the movement of people fleeing conflict, violence and dangerous and inhuman conditions,” and added that Libyan migrants are forced to use the services of people smugglers. “Information from Libya, where around 650,000 migrants and refugees are currently registered, suggests that the Covid-19 public health crisis has not discouraged people from trying to reach Europe.” Cargo Vessel Unloads Migrants in Sicily As Migrant Route Numbers Rise https://t.co/HU6nenHUmJ — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 10, 2020  While the number of migrants entering the European Union has decreased overall during the coronavirus outbreak, Italy has seen a surge in new arrivals in recent weeks. On the long-term impact of the pandemic on mass migration, the UNODC report predicted that “Future economic downturns are likely to have an impact in terms of movements of people to the richer countries.” Migrants who have arrived in Italy during the coronavirus lockdown have been placed under quarantine aboard vessels off the coast. A report released earlier this month revealed that Italian taxpayers were paying as much as €4,000 per month per migrant in order to maintain the quarantine. Alessandro Pagano, a member of populist leader Matteo Salvini’s League (Lega), slammed the costs, saying: “We are not talking about a third-hand dinghy, but of a ship equipped with a self-service restaurant, pizzeria, ice cream parlour,  pub with special wine assortment, play area and video room, double or quadruple cabins with services and even luxury suites.” Farage: French Navy Coordinates with UK Authorities to Transfer Boat Migrants to England https://t.co/aVQwxcHAPn — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 21, 2020 

WASHINGTON (AP) – The European Union on Saturday urged President Donald Trump to rethink his decision to terminate the U.S. relationship with the World Health Organization as spiking infection rates in India and elsewhere reinforced that the pandemic is far from contained. Trump on Friday charged that the WHO didn’t respond adequately to the pandemic and accused the U.N. agency of being under China’s “total control.” The U.S. is the largest source of financial support for the WHO, and its exit is expected to significantly weaken the organization. Trump said the U.S. would be “redirecting” the money to “other worldwide and deserving urgent global public health needs,” without providing specifics. The head of the EU’s executive arm urged Trump to reconsider. “The WHO needs to continue being able to lead the international response to pandemics, current and future,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. “For this, the participation and support of all is required and very much needed.” The WHO wouldn’t comment on the announcement but South African Health Minister Zweli Mkhize called it an “unfortunate” turn of events. “Certainly, when faced with a serious pandemic, you want all nations in the world to be particularly focused … on one common enemy,” he told reporters.

A federal judge has allowed to stand Maine Gov. Janet Mills’ (D) order requiring tourists to self-quarantine for two weeks after entering the state, which is known as “Vacationland.” On Friday, U.S. Judge Lance Walker denied a motion for preliminary injunction while the lawsuit proceeds. A group of Maine campground and restaurant owners, who claim the governor’s executive order is discriminatory against visitors to the state and harmful to their businesses, is challenging the rule. The Portland Press Herald noted Mills’ reopening plan has extended the two-week self-quarantine regulation for visitors through at least July. The judge’s decision comes in the wake of a statement of interest filed by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) in support of the lawsuit by the campground and restaurant owners. According to a statement by Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband of the Civil Rights Division: The United States Constitution requires government to protect the privileges and immunities of all citizens in our nation. These privileges and immunities include the right of Americans to travel freely anywhere in our country, and state governments cannot limit the right of out-of-state Americans to travel to their state unless doing so is substantially related to protecting the public safety. The Department of Justice remains committed to defending the constitutional rights of all Americans no matter where they live. The department will continue to be especially vigilant of any infringement on the right to travel that unduly harms the ability of Americans to earn a living and support their families. In response to the DOJ’s statement of interest, Mills said, she was “deeply disappointed – and frankly disgusted – that the U.S Department of Justice is making a concerted effort to undermine the health of the people of Maine.” The governor added the DOJ did not raise similar objections “when the President and his own task force took steps to limit travel.” Mills said the required quarantine for visitors is “a proven tool to prevent the spread of this deadly disease.” “It seems to me that [the DOJ’s] only actual ‘interest’ here is, at best, political or, at worst, to harm Mainers, not defend them,” she stated. A group of Maine legislators sent a letter nearly two weeks ago to U.S. Attorney General William Barr, requesting an investigation into Mills’ numerous executive orders during the coronavirus crisis, and claiming she has “exceeded her executive authority.” Among the specific concerns the lawmakers cited are Mills’ “arbitrary distinction between ‘essential’ and ‘non-essential’ businesses; denial of Maine citizens’ “right to assemble” in churches with gatherings of more than ten people; and her executive order “establishing quarantine restrictions on travelers arriving in Maine.” “She ordered churches, restaurants, motels, state parks, and campgrounds to close their doors as ‘non-essential’ enterprises, while allowing abortion clinics and ice cream parlors to carry on business as usual,” Maine Rep. Larry Lockman (R) said in a statement to Breitbart News. “Mom-and-pop retailers have been shut down, but the big box stores never missed a beat.” “Before it’s over, the lockdown will kill more Mainers than the virus, in addition to killing tens of thousands of jobs and small businesses,” Lockman said. “And for what?” he asked. “On a typical day, no more than three dozen COVID-19 patients are hospitalized statewide, in a state of 1.3 million people.”

Howard County, Maryland, has reversed course on a ban on receiving the Eucharist during Masses this weekend as church services resume in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. Calvin Ball, the county executive, said Thursday in an update to his executive orders: Since Governor Hogan announced a modified reopening of restaurants yesterday, Howard County revisited all food consumption restrictions. As Howard County moves closer to a full Phase 1 Reopening, also as of 5:00 p.m. Friday, May 29th, food consumption restrictions will be lifted for faith institutions. Ball issued an order on Tuesday that stated, “There shall be no consumption of food or beverage of any kind before, during, or after religious services, including food or beverage that would typically be consumed as part of a religious service.” However, as Catholic News Agency reported, the Archdiocese of Baltimore said it had “serious concerns” about the public health guidance placing a ban on the Eucharist as a condition for churches to hold Masses. “Such restriction would restrict the distribution of holy Communion, an integral part of a Catholic Mass,” the archdiocese said in a statement. “In fact, if the priest could not consume the Body and Blood of Christ after consecration, it would not be a valid Mass”:  Archbishop William Lori said in a tweeted video message to Catholics of his archdiocese, “Without question, we’ve been apart for way too long, and we are hungry for the nourishment that the Eucharist provides”: "We have been apart for far too long and we are hungry for nourishment that the Eucharist provides," Archbishop William Lori says in special message to parishioners about the gradual reopening of churches. https://t.co/x9NmNT8sjl — ArchdioceseBaltimore (@archbalt) May 26, 2020  The archbishop said parishes in some jurisdictions are open this weekend “with limited attendance” for the feast of Pentecost. Lori cautioned that a “one size fits all” approach to reopening parishes “isn’t possible,” and she referred Catholics to their individual pastors for further guidance. Mary Ellen Russell, a spokeswoman for the archdiocese, said, “We are very pleased to hear that Howard County will be lifting their restrictions on faith institutions regarding food consumption.”

4. STAY SAFE and take care of each other. Further centralization of political power and enforced material equality should be the response to current unrest, determined Ocasio-Cortez. She said: If you are calling for an end to this unrest, and if you are calling for an end to all of this, but you are not calling for the end of the conditions that created the unrest, you are a hypocrite.  If you’re trying to call for the end of unrest, but you don’t believe health care is a human right, if you’re afraid to say, ‘black lives matter,’ if you’re too scared to call out police brutality, then you aren’t asking for an end of unrest. You are asking for injustice to continue, and for your people to continue to endure the violence of poverty, the violence of lack of housing access, the violence of police brutality, and not say a damn thing. That’s what you’re asking.  So if you’re out here calling for the end of unrest, then you better be calling for health care as a human right. You better be calling for accountability in our policing. You better be supporting community review boards. You better be supporting the end of housing discrimination. You better be standing up to for-profit real estate developers that are intimidating people and trying to evict them from their homes. That’s what you better be calling for, because if you don’t call for those things and you’re asking for the end of unrest, all you’re asking for is the continuation of quiet oppression. So if you want the end of unrest, then you should be asking for measures that actually liberate people in their lives from the oppression of economic and social inequity. Ocasio-Cortez regularly qualifies justice as “economic,” “social,” and “racial.” Follow Robert Kraychik on Twitter.

The protests across the nation over the death of George Floyd are fueling fears in U.S. cities that the demonstrations could exacerbate the spread of the novel coronavirus outbreak, which has disproportionally ravaged minority populations. At the very least, thousands of people, many of them from minority communities, have taken to the streets to express outrage over Floyd’s death while disregarding mitigation policies like social distancing meant to stem the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Minority communities have “been most traumatized by the dual crisis of a COVID-19 pandemic and an economic crisis that we’re facing right now,” St. Paul, MN Mayor Melvin Carter (D) pointed out during a press conference Saturday. “Those same communities are being re-traumatized right now as our black-owned barbershops, as our immigrant-owned restaurants as local generational family-owned businesses are damaged and destroyed night after night,” he added. “This must stop.” Some protesters are wearing masks, but Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) told reporters on Saturday they are doing so for the wrong reasons — to wreak havoc without being recognized and “take advantage of this situation.” “I will continue to stress because it seems like a lifetime ago: We are still in the middle of a pandemic and passed 1,000 deaths yesterday. We still have hospitals on the verge of being overrun with COVID-19,” Gov. Walz declared. “We are in the middle of a pandemic right now,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey (D) added, echoing Walz. “We have two crises that are sandwiched on top of one another.” On Thursday, health officials in Minnesota also warned that the mass protests were almost sure to fuel new COVID-19 cases. The Star Tribune quoted State Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm as saying: People are moved to want to speak and to want to gather in solidarity and in protest, and we certainly honor and respect that right. As we know, large gatherings do pose a risk in any epidemic, but certainly where we stand today with the state of COVID-19 spread in our community. Knowing that we have community spread, we just want to again encourage folks who gather to be mindful of the risk. Violent rioting and looting have been raging in Minnesota’s Twin Cities, particularly in Minneapolis, where Floyd died after Derek Chauvin, a now-fired white police officer, kneeled on his neck for several minutes in an incident caught on camera. Floyd was unarmed. The havoc that began in Minnesota has spread to urban centers across America, including New York City. “You have a right to demonstrate. You have the right to protest. God bless America,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) declared during his coronavirus briefing Saturday. “You don’t have a right to infect other people. You don’t have a right to act in a way that’s going to jeopardize public health.” “Even if you think you’re a superhero because you’re young and you’re strong, you can get it and then infect someone else,” he added. “So it’s just wholly irresponsible… You can have an opinion, but there are also facts, and you’re wrong not to wear a mask.” Protests, including peaceful demonstrations, have been sweeping the nation since Floyd’s death on Monday as many cities began a phased reopening. “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” Minnesota Gov. Walz said. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear, and disrupting our great cities.” At least initially, some Democrats, including Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, endorsed the protests that have spiraled out of control. On Friday, Authorities have charged fired police officer Chauvin with third-degree murder and manslaughter.

During Friday’s Democratic Weekly Address, Rep. Frank Pallone (D-NJ) stated that the HEROES Act “lays the foundation we will need to ease social distancing and safely reopen the economy.” Transcript as Follows: “Hello, I’m Congressman Frank Pallone from New Jersey. This week, our nation mourns the loss of 100,000 Americans to the coronavirus. It’s a staggering number and grim milestone. Families all around our nation continue to grieve lost ones, oftentimes from a distance. While it’s difficult to even comprehend this loss, it reminds us that we must come together to combat this terrible virus so that we can save lives and protect communities in the weeks and months ahead. This national emergency requires every aspect of government to work together. We must reduce the spread of the virus so we can confidently begin to reopen our economy and get more than 40 million Americans, who’ve lost their jobs as a result of this pandemic, back to work. And the only way we can do that is through a coordinated national strategy: a strategy that significantly boosts testing and invests resources into contact tracing, surveillance and containment. We simply cannot fight this pandemic if we don’t know who has it and where it is being spread. And that requires a national strategy and response. Unfortunately, President Trump and his Administration have failed to provide the consistent and stable leadership that is necessary to guard our nation through this public health and economic crisis. Instead of showing leadership, competence and vision, the Trump Administration is shirking all responsibility and is instead forcing states to find their own way out of this pandemic. For months, the President has refused to develop and implement a national testing program. For months, we’ve been promised millions of tests were right around the corner and that everyone that wanted a test could get one. These promises have been hollow. Testing is getting better, but public health experts continue to warn that our country is far short of the testing we need. And the failure of national leadership has forced states to compete against each other to procure tests and the vital supplies needed to administer tests from the private market. We simply cannot allow the Trump Administration’s failures to persist, and that’s why House Democrats took bold action and passed The Heroes Act earlier this month. This legislation continues our ongoing commitment to providing the health care resources and support needed to combat the coronavirus crisis. The Heroes Act will strengthen testing by finally requiring the Trump Administration to develop comprehensive, coordinated strategies for testing, contact tracing and surveillance. The Administration will be required to include clear benchmarks and timelines. It will also be forced to publicly report key metrics. These requirements are critical to bringing much needed transparency to our nation’s response efforts. It will allow us to see if the Trump Administration is fulfilling their promises and hold them accountable when they are not. The Heroes Act also provides up to $75 billion in grants to support robust testing, contact tracing, surveillance and containment activities. It also provides additional funding to communities that have a high number of COVID-19 cases or are experiencing a surge, as well as for areas with populations experiencing disparities. This includes low-income and the uninsured, communities of color, people with disabilities and other underserved communities. We simply cannot beat this virus without these efforts in place. The Heroes Act builds on the progress we have made and lays the foundation we will need to ease social distancing and safely reopen the economy. Now, it’s time for the Senate to act. Unfortunately, to date, Senate Majority Leader McConnell continues to delay and obstruct. This cannot continue. With more than 100,000 Americans dead, we must collectively find solutions, like The Heroes Act, that will help us finally stop the spread of this virus. It is the only way we will be able to protect the American people, and safely and confidently reopen our communities. I thank you for listening, and please, stay safe.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

MANCHESTER, England (AP) – Sports events will be allowed to resume in England from Monday without any spectators, providing they comply with the government’s coronavirus protocols. The guidance for elite sports bodies was published by the government on Saturday as COVID-19 lockdown restrictions that were imposed in March are eased further. “The wait is over,” Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said. “Live British sport will shortly be back on in safe and carefully controlled environments.” It paves the way for the planned June 17 return of the Premier League, the world’s richest soccer competition. “There is still much work to be done to ensure the safety of everyone involved,” Premier League chief executive Richard Masters said. The government announcement allows English cricket authorities to plan for international series against West Indies and Pakistan. Formula One is also exploring two races at Silverstone from July, with the season yet to start. The first competitions to return on Monday are set to be horse racing, snooker and greyhound racing which lined up events in anticipation of the end of an 11-week shutdown of sports. British horse racing employs tens of thousands of people and the absence of meets since March 17 has left many facing “considerable hardship,” according to the Jockey Club. “The lockdown has been an incredibly hard period for our industry and it will be a long road back to recovery,” Jockey Club chief executive Delia Bushell said. “While we are not a human-contact sport, extensive plans are nevertheless in place to create the safest possible environment for participants.” Athletes and other staff will be required to travel to venues individually and by private transport where possible. Screening for coronavirus symptoms is required before entering. Where social distancing cannot be maintained – staying 2 meters (6 feet) apart – activities need to be risk assessed and mitigated. Media have been told to “minimize crossover” with others at the venue, including players. There is also a request that “during any disputes between players and referees, or scoring celebrations” they must stay apart. “This guidance provides the safe framework for sports to resume competitions behind closed doors,” Dowden said. “It is now up to individual sports to confirm they can meet these protocols and decide when it´s right for them to restart. “This is a significant moment for British sport. By working with clinicians every step of the way, we are creating the safest possible environments for everyone involved.” The first major event after the resumption of sports is set to be the 2,000 Guineas horse race next Saturday at Newmarket, with jockeys wearing face masks. But the government is not yet prepared to allow non-elite sports to resume, denying regular citizens the chance to play cricket and football in a park. “We are working hard to get grassroots sport back up and running safely too, so that people can reunite with their own football, rugby or cricket teammates and get back on their pitches, fields or athletic tracks,” Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston said. “But we will only do this when it is safe and appropriate to do so, based upon scientific advice.” The government, however, will from Monday allow groups of six people from different households to exercise outside as long as they remain 2 meters apart. Currently only two people from different households can meet up. Though the Covid-19 deaths per day have fallen in Britain since the peak in April, another 215 were still reported on Saturday by the government, bringing the known death toll in all settings including hospitals and care homes to 38,376. Deputy chief medical officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam said it was still a “very dangerous moment” but added the return of sports events without spectators “is not going to have any meaningful impact” on the infection rate.

BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Romania’s prime minister has paid fines totalling about $600 for smoking indoors and holding a meeting in a government building where several Cabinet ministers and other participants did not follow social distancing rules. In a photograph published in Romanian media, Prime Minister Ludovic Orban and others can be seen smoking with food and bottles of alcohol on a table. No one in the photo wore a mask or maintained the required spacing. Orban told the Mediafax news agency that the picture was taken on May 25th, his birthday. The foreign minister and economy minister of Romania were among those attending. Romania has registered 19,133 confirmed coronavirus cases and 1,259 deaths.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has cashed in the first portion of an incentive-based stock options payout for keeping the company’s market capitalization at $100 billion along with hitting revenue milestones. The award is valued at about $775 million. CNBC reports that Tesla CEO Elon Musk has earned the first part of a huge incentive payout according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday. The payouts are linked to 1.7 million shares of Tesla which are valued at around $775 million based on Thursday’s closing market value. Tesla shares closed at $805.81 on Thursday and options have a strike price of $350.02. Thursday’s filing also set a day of July 7 for the company’s annual shareholders meeting, stating: “As of the date of this proxy statement, one of the 12 tranches under this award has vested and become exercisable, subject to Mr. Musk’s payment of the exercise price of $350.02 per share and the minimum five-year holding period generally applicable to any shares he acquires upon exercise.” Musk has earned the first portion of stock options for keeping Tesla’s market capitalization at $100 billion on a 30-day six-month trailing average. A 2018 regulatory filing outlined the conditions for the payout which included Tesla hitting trailing-fourth-quarter revenue of $20 billion or EBITDA (minus stock-based compensation) of $1.5 billion for Musk to get the stock award. Musk owned approximately 18.5 percent of Tesla as of May 1 according to FactSet, an ownership stake worth around $24 billion. Thursday’s proxy filing revealed that Musk’s stake in the company had risen to 20.8 percent, a total of 38.7 million shares, including 18.5 million used as collateral for the CEO’s personal debt. Musk’s full award is set to vest over 12 tranches with different milestone requirements reaching up to $650 billion in market capitalization for Tesla. Since the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic began, Tesla has focused heavily on reopening its manufacturing facilities. Breitbart News recently reported that Tesla plans to open its plant in Fremont, California, and has told workers their options are to violate the state’s stay-at-home orders and come to work, or stay home and forgo payment and benefits. In an email obtained by the Guardian from Tesla’s management to its workers, the firm stated: “Choosing not to report to work may eliminate or reduce your eligibility for unemployment depending on your state’s unemployment agency.” Tesla workers told the Guardian that they feel that Tesla’s management is using intimidation tactics in order to force them to return to the job by threatening to cut their pay and unemployment benefits. Breitbart News recently reported that Tesla has sued local authorities for attempting to enforce shutdown orders. In a post to the company blog on Saturday, Tesla stated that the county’s position had left it no choice but to take legal action to ensure that Tesla and its employees could return to work.

Rapper Lil Wayne interviewed doctor Anthony Fauci — the director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases — on his new radio show, Young Money Radio. “I want to say thank you for even considering being on this show, Dr. Fauci, I really do want to say thank you,” said Lil Wayne as he introduced Dr. Fauci to his show, which is hosted via Apple Music’s Beats 1 radio. “You made a prediction that the U.S. could experience 100,000 to 200,000 deaths,” the Grammy-winner added. “I saw a week later, you were forced to revise that estimate. What number do you think we’re at now?” Fauci estimated that the United States will likely see between 120,000 to 140,000 coronavirus deaths this year. “Well, as you mentioned correctly, Lil Wayne, we’re over 100,000,” said Fauci. “And we still have a number of states, cities, regions, that have active transmission of infection. So although we don’t want to predict an exact number, I think it’s probably going to be at least another 20 or more thousand, maybe 120,000, 140,000.”     We have two doctors on the show today — Dr. Dre, and the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases DR. FAUCI!  We’re facing the worst pandemic of our lifetime and he’ll be on to have a REAL discussion about its affect on our community. Watch LIVE on  #YoungMoneyRadio at 4pm PT/7pm ET on @applemusic. 🏾 A post shared by  Lil Wayne (@liltunechi) on May 29, 2020 at 1:39pm PDT “You gotta be careful, because you know, all of these predictions that we’ve made over these months have turned out to not be completely accurate,” added Fauci. “If we don’t make sure — as we’re trying to ‘open up America again’ — to get things back to normal, there’s gonna be people who are going to get infected, and we may get rebounds.” “So we need to be able to prepare ourselves to respond to those rebounds,” affirmed Fauci. The rapper then asked whether Fauci thinks that returning to normalcy will increase the risk of infection. “I see a lot of cities opening back up and people partying in large numbers,” noted Lil Wayne. “Do you think this will affect the numbers of deaths?” “I think it will,” said Fauci. “I think that if you look at the dynamics of an outbreak in any given state, city, or county, or region, if the infection level is really low, they can afford to be a little more brisk in how they open up and get back to some form of normality.” But if you have a state our a county or a city in which there’s still a lot of active infection, and you jump out there and prematurely do the kind of mingling and get rid of the distancing — you know, you saw those pictures on TV of people crowding at bars and at beaches — you gotta be careful of that because you might be tempting to fate to allow there be a rebound infection, so you gotta do this with care with prudence. To date, the 21 states that have eased lockdown restrictions since May 4 haven’t experienced significant increases in Chinese coronavirus hospitalizations and fatalities, according to an ABC News investigation. The report also said there wasn’t a spike in the rate of people testing positive for the disease. “I hope we’ll get a vaccine,” added Fauci at one point during the interview. “By December?” asked Lil Wayne. “We’ve already started the early phases of the vaccine trial in a number of different candidates,” said Fauci. “And we hope that if we get lucky — and I’m cautiously optimistic that we will — that by the end of this calendar year, the beginning of 2021, that we would have a vaccine that we could deploy to people throughout the country, and then other vaccines maybe throughout the world,” he added.

ROME — The Vatican has decried the rise in anti-Christian hate crimes throughout Europe as well as the discriminatory treatment suffered by Christians during the coronavirus lockdowns. Speaking on behalf of the Holy See, Monsignor Janusz Urbańczyk stressed the gravity of anti-Christian violence in an address at a conference of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) on intolerance and discrimination, Vatican News reported Thursday. The Holy See’s Permanent Representative to OSCE noted the disturbing increase in explicitly anti-Christian acts in Europe, including “threats, violent attacks, murders and profanation of churches and places of worship, cemeteries and other religious properties.” In 2019, Christian sites in Europe suffered a record number of attacks, with some 3,000 Christian churches, schools, cemeteries, and monuments vandalized, looted, or defaced. Reports chronicling the anti-Christian acts describe a broad spectrum of profanation including arson, defecation, desecration, looting, mockery, Satanism, theft, urination, and vandalism. The greatest number of acts of violence against Christian sites have occurred in France, where churches, schools, cemeteries, and monuments “are being vandalized, desecrated, and burned at an average rate of three per day,” the reports state. In his address this week, Msgr. Urbańczyk said he was concerned over the growth of the false idea “that religions could have a negative impact or represent a threat to the well-being of our societies” as well as the push to make prayer and religious practice a private matter with no place in the public square.

Even in the midst of times of crisis, fundamental freedoms such as religious liberty must be respected, the monsignor declared. “Tolerance cannot be an alibi for denying or guaranteeing fundamental human rights,” he said.

China’s state-run Xinhua news service on Friday took great interest in an American researcher’s call for more aggressive censorship by Big Tech companies to reduce “misinformation.”  China’s censorship regime was originally justified as just such a crusade against false information and the regime’s apologists claim that is the primary goal of their million-censor army to this day. The article that caught Xinhua’s interest referred primarily to incorrect information about the Chinese coronavirus, which adds an extra layer of bitter irony since the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is the world’s undisputed heavyweight champion at spreading false coronavirus information: “The pandemic lays bare how tech companies’ reluctance to act recursively worsens our world. In times of uncertainty, the vicious cycle is more potent than ever,” said Joan Donovan, research director of the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School in Cambridge, Massachusetts. […] The senior researcher demanded that “tech companies become more transparent, accountable and socially beneficial,” while urging holding them to this commitment long after the pandemic. “Social media companies must flatten the curve of misinformation,” she added. The Chinese government would never leave it to any private companies to bulldoze that “curve of misinformation” according to their own notions of accuracy or fairness. In China, all of the misinformation bulldozers are driven by Communist Party officials, and a private company CEO who decided to “fact check” a statement by dictator Xi Jinping would never be seen or heard from again.  Dissident Xu Zhiyong, for example, who attempted to do just that in a scathing letter demanding Xi resign, is facing 15 years in prison for his “fact check.” Donovan’s article, which probably caught the eye of the Chinese Communist Party because she railed at length against President Donald Trump and “right-wingers” (and special guest star Elon Musk) for being too enthusiastic about using hydroxychloroquine to combat the effects of the coronavirus, perhaps inadvertently made the case that only a massive government censorship apparatus on the scale of the one constructed by Beijing could provide the level of inoculation against “misinformation” that she advocates: After blanket coverage of the distortion of the 2016 US election, the role of algorithms in fanning the rise of the far right in the United States and United Kingdom, and of the antivax movement, tech companies have announced policies against misinformation. But they have slacked off on building the infrastructure to do commercial-content moderation and, despite the hype, artificial intelligence is not sophisticated enough to moderate social-media posts without human supervision. Tech companies acknowledge that groups, such as The Internet Research Agency and Cambridge Analytica, used their platforms for large-scale operations to influence elections within and across borders. At the same time, these companies have balked at removing misinformation, which they say is too difficult to identify reliably. Moderating content after something goes wrong is too late. Preventing misinformation requires curating knowledge and prioritizing science, especially during a public crisis. In my experience, tech companies prefer to downplay the influence of their platforms, rather than to make sure that influence is understood. Proper curation requires these corporations to engage independent researchers, both to identify potential manipulation and to provide context for ‘authoritative content’. U.S. tech companies are not shy about admitting they cannot police everyone for misinformation, hate speech, and so forth. An ostensibly fair system can be made grossly unfair by applying it unevenly, which is the heart of the criticism from those who noticed that Twitter will contentiously label a post from President Trump for “glorifying violence” but seems untroubled by the Supreme Leader of Iran’s enthusiasm for genocide. The Chinese Communist Party does use “sophisticated artificial intelligence” as part of its massive censorship apparatus, but also has a huge number of human operators working to suppress speech the government dislikes. China imposes its censorship mandates on foreign speech as much as possible and blocks foreign sources of information it cannot control. The cost of such an operation is far beyond anything a profit-seeking company could pay and, as the current debate about Twitter censorship demonstrates, it is exceedingly difficult to find a standard of absolute truth or perfect fairness that would insulate private censors from complaints, retaliatory loss of business, and possibly legal action.  Hydroxychloroquine is, like everything else related to the coronavirus, a matter of much debate among the medical community. That community is still torn by vigorous arguments over whether surgical masks provide any protection from the pandemic. The World Health Organization, of which Donovan wrote approvingly in her article, continues to insist they do not, but masks have become tremendously important to the American Left and the Democrat Party, and its members regard challenges to the effectiveness of masks as “misinformation.” This, again, is not a problem for China. A high-ranking member of the ruling party in good standing would never be accused of spreading misinformation because the truth is whatever the Party says it is. If the truth changes tomorrow, the old truth becomes misinformation. If a high official falls from Party grace, he suddenly becomes a source of misinformation.  The CCP believes its approach is the only way to police the turbulent Internet for “truth,” so it is quite happy to hear people who haven’t thought all the way to the end of the censorship game take a few fumbling steps in its direction.

In Mudanjiang, a city in China’s northeastern Heilongjiang province, a recent spike in coronavirus cases has caused the government to reimpose a partial lockdown, the Epoch Times reported on Friday, with local reports indicating that authorities are sealing residents in their homes. Over the past three days, Mudanjiang health authorities announced that they had identified eleven asymptomatic carriers of coronavirus in the city. The news followed a period of several weeks in which authorities reported no confirmed or asymptomatic cases of the virus. According to the report, Chinese officials record asymptomatic cases separately from symptomatic, or confirmed, cases. Flights into and out of the city have been halted, along with train and bus services, according to the report. Students who had returned to school in recent days were ordered to return home. This is the third time Mudanjiang has faced lockdown restrictions. It was first locked down in January, along with most of China, after the initial Wuhan coronavirus outbreak late last year in the eponymous central Chinese city, then again last month following another outbreak. Students had just been allowed to return to school on May 25 when the third lockdown was announced, according to the report. On May 28, a local taxi driver surnamed Huang told the Chinese-language Epoch Times that residential compounds in Mudanjiang where asymptomatic carriers live have been fully “locked down” from the outside. “Shuguang Xincheng has 107 residential buildings and is one of the largest residential compounds in Heilongjiang Province,” Huang said. “The whole compound was locked down on the evening of May 25.” She added that the Lishui Lantian residential compound, where a colleague of hers resides, was also locked down. A video uploaded to social media by a Mudanjiang local on May 25 and shared by the Epoch Times supports Huang’s account of residences being fully “locked down.” It shows government workers at the Shuguang Xincheng residential compound installing a metal bar on the gate of a residential building, sealing it off from the outside. A similar lockdown was documented last month in Harbin, the capital of Heilongjiang province, located about 200 miles northwest of Mudanjiang. There, one local filmed a residential unit that had been locked from the outside by authorities, who placed an official notice on the gate stating that people suspected of having coronavirus lived inside the sealed compound. At the time, Harbin had officially admitted to just 58 cases of coronavirus, despite enforcing the extreme lockdown measures.

Some Wuhan residents admitted to state hospitals for coronavirus treatment have said they were left in prolonged isolation during their stay under torturous conditions, with at least one person allegedly committing suicide due to maltreatment, Bitter Winter, a human rights magazine, reported on Thursday. According to the report, one Wuhan resident wrote an open letter criticizing the Chinese government after his coronavirus patient mother was left in agony from poor treatment at state hospitals and subsequently took her own life. The man says that his 75-year-old mother was assigned to an isolation unit at a Wuhan hospital after being diagnosed with coronavirus on February 9. “I feel blindsided and cheated by the government,” the man wrote in his letter, blasting the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) “propaganda machine” that “promote[s] … news about its solid attempts to fight the epidemic, how the epidemic was put under control, and how many patients were treated, fully recovered, and were released from the hospital.” He said his mother’s death proves the CCP coronavirus propaganda is a lie. “During her isolation, no doctor treated her at all, and no one gave her injections, medicine, or other most basic care to prevent the deterioration of her condition,” the man wrote. The man’s mother told him that she was not the only coronavirus patient left unattended in the isolation ward. According to her account, two older women assigned to her wing were “barely breathing” and “constantly soiled their beds,” but no one came to clean or check on them. Left along in such desperate conditions, the woman told her son that she “had no choice but to wait for her death.” After a week in the isolation ward, the woman was transferred to Wuhan’s No. 3 Hospital, where doctors again failed to administer her any treatment. The man wrote that doctors did nothing more than take his mother’s temperature each day. “On February 26, the hospital declared my mother cured of coronavirus, and she was transferred to a medical observation facility for 14 days,” the Wuhan resident says. According to the man’s account, his mother was discharged from the observation facility on March 11 despite a persistent fever that had not yet abated. The woman had also been suffering from an “unbearable” stomach pain that her son says was still present when she was discharged. The woman’s family then took her to another local general hospital in the hopes of finding treatment elsewhere. However, doctors there refused to admit the woman, claiming her condition “did not meet hospitalization standards.” The man says the family tried other hospitals but were unsuccessful. Without further recourse, the family took the woman home, despite her fever and “severe [stomach] pain.” At home without treatment, the woman grew desperate from her condition in the subsequent weeks. “My mother gave up all hope,” the man wrote in his letter. “On April 15, she ingested pesticide and killed herself.” Several accounts of coronavirus patients facing “isolation without treatment” have been documented on Chinese social media in recent weeks and months, with some describing the isolation wards as “death camps.” “The hospital repeatedly said they gave me the best treatment design, but in reality, they did nothing for me,” a 23-year-old university student from Wuhan wrote on her Weibo account (China’s version of Twitter) in March while in an isolation ward for coronavirus patients in Wuhan. The account was reportedly part of a suicide note, as the woman threatened to take her own life. “I’ll die in discontent!” she said. In April, another Wuhan resident whose parent died after contracting coronavirus in a Wuhan hospital on February 1 blamed the local government for the death. The Wuhan coronavirus was first documented in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Before authorities had publicly admitted there was an epidemic in Wuhan, Zhang Lifa took his father to a Wuhan hospital in January for medical treatment unrelated to the virus. While admitted, the man contracted the virus and later died. Zhang says the authorities’ “lies and cover-ups” during Wuhan’s initial coronavirus outbreak late last year were directly responsible for his father’s death.

A Cuban poet and political activist claimed this week that Cuban dissidents confined to their home during the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic are essentially under house arrest, with the Communist regime taking advantage of the conditions to further silence anti-government voices. Amaury Pacheco lives in Alamar – less than ten miles east of Cuba’s capital, Havana – with his large family. They have been confined to their home under strict coronavirus lockdown measures for several weeks, which should apply to most Cubans on the island, but police, dissidents say, have been more intensely enforcing the measures against them. A poet and vocal critic of Cuba’s Communist regime, Pacheco told the Spanish newspaper Diario de Cuba that he has come to understand firsthand how the government has taken advantage of mandatory restrictions on people’s movement during the pandemic to further repress political dissent. Forced home confinement during the pandemic has significantly hindered traditional methods of protest, according to Pacheco. Before, activists would stand up to repressive regimes in person, he said, using their bodies to occupy public space in a physical demonstration that spoke volumes. Historically, Pacheco says, “[w]e take to the street. We break the mantra that the street belongs to the revolutionaries. We give it another meaning. We set aside those old tropes and present our physical bodies in their place.” “[The new conditions] have created some anxiety for me because there are arrests [of dissidents],” he said. Pacheco continued: The government has taken advantage of Covid-19 [Chinese coronavirus] to convert our houses into prisons. I understand that there are many measures that are important, but a government that takes advantage of and treats all citizens as criminals … It detains activists, people who are against obscure decrees that go against freedom of expression. During and after Covid-19 [the Chinese coronavirus pandemic] what will we do? … Will our activism collapse because the government has gained ground and has detained us in our very homes? The artist said that during the pandemic, almost all political activism in Cuba has been pushed online. “[All the activism] has spilled over onto the internet. There is more communication now because people are there, Cubans in Cuba, and those in other parts of the world,” he said. Pacheco said that political writing and poetry that the Communist regime might not allow people to share publicly remains free to be published in online forums. “Now we present poetry online as perhaps we could not have presented it in public spaces. In that sense, it [the transition to online activism] has been a benefit,” the poet said. Pacheco says he and his wife, also an artist, are homeschooling their four children – ages 8, 9, 11, and 12 – during the pandemic, adding that they had already been supplementing their children’s state-mandated education prior to the lockdown. “The education they give at school is very bad. We have noticed in recent years that there were elements missing in [the state-mandated curriculum that] we have had to supply as parents,” the writer said. Homeschooling prior to the pandemic was illegal in Cuba. Schools serve as pivotal indoctrination centers, teaching allegiance and zeal for the Communist Party. Cuban officials have famously imprisoned parents for homeschooling. Last year, Pastor Ramón Rigal and wife Ayda Expósito, were sentenced to two years and a year and a half in prison for insisting on homeschooling their children to avoid their indoctrination with communist values. Expósito recently concluded her sentence. In his interview with Diario de Cuba, Pacheco also mentioned that he had witnessed the infamous bread lines that many Cubans are forced to stand in for state food rations. Pacheco said he and his family had stocked up on basic supplies prior to the pandemic and were fortunate enough not to have to wait in these lines yet. He said many people wait in long lines only to receive nothing as the food supplies run out before they reach the end of the line.

Authorities in Blackburn said they will “take action” over a gathering of Muslim men praying in the streets which constituted a “serious breach” of coronavirus lockdown measures. Police in Lancashire had granted “special permission … to perform the [Muslim] call to prayer” in Blackburn to mark Eid, according to a letter signed by Assistant Chief Constable Peter Lawson and local government leader Mohammed Khan. But the document, which was seen by BBC Asian Network, reportedly emphasised that individuals must “pray privately in their home” as “restrictions on congregational prayers had not been lifted”. “Not on the street, not in congregation with an Imam leading the prayer, not with amplified microphones and not with road closures,” the authorities specified.

Sayyed Osman, the council’s director of adult services, suggested that “the whole community feels let down” by the event, which appeared to breach Wuhan virus guidelines on social distancing and public meetings. “No permission was given for any such gathering and we see this as a serious breach of the national lockdown,” he said, claiming that it was “only a very small minority” who had prayed on the street. “We are working with the police to take action against the individual who organised the gatherings.” Multicultural Blackburn is said to be one of Britain’s least socially cohesive places, with the “Muslim Asian and white communities were living worlds apart” in a kind of informal segregation, according to a BBC investigation in 2007. A follow-up investigation by the BBC in 2018 found that the situation had, if anything, significantly worsened, with the broadcaster — not normally keen to highlight the downside impact of diversity on the country — quoting one South Asian heritage migrant saying: “There were probably about half a dozen Asian families here [when I arrived], nowadays there’s probably half a dozen white families left” — with “very little prospect for integration”.

Breitbart London previously compared the media uproar over Cummings, which attracted international attention, to the lack of establishment interest when globalist Irish leader Leo Varadkar was pictured at a topless barbecue in the park with multiple friends. The picnic was dismissed as a “storm in a bag of cans” with the assertion that Varadkar “did no harm” being made in the Irish Times — a newspaper which previously printed multiple pieces condemning British prime minister Boris Johnson for his refusal to sack Cummings. In one article, which decried Britain and America as “racist” nations “full of white people”, it was claimed that Cummings having held on to his job had revealed “a British political establishment that is obnoxious, its corruption and lies hiding in plain sight”.

MOSCOW – Russia has recorded nearly 9,000 new cases of the coronavirus, roughly consistent with the increases reported over the past two weeks. The national coronavirus task force said Saturday that 4,555 Russians have died of Covid-19 and 396,575 infections have been confirmed overall. The relatively low mortality rate compared with other countries has prompted scepticism domestically and abroad. In a bid to dispel suspicions that authorities are trying to lower the death toll for political reasons, Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova explained Friday that Russia’s count contains only those confirmed to have died of the infection, but she also gave figures for people who tested positive for the virus but died of other causes. If all categories are counted as Covid-19 deaths, the nation’s total toll for April would stand at 2,713, or nearly 60 per cent more than the previously announced number.    

BERLIN (AP) – Chancellor Angela Merkel will not personally attend a meeting in the U.S. with the leaders of the world’s major economies if President Donald Trump goes ahead with it, unless the course of the coronavirus spread changes by then, her office said Saturday. After cancelling the Group of Seven summit, originally scheduled for June 10-12 at Camp David, Trump said a week ago that he was again considering hosting an in-person meeting of world leaders because it would be a “great sign to all” of things returning to normal during the pandemic. Immediately after that announcement, Merkel suggested she had not yet made up her mind on whether to attend in person or by video conference, but her office told the dpa news agency she has now made a decision. “As of today, given the overall pandemic situation, she cannot commit to participating in person,” her office said. It added that the chancellor would continue to monitor the coronavirus situation in case things change.

Greece released a list of 29 countries whose nationals will be allowed to visit the country on holiday but several countries such as Britain and Sweden were notably absent. Tourists from the approved countries who arrive in airports in Athens and Thessaloniki will be checked for Chinese coronavirus symptoms, with the checks based on the passport of the traveller and not where the flight originated. The list of approved travel countries was created after announcements by the European Air Safety Agency (EASA) and includes several European countries such as Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Denmark, along with countries outside of Europe such as New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, and even China. All travellers attempting to enter Greece from countries not on the list, according to a report by newspaper Proto Thema, will have to undergo a mandatory two-week quarantine upon arriving. The Greek Ministry of Tourism said that the new policy would go into effect on June 15th and is the first phase of opening the country back up to international travel. Danes Want to Re-open Land Borders to Everyone Except No-Lockdown Sweden https://t.co/A2nX8Gi4Xo — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 17, 2020  The second phase, expected to start on July 1st, will involve all airports in Greece accepting international flights and a second “red list” created of countries that have not managed to keep the spread of the virus under strict control. While the list includes countries like Austria, Germany, and Hungary, it does not include countries like the United Kingdom and Sweden where infection rates continue to grow. Sweden has also been largely isolated by neighbouring Scandinavian countries due to a large number of infections and deaths in the country as a result of the Chinese virus and their refusal to lock down. Mika Salminen, health safety manager at Finland’s Institute for Health and Welfare said that it was much riskier for the country to allow in Swedish tourists, as opposed to those from Denmark or Norway. “It is a political decision, but the actual difference in the spread of infection is a fact, and I suppose the government, of course, takes that into account,” he said. The British government, on the other hand, did lock down — but never implemented travel bans or mandatory periods of self-isolation on people coming into the country.

A new poll released by USA Today/Ipsos found that one in five, or 20 percent, of teachers say they are not likely to return to their schools should they reopen in the fall. The “parallel” online polls of the views of 505 K-12 teachers and 403 K-12 parents were conducted May 18-21. The polls’ credibility intervals, which are similar to a margin of error, are plus or minus five percentage points for the teachers’ survey and 5.6 points for the parents’ survey. According to the polls, 83 percent of teachers said their job is more difficult now, while 71 percent of parents said they believe teachers are working harder. However, a report at Education Week in April observed that teachers have had many more “flexible arrangements” during the coronavirus crisis. “The actual amount of time teachers are expected to instruct on a daily or weekly basis is shorter,” the report noted. “But they must reserve specific times for ‘office hours,’ when they are available to help students and parents individually.” In the USA Today/Ipsos teachers’ poll, 76 percent said online learning is causing children to fall behind academically, and 24 percent said public school teachers are paid fairly. However, less than half, or 46 percent of parents, said online learning is causing their children to fall behind, and 40 percent of parents said teachers are paid fairly. USA Today/Ipsos noted that, in a separate poll of parents, six in ten, or 60 percent, said they will likely pursue at-home learning in the fall even if their public schools reopen, including 30 percent who said they are “very likely” to continue at-home learning options. A RealClear Opinion Research poll released two weeks ago found 40 percent of families are more likely to choose to homeschool their children or engage in virtual learning even after schools reopen. Additionally, an EdChoice poll released in April found 52 percent of parents have a more favorable opinion of homeschooling since the school closures due to the coronavirus. “As our world has changed, almost everything we do has changed, including how we view and approach education,” said Cliff Young, president of Ipsos, in a statement. “Though Americans are optimistic about a return to in-person learning, there is angst among teachers, parents and America at large about how to keep our schools safe if the virus isn’t fully contained.”

Delaware Gov. John Carney (D) issued a cease and desist notice on Thursday threatening to arrest and fine a spa owner for planning to reopen the business in protest of the state’s stay-at-home order, issued to get a handle on the novel coronavirus outbreak. “Further failure to comply with the Governor’s order constitutes a criminal offense and may result in fines and imprisonment,” the Delaware Emergency Management Agency (DEMA), a component of the state’s Department of Safety and Homeland Security, declared in the May 28 cease and desist letter, first published by the Gateway Pundit (TGP). Although the state will begin phased reopening on June 1, the letter said the V Spa will not be allowed to open during Phase I because it is a “close contact personal services business,” adding: Your anticipated operation of a close contact persona services business prior to the termination of the State of Emergency is a direct violation of the Governor’s order and endangers public health. The Governor’s order has the force and effect of law. By the authority vested in the Delaware Emergency Management Agency (“DEAMA). DEMA formally mandates that you immediately Cease and Desist business at the V Spa …. Lauren Witzke, who is trying to unseat Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE), has been an ardent supporter of the V Spa owner. In a statement to Breitbart News, she lambasted the Delaware governor’s office for threatening to imprison and fine the business owner. “The COVID-19 shutdowns in the state of Delaware have gone on far too long. It’s no longer about public health and safety. It’s about political control and ensuring the Democrats’ proposed ‘Vote by Mail’ scheme to steal the 2020 election from President Donald Trump is implemented,” the America First Republican candidate proclaimed. COVID-19 is the disease produced by the Chinese coronavirus. “Governor John Carney and [Senate Minority Leader] Chuck Schumer [D-NY] lackey Chris Coons plan to allow Delawareans to starve while they attempt to rig the upcoming election,” Witzke added. Taking a page from the governor’s playbook, a local news outlet threatened to have Witzke arrested for trying to hold a press conference outside the television station after it refused to cover the cease and desist order issue. Witzke told TGP: As for WBOC, threatening to have a political candidate arrested for holding a press conference outside their news studio is flatly absurd, though I can’t say I’m surprised by the far-left media. They continue to act as PR [public relations] agents for the DNC [Democratic National Committee]. Maybe WBOC should try covering the news, instead of covering for Chris Coons. Witzke announced via Twitter that she is still planning to hold the press conference outside the station Friday evening. pic.twitter.com/CbgD56DRDM — Lauren Witzke for U.S. Senate (@WitzkeforDE) May 29, 2020  The Democrat-allied leftwing media has reportedly been attacking Witzke, who is running on policies similar to President Trump’s. All U.S. states have at least partially reopened, with the vast majority allowing their stay-at-home orders to expire.

There was no significant increase in Chinese coronavirus hospitalizations, fatalities, and the percentage rate of people testing positive for the disease in 21 states that eased lockdown restrictions on May 4 or earlier, including seven that did not implement a shutdown order at all, an ABC News investigation reportedly found this week. Health analysts consider the number of hospitalizations, fatalities, and the positivity test rate, particularly the seven-day average given the swings in the figures reported daily, to be good proxies for the severity of COVID-19, the new coronavirus disease. Eric Strauss from ABC News identified the 21 states as South Carolina, Montana, Georgia, Mississippi, South Dakota, Arkansas, Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Wyoming, Kansas, Florida, Indiana, Missouri, Ohio, and Nebraska. On Thursday, he wrote on Twitter: JUST IN: [ABC News] looked at 21 states that eased restrictions May 4 or earlier & found no major increase in hospitalizations, deaths or % of people testing positive in any of them. [SC, MT, GA, MS, SD, AR, CO, ID, IA, ND, OK, TN, TX, UT, WY, KS, FL, IN, MO, NE, OH] via [Arielle Mitropoulos]. About a handful of those states — Arkansas, Iowa, South Dakota, Utah, Oklahoma, Wyoming, Nebraska — did not implement a statewide stay-at-home order or any similar measure to stem the spread of the highly contagious and lethal COVID-19. All U.S. states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia are at least partially reopened, with the vast majority allowing their stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders to lapse. New Jersey is the only state that remains mostly shut down, except for limited re-openings for specific retail stores and construction industries, data compiled by the New York Times showed on Friday. The stay-at-home order in New Jersey, home the strictest statewide lockdown, is expected to expire June 5. Delaware’s lockdown measure will not expire until Sunday, but the state has allowed more limited re-openings than New Jersey. ABC News had yet to publish the results of its study as of Friday afternoon, but the alleged author, Mitropoulos, retweeted Strauss’s post about the investigation: JUST IN: @ABC looked at 21 states that eased restrictions May 4 or earlier & found no major increase in hospitalizations, deaths or % of people testing positive in any of them.

Strauss (@ericMstrauss) May 28, 2020  Breitbart News has determined that after a spike in cases reported each day soon after the state allowed non-essential businesses to reopen on May 1, Texas turned things around. Over the past weeks, the Lone Star state has seen a steady decline in the seven-day average of new coronavirus cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and positivity test rates reported daily. To justify decisions to allow non-essential businesses to reopen, U.S. state officials have been relying on a five or seven-day average number of cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and test positivity rates to account for daily swings in the raw figures. Like several other state leaders, “Gov. Greg Abbott is looking at two specific metrics to justify his decision to restart the Texas economy — the positive test rate and hospitalization levels,” the Texas Tribune noted. To make its determination that there was no COVID-19 spike in the 21 states that reopened early, ABC News likely relied on the seven or five-day average numbers given that the daily hospitalization and fatality figures, along with the rate of people testing positive, fluctuate day by day. The overall number of cases and deaths continue to increase in the United States. As of Friday afternoon, over 1.7 million U.S. residents had tested positive for COVID-19, and over 102,000 had succumbed to it, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker.

Friday on MSNBC, network anchor Chuck Todd said it “seemed” as if President Donald Trump was afraid to lead because he did not take questions from reporters following his White House announcement earlier in the day. After Trump left the podium without taking questions, Todd said, “All right, President Trump with a not taking questions at all. Deciding with his announcement on the various ways he’s going to attempt to punish China over their decision to essentially erase the treaty they originally agreed to with Hong Kong. Look, it’s not lost, I think, on a lot of people to see number one, Katy, he had nothing else to say. He went right to that, stuck to the teleprompter, and walked right out. I think that tells us how he’d like to engage in the Minnesota issue.” Co-host Katy Tur said, “I think you’re right there. There’s a city that is smoldering right now, there are people across this country, the black community is in pain, there is a pandemic, and the president tried to clear it all up, or at least clear his part in potentially inflaming those tensions with a tweet earlier today. Didn’t want to take any questions from reporters.” Todd said, “I got to ask, is the president afraid to lead right now? To not engage at all, I just— that seemed like he was afraid of this. He doesn’t know what to say.” He added, “We’re struggling as a country right now, and that’s — no matter what you think — the president of the United States can’t bring himself to say anything about a Midwestern city that’s smoldering.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

President Donald Trump on Friday announced at the White House that the United States would terminate its relationship with the World Health Organization. The president said that Chinese officials failed to report details of the coronavirus properly to the World Health Organization (WHO) and pressured the organization to mislead the world about the its dangers. “Countless lives have been taken and profound economic hardship has been inflicted all around the globe,” he said. Trump said that the WHO failed to act on reforms that the United States had demanded, prompting his decision to end America’s role with the organization. “We have detailed the reforms that it must make and engage with them directly, but they have refused to act,” he said. Trump said that the United States would use the hundreds of millions previously sent to the WHO to other international aid programs. “The world needs answers from China on the virus,” Trump says. “We must have transparency.” He noted that Chinese officials shut off people from leaving Wuhan during the peak of the coronavirus pandemic to other parts of China but allowed them to travel the world and spread the virus. “The death and destruction caused by this are incalculable,” Trump said. “We must have answers, not just for us, but the rest of the world.”

No less than the New England Journal of Medicine has dealt a body blow to America’s growing army of mask fascists with the news that “wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection.” The reasons for this are both simple and logical: We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection. Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes). The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal. In many cases, the desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic. So there you go… The only real way to catch the China Flu is to hang out with someone infectious for a protracted period of time, so it’s unlikely you will catch it walking along somewhere, like a store or sidewalk. Obviously, as the Journal points out, if you are a healthcare worker, you are going to be dealing with someone infectious indoors, in a closed setting, and not just passing by. So the Journal warns that the “mask is a core component of the personal protective equipment (PPE) clinicians need when caring for symptomatic patients with respiratory viral infections, in conjunction with gown, gloves, and eye protection.” Even so, the Journal’s warning for healthcare workers points out that a mask is still not very helpful “since it does not provide protection from droplets that may enter the eyes or from fomites on the patient or in the environment that providers may pick up on their hands and carry to their mucous membranes.” “What is clear, however, is that universal masking alone is not a panacea. A mask will not protect providers caring for a patient with active Covid-19 if it’s not accompanied by meticulous hand hygiene, eye protection, gloves, and a gown,” the Journal adds. The World Health Organization (W.H.O.) goes even further: “Masks should only be used by health care workers, caretakers or by people who are sick with symptoms of fever and cough,” said Dr. April Baller, a public health specialist for the W.H.O. Baller adds that the danger to a healthy person wearing a mask is a “false feeling of protection” — which is something the CDC warned of early on during this pandemic, back when we were told not to wear masks. Of course, the CDC has flip-flopped completely on the mask issue, which means that what we are now being told by the New England Journal of Medicine and W.H.O. contradicts the latest CDC guidelines, which, after telling us for weeks that masks are useless against the virus, now “recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.” Since its flip-flop, I have never really bought into the idea that American health “experts” like the CDC and Drs. Fauci and Birx were genuine in their flip-flop on the mask issue. It always seemed to me that public and media pressure forced them into caving. Even today, Fauci can’t bring himself to offer a full-throated mask endorsement, only that the mask is a “symbol” of what “you should be doing” … they are a “valuable safeguard” and part of “respect for another person.” This is a far cry from what he said in March: “There’s no reason to be walking around with a mask,” infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci told 60 Minutes. While masks may block some droplets, Fauci said, they do not provide the level of protection people think they do. Wearing a mask may also have unintended consequences: People who wear masks tend to touch their face more often to adjust them, which can spread germs from their hands. It would seem to me that the need to wear a mask should be based on how the virus in question operates. If, as the New England Journal of Medicine points out, you need to be in close contact with an infected person for up to 30 minutes in order to get infected with the coronavirus, the mask is unnecessary unless you’re in that situation. Out of concern for my wife, I’ve worn a mask since day one, even when Fauci was telling me not to… And I will continue to, at least for the foreseeable future, even though I hate the damn thing. Sadly, though, this latest science against wearing masks will get no traction in our corrupt corporate media or with the corrupt Democrat politicians who have embraced mask fascism with the unbridled glee that all self-righteous bullies embrace such things, embrace any opportunity to join a pious mob and feels a false sense of superiority while shaming and terrorizing others. Like the fact that the coronavirus is no more lethal to those 50 and under than the seasonal flu, the media will cover up this important information. Like the fact Democrat Govs. Whitmer, Cuomo, and Murphy poured infection into nursing homes, the media well bury this information. But here’s the thing… If you believe a mask will protect you, go ahead and wear a mask. But what do you care if someone else is wearing one or not? As long as you’re wearing one what does it matter? Why can’t we just leave each other alone? Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.

Some left-wing Democrat governors want to damage their states’ economies with extended coronavirus-related lockdowns, noted Rep. Greg Steube (R-FL), offering his remarks on Friday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow. Marlow described Florida’s response to the coronavirus outbreak as “a pretty big success story” largely ignored by news media. “I think that the death toll and economic toll [in Florida] have been significantly lower than comparably sized states like New York,” Marlow said. “[The] decision to cram infected patients back into nursing homes and not clean the subway system is so unbelievably heinous.” Americans will voluntarily be conscientious about their health in the context of the coronavirus outbreak without governmental decrees, assessed Steube. “It just goes to show that people will take their own personal responsibility to ensure that they’re being safe and they’re taking care of themselves and their families,” Steube said. Steube referenced a Thursday-published Tampa Bay Times article which declared that “Florida hasn’t seen a spike in coronavirus cases” following its economic reopening.  Coronavirus-related statistics from Florida as noteworthy given the Sunshine State’s large share of elderly residents, noted Steuebe. Steube stated, “I have the second-most elderly district in the entire country. Florida has some of the most elderly population, one of the most diverse populations, and we have actually more people than New York does.” Steuebe continued, “If you compare the [coronavirus] numbers in New York to the numbers in Florida, they’re staggeringly different.” According to an interactive map produced by the New York Times tracking coronavirus infections and deaths — citing “state and local health agencies and hospitals” as its data sources — Florida had 52,277 cases with 2,363 deaths. New York had 371,559 cases and 29,438 deaths. Steube remarked, “I believe we live in the country that provides freedoms, and we should not be telling people they can’t leave their houses to do the things that they need to do or to [shut down] a business owner.” Steuebe noted much of the news media’s alignment with left-wing and partisan Democrat politics regarding the coronavirus-related shutdowns. “It’s interesting to watch the mainstream media just completely criticize DeSantis when — if you look at the numbers — he’s probably had one of the biggest success stories in the entire country from a state that is very populous, very diverse and very old, yet they’re not going to talk about that,” Steube said. Steube determined, “I think that some of these left-wing Democratic governors want nothing more than to destroy their states’ economies. Look no further than Michigan. The things that are going on there are just atrocious, and they violate, in my opinion, our individual liberties and our constitutional rights.” Steube concluded, “Hopefully, these things will start to change significantly, and the DOJ will get involved in these overly abusive and overly burdensome orders.” Breitbart News Daily broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.

The president of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) told the USA Today editorial board she does not agree with President Donald Trump’s view that schools should reopen as soon as possible. In an interview published Thursday, Randi Weingarten accused Trump of creating a “false narrative that people either want to stay in place, locked down, or you open things up as if it was last June.” Weingarten said if there is a second wave of coronavirus infections during the summer, “all bets are off” for reopening schools. The union leader said the distance learning taking place since schools shut down “is something that we all know has not been good for kids.” She noted teachers have “worked really hard” to be flexible to do remote teaching but said online education “is not a substitute for the relationship building and the alchemy that happens in schools and in classrooms.” Weingarten added perhaps “a kid or two” will do well with virtual learning, but dismissed it as a potential ongoing education mode. However, she admitted she could envision some high schools opening one day a week since students of that age “may be able to do more in remote.” She responded to a question about when Americans would know if schools will open in time for the fall semester with the statement, “I think your question is, what’s going to happen in terms of school buildings.” Weingarten added: I think we’re going to know that based upon two facts. Will we get this (financial aid) package (from Congress)? Because if we don’t get that package, then school buildings are not going to reopen in the way that they need to. The second real issue, which is a big uncertainty, is whether there’s going to be a second wave. If a second wave crops up that you can’t contain, then schools won’t open in September. I want schools to open safely and responsibly, and as a union, we are doing everything in our power to prepare people to do that and to try to make it work. The union leader stressed again that schools will need more funding to open “safely and responsibly.” “It’s going to cost more money than we’re spending now,” she continued. Weingarten suggested some possible means of social distancing in schools. “You might have to halve the size of the school in terms of the number of kids that are there,” she said. “You might have to stagger morning and afternoon sessions. … You’d have to clean the school between sessions.” The AFT president acknowledged the possibility of “hybrid models” of school for some districts but emphasized that reopening will be a difficult, but necessary, feat. “[I]t’s not good for kids to be home like this,” she said. In response to her support to “road test” some possible innovations for schools during the summer months, Weingarten admitted some of her members have asked, “[W]hy are you pushing for this? And why are you pushing for summer school?” She said the fear and anxiety associated with the infection caused by the Chinese virus is “legitimate.” “This illness, excuse my language, it knocks the s–t out of you,” she said.

Consumer sentiment improved slightly in May boosted by a big improvement in views of current economic conditions. The University of Michigan’s index of consumer sentiment rose half a percentage point in May, according to the survey’s chief economist Richard Curtin. Consumer assessments of current conditions jumped 10 percent compared with April. The gauge of current conditions crashed in March and early April, falling by 40 points. But it appeared to stabilize in April, perhaps because of government payments to taxpayers, programs to stabilize employment, and enhanced unemployment benefits. Now it is on the rise again. “The CARES relief checks and higher unemployment payments have helped to stem economic hardship, but those programs have not acted to stimulate discretionary spending due to uncertainty about the future course of the pandemic,” Curtin said. Troublingly, consumer expectations continued to weaken in May as it became clear that the reopening of the economy would be slower than many expected when the lockdown orders were initially issued. Expectations began weakening in March but held up better than the current conditions metric, indicating that Americans were startled by the sudden crash in stocks and lockdown orders that brought much of the economy to a halt but expected a quick recovery. April saw a steeper plunge in expectations as the extent of the economic damage became clearer and lockdowns stretched on. In May, the expectations gauge fell another 6 percent to 65.9, the lowest level in six years, from 67.7 in the mid-month preliminary reading and 70.1 in the April reading. “It should not be surprising that a growing number of consumers expected the economy to improve from its recent standstill, or that the majority still thought conditions in the economy would remain unfavorable in the year ahead,” Curtin said. While the government’s aid programs have likely boosted consumer sentiment they are also likely the cause of rising inflation expectations. Recent data on prices, however, suggests that the economy is experiencing deflationary pressure from lower consumer spending. Bond yields and other market based indicators do not predict much inflation in the year ahead.

Liberal Democrat leader Sir Edward ‘Ed’ Davey is attempting to use the Chinese coronavirus pandemic as an excuse to delay Britain’s true Brexit from the European Union, arguing that a two-year delay is “just common sense”. “We are facing the deepest recession in 300 years [a]fter the most serious public health crisis in over 100 years,” he argued in a statement posted on social media. “With a climate emergency that demands action now Delaying Brexit by 2 years is just common sense,” he claimed — although the link between the pandemic and an alleged “climate emergency” was left unclear. The 54-year-old’s choice of words was revealing, as, formally Brexit has already happened, with the United Kingdom leaving the European Union in January 2020. However, it is now in a so-called “transition period” with the bloc in which it remains an EU member-state in all but name, still subject to its laws, its judges, its trade policy, and its migration regime, among other things — with the only real change being that Britain has lost its representation in EU institutions such as the European Commission and the supranational Court of Justice. We are facing the deepest recession in  300 years After the most serious public health crisis in over 100 years With a climate emergency that demands action now Delaying Brexit by 2 years is just common sense @LBC https://t.co/pp2K4lnbBf — Ed Davey MP 🔶🇺 #StayHomeSaveLives #ProtectNHS (@EdwardJDavey) May 28, 2020  Sir Ed’s proposal to extend the transition for two years — meaning that, the better part of a decade on from the British people’s vote to Leave the European Union, the country would still not be free of the bloc in a meaningful sense — is backed by a range of EU loyalist British opposition leaders, as well as the EU itself. Indeed, a plan to extend the transition was reportedly “all but agreed at official level” while Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his chief adviser Dominic Cummings were out of action with coronavirus infections — but this was “scuppered” when the later recovered and returned to work. Now that Cummings’ is under pressure to resign from his position over claims that a move from London to Durham during the lockdown to ensure his young son’s childcare needs could be met, however, the efforts of politicians to delay Brexit by the EU and British EU loyalists like Sir Ed have intensified, with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier writing an open letter to British opposition politicians to make it clear that a two-year extension is very much on offer. The official position of Boris Johnson’s government is that it will not agree to any extension — at least for now. Thank you @MichelBarnier for your letter today confirming the EU is open to a two-year extension to the Brexit transition period. Time is running out. @BorisJohnson must put his responsibilities to jobs and the economy first –  agree an extension to prevent another crisis. pic.twitter.com/b9NqjP1YwZ — Ian Blackford (@Ianblackford_MP) May 27, 2020 

Friday on Fox News, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow warned unemployment news was to get worse before it gets better due to the economic downturn resulting from the coronavirus pandemic. Kudlow, however, said there were other positive signs in the economy offering reasons for optimism. “You know, the things are looking better, OK?” he said. “Now, we are still in the pandemic contraction. We probably haven’t peaked in unemployment, and the numbers coming in the weeks ahead are going to be very poor here in the second quarter. It’s a lot of hardship, a lot of heartbreak, OK, a lot of anxiety, so it certainly isn’t over. But, but, but, but I will say this. The virus is flattening and coming downward. The openings are coming across the country. Businesses are opening. New business applications are opening. There’s kind of a list, Steve, of all the – you know, I call them glimmers of hope and growth. Cars are driving more. Gasoline prices are up. The Apple Mobility Index is up.” “We’re even seeing on the unemployment claims, which is a terrible number – close to 40 million – but it is slowing in its increase,” Kudlow continued. “So there’s some hopeful signs, and I think we’re going to move strong into the second half of the year with perhaps as much as 20 percent economic growth. We’ll talk about this with the business leaders and next steps on economic policy. You know, we’ve gone through the liquidity phase. Now we’re in the reopening phase. I think the next phase has to go back to old fashion Trumponomics — cutting taxes, deregulating, fair trade deals, things that grew the economy rapidly in the first three years plus and things that can grow the economy rapidly in the second half and onto next year. The president rebuilt the economy. He can do it a second time. We’ll have this whole conversation with the CEOs and the others.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor

The world’s alarmists took another hit with the news Denmark was able to reopen its schools and daycare centers without an increase in coronavirus infections. Reuters reports that after a one-month lockdown, “Sending children back to schools and day care centres in Denmark, the first country in Europe to do so, did not lead to an increase in coronavirus infections[.]” In fact, the “number of infected children aged between one and up to 19 has declined steadily since late April[.]” It should be added the Denmark schoolchildren pictured in the Reuters piece are not wearing masks, nor are the adults. There was what is described as a “slight uptick” immediately after the schools reopened, but it came too soon to be blamed on the reopening and was probably due to the increase in testing. There’s more good news out of Denmark: a “steady drop in daily infections, hospital admissions and deaths since early April has led Denmark to continue its reopening, with shopping malls, bars, restaurants allowed to reopen in May.” And here’s more bad news for coronavirus alarmists, courtesy of no less than ABC News… “ABC looked at 21 states that eased restrictions May 4 or earlier & found no major increase in hospitalizations, deaths or % of people testing positive in any of them.” Well, how about that… Regardless of all this, even if the infection rate increased in Denmark, it still makes no sense to keep children out of school, especially now we know the coronavirus is no more lethal to those under the age of 50 than the seasonal flu. As far as teachers and staff over the age of 50, if they are concerned about infection, they can wear a mask or find a job that will allow them to work from home. There is just no valid scientific or moral reason to keep anyone under the age of 50 locked down, most especially children who have the least to worry about with the coronavirus. They are probably in as much danger of dying in a car accident as they are from the coronavirus. Regardless, if we are not closing schools to “save lives” during the seasonal flu, we should no longer be shuttering our schools for the coronavirus when the risks are exactly the same for students. And let’s not forget the risks that come from these lockdowns, the lack of socialization and structure, the damage that does to children. Over and over and over again, the science continues to prove that the “experts” we wrong about almost everything. What we appear to have here is a disease that ravages the elderly, but what did we do? We pulled kids out of school, locked up the young people who are in almost no danger, shattered 40 million of their lives by killing their jobs. And those who are truly at risk — those who live in nursing facilities? Well, Democrat governors like Andrew Cuomo of New York, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, and Phil Murphy of New Jersey had the plague poured directly into those nursing facilities.

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas will soon allow outdoor pro sports events to have spectators, but the numbers will be strictly limited, under a new order Thursday from Republican Gov. Greg Abbott. Abbott revised a decision to let pro sports leagues host events without fans starting in June as part of the state’s move to reopen amid the coronavirus pandemic. Abbott’s new order allows outdoor stadiums to host fans up to 25% of their normal capacity. Leagues will have to apply to state health officials to be allowed to have fans. Indoor events will still be without spectators. The change came the same day Texas reported a one-day high in new cases with 1,855 reported Thursday. Texas now has 59,776 confirmed cases through nearly 990,000 viral and coronavirus antibody tests. It has 1,601 deaths, a one-day increase of 39. The actual number of cases is likely far higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. IndyCar is set to open its season at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth on June 6, but track president Eddie Gossage said that even under the new rule, the Genesys 300 race will still not include fans. “Nobody wants to have the stands filled with fans more than me but we’re just not in a position to do that yet,” Gossage said in a written statement, noting the race will be broadcast live on NBC. “While the state will permit us to operate at 25 percent of capacity, there are still too many unanswered questions for an event that is just one week away.” PGA Tour has previously said it plans to restart its season at Colonial in Texas on June 11-14 without fans attending. Major League Baseball has proposed starting its season in early July at regular-season ballparks, if necessary without fans. Abbott’s order, however, may not impact the Texas Rangers and the Houston Astros because “stadiums with retractable roofs are not considered to be outdoors,” health department spokeswoman Lara Anton said. State health officials did not immediately respond to questions on whether any leagues or event organizer have asked to be allowed to have spectators. The state has set up several guidelines, including a recommendation that spectators and employees keep at least 6 feet (2 meters) apart from anyone not from their household. If that is not feasible, other measures such as face coverings and sanitation protocols should be followed. Athletes will not be required to wear masks, but the guidelines encourage them to be worn on the sidelines.
The order does not address college sports events. For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death. However, most patients recover.

Friday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” network anchor Joy Reid addressed the scene in Minneapolis as violent protests have ramped up. Reid pushed back against the situation being labeled as a “riot” despite the looting and burning of buildings, adding people in Minneapolis are “risking COVID” to say “stop killing us” and “acknowledge that we’re people.” “The lack of sense that these are people — as black people right now, we feel hunted,” Reid explained. “Everybody I know, white, black, every race that I know is angry. No one I know is sleeping. People are stressed. People are afraid. But everybody black I know feels hunted. And that is not the way we’re supposed to feel in our own country. And I disagree with only one thing that was said: the word ‘riot.’ What happened in 1921 in Tulsa, when black people were massacred just for having a nice neighborhood, that was a riot. That ain’t a riot what we’re seeing right now in Minneapolis.” “What we’re seeing right there is frustration and anger and rage and an uprising,” she continued. “It’s the same thing that we saw in Ferguson. It is the same thing that we saw in Baltimore. Because when people get good and sick of being killed for nothing in their own country and treated like sub-humans in their own country, people get mad, and people get sick of it. People are risking COVID to explain to this country that we’re fed up. Just stop killing us. This is not a — this is not a huge demand. Black Lives Matter was a minimal demand. Just acknowledge that we’re people. Now, we’re just saying, ‘Just stop killing us.’ Whether it is police or ex-police or civilians, please, just stop killing us.” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent

Police are scrambling to track down hundreds of people who fled coronavirus quarantine centers in recent days in Zimbabwe and Malawi, the Associated Press (AP) reported on Thursday. In Blantyre, Malawi, over 400 people escaped from a quarantine center set up at a local stadium recently, many of them “jumping over a fence or strolling out the gate” reportedly while police officers and health workers watched on. When local reporters asked police and health workers why they had not stopped the patients from escaping, they said they “lacked adequate protective gear” to confront them. While the shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) to treat coronavirus patients in the region has been well documented, some of the people who left the center said they had bribed police to get out. According to the AP, at least 46 of the patients who fled had tested positive for Chinese coronavirus. The report identified some of the quarantine escapees as having recently entered Malawi from South Africa, which has the highest number of coronavirus cases on the continent with almost 125,000 infections. A source of regional economic power, many people from Malawi and Zimbabwe travel to South Africa seeking work. In Zimbabwe, law enforcement officers are “hunting down” over 100 people who escaped from quarantine centers, spokesman Paul Nyathi told the AP. The country requires a 21-day quarantine for people returning from abroad. “They escape and sneak into the villages … We are warning people to stop sheltering them. These escapees are becoming a serious danger to communities,” Nyathi said. Almost all of Zimbabwe’s 75 new coronavirus cases this week were traced to quarantine centers that detain, often involuntarily, hundreds of people returning from abroad. As in Malawi, many of the people returning to Zimbabwe had traveled to South Africa. Many also returned from neighboring Botswana, according to the report. This week, Zimbabwe Health Minister Obadiah Moyo told a special parliamentary committee that the mandatory quarantine centers have become “our source of danger,” according to the AP. Both Zimbabwe and Malawi have fewer than 200 documented cases of Chinese coronavirus, although the true numbers are likely higher due to deficient testing in the region.

Jihadis were more prolific during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan this year despite the Chinese coronavirus pandemic and the associated lockdowns, carrying out at least 242 attacks, about 30 percent more than the 187 last year, data compiled by Breitbart News reveals. Islamic terrorists carried out an average of about eight attacks per day this year, compared to an average of six daily assaults in 2019. Three weeks into Ramadan this year, it appeared the number of deaths and injuries would exceed those from the same period last year, but the attacks became less lethal towards the end. Breitbart News’ tally covers 30 days, starting from Ramadan’s first full day on April 24 through May 23. Edwin Mora/Breitbart News Jihadis killed at least 867 people and injured 813 others across 20 countries during the holy month this year.  On average, jihadis killed 29 people and maimed 27 others each day during Ramadan this year. Last year, however, the holy month was slightly bloodier, resulting in at least 911 fatalities (30 per day) and 1,006 injuries (34 per day). The 1,680 casualties this year represent a drop of over ten percent from the 1,917 last year. Jihadis have been responsible for nearly 10,000 casualties during the past five Ramadans combined: 2020 (867 killed; 813 wounded), 2019 (911 killed; 1,006 injured), 2018 (841 killed; 1,014 wounded), 2017 (1,639 killed; 1,704 wounded), and 2016 (421 killed; 729 wounded). Edwin Mora/Breitbart News The Afghan Taliban remains the deadliest (423 deaths; 379 injuries) group during Ramadan this year, again followed by the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) and its affiliates (228 killed; 258 wounded). However, ISIS was behind Ramadan’s bloodiest attack, killing 32 people and wounding 133 others during a funeral in Afghanistan on May 12. Primarily fueled by several ISIS attacks, May 12 became the bloodiest day (79 fatalities; 165 injuries) of the holy month. Although the ISIS-West Africa branch (ISWAP) allegedly broke away from the Nigeria-based Boko Haram group in 2016 over leadership issues, it has never been clear that ISWAP members were different individuals than those in the original Boko Haram. Analysts have often attributed the same attack to both groups, making it difficult to differentiate between the two. Breitbart News combined the deaths and injuries carried out by the two groups. This year, the Nigeria-based Fulani herdsmen jihadis, known to target Christian farmers, killed (61) and wounded (23) more people than al-Qaeda terrorists and their affiliates (55 fatalities; 15 injuries). On May 11, Fulani herdsmen killed 17 civilians, including a six-year-old who was hacked to death. The Fulani jihadis also wounded six others that day, including a three-year-old who was hot in the head. Some of the Ramadan jihadi culprits designated as “others” primarily include militants from the Iran-allied Shiite Houthis in Yemen and terrorist groups that operate in the Kashmir region claimed by India — namely Lashkar-e Tayyiba (LeT), Hizbul Mujahideen (HM), and Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM). Breitbart News was unable to determine the culprit for 26 attacks that killed 77 people and wounded 85 others (about 10 percent of all casualties), deeming the perpetrators “unknown.” Those included occurred in areas where terrorism is overwhelmingly the product of jihadist groups. Edwin Mora/Breitbart News The top five deadliest countries during Ramadan 2020 are Afghanistan (498 deaths; 563 injuries), Nigeria (100 deaths; 57 injuries), Syria (87 deaths; 26 injuries), Iraq (57 deaths; 68 injuries), and Niger (33 deaths; 12 injuries). Most of the casualties in Afghanistan appear to involve U.S.-backed security forces. It is often difficult to differentiate between civilian and security force victims, but the Afghan government estimated that the Taliban alone killed at least 146 civilians and maimed 430 others across 20 provinces during the holy month. Edwin Mora/Breitbart News The Afghan government and the Pentagon also noted that the Taliban increased attacks during the holy month, a time when jihadis urge their followers and supporters to embrace martyrdom. Despite losing its caliphate in Iraq and Syria, ISIS, which also stepped up attacks during the holy month, continues to wreak havoc in those two countries and beyond. Again this year, ISIS went on to target the food supply in Iraq during Ramadan, burning crops and even killing livestock. Even after the Taliban killed and maimed hundreds of Afghan civilians and security forces, Kabul agreed to a three-day ceasefire with the narco-jihadi group. The truce began on Sunday, the first full day of the Eid al-Fitr (“Festival of Breaking the Fast”) holiday that marked the end of Ramadan in many countries. Some jihadi groups, including the Taliban, targeted Muslims while they prayed inside mosques. The vast majority of Ramadan victims are Muslims, except for a handful in Western countries and several more in Nigeria. On May 21, a jihadi targeted a naval base in Texas, injuring a sailor before authorities took him out. This year, jihadis intensified the number of Ramadan attacks in Africa’s Sahel region. Breitbart News documented an estimated 15 kidnapping incidents as injuries this year. Despite the Ramadan attacks, violence is entirely dissonant with the holy month for most Muslims. Most of them follow the tradition of abstaining from eating, drinking, smoking, having sex, and other physical needs each day, starting from before the break of dawn until sunset during Ramadan. Breitbart News primarily gleans its tally from the Religion of Peace website and the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED). This report only includes incidents Breitbart News has corroborated online through news agencies, governments, and/or other entities that monitor jihadi activity. The overall number of attacks and the associated casualties could be higher because not all incidents are documented online, including some that take place in regions with no free press. It also omits attacks where the jihadi nature of the perpetrators is not explicit, including incidents where no group has taken responsibility in an area where terrorists of non-jihadist ideologies are also present. For the most part, the tally also excludes casualties suffered by jihadis. However, some of the documented incidents in Syria may inadvertently include deaths and injuries sustained by opposition groups with jihadi ties. Death and injury figures may change as some victims succumb to their wounds.

Jerusalem (AFP) — Start-up nation Israel, on its way out of coronavirus lockdown, is seeking to export lessons that have allowed it to emerge as one of the least-hit victims of the pandemic. Use of distance diagnostics, blood analysis, mobile phone tracking and tracing and mandatory wearing of face masks are among measures credited with giving the Jewish state an official COVID-19 death toll of around 280, equivalent to 31 per million inhabitants. That compares with around 310 deaths per million in the US, about 560 in Britain and 427 in France. In Israel, patients equipped with “oximeters” are contacted twice daily by medical teams who ask them to report their data. A decrease in blood oxygen levels shows a downturn in the condition of the patient who is brought swiftly to hospital. The quasi-governmental Jewish Agency, formed to encourage Jewish immigration to Israel, has formed a partnership with the country’s Weizmann Institute of Science and private health services provider Clalit Health Services, to try to export the Israeli model to Jewish communities abroad. “The basic idea is to try to explain to the Jewish community — which has been proportionally more affected than the average population in France, in the United States, mainly in New York — the experience of doctors and scientists in Israel,” Amos Hermon, a Jewish Agency executive, told AFP. “We think that Israel has taken the essential measures (to stem the crisis).” “In comparison with other countries, Israel has done very well… We therefore would like to share this knowledge, with other communities which have been very affected,” he added. Israeli officials, mindful of the Jewish festival of Shavuot which began on Thursday evening, have urged French Jews to delay opening their synagogues for the time being and urged setting up medical committees to monitor the health of their community, according to viewers of an online discussion between a Paris Jewish leader and Israeli officials. The Israelis recommended checking worshippers before they arrive at their synagogue, by using oximeters, enabling a quick and simple measuring of blood oxygen as a measure of health. “The basic idea is to have a doctor in daily contact with patients in order to assess the signs of deterioration in their state of health …. The oximeter is the tool,” notes Boaz Katz, from the Weizmann Institute. According to a study by Tel Aviv University, about 70 percent of people diagnosed with the virus in Israel have been infected with a strain from the United States, and 30 percent from Europe, mainly from France and Belgium.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey (D) requested on Thursday that “protesters” in the City of Lakes practice social distancing and wear masks to reduce coronavirus transmission. The municipal government claimed to provide hundreds of masks to the public for this purpose. Frey’s comments came during ongoing protests and riots in Minneapolis following the death of George Floyd, a man who died after a municipal police officer placed his knee on Floyd’s neck while handcuffed. The city government issued a statement on Thursday via its website with the mayor’s request. “The City encourages everyone to exercise caution to stay safe while participating in demonstrations, including wearing masks and physical distancing as much as possible to prevent the spread of COVID-19,” the statement reads. “The City has made hundreds of masks available to protesters this week.” Frey linked the unrest to slavery during remarks he made on Thursday: What we’ve seen over the last two days and the emotion-ridden conflict over last night is the result of so much built-up anger and sadness, anger and sadness that has been ingrained in our black community, not just because of five minutes of horror, but 400 years. If you’re feeling that sadness and that anger, it’s not only understandable, it’s right. It’s a reflection of the truth that our black community has lived. While not from lived experience, that sadness must also be understood by our non-black communities. To ignore it, to toss it out, would be to ignore the values we all claim to have. That are all the more important during a time of crisis. “This could be the marker,” added Frey. “This could be a point in time, when several years from now we can look back to know that we rose to right the wrongs of the past. Not just with words, but with action.” Frey, who wore a mask for his Twitter profile photo, framed Lloyd’s death in racial terms. Video of my full remarks from earlier this morning. "Being Black in America should not be a death sentence. For five minutes, we watched a white officer press his knee into a Black man’s neck. Five minutes. This officer failed in the most basic, human sense." https://t.co/4cfPkSsf1A — Jacob Frey (@Jacob_Frey) May 26, 2020  Breitbart News Daily broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.

President Donald Trump on Thursday announced he is extending National Guard troops’ deployments in the fight against coronavirus until mid-August, which will allow them to qualify for certain benefits. “The men and women of the National Guard have been doing a great job fighting the CoronaVirus. This week, I will extend their Title 32 orders through mid-August, so they can continue to help States succeed in their response and recovery efforts,” Trump tweeted. The men and women of the National Guard have been doing a great job fighting the CoronaVirus. This week, I will extend their Title 32 orders through mid-August, so they can continue to help States succeed in their response and recovery efforts. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 28, 2020  The National Guard troops’ federal deployments were scheduled to end on June 24, which for many would have been just shy of the 90 days of duty needed to qualify for early retirement and education benefits. Approximately 46,000 Air and Army National Guard troops are supporting the fight against the coronavirus that originated from China. The deployment is the largest use of the National Guard for a domestic operation since Hurricane Katrina, according to the National Guard. More than 51,000 Guard members responded to that natural disaster. However, whereas during Hurricane Katrina, the National Guard was deployed to one region, during the current fight, they are deployed in all 50 states, three territories, and the District of Columbia. “The National Guard is as busy as it’s been for a very long time, and I’m proud to say we are trained and we are ready,” said National Guard Bureau Chief Gen. Joseph Lengyel in a statement Thursday. “The men and women who put on this uniform expect to be called to duty and deployed around the world as part of the Army or Air Force. They expect to be called to duty for homeland emergencies, because that is a unique thing the National Guard does,” he said. National Guard members are assisting at food banks, meal deliveries, serving as medical staff, supporting medical equipment delivery, distributing personal protective equipment, supporting law enforcement, conducting traffic control, performing testing, cleaning facilities, and many other critical tasks all across the nation.

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) lifted the restrictions he placed on houses of worship in his state Thursday after two churches filed an emergency injunction pending appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. Within hours after two Romanian churches, represented by Liberty Counsel, filed the emergency injunction, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh ordered Pritzker to respond by 8:00 p.m. Thursday. With less than four hours before the deadline, the governor released “guidelines,” rather than mandates, for houses of worship that wish to resume church services following the coronavirus lockdowns. None of the suggestions are legally enforceable, explains Liberty Counsel. The guidelines state that the governor’s administration recognizes worship is central to the lives of many people as is “the spiritual and emotional value of prayer, community, and faith.” Pritzker’s guidelines still “strongly recommend” the continuation of “remote services, particularly for those who are vulnerable to COVID-19, including older adults and those with co-morbidities.” For those churches that wish to resume in-person worship, the guidelines suggest gathering outdoors in small groups, with less than ten people as the ideal choice. “Congregants who are living together sit together, at least six feet apart” from others,” the guidelines continue, adding the recommendations of face coverings and the avoidance of singing and “group recitation” of prayers. “Restrooms should be regularly sanitized and have sufficient soap and hand sanitizer,” state the guidelines. The governor’s office says high-risk behaviors to be avoided are those that involve person-to-person contact, such as greetings, hugs, handshakes, use of a common communion cup, and offering communion on the tongue. Liberty Counsel said it filed the emergency request to the Supreme Court due to a letter sent to churches on Saturday by the Chicago Department of Public Health: The city is threatening closure and “summary abatement.” In the threatening letter, Commissioner Allison Arwady, who declared the churches a “public nuisance” for holding services with more than 10 people, wrote: “I am authorized to seek to enjoin such nuisance or to cause the same to be summarily abated in such manner as I may direct….” The letter ended by stating that “the City will take steps necessary to abate, including Summary Abatement.” According to Pritzker’s “Illinois Restored” plan, it was not until Phase 5 of the plan, when “testing, tracing and treatment are widely available throughout the state,” and “either a vaccine is developed to prevent additional spread of COVID-19, a treatment option is readily available that ensures health care capacity is no longer a concern, or there are no new cases over a sustained period,” that gatherings, including religious services, of more than 50 people, would have been permitted. The River at Tampa Bay Church will hold an outdoor worship service on church property this Sunday, May 31, the day of Pentecost, beginning at 9:30 a.m. This will be the church’s first in-person worship service since @rhowardbrowne was wrongfully arrested. https://t.co/ecu5RYuqNW pic.twitter.com/hAXuqC54rJ — Liberty Counsel (@libertycounsel) May 28, 2020  “The unilateral actions of Gov.

Pritzker is the classic example of tyranny,” said Liberty Counsel Chairman Mat Staver in a statement. “He knew he did not have authority to trample on the First Amendment rights of churches and houses of worship, but he did anyway and continued to do so until his case reached the U.S. Supreme Court.” Staver added that his organization wants “to make sure this tyranny and abuse never happens again.” Warning that Pritzker could easily reinstate his mandates, Liberty Counsel plans to file a reply to the Supreme Court, arguing that Pritzker’s “unconstitutional orders are capable of repetition yet evading review.” In a statement about the newly released guidelines for worship in Illinois, Kelly Shackelford, president and chief counsel at First Liberty Institute, said, “The massive religious discrimination and criminal threats against churches is over in Illinois.” “This was a disgraceful part of our history during the pandemic,” he continued. “We are grateful to President Trump for his leadership in urging Governors across America to restore religious liberty and allow Americans to return to their places of worship.”

Senators Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) are looking to end China’s pipeline of foreign students to fill spots at American universities and take American STEM jobs. In the wake of the Chinese coronavirus crisis, Cotton and Blackburn — as well as Rep. David Kustoff (R-TN) in the House — have filed legislation called the SECURE CAMPUS Act that ends the China-to-United States pipeline of Chinese nationals receiving student visas for STEM fields. “The Chinese Communist Party has long used American universities to conduct espionage on the United States,” Cotton said in a statement. “What’s worse is that their efforts exploit gaps in current law. It’s time for that to end.” In short, Cotton and Blackburn’s plan would: In 2019, nearly 117,000 Chinese nationals secured F visas to arrive in the U.S. as students — the most of any country in the world. https://t.co/A7ZfeKacsP — John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) April 28, 2020  Blackburn said in a statement: Beijing exploits student and research visas to steal science, technology, engineering, and manufacturing secrets from U.S. academic and research institutions. We’ve fed China’s innovation drought with American ingenuity and taxpayer dollars for too long; it’s time to secure the U.S. research enterprise against [China’s] economic espionage. As Breitbart News has chronicled, the U.S. legal immigration system remains hugely beneficial to China. From 2008 to 2018, more than 825,000 Chinese nationals arrived in the U.S. on green cards — an immigration status that provides them with permanent residency, a pathway to American citizenship, and eventually the ability to bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the country through the process known as “chain migration.” There are nearly 500,000 Chinese students in the U.S. in any given year — more than any other country — taking seats in university classrooms and looking to eventually obtain Optional Practical Training (OPT) visas to take entry-level jobs in white-collar professions. In Fiscal Year 2019, alone, Chinese nationals secured about 170,000 F, J, and M visas to arrive in the U.S. as students — more than any other country in the world.

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a federal lawsuit Wednesday challenging a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rule that requires women to have an in-person clinic visit in order to obtain drugs to induce an abortion. The ACLU filed the lawsuit in Maryland on behalf of the leftwing American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective, which claim the FDA rule that requires women to first have an in-person visit with the abortion provider is a “burdensome barrier.” The FDA regulates 20,000+ drugs. But it uniquely restricts one abortion-inducing drug – and it won’t lift those restrictions in a pandemic. So the ACLU is suing. My @vicenews latest:👇 https://t.co/uhxfhPrFBM — Carter Sherman (@carter_sherman) May 27, 2020  According to the organization, their complaint states, “Of the more than 20,000 drugs regulated by the FDA, mifepristone is the only one that patients must receive in person at a hospital, clinic, or medical office, yet may self-administer, unsupervised, at a location of their choosing.” ACOG says the FDA rules have “no medical basis” and “unnecessarily restrict access to care.” FDA’s medically unnecessary restrictions on mifepristone threatens to harm patients & their clinicians during a national crisis. It undermines the health care community's efforts to identify safe, effective ways to provide patients with the care they need. https://t.co/utC37UorOx pic.twitter.com/baQ1sRdkCE — ACOG Action (@ACOGAction) May 27, 2020  The organization adds the rules are “especially harmful” during the coronavirus pandemic because “forcing physicians to dispense this drug in person puts patients at increased risk of COVID-19.” Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers, however, have refused to stop providing elective surgical abortions in their clinics, claiming these are “essential” services, even as scarce personal protective equipment (PPE) has been needed by healthcare workers directly providing care to patients with the infection caused by the Chinese virus. “Like any lawyers, the ACLU pushes for their clients’ financial interests in a lawsuit designed to force the FDA to help abortion vendors make a quick buck,” Students for Life of America President Kristan Hawkins said in a statement sent to Breitbart News. “The FDA must hold the line on the health and safety standards in place that are meant to help women survive taking chemical abortion pills,” she added. “Using this COVID-19 crisis to force the sales of life-ending drugs in ways that risk women’s lives should embarrass the abortion industry. But perhaps that is asking too much of people who end life for a living.” In addition to claiming elective surgical abortions are “essential” for women’s health, industry giant Planned Parenthood announced during the pandemic its new tele-abortion service is now available in all 50 states. Acting CEO of Planned Parenthood Alexis McGill Johnson called her new tele-abortion service the “silver lining” of the coronavirus crisis. Planned Parenthood has been touting an increase in at-home abortions since its tele-abortion services began nationwide, though many physicians and pro-life advocates express concerns about the practice. Specifically, women are obtaining mifepristone illegally from other countries since it is not approved under the FDA Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). In early May, national pro-life leaders sent a letter to FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn, urging him to take action to block the illegal Internet sale of abortion-inducing drugs that are produced overseas and then shipped to the United States. In a press release, the leaders observed that, under REMS, the drug “cannot legally be sold in pharmacies or online due to the risk of serious complications.” However, websites such as AidAccess and Rablon sell and distribute the drugs regularly. “This is a medication that definitely has dangers associated with it,” Dr. Christina Francis, an Indiana-based OB/GYN and chairman of the board of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists (AAPLOG), told EWTN Pro-Life Weekly recently. Francis said some immediate complications of mifepristone could be “hemorrhage, the immediate possibility of infection, and the possibility of failure, where the pregnancy doesn’t fully pass from the medication and then leading to sometimes the requirement for emergent surgery for that woman because of either ongoing bleeding or the risk of infection.” Francis added that because of the uncertainties associated with the pandemic, many women “are being influenced by fear right now, and this is being perpetuated by the abortion industry.” One Planned Parenthood official in New York state touted that the organization’s new tele-abortion service is so much in demand that one mother began her drug-induced abortion “at home with her children running around behind her.” Dr. Meera Shah, chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood Hudson Peconic, told the Associated Press (AP), “We provided a medication abortion to an EMT while she was sitting in her ambulance. We provided abortion care to a mother who was at home with her children running around behind her.” Former abortionist Dr. Anthony Levatino explained in his videos about various abortion procedures that mifepristone blocks the action of progesterone, which the mother’s body produces to nourish the pregnancy. When progesterone is blocked, the lining of the mother’s uterus deteriorates, and blood and nourishment are cut off to the developing baby, who then dies inside the mother’s womb. The drug misoprostol (also called Cytotec) then causes contractions and bleeding to expel the baby from the mother’s uterus. Family Research Council President Tony Perkins wrote that, as a result of Planned Parenthood’s tele-abortion service, more women will have at-home “chemically-induced procedures that carry significant risks”: They tell women that it’ll be simple, natural, safe, and private process. They’ll recover in a day, maybe two. What they don’t tell them is that they might deliver a tiny, perfectly-formed child. Or that they’ll experience labor pains, heavy bleeding, vomiting, or lose consciousness. They don’t talk about the depression, anger, anxiety, panic attacks, and substance abuse that follow. Or the weeks to months of recovery time, usually managed alone. “This is Planned Parenthood’s ‘silver lining,’” Perkins said. “Babies who don’t have a chance at life, women who are haunted and harmed.”

Automated mailing of ballots to all persons on inaccurate voter rolls “is the definition of voter fraud,” said House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA), critiquing Democrat proposals to standardize mail-in voting during a Thursday interview on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow. Marlow noted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) calls to change voting laws under the pretense of public health during the coronavirus outbreak, including proxy voting for members of Congress related to legislation, as well as ballot harvesting and vote-by-mail measures for elections. “I want to connect some dots here, because Pelosi does not want the House to come back and be able to vote. She wants to have these proxy votes. I think this is all setting up the vote-by-mail narrative, or as we call it, ‘cheat-by-mail.'” Democrats want ballots sent to everyone without consideration of their legibility to vote, stated Marlow. “Democrats are going to use it to win this election and maybe future elections,” he added. Economic reopenings of cities and states following coronavirus-related lockdowns make it difficult for Pelosi to justify her advocacy for congressional proxy voting and various forms of remote voting in elections, assessed Marlow. “You’re seeing some Democrats in Washington that are trying to take advantage of a crisis,” Scalise replied. “We’ve heard that before. We’ve seen their playbook, and they’re trying to do it here.” LISTEN:
 Various Democrats, left-wing news media figures, and celebrities are calling for increased remote voting options — including vote-by-mail and ballot harvesting measures — as a public health endeavor to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Democrats’ voting reform proposals “literally would be federalizing elections,” determined Scalise, highlighting opposition to voter ID laws as a push to undermine election integrity. Marlow and Scalise differentiated between absentee voting and standardized mail-in voting. “We all want to be fighting for the right for every single American who’s legally allowed to vote to be able to vote once [per election],” Scalise stated. “Everybody ought to have that legal right, and I’ll fight for that for anybody.” Scalise continued, “If somebody who’s illegally registered to vote is casting a vote, that means they’re stealing your vote. They’re stealing the vote of people who are legally registered.” Scalise warned, “To say we’re going to automatically mail ballots to people who we know are on the rolls fraudulently, that is the definition of voter fraud, and it’s taking away the rights of law-abiding citizens, and it shouldn’t be allowed to go forward.” Scalise concluded, “States like California shouldn’t be the model for how to vote, when you saw — three weeks after election day two years ago — the person who won on election night is not the person being sworn in in Congress, because they were counting votes three and a half weeks after an election until they got the result they wanted. That happens in third world nations, but it shouldn’t be happening here in America.” Breitbart News Daily broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.

Seven-year-old Curtis Rogers, of Raleigh, North Carolina, created a social distance-style prom for his babysitter on Tuesday. Curtis knew his nanny, Rachel Chapman, would have to miss her senior prom due to the ongoing battle against the novel coronavirus pandemic. He decided that simply would not do and took matters into his own hands. “He planned a socially distant prom, complete with dancing & her favorite foods,” Rachel’s mother, Becky, tweeted on May 26. “I planned it out because Rachel probably wanted to see me a lot,” Curtis told ABC11. “She is also one of the best people I’ve known.” My daughter has been a nanny for this amazing kid for over a year. When he realized she wouldn’t have a senior prom, he wanted to throw her one. He planned a socially distant prom, complete with dancing & her favorite foods. @somegoodnews @ABC11_WTVD #bestpromever  #SomeGoodNews pic.twitter.com/8T8LY3DQZw — Becky Chapman (@bhchapman) May 26, 2020  The tweet — also featuring several pictures from the adorable “prom” — has gone viral. At the time of this writing, it has over 36,500 likes and more than 4,400 shares. The aforementioned photos feature Rachel and Curtis sitting on opposite ends of a long table, with a pool noodle for measuring distance. Another shows the two standing six feet apart in suit and gown. “He was really excited for it to start and make sure he was ready to impress her,” Curtis’s mom, Elissa, said. “Rachel is one of our favorite people and she also helps around the house a lot,” she added. “So, Rachel’s like the best nanny ever.” Ms. Chapman echoed the sentiment: “He had all my favorite foods and everything,” she said. “I could tell he put a lot of thought into it.” And while apples, peanut butter, and Chick-fil-A may not be a traditional prom dinner, it was perfect for Curtis’s favorite person. Even so, the day was bittersweet. “I was kind of like, bummed putting my dress on because I was sad; I don’t get to wear it to my senior prom,” she said. “After leaving it and having that time with him because it was the first time I had seen him in two months, it was like, really fun, and I’m really glad that he did that.”

Thirty-eight House Republicans have joined nine Republican Senators in lobbying the White House to continue importing foreign workers to the United States even as more than 36 million Americans are jobless. In a letter to Trump, Republican lawmakers including Rep. Roger Marshall (R-KS) — running against Kris Kobach for Kansas’s open Senate seat — and New York Representitives Elise Stefanik and Peter King ask that businesses continue to be allowed to import blue-collar foreign workers through the H-2B visa program amid mass unemployment. Every year, U.S. companies are allowed to import 66,000 low-skilled H-2B foreign workers to take blue-collar, non-agricultural jobs. For some time, the H-2B visa program has been used by businesses to bring in cheaper, foreign workers and has contributed to blue-collar Americans having their wages undercut. The Republican lawmakers claim that even though a record number of Americans in many states are jobless, businesses are still suffering from labor shortages — a claim that is made year-round by the cheap labor lobby. The Republican lawmakers who signed the letter include: The Republicans write: On behalf of the thousands of small and seasonal businesses in our Districts that are struggling in this unprecedented and uncertain economic climate, we respectfully urge you to refrain from imposing any further restriction on the H-2B nonimmigrant seasonal guest worker program as part of any forthcoming executive action relating to immigration and/or economic recovery. The letter continues: This is evident as, despite active recruitment by seasonal employers, very few US workers are seeking and accepting seasonal temporary jobs. Therefore, it is important that the H-2B program continue to be available to our seasonal employers as a failsafe in the event that we see a rapid drop in unemployment and a return to the extremely tight labor markets of just a few months ago. Such flexibility to meet business needs is critical to rapid, solid and fulsome economic recovery. [Emphasis added] … As such, we urge you to maintain the continued, uninterrupted operation of the H-2B program with the continued requirement that all employers only have access to it based upon their proven and certified need within the statutory cap. [Emphasis added] The full letter can be read here: GOPs Ask for H-2B Visa Prog… by John Binder on Scribd  Likewise, this week, nine Republican Senators sent a letter to Trump asking the administration to allow businesses to import more foreign workers. Specifically, the Senators said businesses must be able to exempt themselves from some existing labor regulations so long as they claim they cannot find qualified Americans to do the work. The Republican Senators who signed the letter include: Today, federal employment data reveal that there is no labor shortage of working- and middle-class Americans who want a job. There are currently more than 36 million Americans out of work, spurred by the Chinese coronavirus crisis. The H-2B visa program has been widely used by businesses to drag down the wages of American workers in landscaping, conservation work, the meatpacking industry, the construction industry, and fishing jobs, a 2019 study from the Center for Immigration Studies finds. When comparing the wages of H-2B foreign workers to the national wage average for each blue-collar industry, about 21 out of 25 of the industries offered lower wages to foreign workers than Americans. In the construction industry, wage suppression is significant, with H-2B foreign workers being offered more than 20 percent less than their American counterparts. In the fishing industry, foreign workers were offered more than 30 percent less for their jobs than Americans in the field. In the meatpacking industry, foreign workers got 23 percent less pay than Americans. Every year, the U.S. admits about 1.2 million legal immigrants on green cards to permanently resettle in the country. In addition, another 1.4 million foreign workers are admitted every year to take American jobs John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter at @JxhnBinder. 

Texas had seen a steady decline in the seven-day average of new Chinese coronavirus cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and test positivity rates as of Thursday afternoon, a couple of weeks after a spike in new daily cases reached its peak, marking the highest single-day figure, and the state set a new record for deaths. The drop in the seven-day average came after Gov. Greg Abbott (R) allowed the state’s stay-at-home order to expire on April 30, and non-essential businesses began a phased reopening the following day. To justify decisions to allow non-essential businesses to reopen, U.S. state officials have been looking at the seven-day average of cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and test positivity rates to account for daily swings in the raw figures. Most of the United States, including Texas, issued statewide lockdown measures, commonly known as stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders, to stem the spread of the highly contagious and deadly COVID-19 disease produced by the coronavirus. Soon after Gov. Abbott lifted Texas’s stay-at-home order, the state experienced an increase in the sheer number of new cases and deaths reported each day. On May 14, Texas recorded its second-deadliest day (51) since the first COVID-19 fatality in the state on March 16, data from the state’s health department showed. The following day, Texas documented the highest single-day tally of new cases (1,818) since it recorded its first case on March 4. In the weeks that followed, however, the seven-day average of new cases and deaths has been steadily going down, the state data revealed, echoing assessments by mainstream media outlets. The seven-day average number of hospitalizations and test positivity rates have also seen a steady, but modest decrease. Analysts consider the number of hospitalizations to be an essential measure of the severity of the ongoing outbreak. According to data from the Texas Department of Health, about 70 percent of Texas’s hospital beds were occupied as of Thursday afternoon, with 15,315 regular and 1,592 intensive care unit (ICU) beds still available. Currently, there are 1,692 lab-confirmed COVID-19 patients at Texas hospitals, occupying only about three percent of the available beds. The national average of coronavirus cases per one million U.S. residents, at 5,323, is more than double the 2,045 per one million in Texas, according to Worldometer. Furthermore, the 55 deaths per one million Texans are about six times lower than the national average of 312 per one million. The raw number of new daily cases in Texas has seen a substantial increase in the last few days, more than doubling from 440 on May 25 to 1,361 yesterday, state data showed. That change could push the seven-day average number of new cases up going forward if the amount reported daily keeps increasing. However, the sheer number of new daily deaths has remained relatively low in recent days. Meanwhile, the raw number of hospitalizations reported each day had also seen a modest decline. Gov. Abbott’s office has attributed the rise in new daily cases to a substantial increase in the states’ testing capabilities, as shown by data compiled by the Texas Tribune. More tests have allowed the state to detect more cases. “Gov. Greg Abbott is looking at two specific metrics to justify his decision to restart the Texas economy — the positive test rate and hospitalization levels,” the Texas Tribune noted. As of Thursday afternoon, about seven percent (57,921) of the total 855,674 tests administered by health officials in Texas had come out positive, marking a decrease from the estimated eight percent two weeks ago, on May 13, the COVID Tracking Project revealed. According to the White House reopening guidelines, a state can reopen if it reports a downward trajectory of the positive test rate over 14 days, even if the daily case count is on the rise. Texas has seen a gradual decline in the percentage of tests coming back positive. More people continue to test negative than positive. The cumulative number of cases and deaths continue to increase in the Lone Star state. As of Thursday afternoon, over 57,900 people in Texas had tested positive for COVID-19, and over 1,500 had succumbed to it.

Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Mike Lee (R-UT) spoke at a webinar hosted by the Heritage Foundation on Wednesday about what Congress’s next move should be in a post-coronavirus America. Both said any future legislation should be about recovery in the form of tax cuts and regulatory easing to help small businesses get back to work. Small businesses in America account for 99.9 percent of businesses in the United States, with 500 or less employees, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Cruz said he refers to the more than $2 trillion dollars the feds have doled out to help Americans and small businesses survive in the wake of the virus not as stimulus funding but as relief funding. “They were designed to provide emergency relief — short term emergency, short-term emergency bridge loans for individuals and families and small businesses to help them get through the immediate crisis they were facing,” Cruz said.  Cruz said the amount of money Congress has spent “takes your breath away,” and he disagrees with Democrats who want to hand out more money. “Where we are now, I believe the next legislation should be recovery legislation,” Cruz said. “It should be focused not on relief, not on spending more money and just shoveling more money at the problem,” Cruz said. “You can’t fix it that way.” He went on: Instead, the next stage should be focused on tax reform and regulatory reform. In other words, lessening the burden on small businesses and job creators. The only way out of this mess, economically speaking, is to get people back to work, which means we need to be looking at policies that help the small businesses that are just starting to open up their doors again; that are just starting to see customers again. We’ve got to unleash the engine of the American free enterprise system —the only thing strong enough to overcome this economic catastrophe. Cruz said examining regulations is a good starting point: One place to start is every regulation, state regulations, local regulations, that have been suspended because of the crisis, to deal with the crisis, I think we should all start with the presumption that those regulations should stay suspended going forward. That’s if it was deemed helpful for that regulation to be suspended during the time of crisis then it should still be helpful during recovery. I really think that’s what our focus needs to be is how do we empower small businesses to drive free enterprise forward and turn our economy around and get people back to work. Lee agreed with Cruz and added the value of limited government at a time like this. “One of the many things he said that is right and appropriate for our time is that we’re not going to fix our economy with more government spending,” Lee said. “We’re not going to fix our economy with more government programs.” “What we need is to get government out of the way so that Americans can start helping each other again,” Lee said. Both lawmakers are working on legislation to address these concerns, including the Right to Test Act to give states authority to approve and distribute tests during a national health emergency and the Prime Act to gives states more authority in regulating meat processing plants instead of federal control, which during the coronavirus has led to bottlenecks in the food supply chain. About this Lee said: We have to remember that the federal government was never intended to be this all-encompassing regulatory body that would regulate even purely local activities like labor, mining, manufacturing, and agriculture. It certainly wasn’t meant to be the comprehensive exclusive regulator of things like meat packing, and yet it is the federal commandeering of the meat packing licensing and regulatory business in this nation that has resulted in bottle neck. The Mercatus Center at George Mason University agrees with Cruz and Lee and wrote a proposal about some of the regulations that were lifted and should remain so, including the FDA approval process, Transportation Security Administration’s limits on hand sanitizers, tariffs on medical equipment imports, restrictions on telemedicine practices, restrictions on scope of practice for nurse practitioners, and state certificate-of-need laws, or certificate-of-need (CON) laws that require healthcare providers to first obtain permission before they can open or expand their facilities.  The proposal read, in part, “This list is not comprehensive; more suspended rules at the local, state, and federal levels are coming to our attention on a daily basis.This is not surprising, simply because so many rules have accumulated over the past 50 years. This regulatory accumulation has been well documented by the RegData Project, which, among other variables, measures the number of regulatory restrictions contained in US federal regulation. According to the project’s most recent dataset (RegData 3.2), the volume of federal regulations has increased by more than 150 percent in the past 50 years. In 1970, there were about 400,000 regulatory restrictions on the books. Today, there are more than 1,000,000 regulatory restrictions in effect.” Follow Penny Starr on Twitter

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo added two Hollywood actors, Chris Rock and Rosie Perez to his coronavirus update presser on Thursday, even as he continues to face criticism for forcing the state’s nursing homes to take patients with COVID-19. When the two Brooklyn-born actors took the stage with Cuomo, they gave the gov. glowing reviews for his orders to wear a mask in public in response to the coronavirus. Rock even said that Cuomo “brings him joy every day.” “I watch you every single day,” Chris Rock fawned. “You bring me calm. You bring me joy every single day.” Perez gushed that Cuomo was “such an amazing leader during this crisis.” Watch below: Chris Rock tells Governor Cuomo "I watch you every single day. You bring me calm. You bring me joy every single day" https://t.co/qDjBrx9AGO pic.twitter.com/iuk6Uit0dv — CBS News (@CBSNews) May 28, 2020  Gov.

Watch below: Chris Rock on helping NY Gov. Cuomo to get out the message about wearing a mask: “We’re soldiers for New York. It’s 100,000 dead Americans. I will go wherever I am called" https://t.co/qDjBrx9AGO pic.twitter.com/1YfnWGrARY — CBS News (@CBSNews) May 28, 2020  For her part, Perez excoriated people who refuse to wear a mask calling them “arrogant,” “hipsters,” and “yuppies.” “When I see hipsters and yuppies walking around without a mask, I go, what is it? Is it arrogance?” Perez said. Then she praised those who do wear masks, saying it makes everyone feel better and will ease “the mental-illness ramifications of all of this,” since “everyone’s on their last nerves.” The White Men Can’t Jump actress claimed she confronts people and tells them, “Hey, do the right thing. Put your mask on. Come on, people!” Cuomo, who ordered the state’s nursing homes and retirement villages to take COVID-19-infected patients causing thousands of older New Yorkers to die unnecessarily, recently made moves to make it illegal to sue nursing homes for the very deaths his orders caused.

Organizers said Thursday that they instead will have a “virtual event” in which participants who verify that they ran 26.2 miles on their own will receive their finisher’s medal. The race had originally been scheduled for April 20 before being postponed for five months because of the coronavirus pandemic. “While we cannot bring the world to Boston in September, we plan to bring Boston to the world for a historic 124th Boston Marathon,” said Tom Grilk, the CEO of the Boston Athletic Association. Although the title of Boston Marathon champion is contested by a few dozen elite athletes, the field includes more than 30,000 recreational and charity runners, with as many as 1 million people lined up along the course trek from Hopkinton to Boston’s Back Bay. That presented organizers with a social distancing problem that won’t be solved by the fall. The cancellation is the first ever for the race, which began in 1897 when 15 men drew a starting line in the dirt in Ashland and headed for the city to commemorate the first modern Olympic Games the previous year. In 1918, the format was modified to a relay due to World War I; the 2013 race was stopped when two bombs exploded at the finish line, several hours after the winners had finished but while many recreational runners were still on the course. For each of those years, the race was held in April on the state holiday to commemorate the battles in Lexington and Concord that marked the start of the Revolutionary War. Traditionally, the Red Sox have scheduled their first pitch for the morning so baseball fans could wander over to Kenmore Square after the game to see the runners pass by with one mile to go. In March, when the race was postponed to Sept. 14, Mayor Marty Walsh cited the desire to salvage the estimated $211 million pumped into the city’s economy each year. The Boston Athletic Association and marathon runners also raise about $40 million for charity. Walsh said at the time that there was no thought of excluding the tens of thousands of amateur runners who consider running Boston a bucket list achievement. The Tokyo Marathon went on as scheduled in March with just over 200 elite runners but not the 38,000 recreational runners who had signed up; spectators at the Los Angeles Marathon were advised to practice social distancing. “That’s not the Boston Marathon. We’re an inclusive marathon,” Walsh said. “The Boston Marathon is for everyone.” The 2021 Boston Marathon is scheduled for April 19 and the 125th anniversary edition is scheduled for April 18, 2022.

The coronavirus outbreak has turned out to be a get out of jail ticket for countless people behind bars, including in California where Democrat Gov. Gavin Newsom’s effort to balance the state’s budget could include closing prisons and reducing the inmate population by 11,000 people by 2024. The San Francisco Chronicle reported on how Newsom is trying to make up for the projected $54 billion deficit in part because of the cost of dealing with the virus: In a revised budget plan unveiled this month, Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed shuttering two state prisons within the next three years, ultimately saving the state about $400 million annually. That’s a much faster timeline than the governor envisioned just a few months ago. His original budget in January proposed closing one prison in the next five years, if the inmate population continued its decade-long decline. Newsom is looking everywhere for solutions, including changes that could allow thousands of inmates to earn a quicker release, positioning California to close a prison for the first time since 2003. “It’s my intention to shut down a state prison to continue to invest more and more in education,” Newsom said during a news conference on May 14. “It’s a core value.” Newsom is getting pushback for his idea, with some citing a possible spike in crime if transitioning programs are also slashed. “It’s a completely terrible idea to reduce all services available to inmates coming out of prison and then accelerate the release of inmates,” Scott Kernan, a former corrections secretary under Democrat Gov. Jerry Brown, said in the Chronicle report. The news outlet also noted a federal court order from 2009 required the state to reduce the number of inmates to 137.5 percent of capacity. The Chronicle reported: Before it can close any prisons, however, California will need to release many more inmates. In his budget proposal, Newsom said he wants to phase out three contracts with outside facilities that house about 1,600 state inmates over the next two years. Shutting down two prisons on top of that would eliminate 5,000 to 6,000 more spots from the overflowing system. Coronavirus also had led to the state to release some inmates early and stop accepting new ones, which reduced the prison population to just over 108,000 — a drop of almost 6,000, bringing the system to 127 percent of capacity. The report said that some policies already in place also will help reduce the prison population, including rehabilitation and good-conduct credits that reduce sentences. This could mean that the prison population would be reduced by 11,000 by 2024 and could allow for two more prisons to be closed. At least one Democrat, however, isn’t behind Newsom’s plan. Assemblyman Jim Cooper, a former sheriff’s captain, said criminal justice reform in the state has already cleared out the lowest-level offenders. Cooper is behind a November ballot initiative that would reclassify 15 offenses as violent, including human trafficking of a child, rape of an unconscious person and assaulting a police officer so that individuals convicted of those crimes could not earn parole faster under a 2016 law. “Who’s left in those jails and prisons?” Cooper asked. “It’s those bad people.” Follow Penny Starr on Twitter

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) got a win in court against 77-year-old barber Karl Manke on Thursday, but he vowed to continue operating his business she deemed “nonessential.” The Michigan Court of Appeals upheld Manke’s license suspension and ruled 2-1 that the state has the authority to close his shop. “I am astonished at this ruling,” Manke attorney David Kallman told Great Lakes News. “This is a blatant violation of the law. We’re filing an immediate appeal with the Michigan Supreme Court. You cannot summarily reverse a lower court’s ruling without it being unanimous. This decision was 2-1.” Manke was defiant after the ruling and told WILX, “I’m still open, still working until they cut my hands off.” The state’s chief medical officer and a top Whitmer adviser, Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, testified Wednesday that Manke’s shop is “an imminent threat to public health.” The lower judge disputed that notion when he noted Manke was not arrested by the state. Breitbart News talked to Manke during the “Operation Haircut” protest at the state capitol last week. He said the response during the protest and the support for his stand was “overwhelming,” and called himself “a Michigan small town barber that just wants to work.” “This is an oppressive move on this governor’s part,” Manke said, observing that it “reflects almost a police state.” “I refuse to stand down on this,” he said. “I wasn’t this rock star three weeks ago,” Manke told Breitbart News, but Whitmer made him one. He thanked God for the development. “I’m still standing up. I still have that courage,” Manke said. Kyle Olson is a reporter for Breitbart News.

The study that led the U.N.’s World Health Organization (W.H.O.) to halt clinical trials of the drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as a treatment for the infection caused by the Chinese coronavirus has been called into question. Physicians and researchers are raising concerns about the study, published in the Lancet, that stem from the fact that the source of some of the data for the study could not be determined. The study upon which the W.H.O. based its decision reported it found no benefit of HCQ to COVID-19 patients who received the malaria drug since the researchers said they were dying at higher rates and experiencing an increased frequency of heart arrhythmias compared to patients with other viruses. The researchers concluded: Although observational studies cannot fully account for unmeasured confounding factors, our findings suggest not only an absence of therapeutic benefit but also potential harm with the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine drug regimens (with or without a macrolide [antibiotic]) in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. The research team, led by Brigham and Women’s Hospital Heart and Vascular Center in Boston, reported of the 96,000 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 during the study period, about 15,000 received HCQ alone or combined with antibiotics. The control group contained the other 81,000 patients, who were not treated with drugs. The authors of the study said among the data they received were those from five Australian hospitals that documented, as of April 21, 600 COVID-19 patients and 73 deaths. However, as the Guardian Australia reported, Johns Hopkins University data showed “only 67 deaths from COVID-19 had been recorded in Australia by 21 April. The number did not rise to 73 until 23 April.” “The data relied upon by researchers to draw their conclusions in the Lancet is not readily available in Australian clinical databases, leading many to ask where it came from,” the report noted. In response to Guardian Australia’s questions about the data, the Lancet replied the study’s lead author said he received his data from a healthcare data analytics company called Surgisphere, the founder of which admitted they had mixed up data from an Asian hospital with those from Australia. While the Surgisphere founder said the data error did not alter the findings of the study, Dr. Allen Cheng, an infectious disease physician from Alfred Health in Melbourne, said the names of the Australian hospitals should be made public and that he had never heard of Surgisphere. “Usually to submit to a database like Surgisphere you need ethics approval, and someone from the hospital will be involved in that process to get it to a database,” Cheng told Guardian Australia. “If they got this wrong, what else could be wrong?” He also questioned the fact that the Lancet study had only four authors. “Usually with studies that report on findings from thousands of patients, you would see a large list of authors on the paper,” he said. “Multiple sources are needed to collect and analyse the data for large studies and you usually see that acknowledged in the list of authors.” Other physicians tweeted their concerns about the Lancet study: So Surgisphere Corp was caught falsifying data for the Lancet study on hydroxychloroquine Hospitals deny ever sharing patient data w/ this mysterious database When asked to reveal the hospitals the data came from, Surgisphere refused Is this real life?https://t.co/mvoBpE8IrE — James Todaro, MD (@JamesTodaroMD) May 28, 2020  Lancet registry study has problems.

Risch found that in five studies, including two controlled clinical trials, the drugs showed “significant major outpatient treatment efficacy” and concluded HCQ and azithromycin “need to be widely available and promoted immediately for physicians to prescribe.” “Hydroxychloroquine+azithromycin has been widely misrepresented in both clinical reports and public media,” he noted, observing as well that “Remdesivir has shown mild effectiveness in hospitalized inpatients, but no trials have been registered in outpatients.” Risch added: Hydroxychloroquine+azithromycin has been used as standard-of-care in more than 300,000 olderazithromycinazithromycin adults with multicomorbidities, with estimated proportion diagnosed with cardiac arrhythmias attributable to the medications 47/100,000 users, of which estimated mortality is <20%, 9/100,000 users, compared to the 10,000 Americans now dying each week.

Americans should be allowed to unite over George Floyd. I don’t know of anyone defending his sadistic treatment at the hands of the Minneapolis police. Everyone’s condemning what happened. President Trump is demanding justice and an investigation. The U.S. Attorney’s office in Minnesota and the FBI’s Minneapolis field office issued a joint statement saying they are in the midst of “a robust criminal investigation.” If such things were allowed today, the appalling death of George Floyd could bring the country together, could heal the racial divide that was cynically widened by the Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown hoaxes… Some good could come from this, could come from our shared humanity and revulsion over what happened to Mr. Floyd. But Democrats and our nihilistic media cannot allow that. Coming together is now forbidden in this country, thanks to a media that has lost so much credibility with the public it has turned to nihilism, has turned to fomenting chaos — because causing anarchy is the only influence the media have left. Let me put it this way… If you’re in a room full of people enjoying a robust political debate and no one is paying attention to you because you’ve been caught lying too often, been caught inventing facts too often — you only have one option to call attention to yourself. All you can do is stand on a table and scream FIRE! And that always works. Screaming FIRE! shuts everyone else up, puts all eyes on you, and best of all, everyone reacts to you, to what you’re saying. Watch them scramble! Watch them panic! Watch them scratch and claw as they crawl all over each other! That’s the corporate media today. That’s all they have left. They can’t win a fair debate; they can’t participate in an adult discussion anymore. We don’t trust them anymore. They have no credibility anymore. Plus, we’re informed now. We have access to the same information they do. So we don’t even need them. They’re useless liars no one trusts or believes. But they can still stand on a table and scream FIRE! Like any criminal or gangster or anarchist, like anyone evil enough to do so, the media will always have the power to spread fear, panic, and chaos… This turn towards nihilism began with the George Zimmerman Hoax in 2013. All Zimmerman was guilty of was defending himself against a deadly physical assault, but in order to stir up hate and racial division, the media described the Hispanic Zimmerman as white and even went so far as to fabricate evidence against him — ABC, NBC, and CNNLOL were all guilty of this. After failing to start a race riot over Zimmerman, the media immediately embraced the Hands Up, Don’t Shoot Hoax in Ferguson. This was when I first compared CNNLOL to Elliott Carver, the Bond villain in Tomorrow Never Dies, who generates tragedy to sell his newspapers and boost the ratings of his news networks. Not content to report on events in Ferguson, CNNLOL sent its anchors in, monsters like Jake Tapper and Don Lemon, to deliberately incite a riot. Using lies and hysteria (over what turned out to be a hoax) CNNLOL and the rest of the nihilist media pulled an Elliot Carver — invented news that created violence and death just to boost ratings and clicks — just to feel influential again. Hey, and so what if Ferguson burned down. No one in the elite media lives in Ferguson. So what if a predominantly black working class community is destroyed. Hey, sometimes you gotta break a few eggs… The nihilism then moved to Baltimore and more race riots. Then it moved to inciting violence at Donald Trump’s 2016 rallies. After Trump won, the media have screamed FIRE! non-stop, manipulating the public the only way they can: with panic and chaos based on big lies about Russia collusion and Charlottesville, and small lies like fish food. Well, on top of the deaths in Ferguson and Baltimore, the media’s nihilism can now add countless coronavirus nursing home deaths to its list of causalities, some 50,000 who died while the media created chaos by screaming about how we were all going to die of the virus unless we locked down the healthy and destroyed our economy. To create chaos around Trump, the media gushed over Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-NY) to undermine Trump’s federal authority — when the truth is that Trump was doing a pretty good job while Cuomo was pouring infection into nursing homes, needlessly killing thousands. And now that we’re learning the true toll of these unnecessary nursing home deaths, rather than focus on that, rather than ensure that doesn’t happen again (something we could agree on), the media ignore the nursing home holocaust to spread social chaos over masks — bullying everyone into wearing a mask even though if you’re under 50 the coronavirus is no more fatal than the seasonal flu. The media cannot influence us with truth because all the media do is lie. The media cannot influence us with persuasive arguments because all their ideas have either failed throughout history or are fascist. The media cannot influence us through bias because we now see through it. The media cannot influence us through news coverage because we are now more informed than the soc-called “journalists” are, too many of whom are spoiled, entitled twenty-somethings who know nothing about anything, most especially real life. So now the media gameplan is nihilism and chaos, which is why the unifying outrage over the death of George Floyd has been twisted into a black v. white issue, a left v. right issue, a pro-riot v. anti-riot issue. Any asshole without a conscience can scream FIRE!, can spread fear, panic, and chaos. That requires no skill, and that’s all the media have left. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

Boston University announced this week that it will be using “specialized robots” to test students for the Chinese virus upon their return to campus this fall. The university also announced that it will utilize contact tracing to mitigate the spread of the virus on campus. According to a report by Campus Reform, Boston University will use robots as part of its “multipronged” response to the Chinese virus pandemic. The robots will reportedly be used to expedite the testing process. A report from Boston University Today revealed that engineering faculty have been developing a robotics program that will aid in the university’s mitigation efforts. The program, which is still in development, will allow students to be notified electronically if they test positive for the virus. The samples would be tested for the coronavirus at a lab inside the Rajen Kilachand Center for Integrated Life Sciences & Engineering. Newly purchased specialized robots would be used to help speed up the test result process, and results of the tests would be delivered to people electronically. Leading the testing program will be Catherine Klapperich, a College of Engineering professor of biomedical engineering and director of the BU Precision Diagnostics Center. Once it’s running, the laboratory will be run and overseen by certified clinical lab professionals and will work closely with the offices of Student Health and Occupational Health. Breitbart News reported in April that Boston University officials were considering extending the campus shutdown through the end of the calendar year. However, these recent developments suggest otherwise. Boston University President Robert A. Brown suggested that the fall semester may involve a hybrid approach with both online and in-person courses. “We are starting to see a vision of fall emerge,” Brown said in a statement. “The goal is to take advantage of the best public health and safety tools at our disposal in order to allow our students to get back to school. Our classroom instruction will be designed with flexibility in mind, offering both remote learning with in-person participation, so that every student, whatever their location or personal circumstance, will receive the academic support and instruction they deserve.” Stay tuned to Breitbart News for more campus updates.

Universities and colleges around the nation are claiming that the ongoing Chinese virus pandemic has prevented them from complying with requests for public records from journalists. Some universities have even refused to comply with a federal investigation into foreign influence on higher education. According to a report by the College Fix, universities are using the Chinese virus pandemic as an excuse to delay responses to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. Although the Chinese virus pandemic began nearly two months ago, reporters claim that universities and colleges have continued to use the pandemic as a justification for delays. Frank LoMonte, the director of the University of Florida’s Brechner Center for Freedom of Information, said that many government agencies are using the pandemic to shut down records requests. “We are definitely seeing agencies across all levels of government taking full advantage of the COVID crisis to more-or-less shut down fulfillment of records requests,” LoMonte said. The problem, LoMonte, points out, is that universities and colleges typically try to avoid compliance with information requests. Unfortunately, the Chinese virus pandemic has presented institutions with a fresh reason to delay document production. “Frankly, there are a lot of agencies, including colleges and universities, that never wanted to answer [Freedom of Information Act] requests in the first place and that are opportunistically using the crisis to close the window to requester,” he added. “It’s totally understandable that fulfilling requests, especially requests for paper documents that can’t be remotely retrieved from home, is going to take longer than it used to. That’s legitimate,” LoMonte finished. “What’s not legitimate is totally shutting down processing requests.” Breitbart News reported last week that several universities and colleges have refused to comply with a federal investigation into the Chinese government’s influence on American higher education. Federal investigators believe that internal university documents will reveal undisclosed financial grants from the Chinese government. Stay tuned to Breitbart News for more updates on this story.

MANCHESTER, England (AP) — The Premier League plans to restart on June 17 after a 100-day shutdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic, with new staggered kickoff times to make sure every game can be shown on TV as fans are prevented from attending games. The clubs agreed Thursday that the competition should resume with a Wednesday night doubleheader featuring Manchester City playing Arsenal and Aston Villa hosting Sheffield United — two games that were postponed during earlier rounds. However, the league still needs formal approval from the government. “This date cannot be confirmed until we have met all the safety requirements needed,” Premier League chief executive Richard Masters said, “as the health and welfare of all participants and supporters is our priority.” After those makeup games are played, the 30th round will start on Friday, June 19 at 8 p.m. (1900 GMT) — if authorities approve safety plans. “Positive to see further steps on the return of football today,” Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden tweeted. “We are still working on govt guidance before we green light sports’ return.” It’s still unclear where games will be played when the league resumes. Police have said only neutral venues should be used over concerns fans would congregate outside, but that plan was opposed by the 20 clubs. The Premier League agreed to a government request for all remaining 92 fixtures to be aired live in Britain. Only 200 of the 380 games each season are normally broadcast live domestically while all are available to view internationally. For the first time since the Premier League launched in 1992, games will be shown live by free-to-air broadcaster BBC, which has four of the remaining games. “At a time when sports fans across the country are in need of lift, this is very welcome news,” BBC director of sport Barbara Slater said. Saturdays will see an additional late game start at 8 p.m. after fixtures at 12:30 p.m., 3 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. There will be a new early and late slot on Sundays of 12 p.m. and 7 p.m. between the usual 2 p.m. and 4:30 p.m. kickoffs. The Friday and Monday night games will be at usual at 8 p.m. Midweek rounds will now see an earlier set of games at 6 p.m. followed by 8 p.m. kickoffs. Football has already resumed in Germany, with three rounds of the Bundesliga played in empty stadiums. The Spanish league has government approval to restart after June 8. But lockdown measures have only just been eased to allow full practice sessions to resume at Premier League clubs. Liverpool is on the verge of winning the Premier League, sitting 25 points in front with nine games remaining.

Just one day after Breitbart News reported that Twitter had failed to “fact check” Chinese accounts promoting conspiracy theories about the Wuhan coronavirus, Twitter has applied a “fact check” label to two posts by China Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhao Lijian that were included in Breitbart’s report on the platform’s failure to hold the communist nation to account for its misinformation on the Chinese virus. On May 26, Twitter added a “fact check” label to a pair of tweets from President Trump expressing widely-held concerns about mail-in ballots increasing the risk of voter fraud. The “fact check” link, which urged users to “get the facts about mail-in ballots,” directed users to a Twitter “moment” — a collection of links and tweets, handpicked by Twitter employees. The “moment,” intended to fact-check the President, was filled with establishment media articles from CNN, the Washington Post and other outlets, baselessly asserting that Trump was lying about mail-in ballots. This is reportedly the first time the social media platform has branded Trump’s tweets with a link to a “fact check” of this type. Breitbart News reported yesterday that despite the “fact-checking” of President Trump by Twitter, the site had failed to apply the same standards to other governments and heads of state. In particular, the site had refused to remove or even fact-check posts from Chinese government officials spreading conspiracy theories suggesting that the Wuhan coronavirus actually originated in the United States. Today, Twitter added fact-check labels to posts by China Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhao Lijian, both of which were actually listed in the article by Breitbart News. The two tweets can be seen below: This article is very much important to each and every one of us. Please read and retweet it.

A Twitter spokesperson told Bloomberg News that Zhao’s tweets “contain potentially misleading content” about the virus and have been labeled “to provide additional context to the public. These actions are in line with the approach we shared earlier this month.” Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

California was one of a few states hit hard by the coronavirus as it spread throughout the U.S. in March. Hence, hospitals shut down routine procedures and called in thousands of health care workers from across the country to help patients. The only problem is, the predicted coronavirus surge never came. Reuters reported that many of the costs associated with setting up field hospitals, doubling intensive care units, and purchasing personal protective equipment hit the hospitals right in their purse strings, while the ban on elective procedures sliced their revenue in half. The measures drove some hospitals in the state close to bankruptcy, costing them as much as $14 million and forcing them to lay off close to thousands of health care employees, according to the California Hospital Association. Other hospitals, such as the Stanford Health Care (SHC) system, implemented a temporary reduction in hours across the whole organization to stay afloat, KGO reported. “But we’re being asked to use our hard-earned Paid Time Off, or to go unpaid, and file for unemployment until July- or for another ten weeks- if not longer,” one nurse revealed. California called for a Health Corps in March, which 95,000 people signed up for. But of those 95,000 people, fewer than 800 have been hired by the state, Reuters reported. “The worst thing we could do was really to under-prepare,” said Dr. Sanjay Kurani, Medical Director at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center, a public hospital system serving California’s Silicon Valley. “From a patient health standpoint and from a public health standpoint, we had to prepare.” The hospital industry is now asking the state for a $1 billion bailout to help hospitals pay off some of those costs, and another $3 billion once the new fiscal year starts July 1. “Most hospitals’ balance sheets have been trashed,” said Carmela Coyle, president of the California Hospital Association. “It’s a one-two punch that many hospitals will find it difficult to survive.”

Brothel operators in Saarland have launched a lawsuit aimed at the major restrictions on their businesses put in place by the German government’s Wuhan coronavirus lockdown. The brothel owners argue that the government prohibition on prostitution and sex work facilities is not justified as it conflicts with freedom of professional activity. They argued that hairdressers, nail salons, and massage parlours have all been allowed to resume business. The owners claim that they have developed their own procedures to ensure proper hygiene within the brothels just as other businesses have developed similar measures in order to stop the spread of the Chinese virus, Bild reported on Wednesday. Germany is one of the countries in Europe where prostitution is legalised either fully or partially. In Switzerland, where sex work is also legal, prostitutes face the same issues, and the national association of counselling centres for sex workers has demanded they be allowed to resume work on June 8th. French Prostitutes Demand Coronavirus Govt Cash Bailout https://t.co/DNflQPpdqc — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 9, 2020  The association has also come up with guidelines for prostitutes, including sexual positions deemed to minimise the risk of spreading the virus in which the two people engaging in sex have their faces as far apart as possible. The body suggests the “doggy” position would minimalise the likelihood of transmission between client and employee. Rooms in Swiss brothels would also be ventilated for up to 15 minutes or more after each customer and bed linens would be washed after every customer, as well. Brothels have also offered to log customer contact data for up to four weeks to track clients in case of an outbreak. Last month while France was in the middle of its severe lockdown measures, associations representing prostitutes demanded Emmanuel Macron’s government give prostitutes emergency government aid. “An emergency fund must be created to provide a replacement income during confinement,” the Red Umbrella Federation said. “In the short term, some of the poorest sex workers will find themselves forced to defy confinement, not with a gaiety of heart, but as a lack of means of subsistence because it is a question of survival,” they added.

Thursday on MSNBC’s “Andrea Mitchell Reports,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said President Donald Trump was a “terrible example” for mocking people wearing masks when not to do so is “very selfish.” Pelosi said, “100,000 people —more than 100,000 people have died from the coronavirus. This administration has been a failure in terms of what we’re doing when testing and tracing and treating and isolating people. The president has been a terrible example of not wearing a mask, belittling those who do. So anything he does is a distraction from the problem at hand. People are dying, Rome is burning, and all people want to talk about is what he said next about this. That is a success for him. So I just will not go there. It’s about testing, testing, testing, to open up our schools so our children can go back safely. It’s about opening up our economy, so we can flourish. It’s about saving lives. And all of this is a distraction from the problem at hand. We have people dying, and he’s talking about one thing and another and then monopolizes the whole conversation. I simply won’t go there.” She added, “When we talk about opening up, it’s foolish to open up in any way other than that which has guidelines about distancing and masks and the rest. And to do so in a way that preserves health and not endangers people. Because when you go out there, you’re not only endangering yourself, you’re bringing something home to your children or your parents if they’re older in that category with the predisposition. So this is about acting unselfishly. You don’t wear a mask. You’re being very selfish. It’s not about how strong you think you are. It’s how unconcerned you are about what you might spread to someone else. Of course, we all want to be out. That’s natural. I like the idea of fresh air, as a matter of fact, for my children and grandchildren. However, you have to do so in a very, very safe way. And that’s what leadership the administration should be taking instead of saying magically go away. It’s a hoax. Magically, this, that and the other thing. Face the facts, face the reality of what it is, and only then we’ll be able as we understand the challenge, address the needs, do it in a robust and fast way so that we diminish the death toll.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo (D) announced Thursday that he will sign an executive order allowing businesses to bar entry to individuals who do not wear a mask or face covering amid the Chinese coronavirus pandemic.  “We made them mandatory in public settings, public transportation etc., but when we’re talking about reopening stores and places of business, we’re giving the store owners the right to say, ‘if you’re not wearing a mask, you can’t come in,” Cuomo said during his daily press conference. “You don’t want to wear a mask? Fine, but you don’t have a right to then go into that store if that store owner doesn’t want you to,” added the governor.  To date, eight million masks have been delivered to public housing, homeless shelters, and food banks in New York City, while another one million will be sent to various neighborhoods Thursday, he said.  Cuomo’s remarks come as New York Attorney General Letitia James announced the passage of legislation rolling back N.Y. Penal Law 240.35(4), which made it a crime for people to don masks publically. “Wearing masks in public remains necessary for the health and safety of New Yorkers. But there was a clear conflict of law, and repealing this outdated provision is commonsense policy,” James said in a statement. “Even if it is difficult to imagine a police department enforcing, a prosecutor charging, or a judge upholding such a charge during the COVID-19 crisis, we should not tolerate a situation where following the law is dangerous. I thank Senator Bailey and Assemblymember Quart for their leadership and for permanently repealing this law.” New York City has over 200,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and 16,410 deaths, according to data tracked by Johns Hopkins University.

Dr. Anthony Fauci has urged Christians to wear masks, practice social distancing, and forego singing and receiving communion during worship services to curb the spread of the coronavirus. In an interview with the Jesuit-run America magazine published Wednesday, Dr. Fauci said that churches should “limit the number of people, so that you don’t have people in the pews right next to each other,” and the faithful should “absolutely” wear masks. Regarding the distribution of communion, Fauci said he does not think there is a safe way to go about it and the practice should be abandoned until further notice. “I think for the time being, you just gotta forestall that,” he said. Fauci, who identifies as a Jesuit-educated Catholic who has distanced himself from “the concept of organized churches, religions,” said that at the moment he believes that receiving communion is too risky, even if it involves only the distribution of the consecrated bread without the cup. “As many times as a priest can wash his hands, he gets to Communion, he puts it in somebody’s hand, they put it in their mouth,” he said, “it’s that kind of close interaction that you don’t want when you’re in the middle of a deadly outbreak.” Fauci said he thinks that religious practice should vary from place to place, according to the intensity and extent of infections. “It depends on where you are,” he said. “If you are in a region, a city, a county, where there is a significant amount of infection, I think with distributing Communion, I think that would be risky. I’m telling you that as a Catholic, it would be risky.” In recent weeks, there have been numerous confrontations between religious and civil leaders regarding the proper jurisdiction of each when it comes to the practice of the faith. One notorious case was that of Minnesota, where the state’s Catholic Bishops and Lutheran leaders announced that public worship would resume on May 26, in defiance of restrictions put in place by Governor Tim Walz. Many people of faith “were disappointed in Governor Walz’s May 13 announcement that he would end the Stay-at-Home order to allow more commerce but prohibit religious gatherings of more than ten people,” an order that “defies reason,” stated the Catholic bishops in a May 20 letter. Insisting that the life of faith is “essential,” the bishops declared that they have given Catholic parishes “permission for the resumption of the public celebration of Mass on Tuesday, May 26, which will give us time to be ready for the celebration of Pentecost on May 31.” “We are blessed to live in a nation that guarantees the free exercise of religion,” they said. “This right can only be abridged for a compelling governmental interest, and only in a way that is narrowly tailored to be the least restrictive means of achieving the desired end.” Last Saturday Governor Walz told reporters that it is unclear whether worship constitutes something “essential,” countering an assertion made recently by President Trump. “I think the case that the president is making and that may be up for debate in this country of deeming houses of worship essential, essential services and that’s one that we take into consideration,” the Democrat governor said during an hour-long briefing on opening up religious services during the coronavirus lockdown.

New York Yankees players Mike Ford and David Hale are giving online baseball lessons to kids who are unable to attend baseball camp due to coronavirus cancellations. The players are set to host lessons on Internet conference service Zoom for kids who would normally be attending the camp in New Rochelle, New York, PageSix reported. Camp coach Darren Gurney praised the effort, saying, “In the absence of the boys’ ability to play, it is so important to continue to foster their love of the game and to encourage them to stay fit. We are grateful for the opportunity to hear from top MLB talent.” Topics of the videos will include pitching and hitting tips, as well as ways to “stay motivated” despite being shut up in your home, thanks to the coronavirus lockdowns. The team has engaged in a number of actions during this pandemic. The team announced a $1.4 million distress fund for team and stadium employees who have lost salaries and work time due to the shutdowns. In another effort, the team donated cloth to make PPEs that would otherwise have gone into uniform making. Follow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston.

A California sheriff is vowing to look the other way as it pertains to enforcing an order requiring that residents wear masks in public. Orange County Sheriff Don Barnes made his announcement Tuesday in front of the county’s board of supervisors. The county recently passed an order requiring all residents to wear a mask if they cannot stay six feet away from people, the Los Angeles Times reported. “We are not the mask police — nor do I intend to be the mask police,” Barnes said. “I think what we have seen repeatedly throughout the community is Orange County residents acting responsibly.” Barnes went on to call the residents “adults” who “can take the protective measures as they see fit.” “We have not dealt with these issues through enforcement, and I will direct my staff not to direct any enforcement toward the … mask requirement,” he added. Orange County has had 5,646 confirmed coronavirus cases as of Thursday, 136 of them being fatal, according to the Orange County Department of Public Health’s website. Barnes is not the only sheriff not to enforce a mask order. Police and sheriffs’ unions in Texas’s largest county, Harris County, said in April that they would not enforce an order by county Judge Lina Hidalgo, a Democrat, requiring that everyone wear a mask.

A Mexican border state implemented southbound checkpoints at international ports of entry to enforce Coronavirus sanitation measures. Those wishing to enter who do not follow the protocols will be sent back to Texas. This week, the Tamaulipas government began a series of health inspections and outreach operations in the border cities of Matamoros, Reynosa, and Rio Bravo. According to Tamaulipas officials, travelers will be checked for symptoms and be given provide information about current restrictions.  Officials will also check that only one passenger is traveling per vehicle, require masks, and let them know that only essential activities are allowed. Only certain vehicles from the U.S. are allowed on Tamaulipas roads. “These filters are placed to protect the health of Tamaulipas families,” said Tamaulipas Health Secretary Gloria Molina Gamboa in a prepared statement. “They will help decrease the number of infections and deaths due to Coronavirus.” In recent days, Matamoros saw a dramatic spike in cases. Local politicians, including the mayor, claimed the spike is related to U.S. travelers visiting for social purposes who fail to follow health guidelines. The measures stand in direct contrast with the more relaxed federal approach. Mexico City now claims the pandemic under control. Ildefonso Ortiz is an award-winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.

NEW YORK (AP) — Baseball players appeared likely to propose more regular-season games this year while holding to their demand for full prorated salaries, people familiar with their deliberations told The Associated Press. Washington pitcher Max Scherzer, among eight players on the union’s executive subcommittee, issued a statement late Wednesday night calling management’s proposal for more salary cuts a non-starter. A day after Major League Baseball proposed a sliding scale of salary slashing for a pandemic-delayed season with an 82-game schedule in ballparks without fans, the union held a conference call Wednesday that included its executive board, player representatives and alternate player representatives, the people said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because no details were announced. Scherzer, among the sport’s highest-paid players, confirmed the call without divulging who was on it. “After discussing the latest developments with the rest of the players there’s no need to engage with MLB in any further compensation reductions,” he said in a statement posted to Twitter. “We have previously negotiated a pay cut in the version of prorated salaries, and there’s no justification to accept a 2nd pay cut based upon the current information the union has received.” “I’m glad to hear other players voicing the same viewpoint,” he added, “and believe MLB’s economic strategy would completely change if all documentation were to become public information.”
It was unclear when the union will respond to MLB’s plan, the people said. Stars Mike Trout and Gerrit Cole would lose the most under MLB’s plan, about 77% of the $36 million each they were set to be paid this season. In all, there are 133 players whose contracts call for salaries of $10 million or more, not including shares of signing bonuses. A big leaguer earning $1 million or less would keep at least 43% of his salary under the six-tier scale. That includes a share of $200 million earmarked for players that is contingent on the postseason being completed. About 460 of approximately 900 players on rosters and injured lists when spring training was stopped in mid-March due to the new coronavirus make $1 million or less. Trout and Cole would be cut to about $8 million each. Colorado’s Nolan Arenado would drop from $35 million to $7.84 million. “Interesting strategy of making the best most marketable players potentially look like the bad guys,” Milwaukee pitcher Brett Anderson tweeted. The players’ association called the proposal “extremely disappointing.” The union has argued players already accepted a cut to prorated shares of their salaries in a March 26 agreement and should not have to bargain again. MLB would like to start the season around the Fourth of July in empty ballparks and proposed an 82-game regular season. It claims teams would lose billions of dollars by playing with no ticket money and gate-related revenue.
“This season is not looking promising,” New York Mets pitcher Marcus Stroman tweeted. “Keeping the mind and body ready regardless.” Union head Tony Clark has not commented publicly on MLB’s proposal and has said very little publicly since late March. Agent Scott Boras has repeatedly criticized MLB for proposing more salary reductions and has questioned the accuracy of management’s financial claims. “Hearing a LOT of rumors about a certain player agent meddling in MLBPA affairs,” Cincinnati pitcher Trevor Bauer tweeted Wednesday. “If true — and at this point, these are only rumors — I have one thing to say… Scott Boras, rep your clients however you want to, but keep your damn personal agenda out of union business.” Boras declined to comment on Bauer’s remarks. “Working together to manage the public health issue has brought great solidarity among the players,” Boras said earlier in the day. “They are a strong united front and resolute in their support of the MLBPA.” A season with more than 82 games would lead to players earning a higher percentage of their original salaries. MLB says that without fans each additional game would result in a $640,000 loss.
Brewers chairman Mark Attanasio told the Greater Milwaukee Committee on Tuesday “the be-careful-what-you-wish-for part is hours every day.” “It’s got to come together very quickly or we won’t be able to, we will just run out of time,” he said. “To pay players at a full contract rate, pretty much 90% of that would go to pay them and wouldn’t cover any other costs.” Details of the plan have been disclosed to the AP by several people familiar with the proposal. They spoke on condition of anonymity because details had not been announced. MLB’s proposal says that within 48 hours of the ratification of an agreement for player compensation terms and health and safety protocols, the commissioner’s office would announce a proposed timeline for the resumption of the season. The resumption would include a training period of at least 21 days, and each team would be allowed a maximum of three exhibition games, all in the final seven days of the training period. Opening day would be in early July, and the final scheduled regular-season game would be no later than Sept. 27 — the same as in the original 2020 schedule. Issues such as roster size, trade deadlines, series length and treatment of the luxury tax would be delegated to a subcommittee.

The Gary Sinise Foundation, founded by actor and avid supporter of U.S. military veterans and their families Gary Sinise, has donated 20,000 meals to VA hospitals to help the coronavirus recovery efforts. “Donations like this mean a lot to our VA staff as they are on the front lines of caring for our nation’s veterans every day,” VA Secretary Robert Wilkie said in a press release. “We are very appreciative of this donation during the COVID-19 pandemic.” The VA noted that it would distribute the food donations among 80 VA facilities. The @DeptVetAffairs announced today that the Gary Sinise Foundation has committed to providing up to 20,000 meals to 80 VA medical facilities across the nation in the coming weeks.

Everybody’s been impacted by having to stay home from work or go to work because they’re a first responder, and they’re needed out there, so we’re trying to make a difference.” Sinise also recently donated PPEs to the San Diego Police Department. Sinese gave about 500 face shields and a shipment of hand sanitizer to the department. “We’re just so happy that an organization like the Gary Sinise Foundation is willing to make a donation such as this to the San Diego Police Department,” said San Diego Police Lt. Shawn Takeuchi. Follow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston.

BBC anchor Emily Maitlis has not apologised for a rant against Dominic Cummings which the broadcaster admits broke the rules on impartiality. The British Broadcasting Corporation, being funded by the public through a compulsory licence fee which live television viewers must pay whether they consume BBC programming or not –or else face fines backed by the threat of imprisonment — is obliged maintain a neutral, balanced stance in its news reporting. BBC staff may play Devil’s Advocate when interviewing politicians and so on, putting the arguments which they believe their guests’ opponents would put to them — but they are not allowed to use their publicly-funded platform to take sides or voice their own political opinions, like staffers on left- or right-leaning commercial networks in the United States such as CNN and Fox News. On the BBC’s flagship Newsnight programme, however, anchor Emily Maitlis opened the May 27th show with a speech declaring in definitive and highly partisan terms that Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson’s chief adviser, “broke the rules, the country can see that and it’s shocked the government cannot” when he travelled from London to Durham to ensure his young child’s healthcare needs could be met if he and his wife were incapacitated by the coronavirus. She followed with a dig about how Cummings had in the past “tagged the lazy label of ‘elite'” on political opponents — principally establishment Remainers — and claimed the public mood towards him is “one of fury, contempt, and anguish” before accusing the Prime Minister of “blind loyalty” for defending his “reasonable and legal” behaviour. BBC statement on last night's Newsnight pic.twitter.com/JFm4Nt5YMv — BBC News Press Team (@BBCNewsPR) May 27, 2020  The BBC received thousands of complaints about Maitlis’s tirade, and had to admit, after much obfuscation, that it “did not meet our standards of due impartiality”. While Cummings’ enemies believe he should be fired for alleged rule-breaking, however, Maitlis’s admitted rule-breaking does not appear to warrant any punishment in the eyes of the BBC, which merely noted that “Our staff have been reminded of the guidelines.” There was speculation that Maitlis’s absence from Newsnight the day after her rant was some form of punishment, but she has since revealed that she was absent simply because she had herself asked for the night off, with substitute Katie Razzall further confirming that she had “not been asked by the BBC to take [the night] off — and if I thought she had been, I certainly wouldn’t have agreed to present the show”. Indeed, Maitlis not only declined to apologise for her actions, she actually posted a message saying she was “overwhelmed by all the kindness, messages – and support on here – and I’ve probably missed much of it” on social media, and offered  “A big thank you” not just from herself, but “from us all at [Newsnight]” — suggesting a signal lack of contrition for the stunt. Whether the BBC or Ofcom, the broadcast regulator, will take any further, meaningful action remains to be seen. Just for the record, Emily @maitlis has not been asked by the BBC to take tonight off – and if I thought she had been, I certainly wouldn’t have agreed to present the show @BBCNewsnight — Katie Razzall (@katierazz) May 27, 2020  Maitlis has previous form for revealing her political biases in her supposedly impartial journalism, launching into an astonishing pro-EU rant after clashing with the Hungarian foreign minister in an interview centring on his government’s hard line against illegal immigration and state-sponsored multiculturalism in “The problem with the European Union is it believes in tolerance, diversity, and human rights,” she railed at him, visibly quivering with anger. “And you are rejecting them all. So maybe it isn’t for you,” she said.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) sounded off on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and congressional Democrats for utilizing “proxy voting” amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. McCarthy this week joined congressional Republicans in filing a lawsuit against Pelosi saying proxy voting is unconstitutional and during Thursday’s Fox News Channel broadcast of “America’s Newsroom” reiterated Pelosi’s attempt to “secure more power for herself” amid a crisis is “unconstitutional.” “Everybody should be opposed to proxy voting,” McCarthy told host Sandra Smith. “Almost one-third of the Democrats did not show up to work yesterday but they’ll still get their paycheck. More than 50 million Americans did not have a voice on that floor. Democrats signed a piece of paper that said they were physically unable to come to Congress, but Charlie Crist was able to even though he signed that paper to go to the launch across the state. So, he lied to his own constituents, he lied under oath to those members that are in Congress themselves. And think for one moment — 231 years, we have never done this. Through yellow fever of 1793, through the Civil War, through the Spanish flu, even when the building was burned down in the War of 1812, 9/11.” He continued, “We should convene, the Constitution says we should. It is only the ability of Nancy Pelosi to try to get more power. Her own words yesterday on the floor … she says this is an opportunity, every crisis is. She’s taking a crisis as an opportunity to secure more power for herself and allow only 20 people to control the entire floor. That’s unconstitutional. They do not have the power and the right to do it, and all Americans should stand against this.” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent

A newspaper editor fled South Africa last week after police repeatedly assaulted him for covering the country’s strict coronavirus lockdowns, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said on Wednesday. On May 19, local journalist Paul Nthoba fled South Africa for the neighboring country of Lesotho after receiving repeated abuse from local law enforcement for his coverage of the region’s stringent coronavirus lockdowns. “This is the first time in post-apartheid South Africa that a journalist has fled the country with the intention of seeking asylum as a result of reprisals in connection with their reporting,” RSF said. According to the report, Nthoba was “punched and kicked by police while covering the [coronavirus lockdown] operation in [the town of] Ficksburg” for the first time on May 15.” Nthoba told RSF he visited the Ficksburg police station to file a complaint about the abuse on the same day but was “punched and kicked again” and then detained for several hours afterward. “They promised to deal with me once I’m released,” he said. Nthoba said he then reported the assaults to South Africa’s Independent Police Investigative Directorate, but to no avail. The journalist has since been charged with “violating lockdown regulations” and faces up to six months in prison under South Africa’s Disaster Management Act, which was amended in April to assist with regulations during the coronavirus pandemic, according to the report. Arnaud Froger, the director of RSF’s Africa desk, condemned South Africa’s attack on press freedom during the pandemic. “It is unthinkable in the South Africa of 2020 that a journalist should have to flee the country for covering a simple lockdown operation. The police cannot act with complete impunity on the grounds that they are enforcing the lockdown,” Froger said. In late March, Johannesburg police fired rubber bullets at Azarrah Karrim, a journalist for South Africa’s News24, as she reported on the first day of the national lockdown. Under South Africa’s strict lockdown measures, people who are found guilty of “disseminating false information” about the coronavirus pandemic could face up to six months in prison, according to the report. On May 24, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced an easing of coronavirus restrictions starting June 1.

The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said it supports the use of the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) to prevent coronavirus on Tuesday despite the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) suspending clinical trials of the drug over safety concerns, the Times of India (TOI) reported. The ICMR, India’s top biomedical research body, has directed the Indian government’s response to the ongoing Chinese coronavirus pandemic. The council’s endorsement of HCQ comes one week after U.S. President Donald Trump said he has been taking the drug as a preventive measure against the coronavirus. The ICMR recorded “no major side effects” of taking the drug as a prophylactic [preventive medicine] in observational and case-control studies in India, the council’s director-general, Balram Bhargava said on Tuesday, according to Agence France-Presse (AFP). Bhargava added that some instances of “nausea, vomiting, and heart palpitations” were noted. Last week, the ICMR expanded its guidelines for taking HCQ as a preventive drug for coronavirus. It announced all healthcare workers in hospitals and some frontline workers could now take HCQ for “up to several weeks” under strict medical supervision. “We recommended that for prophylaxis [preventive medicine], it should be continued because there is no harm. Benefit may be there,” Bhargava explained in statements to the press on Tuesday, as reported by AFP. He added that once the ICMR determined that the potential benefits of HCQ outweigh its possible risks, the council decided “we should not deny it to our frontline workers and healthcare workers.” Bhargava also said that healthcare workers and those working on the frontlines taking the drug should still wear personal protective gear to further protect themselves from contracting the virus. Previously, the ICMR’s guidelines for HCQ allowed “only asymptomatic healthcare workers caring for suspected or confirmed patients, or household contacts of confirmed patients” to take the drug as preventive medicine for coronavirus, according to the report. On Monday, the W.H.O. said it was halting testing of the drug as a coronavirus treatment after studies reportedly led to doubts over its safety. India manufactures 70 percent of the world’s supply of HCQ and has increased production of the drug in recent weeks as doctors around the world continue to use it to treat coronavirus patients. Last month, India announced it would supply 85 million HCQ tablets to 108 countries to support the global effort to combat the coronavirus pandemic. On Tuesday, an Indian government source told the TOI that India would continue to export the promised shipments of HCQ to foreign countries despite the W.H.O.’s suspension of HCQ trials. The Indian government will “check if the countries who have not yet received HCQ supplies still want it as the medicine is used for other ailments too,” according to the source. At press time on Wednesday, India reported 158,086 infections and 4,534 deaths from the Chinese coronavirus.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who ordered nursing homes to accept coronavirus patients for more than six weeks during the height of the coronavirus pandemic, told MSNBC on Wednesday that he would not send his own mother to one. Cuomo was interviewed by MSNBC hosts Katy Tur and Chuck Todd, who asked him whether he believed he could keep nursing homes safe during a possible “second wave” of the virus in the fall. “Can we keep nursing homes safe? No,” he replied. “Can you keep a hospital safe? No. Can you keep any gathering safe? No.” Todd followed up: “Let me put in different terms, Governor. Would you advise a friend to put their parents in a senior facility if if they thought it was time right now? Or would you wait until this thing passed?” Cuomo replied: “If I were advising a friend, I would say you have a vulnerable person. Best to keep them at home and not put them in a congregate facility. Keep them if a situation where you have the most control. That is the blunt truth. That’s what I would do with my mother.” Asked whether he regretted ordering nursing homes to accept coronavirus patients, Cuomo claimed that the nursing homes had been required to turn such patients away if they could not care for them, and that New York State had merely been following guidelines set by the federal government that banned “discrimination” against coronavirus patients. He did not explain how nursing homes were to determine if they could treat coronavirus patients when he had barred them from even testing for the disease. More than 4,300 coronavirus patients were sent to New York nursing homes, according to the Associated Press. Joel B.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday outlined her vision for a global European Union, backing it to deliver guidance on handling the Chinese coronavirus pandemic based on what she claimed was the manifest evidence of the organization’s achievements. In a speech outlining Germany’s priorities when it takes over the E.U.’s rotating presidency in July, Merkel acknowledged the pandemic had destroyed a host of previous certainties but backed the E.U. to help bring the world to order, AFP reports. Her simple solution is: more E.U. in more places more often. This is despite the evidence Europe has struggled from day one to achieve any level of unanimous agreement on how to handle the crisis, with individual member states each taking their own course and eschewing direction from Brussels: EU President Apologises to Italy as Anger Against Political Bloc Grows https://t.co/wJCsaBIlbf — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 4, 2020  “Especially in times of crisis I want the European Union to show solidarity on a global level too and take on more responsibility,” she told the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung think tank by video link. “In many places, the pandemic will intensify existing conflicts and problems and will therefore also become a stress test for the European Union.” Merkel pointed to the E.U. as an exemplar of  “democracy, freedom and the protection of human dignity” that the world can aspire to, adding: I see our presidency as a chance to further develop Europe as a capable, cohesive, and accomplished power that takes responsibility for the peace and security on the planet. Europe could not tackle the world’s problems alone, however, and she said the United States remained Europe’s “most important partner.” “Of course I’m aware that the cooperation with America is currently more difficult than we’d like,” Merkel said, pointing to differences with President Donald Trump’s administration on a broad range of issues including the World Health Organization and its bungled handling of the coronavirus epidemic. While offering advice to the U.S. on how it could further cooperation with Europe, Merkel neglected to note the very public fractures already appearing in the organization: Le Pen: The EU Was the First Casualty of Coronavirus https://t.co/jrItlGWM3w — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 26, 2020  French National Rally (RN) leader Marine Le Pen back in March was pointing to failures in E.U. unity and cooperation, claiming solidarity was one of the first victims when the virus first reached European soil, as Breitbart News reported. Italy’s populist League leader Senator Matteo Salvini was another to add his voice of disappear to the E.U.’s collective response. He said: “I hope the pro-Europeans have understood that if Europe is hunger and death and sacrifice it is not the future that we must leave to our children.” “Let’s take back our country into our hands without going cap in hand to anyone. Long live Italy and long live the Italians,” Salvini added.

Hungarian Justice Minister Judit Varga confronted European Union officials over Hungary’s Wuhan coronavirus response, saying the globalist campaign against the country had no basis. Minister Varga spoke at a meeting of European Union ministers by teleconference on Tuesday, stating that Hungary should expect an apology from critics who had argued Prime Minister Viktor Orbán had become a “dictator”. Prime Minister Orbán had relinquished his emergency powers earlier this week, handing the parliament back its authority. “It wasn’t the first time that we have fell victim to a campaign that had no basis whatsoever. But fortunately, in this case, the misleading and false information spread about us has obviously been proven wrong,” Minister Varga said. Eight-in-Ten Hungarians Think Govt’s Coronavirus Response Better Than Other EU Countries https://t.co/36SEwyMdKB — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 27, 2020  She added that in an “ideal world” Hungary would be on the receiving end of apologies from critics, but given the silence so far she invoked British singer Elton John, saying: “Sorry seems to be the hardest word.” Prime Minister Orbán faced a wave of criticism by the establishment media and various liberal and left-wing politicians, including former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice who demanded the country be kicked out of the European Union. Despite the criticism, Hungary was bolstered by a European Commission report which said the country had not violated any laws and there was no legal basis for a case against the government. “But, but …all the media have told us for WEEKS that Hungary is basically a dictatorship… all this is VERY confusing…” Hungarian ambassador to the Vatican Eduard Habsburg said following the Commission report. While the measures may not have been popular with liberal elites, a poll released this week revealed that the vast majority (78 per cent) of Hungarians did approve of the steps, with only nine per cent of respondents saying the government’s actions had been too excessive.

A London based Islamic group, which purports to be a “human rights organisation”, has had an advertisement claiming the Chinese coronavirus is an act of revenge from Allah pulled from Facebook. CAGE, a Muslim campaign group perhaps best known for calling ISIS executioner ‘Jihadi John’ a “beautiful” man, was using social media sites to raise £400,000 during Ramadan. The group had posted 16 adverts on Facebook for its campaign called ‘Reviving Divine Justice’, four of which were banned, including one with a video on coronavirus. Facebook decided to remove the advertisements from the Islamist group because the video violated the Silicon Valley tech giant’s advertising policies, according to The Times. Facebook has said that it will remove any coronavirus material that it deems to be “misinformation and harmful content” during the pandemic. Despite the advertisement being pulled, the Islamist coronavirus video still remains active on CAGE’s Facebook and Youtube pages. The video, entitled “One deed that can change the world”, said that “The world is in crisis and no one seems to know how to stop it,” before adding: “Allah has warned us: ‘Whatever misfortune befalls you it is because of what your own hands have done.” In response to reports of the video being taken down, CAGE said: “The once-Hitler supporting Daily Fail (Mail) and the Murdoch Times have coordinated smear pieces on CAGE today because they don’t want you to see THIS video we put on Facebook.” “Also it’s ironic that in the midst of a national emergency, the highest Covid deaths in Europe and with the nation united in disgust at the incompetence of Boris and the breaking of the rules by his chief advisor — these racist rags decide to do the only thing they know to do in order to distract… Stoke fear and hatred of Muslims!” CAGE added. Reports from across the Middle East, Africa, and Asia this weekend described Muslims ignoring lockdowns to celebrate Eid al-Fitr. https://t.co/fXGQnt1567 — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) May 26, 2020  CAGE has previously come under fire after they called for the “abolition” of all terrorism laws in the United Kingdom, following the arrest of their former general secretary under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000. In 2017, Muhammad Rabbani was found guilty of obstructing police after he refused to divulge the passwords of his phone and computer to officers at Heathrow Airport. The group claimed the arrest was a result of racial profiling. The group’s director of outreach, Moazzam Begg, was a former Guantanamo Bay detainee who was released in 2005 following a pressure campaign from the British government despite objections from the Pentagon, which maintained that he was a dangerous terrorist. The Islamist group has also been subject to widespread criticism after they shot to public prominence in 2015 when they defended the Islamic State executioner Jihadi John, saying that he was as an “extremely kind, gentle, beautiful young man”. A spokesman for the group later doubled down on the controversy when he explained that “the concept of jihad is an important concept.” Loudspeaker Islamic Call to Prayer May Become Permanent Fixture in Britain https://t.co/rLL1qX57kx — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 25, 2020  Follow Kurt on Twitter at @KurtZindulka

Wednesday on Fox News, Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) argued against any efforts to bail out so-called blue states to help ease the burden of their liabilities as they tend to the coronavirus pandemic. According to Scott, many of the problems currently plaguing those states comes from their spending policies before the COVID 19 outbreak. He especially took exception to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s (D-NY) rhetoric promoting the idea of the bailout. “You know what’s un-American?” he said. “To keep borrowing so much money that your kids and your grandkids will have all this debt because we’re not fiscally responsible. I got elected when Gov. [Andrew] Cuomo got elected, back at the end of 2010. Both of our states had financial problems. He took a totally different tack. He’s borrowed money every year. He doesn’t pay down debt. I dropped about one-third of our state debt … I’ve cut taxes. And guess what — Cuomo is also mad because all of these businesses moved to Florida because they couldn’t afford to live there, and then the people moved here because they got sick and tired of his taxes, his regulation and his attitude.” “He doesn’t watch the money,” Scott continued. “And now he is tired of taxing his citizens, so he wants the citizens of Florida, including a whole bunch of New Yorkers who moved here to get away from him to pay for his excesses. I’m not going to have it. It’s not going to happen. It’s wrong. You look at places like California, Illinois and New Jersey with their unfunded pensions — why are Floridians responsible for these bad balance sheets?” Instead of more money allocated by the federal government, Scott argued there were other things for Congress to consider for recovery from the pandemic. “[A]t some point we have to say, ‘How much money can we all borrow because we know our kids and our grandkids are going to be paying for this?'” he said. “I think Leader [Mitch] McConnell is doing the right thing. Let’s look at what we’re doing. What can we do to help those unemployed? What can we do to help our small businesses? And what can we do to make sure lawyers aren’t just suing all of our businesses and preventing them from opening because they’re trying to comply with how do you keep people safe, and you have all these trial lawyers wanting to sue our businesses, and it is scaring the living daylights out of our businesses? You’ve got to have liability protection for our businesses and our first responders.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor

Data from the U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests that the novel coronavirus’s true fatality rate in the United States, which takes into account mild and asymptomatic cases, stands at 0.26 percent, about eight to 15 times lower than earlier mortality rate estimates of between two and four percent, which prompted the lockdowns. However, the true (or infection) mortality rate is more than double the flu’s 0.1 percent. The case (or crude) fatality rate only takes into account confirmed coronavirus cases, excluding people with mild or no symptoms that do not require medical attention. Meanwhile, the infection fatality rate (IFR) accounts for the estimated number of mild and asymptomatic cases. It tends to be lower than the crude fatality ratio because it shows that more people have contracted the virus without dying. The 0.26 percent mortality rate (about three in 1,000) linked to COVID-19, the disease produced by the coronavirus, is lower than the death rate predicted by the infamous Imperial College report and other assessments that prompted the lockdowns across America. Using data contained in a CDC report, last reviewed on May 20, Daniel Horowitz, a senior editor at Conservative Review (CR), noted in an editorial this month: For the first time, the CDC has attempted to offer a real estimate of the overall death rate for COVID-19, and under its most likely scenario, the number is 0.26%. Officials estimate a 0.4% fatality rate among those who are symptomatic and project a 35% rate of asymptomatic cases among those infected, which drops the overall infection fatality rate (IFR) to just 0.26% — almost exactly where Stanford researchers pegged it a month ago. … Ultimately, we might find out that the IFR is even lower because numerous studies and hard counts of confined populations have shown a much higher percentage of asymptomatic cases. Simply adjusting for a 50% asymptomatic rate would drop their fatality rate to 0.2% – exactly the rate of fatality Dr. John Ionnidis of Stanford University projected. Breitbart News and other analysts verified Horowitz’s calculations. 'Nuff Said….. pic.twitter.com/0nZsydNHNb — Ethical Skeptic ☀ (@EthicalSkeptic) May 22, 2020  The CDC data is consistent with other assessments. “By now, multiple studies from Europe, Japan, and the U.S. all suggest that the overall fatality rate is far lower than early estimates, perhaps below 0.1 to 0.4%, i.e., ten to forty times lower than estimates that motivated extreme isolation,” Dr. Scott Atlas, a senior fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution, told lawmakers in early May, referring to the infection rate. By taking into account mild and asymptomatic cases that were not clinically confirmed, some health analysts have determined that COVID-19 is more widespread but less deadly than early estimates suggested. Health experts have noted that the faster the disease spreads and hits its peak, the fewer people will die. In early March, the World Health Organization (W.H.O.), a United Nations component, explained the difference between the crude and infection mortality rates, noting: Mortality for COVID-19 appears higher than for influenza, especially seasonal influenza. While the true mortality of COVID-19 will take some time to fully understand, the data we have so far indicate that the crude mortality ratio (the number of reported deaths divided by the reported cases) is between 3-4%, the infection mortality rate (the number of reported deaths divided by the number of infections) will be lower. For seasonal influenza, mortality is usually well below 0.1%. In April, the CDC reportedly placed the crude fatality case at around four percent. Ultimately, the W.H.O. placed the globe’s crude mortality rate at 3.4 percent. Early in the outbreak, health officials, including Dr. Anthony Fauci from the White House Coronavirus Task Force, had concluded that the crude mortality stood at about two percent. Fauci is the top infectious disease expert in the United States. There is a patchwork of policies across the U.S. for how to count the number of coronavirus deaths, meaning that the total fatality figure could be higher or lower than the actual number, depending on the state.

The New York Times has removed a section of a story it published in April that falsely reported that a 26-year-old medical intern had died from coronavirus. The story, titled “I’m an E.R. Doctor in New York. None of Us Will Ever Be the Same. A Covid diary: This is what I saw as the pandemic engulfed our hospitals,” included the story of the young man’s death. On Tuesday, the Times ran an editor’s note dated May 26, 2020, explaining the error: An earlier version of this article described an account that circulated among doctors in April about a 26-year-old medical resident training in New York who was said to have died of Covid-19 in a New York City hospital. This account was verified with sources involved in the patient’s care, but further reporting after publication revealed that it was apparently a case of mistaken identity. According to a spokeswoman for the American College of Emergency Physicians, a 26-year-old man who died from complications related to coronavirus had the same name as a young medical resident at a different hospital. Health workers involved in the patient’s treatment mistakenly believed that he was a medical resident, but ACEP said it had subsequently confirmed that it was not the same man and that the medical resident with that name was healthy. The reference to that case has been removed from the article. So remember in April when The NY Times Magazine ran a cover story that was the diary of an ER doctor in NYC—and the piece reported on the death of a 26 year old doctor? Well, it turns out the doctor didn’t die—or even have covid. pic.twitter.com/3p1iTxZGTm — Zac Bissonnette (@ZacBissonnette) May 27, 2020  A screenshot of the article as it appears now online shows that the story was published on April 14, 2020, and updated May 27, 2020.

103-year-old Jennie Stejna defied the odds to beat the novel coronavirus on May 13 and treated herself to a victory bottle of Bud Light in celebration. “Hell yes,” Stejna told her grandson-in-law, Adam Gunn, when asked whether she was ready to go to Heaven. A brutal fight against the novel coronavirus looked grim, and her family was forced to say their goodbyes over the phone. And while Stejna did not specify when she wanted to go, the following days made it clear: Not yet. Stejna is a “hardcore Boston sports fan,” who “used to sit outside and listen to the Red Sox on the radio,” her family remembered. She also enjoys bingo, reading, and crochet, though the latter has become difficult due to arthritis. She has two children, three grandchildren, four great-grandchildren, and three great-great-grandchildren all rooting for her. Over a century old at 103, Stejna lost her husband in 1992. He was 82 years old. But she is still kicking and more than happy to take a victory lap. Staff brought her a cold bottle of Bud Light, a drink Stejna loves but has not been able to have in a long time. Shelley Gunn described her grandmother as having a “feisty spirit” — a sentiment echoed by her husband, Adam. Even so, the call they received on May 13 was a shocking surprise. “This feisty old Polish grandmother of ours officially beat the coronavirus,” Adam said. “We’re truly very thankful.”

Wednesday on CNN’s “Anderson Cooper 360,” presidential historian and network contributor Douglas Brinkley accused President Donald Trump of failing in his response to the coronavirus pandemic. Cooper said, “The president declared himself a wartime president. If you declare that and then you don’t follow through on it, and you have a huge death toll, I mean, do you think his legacy will be defined by his response to COVID?” Brinkley said, “I think it really will be. I mean, the big bell rang. We had the big crisis, one of the worst ever, and he basically went AWOL. He got in a denial mode, and then he worried about himself only.” He continued, “We look at presidents that we want to feel the empathy of an F.D.R. telling Depression people, ‘We have nothing to fear but fear itself,’ and pulling the country together. Or Ronald Regan after the Challenger disaster in 1986. Or Bill Clinton in Oklahoma City, on and on. There are all these great moments. Today should be a day of national mourning that we hit the 100,000-mark. He should be leading that, showing the open-heartedness of America, that there were mistakes, there were blunders. But instead, he refuses to have a heart, and that’s the part that makes me most sad about what’s happening here. It’s not just the bungled policies, bad decision-making, but it’s a president who doesn’t seem to ever be able to express love to people unless they’re ardent Trump supporters, and it makes him sort of a pathetic figure.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

CNN network president Jeff Zucker said in a company-wide memo Wednesday that “the majority” of CNN employees will not return to the network’s office this year due to health concerns stemming from the Chinese coronavirus, according to a report. Zucker wrote, as was first reported by The Hollywood Reporter: We expect that the majority of you will not be able to return to our offices this calendar year. What happens after that is still a question mark, as well. No doubt the world, and our understanding of the way COVID-19 continues to shape our lives and our work, will change countless times between now and then. But I know it is important as you all make decisions for your own lives and your families that you are equipped with the most honest and transparent information we can give you. Fifteen percent of CNN staffers are currently working from the office, while “a few more” plan to return over the coming weeks. Zucker wrote: When you consider physical distancing requirements, we simply cannot put the same number of people back into our workspaces that were there before the pandemic. So we need to make some tough decisions. We intend to spend the summer months hearing from all of you, and doing our best to balance the physical needs of our spaces with our production needs, as well as your preferences. And nothing happens without putting safety first. All of that will be taken into account as we make decisions about how and when we make the slow return back. Zucker’s Wednesday memo comes after he told CNN employees that most of them won’t come back to the office “in any significant way before the end of the summer.” Two CNN anchors, Chris Cuomo and Brooke Baldwin, have been infected and recovered from the coronavirus.

Michigan State University is set to resume in-person classes this fall and will also feature “enhanced” remote learning opportunities, according to an announcement from university President Samuel Stanley Jr. on Wednesday. In his announcement, Stanley said students will be allowed to return to campus for classes beginning on September 2, with certain modifications in place that will make the campus “look different from any previous semester at MSU.” Stanley said in an online letter sent to students, faculty, and staff: We recognize that some students may choose not to return to campus for health or other reasons, and we will endeavor to provide an enhanced selection of remote classes that allow them to begin or continue progress toward their Michigan State University degree. Stanley also stated that the university would offer online and remote opportunities, which will include the addition of “more hybrid classes” and resuming some “purely in-person options.” The university president also made it clear in his announcement that facial coverings and masks will be “essential components” of the school’s reopening. Stanley also suggested that large gatherings may be “strictly limited and regulated.” In-person instruction on the campus will conclude on November 25 and the following classes will transition to be finished online. After Thanksgiving break, Stanley said students will have the opportunity to move off campus or remain in their permanent residence. According to the university, the schedule shift was implemented due to the prediction of a surge of positive coronavirus cases this fall. Follow Kyle on Twitter @RealKyleMorris and Facebook.

Nine Republican senators are lobbying President Trump to import more foreign workers, claiming there are not enough qualified Americans to take jobs, even with more than 36 million out of work. While economists predict there may soon be 41 million unemployed Americans due to the Chinese coronavirus crisis, Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), John Cornyn (R-TX), Mike Crapo (R-ID), James Risch (R-ID), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Todd Young (R-IN), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), and James Lankford (R-OK) are asking Trump to continue an inflow of foreign workers to take agricultural and nonagricultural jobs. Specifically, the GOP senators say Trump must continue fast-tracking H-2A foreign agricultural workers and H-2B foreign nonagricultural workers into the U.S. and should allow businesses to exempt themselves from foreign worker restrictions so long as they claim they cannot find Americans to hire. The GOP senators write: The marked impact that the coronavirus has had on the job market is undeniable. Nearly 33 million Americans are unemployed, and close to eight million American small businesses are at risk of shuttering forever. Some of these struggling small businesses rely on labor that many Americans may not be qualified or able to perform, even in the aftermath of the pandemic, and some of these businesses operate in industry sectors that are not experiencing high unemployment … or in particular geographical locations where qualified labor is scarce. American businesses that rely on help from these visa programs should not be forced to close without serious consideration. Guest workers are needed to boost American business, not take American jobs. [Emphasis added] … Due to the temporary and seasonal nature of the work, it is exeedingly difficult to find American workers, even now, who wish to work only on a temporary basis. Many of the jobs lost since March are not temporary or seasonal. Much of the furloughed or laid off workforce are likely looking to return to the jobs they were forced to leave … we are afraid the unemployment insurance compensation included in the CARES Act has created a disincentive for many American furloughed or laid off workers from finding new jobs, especially those seasonal or temporary in nature. [Emphasis added] As the GOP senators lobby Trump to import more foreign workers during mass unemployment, grassroots organizations representing American workers and college students are asking the president to halt foreign worker visa programs to ensure scarce jobs go to unemployed Americans. Between the H-2A visa program for foreign agricultural workers and the H-2B visa program for foreign nonagricultural workers, more than 350,000 additional blue-collar foreign workers are imported to the U.S. labor market annually. Despite this year’s record unemployment, hundreds of thousands of H-2A and H-2B foreign workers are expected to take American jobs. For some time, the H-2B visa program has been used by businesses to bring in cheaper foreign workers and has contributed to blue-collar Americans having their wages undercut.

The South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported on Wednesday that the Democrat governor of Washington state, Jay Inslee, wrote a personal letter to Chinese dictator Xi Jinping in early April asking China to use its “enormous productive capacity” to provide “critically needed medical supplies” including masks, gloves, and gowns.  According to the SCMP, Washington “ultimately received donations of an unspecified quantity of supplies from several Chinese government and private sources.” Inslee’s letter to Xi, never before disclosed to the public, was uncovered by the SCMP with a public records request. The April 2 letter began with Inslee telling the authoritarian Chinese ruler than he made “many friends in the state of Washington” during his “historic visit in 2015” and now they needed Xi’s help with the coronavirus. “Your experience in successfully managing the progression of the disease has provided us with many important lessons and has helped us to mitigate the impact of the disease on our people,” Inslee told Xi. “While these lessons have helped us significantly in blunting this outbreak, it is still having a very serious impact on the state. We are facing extreme challenges in finding the supplies and equipment necessary to protect our health care workers and treat our patients.” The SCMP noted, as Inslee did not, that one reason Washington had so much trouble obtaining supplies was that “Beijing had tightened its vetting of exports of medical supplies, resulting in major delays of shipments of personal protective equipment to the United States.” “Beijing’s heightened screening followed complaints by some governments and hospitals that large quantities of PPE sent from China were below acceptable standards,” the SCMP further noted, alluding to substandard or useless equipment delivered by Chinese suppliers to countries around the globe.  Inslee’s letter continued with lavish praise for Xi’s handling of the coronavirus, which Inslee saw as such a smashing success that Beijing could surely afford to send some masks, gowns, gloves, and testing supplies to the Pacific Northwest. “In reviewing the global progression of COVID-19, we note that the situation in China has essentially stabilized due to your government’s leadership,” Inslee wrote. “I am asking you to consider allowing Washington State to access the enormous productive capacity of China to obtain critically needed medical supplies.” Behind the scenes, the SCMP said Inslee’s plea to Xi was brokered with the help of a naturalized American citizen from China named Qiang Wan, a Washington state-based software entrepreneur who chairs the nonprofit Tsinghua GIX Institute North America. The institute was created as a joint project by Microsoft, the University of Washington, and Xi’s alma mater Tsinghua University, which Inslee mentioned in his letter. Wan himself has been in Beijing since embarking on a business trip there in December. Tsinghua, located in suburban Beijing, was founded by Americans in 1911 to help prepare Chinese students who planned to study at schools in the United States, so it has long played a major role in U.S.-Chinese relations in addition to being one of China’s most prestigious universities. “Wan, whose father served as the Chinese ambassador to Morocco in the late 1980s and early 1990s, said he had been moved to act after watching the virus take hold in his home state while in China on business. Washington state, which has recorded about 19,500 coronavirus cases and 1,000 deaths, ultimately received donations of an unspecified quantity of supplies from several Chinese government and private sources following the letter appealing directly to Xi,” the SCMP reported. Wan wrote an email to Inslee’s office in March that was also obtained by the SCMP in which he expressed concern about the coronavirus outbreak in Washington, acknowledged political tensions between China and the United States, and hoped Tsinghua University could “help [Washington] State secure much-needed medical supplies and equipment.” China’s ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, swiftly wrote a letter to Inslee acknowledging that Xi had received his request for aid and “directed relevant government departments of China to provide needed assistance and facilitation.” Inslee, formerly a candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, is not the only U.S. governor to seek Chinese assistance with the coronavirus. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) in April praised the Chinese Communist government for sending 1,000 ventilators to his state amid a bitter feud between Cuomo and President Donald Trump.

During a press conference on Wednesday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo (D) said that the “obligation is on the nursing home” to say they can’t accept people who have tested positive for the coronavirus. Cuomo said that he has “always followed CDC guidance.” And “I think the rule that you can’t discriminate against a COVID patient is right.” He continued, “That doesn’t mean the nursing home has to accept a COVID-positive patient. They conflate those two things. I understand because politically, facts don’t matter…but because you can’t discriminate doesn’t mean you have to accept. Actually, the law is the opposite. You cannot accept a patient at a nursing home unless you can fully and adequately treat that patient. So, you can’t accept a COVID patient — COVID-positive patient, unless you can isolate and quarantine and have the staff. Unless you can do all that, you cannot accept that person. And the nursing home — the obligation is on the nursing home to say, I can’t take a COVID-positive person. I’m too crowded. I’m too busy. I don’t have enough PPE. Whatever the answer is. It doesn’t even matter. It’s — if they say, I can’t take the person, they can’t take the person. So, that’s how it works. It doesn’t mean they discriminate against the COVID-positive person. They just say, I can’t handle the person.” (h/t Harry Siegel) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

24-year-old Tian Yuxi of Wuhan, China, was killed by the coronavirus in early February. According to the Epoch Times, her mother Yang Min was arrested two weeks ago for accusing the Chinese government of being responsible for her death. Yang Min was reportedly dragged away from the Wuhan municipal complaints office on May 11 by four unidentified men because she arrived to file her complaint carrying signs that read, “Injustice,” “Give Me Back My Daughter,” and “The Government Conceals the Truth About the Epidemic.” Yang told the Epoch Times the heart of her complaint is that the Chinese government concealed the extent and lethality of the Wuhan coronavirus epidemic, so Tian went to the Wuhan Union Hospital for an unrelated matter without realizing how dangerous it was. Tian contracted the coronavirus while in the hospital and died there on February 6.  “If we had known about this virus, we would not have gone to the hospital and my child would not have left,” Yang said. Yang said she wants the officials responsible for hiding the truth of the epidemic to be investigated and charged with crimes against humanity if appropriate. The Chinese government is highly unlikely to consider it appropriate. The New York Times reported in early May that Yang was not alone in demanding accountability from the Chinese government, but most of the other Chinese citizens brave enough to complain about relatives who died in China’s brutal quarantine zones or were turned away from hospitals have been intimidated out of pressing their cases. Human rights activist Yang Zhanqing said some of the families he is working with were threatened into silence by the police, lawyers have been pressured into dropping their cases, and “volunteers who tried to thwart the state’s censorship apparatus by preserving reports about the outbreak have disappeared.” “They are worried that if people defend their rights, the international community will know what the real situation is like in Wuhan and the true experiences of the families there,” said Yang, who fled to New York after he himself was pressured by the Chinese police.  Zhang Hai, whose father contracted a lethal case of coronavirus in a Wuhan hospital just like Yang Min’s daughter, said Chinese newspapers have been forced to spike interviews they conducted with him, and even his attempt to crowdfund a monument to victims of the epidemic has been censored. The Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) determination to erase the true history of the coronavirus is so intense that people who were building archives of censored news reports have warned each other to erase everything on their computers before they get arrested. Victim support groups have been forced to disband and public mourning of the coronavirus dead has been discouraged, in part, because the government wants to conceal the true number of infections and deaths, say families. “If anyone dares to make a request and the government fails to meet it, they immediately are seen as a threat to national security It doesn’t matter whether you’re a lawyer or a victim, it’s like you’re imprisoned,” warned Chen Jiangang, one of the bereaved family members working with Yang Zhanqing. 

Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Rebecca Dallet, who argued that Democrat Gov. Tony Evers’ “Safer at Home” order should remain in place, spent Memorial Day weekend boating and surrounded by friends. Dallet, who joined Justices Ann Walsh Bradley and Brian Hagedorn, dissented from the state Court’s decision on May 13 to remove the “Safer at Home” order, which was originally set to expire on May 26. Dallet noted in her dissent that “Wisconsinites will pay the price” for the Court lifting the order two weeks early, while she and another family teamed up for a boating trip two days before the order was set to expire. Photos from the outing were shared to Facebook by one of Dallet’s friends and revealed that social distancing measures were not implemented on the small boat. As noted by News/Talk 1130 WISN, the friend who uploaded the photo to Facebook used a ‘Stay Home, Save Lives’ border on her profile picture.” Had the “Safer at Home” order still been in place, which is what Dallet wanted, she could have been held legally responsible and face 30 days in jail and/or $250 in fines because the order outlawed gatherings of people who do not live in the same home. A photo from the excursion, shared to Facebook, was uploaded by News/Talk 1130 WISN and can be seen here. Follow Kyle on Twitter @RealKyleMorris and Facebook.

The nation’s capital will begin a phased reopening on Friday, announced Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser on Wednesday, citing a 14-day decline in Chinese coronavirus community spread and sufficient hospital capacity, among other metrics the city must meet to reopen. D.C. is basing its 14-day decline in community spread on a five-day average, given that the number of cases fluctuates day by day. On Wednesday, Bowser told reporters: Today, I will be signing a mayor’s order that will lift the stay-at-home order. Beginning Friday, May 29, we will move into Phase One of reopening. So I want to clarify this, COVID-19 [the disease produced by the coronavirus] is still in our community, and our region and our nation and the public health emergency will continue. Gatherings of more than ten people are still prohibited. Starting Friday, the mayor will allow non-essential retail businesses to operate only with curbside and front-door or delivery; haircuts by appointments and with stations six feet apart; outdoor seating at restaurants in addition to takeout, delivery, and grab and go; the reopening of dog parks, golf courses, parks, tennis courts, as well as tracks and fields; and allow health care providers to continue or resume offering elective surgeries. 1/ We have reached our sustained, 14-day decrease in community spread. pic.twitter.com/bP8srfskZT — Mayor Muriel Bowser #StayHomeDC (@MayorBowser) May 27, 2020    3/ Effective Friday: nonessential retail businesses can operate with curbside, front-door or delivery. pic.twitter.com/7wyZVFHCQY — Mayor Muriel Bowser #StayHomeDC (@MayorBowser) May 27, 2020  5/ In addition to takeout, delivery, and grab and go, restaurants with outdoor seating can begin using that space. pic.twitter.com/nohFQg5ycE — Mayor Muriel Bowser #StayHomeDC (@MayorBowser) May 27, 2020  7/  Health care providers may continue to offer or resume offering elective surgeries. pic.twitter.com/N1Ir1TDKYY — Mayor Muriel Bowser #StayHomeDC (@MayorBowser) May 27, 2020  Dr. LaQuandra Nesbitt, director of the D.C. Department of Health (DOH), told reporters: As the stay-at-home order … is being replaced with the mayor’s order today, we still want people to be judicious around the types of activities that they are participating in. It is still favorable for us as a city, if people focus on participating in the essential activities that they have previously been engaging in and using good judgment when utilizing the non-essential activities that have been highlighted today. The health department director urged people to avoid contact with members of high-risk communities, like seniors, if they do go out and engage in non-essential activities. Bowser cautioned that the number of COVID-19 infections would likely increase as the more people venture outside when the city reopens Friday. “I want to make sure that we all understand that moving into Phase One means that more people can get infected because now more people will be moving around in the community,” the mayor warned. However, Bowser noted that D.C. is ready to deal with a potential spike in cases after it reopens. “We have put in place the hospital capacity, built up our PPE [Personal Protective Equipment] supply, and added new contact tracers,” she said. Asked about returning to lockdown if the coronavirus conditions worsen after reopening, Bowser said she does not “anticipate going back.” “DOH will continue to monitor the spread of the virus in the district, and this order [to reopen] can be turned up or turned down, or there could be [specific] activities that we know need to be changed, and we can change it by order,” she added. According to data from the mayor’s office, there have been sufficient days of a low COVID-19 transmission rate to reopen the city. Moreover, D.C. can test all priority groups, as mandated by the district’s reopening guidelines. Currently, the city can test 5,500 people per day, Bowser told reporters on Wednesday. The district also has an adequate capacity to contact trace all new cases and their close contacts, information from the mayor’s office revealed. Bowser urged people to continue wearing masks, social distancing, and practicing good hygiene as the city reopens. “Every single one of us has a role to play in protecting ourselves and each other,” she noted, later adding, “We have a shared responsibility to stop the spread of the virus.” The mayor also encouraged the federal government and private companies to allow people to continue teleworking when possible during Phase One. Monday was D.C.’s first day with no new coronavirus deaths since March. The following day, there were five new COVID-19 deaths, bringing the cumulative total to 445 since the district confirmed its first case on March 7. D.C. continues to see an increase in the cumulative number of new positive cases, which currently stands at 8,406, about 20 percent of the total 42,697 tested in the city, data from the mayor’s office showed.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said during a press conference on Wednesday that “every crisis” is an opportunity to advance a leftist agenda. “We have to open the economy, we have to do so in a way that gives more opportunity for access to care, to credit, to opportunity,” Pelosi said during a press conference regarding her coronavirus phase four bill, the HEROES Act. “Just as Mr. Clyburn said, this is an opportunity, every crisis is,” Pelosi added. The House leader referenced U.S. House Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-SC), who said before the passage of the $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill in March that the bill was a “tremendous opportunity to restructure things to fit our vision.” Pelosi rebuked media reports that the HEROES Act was partisan. “Nobody said that when Mitch McConnell put forth his bill, CARES one,” she said. House Democrats passed the $3 trillion, 1,815-page leftist Heroes Act in May, which many House Democrats reportedly admitted serves as more of a “policy wishlist” than a bill to alleviate the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Politico wrote: Privately, several House Democrats concede their latest bill feels like little more than an effort to appease the most liberal members of the caucus, many of whom were chafed that their most important priorities were minimized or ignored entirely in previous coronavirus negotiations. The Heroes Act contains many leftist provisions, including: Meanwhile, the California Democrat claimed the Heroes Act is “disciplined, focused, necessary.” Sean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News.

TEL AVIV – Israeli scientists have discovered that two drugs for treating Gaucher’s disease are also effective against the coronavirus, the Defense Ministry said Tuesday.  Scientists at the Israel Institute for Biological Research (IIBR) tested an analogue of the FDA-approved drug Cerdelga, and an analogue of a second drug, Venglustat, which is currently in the advanced stage of clinical trials, a statement from the ministry said, adding the drugs could act as a broad-spectrum antiviral therapy in a second coronavirus wave. IIRB’s study found “antiviral treatment using both drugs led to a significant reduction in the replication capacity of the coronavirus and to the destruction of the infected cell. The decrease in virus replication prevents further cell damage following infection,” the statement said. The drugs were also found to be effective against other virus strains, including influenza and West Nile fever. The Defense Ministry-run lab has also completed its clinical trials of the specific compounds in question, making it market-ready in the coming weeks. Earlier this month, IIBR made a breakthrough development in isolating an antibody that neutralizes the COVID-19 virus. The drug would also act to combat people already with the disease and not as inoculation.

Princeton University professor and MSNBC contributor Eddie Glaude, Jr. said Wednesday on his network that Americans need to understand “profoundly racist our country is.” Discussing the death of George Floyd after a police officer knelt on his neck in Minneapolis, Glaude said, “I think it’s pretty much common knowledge in the United States that we have multiple Americas, and that is evidenced in the way in which those Americas are policed. People need — the video exposes a kind of willful ignorance. It provides light on the shadow against the idea of innocence of the country. But I think there’s an intimate knowledge around the country that there are two Americas, that police don’t value the lives of black folk. When you look at the face of that officer, he doesn’t seem to assume that he has his knee on the neck of a human being. He’s with his hand in his pocket. He doesn’t hear him call out for his mother. He doesn’t hear him crying. So this is the America we live in. We just need to confront it honestly.” He continued, “We have to finally be honest with ourselves. We talked about this when this happened with El Paso. We have to understand how profoundly racist our country is and how it shapes the very ways in which communities are policed. That doesn’t lead to an indictment of each individual, but it gets us to the systemic nature of inequality.” He added, “You have a community that’s experiencing trauma and terror simultaneously. Minnesota just hit its peak with COVID-19 yesterday in terms of the number of hospitalizations and the number of dead. African-Americans in Minnesota are disproportionately impacted by Coronavirus. So we’re dealing with the devastation of this pandemic, and we’re seeing Ahmaud Arbery, we’re seeing Breonna Taylor, we’re seeing George Floyd. COVID has changed, in some ways, arrested so much of what the country has been doing about the business as usual, except killing black folk, except the devaluation of black folk.” He concluded, “When you see the police response to white protesters clamoring to open up the economy coming into the state capitol in Michigan, spitting and getting in the face of police, having a gun on their side, refusing to have their arms locked into handcuffs. They’re so patient and restrained. Here we are responding to the fact that this man treated George Floyd like an animal. What do we get? Rubber bullets, teargas, and the like. More than two Americans, Nicolle. This is the ugly underside of who we are.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

An incredible 43 percent of coronavirus deaths occurred in nursing homes and assisted-living facilities (ALF), reports Forbes. The 2.1 million Americans who live in nursing homes and ALFs represent just 0.62 percent of the population, but a staggering 43 percent of America’s coronavirus deaths. Forbes adds that this is almost certainly an undercount: States like New York exclude from their nursing home death tallies those who die in a hospital. Outside of New York, more than half of all deaths from COVID-19 are of residents in long-term care facilities., even if they were originally infected in an assisted living facility. In other words, if you remove New York from the tally, the percentage of American nursing home deaths jumps to over 50 percent. In Minnesota, the number is a breathtaking 81.4 percent. Washington State: 61.1 percent. Pennsylvania: 69.2 percent. Ohio: 70 percent. Virginia: 62.8 percent. North Carolina: 63.3 percent. Massachusetts: 61.9 percent. New Hampshire: 69.8 percent. Michigan, which like New York and New Jersey, forced nursing homes to accept patients still infected with the coronavirus, and is refusing to release its number of nursing home deaths. Gee, I wonder why. Florida, a state the corporate media have relentlesslyand falsely smeared as irresponsible over its refusal to institute these stupid one-size-fits-all lockdowns, has one of the lowest percentages of nursing home deaths: 43.5 percent — which is even more impressive considering Florida’s abnormally large senior population. Forbes says the contrast between New York and Florida is no accident: Contrast the decisions by governors like Cuomo with those of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. In Florida, all nursing home workers were required to be screened for COVID-19 symptoms before entering a facility. On March 15, before most states had locked down, DeSantis signed an executive order that banned nursing home visitations from friends and family, and also banned hospitals from discharging SARS-CoV-2-infected patients into long-term care facilities. Compare that policy to that of Govs. Andrew Cuomo (D-NY), Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI), and Phil Murphy (D-NJ), who would not even allow nursing homes to turn down an infected patient. Here’s what we know… If you are under 50, the fatality rate for the coronavirus is just 0.1 percent, or 1 in 1000, which is the same as the everyday flu. If you are over the age of 80, your chances of dying are about 150 times worse — 150 out of 1000, or 15 percent. But what did we do to those who were no more at risk of dying of the coronavirus than they were of the flu? We locked them down, and by extension took them out of their schools, shuttered their businesses, and destroyed some 40 million jobs. Yes, we shattered tens of millions of lives over a virus that is no more lethal than the seasonal flu if you are under 50. But we didn’t stop there, did we? Oh, no… Retirees, those who are no longer working, those who are most susceptible to the coronavirus — instead of locking them down away from the coronavirus, Democrat governor after Democrat governor after Democrat governor mandated that the infection be poured directly into the very  facilities that house those most at risk. And it’s not as if these Democrat governors did not know this. By the time the virus hit America, we already knew this was a virus that devastated seniors, especially seniors in nursing homes. We learned that from Italy. Think about that… We’re hit with a virus that primarily kills retirees, so the government locked up all the students and working people who aren’t at any real risk, and then forced infection into the homes of retirees who are. Imagine how different everything would look had these states protected their seniors. Imagine how much lower the death count would be. Imagine how much lower the infection and fatality rates would be… Imagine how many fewer lives would have been shattered had we been guided by the science instead of panic — had we not locked down those who were never in any real danger… What a debacle. As far as domestic policy goes, the government reaction to the coronavirus is the biggest and most deadly debacle in American history.   Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

The policy director of the Foundation for Government Accountability (FGA) wrote Tuesday that some business owners are having difficulty “reopening” their doors because their employees would rather collect funds through the Payroll Protection Program (PPP). In a column at the Washington Examiner, Sam Adolphsen observed business owners he spoke to in Camden, Maine, said their employees were receiving nearly $1,000 a week for not working through the CARES Act’s PPP coronavirus relief measure. "Business owners across the country are lamenting that people are not coming back to their jobs, even when offered. For small businesses able to survive the quarantine, more will need to be done to get their workers off welfare and back in the workforce" https://t.co/vwCXvP74OQ — The FGA (@TheFGA) May 27, 2020  “It’s a confusing and concerning problem for these business owners because they took the Paycheck Protection Program funds that were supposed to help them keep employees on the payroll,” Adolphsen wrote, citing a report released in early May by the Heritage Foundation that found the unemployment benefits in the $2.2 trillion CARES Act are actually creating devastating consequences for the U.S. economy. “Instead of bridging the gap, excessive unemployment payments will only increase the breadth and depth of the economic downturn,” research fellow Rachel Greszler wrote in her report, urging Congress to “fix” the CARES Act legislation so that no more than 100 percent of a worker’s prior wages would be provided through the emergency relief program. With up to 14 million jobs on the line and as much as $1.5 trillion in lost output, Congress should fix this disastrously flawed provision by capping total unemployment benefits at no more than 100% of workers previous wages. https://t.co/L6AuWvORmh — Heritage Foundation (@Heritage) May 2, 2020  Adolphsen explained further: Business owners across the country are lamenting that people are not coming back to their jobs, even when offered. For small businesses able to survive the quarantine, more will need to be done to get their workers off welfare and back in the workforce. It’s going to require thoughtful action from state and federal leaders, as well as strict enforcement of existing laws regarding unemployment benefits. Thankfully, some of the nation’s governors are making bold and commonsense moves to address the three-headed monster of a health crisis, budget woes, and businesses on the brink of extinction. Adolphsen praised Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), who fast-tracked COVID-19 protection for vulnerable nursing home residents, and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R), who came to the aid of healthcare workers by easing regulations and introducing more flexibility in the delivery of their services. Without Congress’s intervention to fix the CARES Act flaw, however, the nation is experiencing welfare on steroids. Adolphsen wrote: Congress created this problem, in large part, by adding a $600 per week unemployment benefit on top of the usual benefit so that many made significantly more money staying at home than they made while working. This is the perfect storm for wide-scale unemployment fraud and abuse. He applauded the courageous acts of those governors, including Kim Reynolds (R-IA), Phil Scott (R-VT), and Mike Parson (R-MO), who are asserting that workers who refuse to return to their jobs will no longer be eligible for unemployment benefits. “Reopening the economy only works if people return to work,” Adolphsen wrote.

Walt Disney World is planning on a phased reopening plan that would gradually open up its four parks in July, while SeaWorld Orlando plans to open its parks in June. Disney World plans to reopen the Magic Kingdom and the Animal Kingdom on July 11, and open Epcot and Hollywood Studios by July 15, Disney announced Wednesday. SeaWorld Orlando proposed reopening its three parks, including Aquatica and Discovery Cove, to the public by June 11 — about three weeks away, interim CEO Marc Swanson announced Wednesday. Gov. Ron DeSantis said each of the theme parks needs approval from the county before they can move forward with the reopening process, and approve of their plans. Both theme parks presented their reopening plans before the Orange County Economic Recovery Task Force, a panel of community and business leaders. The board unanimously approved of both of their plans. Both Disney and SeaWorld said guests and employees would have to wear masks and undergo temperature checks, and there would be some significant changes made throughout the park to promote social distancing and encourage hand-washing among park guests and employees. Swanson said masks would be required for guests ages two and older, temperature checks would be mandatory, and there would be a limit to how many guests who could use the pools and rivers. Hand sanitizer would also be available at the entrance and exits of each attraction. SeaWorld’s parks will open June 10 privately for an employee appreciation night the night before its set to open to the public, Swanson said. Disney visitors will also have to wear masks and undergo temperature checks, but the parks will provide masks for guests who do not bring their own. Disney cast members will enforce the rules as part of a “social distancing squad,” which had already received positive results when they made their debut in the Disney Springs retail area, said Jim McPhee, senior vice president of operations for Walt Disney World. Park attractions would also be limited, and not all attractions would open at once. Disney, SeaWorld, and Universal Orlando in Florida have been closed since March due to the coronavirus pandemic. Their decision to close was to stem the transmission of the coronavirus. Both SeaWorld and Disney, if approved by DeSantis, will follow the opening of Universal Orlando, which plans on opening June 5, the Tallahassee Democrat reported.

Washington State University (WSU) is working to provide “emergency” funding for illegal alien students in the wake of the Chinese virus pandemic. The publicly-funded university has partnered with a student activist group to help illegal alien students get “emergency” financial assistance in response to the Wuhan virus, according to a report by the school’s student newspaper, the Daily Evergreen. The report added that aside from emergency funds in response to the Chinese virus, the money will also go toward “the DACA renewal fund, and the scholarship fund,” and that the funds are available to all illegal WSU students, “even if they are non-DACA recipients.” The funds are being offered by WSU’s “Undocumented Initiatives Office” and the Crimson Group, the student organization working with the school to allocate the money toward illegal immigrant students. The Crimson Group describes itself as “an activist and support group for undocumented students and allies at Washington State University Pullman and the Palouse community,” according to the group’s Facebook page. “The federal government said the money going to universities and states for COVID relief will not be eligible for undocumented students,” said Linda Vargas, WSU’s Undocumented Inititatives ambassador and sophomore environmental science major. “So this is just another way that they can access funds and be able to afford their living expenses and pay their rent during these times,” she added. While it remains unclear whether or not taxpayer dollars are being provided for illegal immigrant students via this specific initiative alongside the Crimson Group, taxpayer dollars in Washington State are in fact available to illegal alien students through a state aid program called the Washington Application for State Financial Aid. The university describes the Washington Application for State Financial Aid as an entity that enables illegal immigrant students “to be considered for the Washington College Grant and for aid awarded by WSU.” Washington State University did not immediately respond to Breitbart News’ request for clarification on whether taxpayer dollars are being distributed to illegal aliens through this new initiative at the university.

Wednesday on CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” hosts Joe Kernen and Andrew Ross Sorkin battled over the stock market volatility amid the coronavirus pandemic. Kernen said, “Still looking at the coincidence and laggard indicator. For a while, it was how can stocks be where they are because of oil prices, remember that was your take then. How can it be based on where interest rates are right now. Every single discussion you had over the weekend is about how can stock prices be here when it is your earnings are here. Can you see how it isn’t the stuff in your face?” Sorkin said, “That’s the question there are a lot of smart people who have that view.” Kernen said, “Why is that the smart people? They’ve been wrong for 35 percent. Why are they smart? Just because they can see what’s right in front of their nose? That doesn’t make them smart! It makes them not savvy about the market!” Sorkin shot back, “Joe, Joe, Joe, you missed it a hundred percent on the way down too! You missed it 100 percent on the way down! And you missed 100,000 deaths.” As Kernen tried to respond, Sorkin said, “Hold on, hold on, hold on. I’m not going to do this with you, Joe. Every morning you try to question the questions I’m asking.” After some back and forth, Sorkin said, “Go ahead with the news!” Kernen said, “You panicked about the market, panicked about COVID, panicked about the ventilators, panicked about PPE, panicked about ever going out again. What good is it?” Sorkin interrupted, “Joseph, Joseph, you didn’t panic about anything! Joseph, 100,000 people died! One hundred thousand people died, Joe! And all you did was try to do was help your friend the president! That’s what you did! Every single morning on this show! Every single morning on this show! You used and abused your position, Joe!” Kernen shot back, “That’s totally unfair. I’m trying to help investors keep their cool. Keep their heads. And as it turned out, that’s what they should’ve done!” Sorkin said, “Do the news. Do the news.” Kernen said, “If they had listened to you, Andrew, we’re supposed to be at about 8,000.” Sorkin said, “I wasn’t arguing to go sell your stocks, Joseph! I was arguing about people’s lives! … Do the news, Joseph! I’m begging you! Do the news!” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

A copy of the since-canceled contact tracing contract Michigan Democrat Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s administration executed with a Democrat operative’s consulting firm, obtained exclusively by Breitbart News, shows the firm would have been paid to recruit 400 volunteers to collect medical information from state residents. The contract was signed April 20, 2020, between the Michigan Public Health Institute and Great Lakes Community Engagement, a nonprofit organization under the control of Mike Kolehouse, a Democrat campaign consultant. Great Lakes Community Engagement – Subcontract by Breitbart News on Scribd  Emails released on Tuesday show Whitmer’s team gave the “green light” to hire the firm, according to Bridge Magazine. “We got the green light from EOG [the executive office of the governor] to move forward with a slightly different organizational arrangement of the contact tracing volunteer work,” Andrea Taverna, a senior adviser at the Department of Health and Human Services, said in an email to other health department officials. “This would still be working with Mike Kolehouse, so work there isn’t lost — it’s just organized somewhat differently,” she wrote. Despite those statements, Whitmer’s office has sought to distance her from the arrangement. “When it was brought to my attention, I told them to cancel it,” Whitmer said during an April 22 press conference. She also defended the department, saying it “does not have a political bone in their theoretical body.” But no one has explained how Kolehouse, who has a long history of working exclusively for Democrat campaigns and progressive causes, came onto the scene to begin with. Janice Kidd, finance and budget manager at the Michigan Public Health Institute, signed the agreement. Kidd has not responded to Breitbart News about who authorized her to sign the document. The contract laid out personnel and a payment schedule. “The staff overseeing these programs will consist of the Owner/Operator, Director of Operations, and a 16-person management team. The management team includes two Project Managers and 14 Volunteer Managers who will each oversee approximately 400 volunteers,” it read. Initial Payment: The first 4 weeks of services of $64,500, plus the cost of an estimated 50 shifts ($17,500), for a total invoice amount of $82,000. Once invoiced, the first payment will be due on May 1st. Final Payment: The last 4 weeks of service will be based on shifts used in the previous month, subcontractor will adjust the bill accordingly. The invoice will include $86,000 for 4 weeks of management, plus the cost of an estimated 75 shifts ($26,250) for a total of $112,250. Once invoiced, the second payment will be due on June 1st. Total payments from MPHI to the Subcontractor under this Agreement, shall not exceed the sum of ONE HUNDRED NINETY-FOUR THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY and 00/100 DOLLARS ($194,250.00). MPHI shall make payments to Subcontractor within forty-five (45) days after receipt by the Business Office of an invoice that has been approved by the project coordinator indicating the amount due and the subcontract reference number. The contract also included a two-and-a-half page exhibit detailing privacy requirements due to the sensitivity of the medical information volunteers would be obtaining. The agreement also included a “Stop Work Order” provision, which was invoked the following day after media scrutiny in a letter to Kolehouse: The Michigan Department of Health & Human Services (MDHHS) has requested that the Michigan Public Health Institute (MPHI) issue a Stop Work Order to Great Lakes Community Engagement for work on project N-80007. Consequently, per Section 19 of your agreement, this letter serves as your Stop Work Order notification. All work must stop immediately on this project, effective April 21, 2020. Stop Work Order 4.21.2020 by Breitbart News on Scribd  Kolehouse has not commented on the matter. Kyle Olson is a reporter for Breitbart News.

A new poll suggests that the majority of college students do not think they will contract the Chinese virus by the end of the year. Only four percent of respondents said that they had already tested positive for the virus. According to a report by The College Fix, a poll revealed that a majority of college students do not think they will contract the Chinese virus by the end of the year. Of the 1,000 college students polled from around the nation, only 34 percent said that they believe they will be infected with the virus this year. The poll, which was conducted by College Pulse, revealed that Democratic students are more likely to believe they will contract the virus. Although 39 percent of Democratic students said they think they will become infected, only 27 percent of Republican students agreed. Some students argued that it is likely that many Americans will contract the virus if immunity isn’t achieved through a vaccine or a sufficient number of cases. “Until there’s a vaccine or enough people have had it to provide herd immunity, everyone is gonna get it unless they continue living in quarantine,” a student from Rowan University said. “Working in a hospital, my contact with possibly infected individuals that aren’t showing signs is high, especially since the tests take a while to come back with positives or negatives,” one student from the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga said. Some students claim that the lockdowns are causing more harm than the virus itself. One comment on the survey noted that domestic abuse, sexual assault, and suicide have all risen during the lockdowns. “OPEN AMERICA NOW!!! The stay at home order will do more damage than the virus itself … abuse, sexual assault, alcoholism, depression, and suicide just to name a few have all gone up rapidly,” a student at the Indiana University of Pennsylvania said. Stay tuned to Breitbart News for more campus updates.

The European Commission has proposed a massive €750 billion (£673bn/$825bn) Wuhan coronavirus bailout package as many across Europe have begun to question the European Union itself. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the coronavirus bailout package in the European Parliament on Wednesday. It will consist of €500 billion in non-repayable grants and another €250 billion in loans backed by bonds. “Today we are experiencing our own defining moment,” von der Leyen told the parliament and claimed the measures would be an investment in future generations, Die Welt reports. Economists Predict Potential End of the Euro Due to #Coronavirus https://t.co/VpZL1QJmhs — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 29, 2020  “This is Europe’s moment. Our willingness to act must keep pace with the challenges we all face,” she added, claiming that European countries would not be able to solve the coronavirus economic impact on their own. “What started with a virus so small your eyes couldn’t see it, has become an economic crisis so big that you simply cannot miss it,” she added. The plan comes just a week after a €500 billion bailout deal was proposed by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron. Not all member states are pleased with the proposal, which could reach up to a trillion euros in the coming years. Austria, Denmark, Sweden, and the Netherlands, which have been described as the “frugal four”, have come out against the idea of giving away cash to member states without seeking repayment. Experts Say German Court Decision Could End the Euro Currency https://t.co/e2pov7YFJX — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 21, 2020  The bailout package comes after many experts and economists have warned that both the euro currency and the European Union itself faced an existential risk over coronavirus due to a lack of solidarity from wealthier member states in the north towards poorer southern states more affected by the coronavirus. Italy, one of the countries hardest hit by cases and deaths relating to the virus, saw a wave of anti-EU sentiment in the early days of the crisis, leading polls to show nearly half of Italians thought their country would be better off outside of the EU. Another poll released this week by Redfield & Wilton Strategies has revealed that Euroscepticism has spread to Germany and France, as well. The poll found that 61 per cent of Italians said the coronavirus pandemic had weakened the case for the existence of the European Union, with 47 per cent of French and 40 per cent of Germans expressing the same view. A majority of respondents in all three nations also agreed that the EU had not done enough to help their respective countries battle against the spread of the Chinese virus. A majority, an average of two-thirds, also agreed strong national borders were important to secure their countries, a major blow to the EU’s free movement principles and the Schengen agreement which celebrated its 25th anniversary this year as most borders were closed.

Democrat governors are encouraging residents to wear masks during the coronavirus pandemic, describing it as a symbol or a sign of virtue. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) said Tuesday that wearing a mask during the coronavirus pandemic signified “strength.” “A face covering signifies strength and compassion for others,” Cooper said. “Wearing one shows that you care about other people’s health.” Cooper also expressed the sentiment on Twitter. A face covering signifies strength and compassion for others. Wearing one shows that you actually care about other people’s health. — Governor Roy Cooper (@NC_Governor) May 26, 2020  On Tuesday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) said that wearing a mask was “cool” and suggested he wanted to sign an executive order that said, “Wearing a mask is officially cool.” “Wearing a mask is now cool,” Cuomo said. “I believe it’s cool. … Wearing a mask is officially cool.” Dr. Anthony Fauci on Wednesday told CNN that wearing a mask was a “symbol.” “I want to protect myself and protect others, and also because I want to make it be a symbol for people to see that that’s the kind of thing you should be doing,” Fauci said, even though he reminded viewers that masks were “not 100 percent effective.” Former Vice President Joe Biden said that wearing a mask was a symbol of leadership. “What it presents and projects is leadership,” he said, berating President Trump for not wearing a mask. “Presidents are supposed to lead, not engage in folly and be falsely masculine.”

Recently Twitter added a “fact check” label to President Donald Trump’s tweets about the concerns surrounding mail-in voting fraud, but the social media site has failed to apply those same fact-checking measures to verified Chinese government accounts that spread coronavirus misinformation on the platform. Breitbart News recently reported on Twitter’s attempts to “fact check” President Trump, this time focusing on the President’s tweets discussing concerns surrounding mail-in voting fraud. Twitter chose to add its own personal “fact-check” to the President’s tweet, Breitbart News journalist Allum Bokhari outlined why this situation is unique in an article writing: Unlike Facebook, which gives itself plausible deniability for fact-checking bias by relying on “third party fact checkers” (almost all left-leaning) to pick and choose what to fact-check and what to ignore, Twitter made the decision to fact-check Trump’s tweet itself, linking to an official “moment” curated by Twitter employees and containing numerous articles from the mainstream media calling the president a liar. In a comment to Breitbart News, Twitter said there was no way for the President even to appeal the dubious “fact-check.” However, despite the “fact-checking” of President Trump by Twitter, the site has not applied the same standards to other governments and heads of state. In particular, the site has refused to remove or even fact-check posts from Chinese government officials spreading conspiracy theories suggesting that the Wuhan coronavirus actually originated in the United States. In March of this year, Breitbart News reported that Twitter refused to crack down on misinformation from Chinese officials, with the Daily Beast reporting: Coronavirus disinformation spread by senior Chinese government officials does not violate Twitter’s terms of service, a spokesperson for the company told The Daily Beast on Monday. The spokesperson pointed to language on its website, which gives wide latitude to statements from government officials. “Presently,” the company says, “direct interactions with fellow public figures, comments on political issues of the day, or foreign policy saber-rattling on economic or military issues are generally not in violation of the Twitter Rules.” Republican lawmakers Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE) and Rep. Mike Gallagher(R-WI) wrote a letter to Twitter’s CEO, Jack Dorsey, in March asking the CEO to crack down on Chinese propaganda on the site. The Senators stated in their letter: It is clear that Chinese Communist Party officials are using twitter to disseminate propaganda in the midst of a dangerous global crisis. Even worse, this propaganda obscures and confuses users over the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic and potentially undermines efforts to contain and control the outbreak. We believe this behavior more than warrants their removal from the platform. But just months later in May, Breitbart News reported that according to a study of data collected by the Hamilton 2.0 dashboard of the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a tool aggregating accounts connected to the Chinese government, the Chinese disinformation campaign had been ramped up. On May 8, the spokesperson for China’s Foreign Affairs Ministry posted a sweet that has been liked more than 4,000 times which reads: “The #US keeps calling for transparency & investigation. Why not open up Fort Detrick & other bio-labs for international review? Why not invite #WHO & int’l experts to the US to look into #COVI19 source & response?” The military houses and studies infectious diseases at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick, Maryland.

Why not invite #WHO & int'l experts to the US to look into #COVID19 source & response? — Hua Chunying 华春莹 (@SpokespersonCHN) May 8, 2020  It was estimated by Bret Schafer, the digital disinformation fellow at the alliance, that since the beginning of April more than 200 diplomatic and state-run media accounts had published more than 90,000 tweets in a massive Wuhan coronavirus information war. Schafer’s analysis estimated that Twitter output from China’s official sites had almost doubled since January with the number of diplomatic Twitter accounts tripling to 135 from 40 accounts at the same time last year. According to Schafer, the Chinese accounts “have become more aggressive, more conspiratorial, and the ones who have done that are their most popular accounts and have by far the most engagement.” Schafer stated that the Twitter account for the Chinese Embassy in France “has significantly more followers than the embassy in Poland, for example, because the embassy in France has been a driver of the most aggressive content.” On March 12, Zhao Lijian, the spokesman and deputy director of the Foreign Ministry’s Information Department, who has been one of China’s most prolific officials on Twitter, tweeted: “It might be the US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan.” A day later, Zhao tweeted that there was “Further evidence that the virus originated in the US.” This article is very much important to each and every one of us.

China has also previously rejected calls for an independent international investigation into the coronavirus outbreak, claiming that any demands for an inquiry are “politically motivated.” Despite all of this, Twitter has continued to refuse to fact-check tweets from Chinese government accounts, instead choosing to focus on President Trump’s concerns about mail-in voting fraud.

Michigan’s Democrat Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s decision to ban most residential construction during the coronavirus shutdown led to a 44 percent decline in Michigan construction jobs and contributed to her state’s second highest in the nation unemployment rate. Although unemployment rates rose in every state in April, three states stand out in particular: Nevada led the nation at 28.2 percent, followed by Michigan at 22.7, and Hawaii at 22.3. Michigan’s 22.7 percent jobless rate is the highest the state has registered since at least 1976, when comparable data was first tracked. The state’s previous high was 16.7 percent in December 1982 at the height of the 1980s auto downturn, making April’s numbers worse than the Great Recession of 2009 and likely the worst seen since the Great Depression nearly a century ago. The question is why was Michigan hit so hard in comparison to most of the nation. Nevada and Hawaii’s outlier jobless numbers are understandable. Both states rely heavily on the travel and tourism industry, which was hammered by the coronavirus pandemic even before government lockdown actions took effect. On March 17, both Hawaii and Nevada’s Democrat governors issued executive orders that shutdown their states’ leading source of revenue. Hawaii Gov. David Ige’s order urged tourists to “stay away” from the Aloha State, and Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak closed Las Vegas’ casinos, hotels, and entertainment venues. But Michigan’s economy does not rely on tourism, and although the state is home to the world’s automotive industry, the auto industry alone does not account for the Wolverine State’s outlier April unemployment numbers. The issue appears to be construction jobs, according to ZipRecruiter’s labor economist Julia Pollak. Construction jobs in Michigan fell by 44 percent in April, as compared to the national average of 13 percent, Pollak noted in a graph posted on social media. 2/ Michigan shut down construction when most states did not. As a result, construction employment fell by 44% (!) there, compared with only 13% nationwide, on average. — Julia Pollak (@juliaonjobs) May 24, 2020  3/ The state reopened construction in early May. Let's hope the industry bounces back. — Julia Pollak (@juliaonjobs) May 24, 2020  Whitmer’s original shutdown order, which took effect on March 24, deemed certain construction permissible, such as: [C]onstruction to maintain and improve roads, bridges, telecommunications infrastructure, and public health infrastructure (such as the creation or expansion of hospitals or other medical facilities to provide or support the provision of necessary care during the emergency). Construction workers may also undertake projects that are necessary to maintain the safety, sanitation, and essential operations of a residence during the emergency, including projects immediately necessary to restore the habitability of a residence. However, Whitmer’s order clearly stated that “[a]ny non-emergency maintenance or improvements to residences are not permitted.” That distinction effectively shut down a significant portion of Michigan’s construction industry. “She never closed down major construction like roadwork and large commercial projects during the pandemic,” one Metro Detroit area general contractor told Breitbart News. “So, you had road crews out there doing stuff. You had state construction projects.” The general contractor found the governor’s distinction between essential and non-essential construction to be arbitrary. “As a licensed electrician, I would be considered an essential worker if I got called to service someone’s house because they had no power,” the contractor said. “I’m allowed to go service that. But if I wanted to go to a remodeling project, I’m not allowed to do that. Tell me what the difference of the work site is? If I go to someone’s home to fix a power outage or if I go to their home that’s being remodeled, what’s the difference health-wise? And if I am going to a residence that is currently occupied and has someone who is infected living there, isn’t that a greater health risk than if I am going to work on a vacant house that’s being remodeled?” He feels that it was always possible to keep construction crews safe during the pandemic with face masks and basic social distancing. “When you’re framing something or hanging drywall, you’re not hugging each other. You’re standing within three, four, five, or six feet from each other at any given time. Now obviously, you use some common sense. If you’re not feeling well, you don’t come to work.” Roofers work on new housing construction in Oak Park, Michigan, on May 6, 2020, a day before Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s executive order allowed all construction to resume. (AP Photo/Carlos Osorio) Whitmer is not the only governor to halt residential construction due to the pandemic. New York’s Democrat Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s executive order also shut down “non-essential construction,” with an exception for “emergency construction,” which the order defined as “a project necessary to protect health and safety of the occupants, or to continue a project if it would be unsafe to allow to remain undone, but only to the point that it is safe to suspend work.” However, Cuomo’s order included a number of broad exemptions for “essential construction projects,” including construction on “roads, bridges, transit facilities, utilities, hospitals or healthcare facilities, homeless shelters, or public or private schools,” as well as work on “affordable housing” and any construction done by “a single worker who is the sole employee/worker on the job site.” A March 31 article in Curbed New York noted that Cuomo’s order essentially “puts the kibosh on entirely luxury residential and office construction, but still permits work on apartment buildings with a majority of market rate units.” That distinction still permitted a considerable amount of building in a state heavy with more apartment rental construction than single-family housing. According to U.S. Census Bureau data, the state of Michigan issued nearly 36 percent more building permits in 2019 for new single-unit residencies than the state of New York. Even still, the effect on construction jobs in New York was devastating. Like Michigan, construction jobs accounted for about 4 percent of all nonfarm jobs in New York at the start of the year. And construction employment fell about 41 percent. Overall nonfarm employment fell about 20 percent between February and April in New York. In Michigan, overall employment fell 23.5 percent. It is perhaps understandable that Whitmer and Cuomo took hardline shutdown stances, as both their states are epicenters for the coronavirus pandemic. However, California is also one of the pandemic’s hotspots, but the Golden State’s Democrat Gov. Gavin Newsom did not limit construction at all. Newsom’s shutdown order broadly defined construction workers as part of the “essential workforce,” and as such, his order specifically exempted: Construction Workers who support the construction, operation, inspection, and maintenance of construction sites and construction projects (including housing, commercial, and mixed-use construction); and workers who support the supply chain of building materials from production through application/installation, including cabinetry, fixtures, doors, cement, hardware, plumbing, electrical, heating/cooling, refrigeration, appliances, paint/coatings, and employees who provide services that enable repair materials and equipment for essential functions. Such a broad exemption basically allowed construction work to continue in California without interruption. And now such work is allowed in Michigan again since Whitmer lifted her construction ban at the beginning of May with an executive order allowing building to resume on May 7 with guidelines in place to ensure that workers maintain social distancing and employers conduct daily health screenings. Hopefully, this will be reflected in next month’s jobs numbers. But the bounce back for Michigan’s construction industry might take longer than expected because contractors now find that workers are harder to come by. “The problem is with everybody so scared about catching the virus, it’s hard to find employees,” the Michigan general contractor told Breitbart. “I have a personal friend with a framing crew who lost his entire crew because they won’t come back. They believe that there’s going to be a second wave, and they don’t want to risk their family. They’re content sitting on unemployment. They’re content with what they’re getting.” There is also some uncertainty about how much or how long businesses will be allowed to remain open. “Keep in mind that the governor here in Michigan has been engaged in a power play back and forth with the legislature threatening to extend the shutdown order,” he said. But he remains hopeful that the industry will be able to resume the projects that were put on hold when the lockdown order went into effect in March. “We had a really, really strong economy before this lockdown. We had plenty of work out there before the lockdown,” he said. “The construction industry was doing very well in Michigan. Now, it’s still very strong. But if I had to estimate, I would say that at least 10 percent of the jobs that were on the books dropped off.” The drop-off is a result of people cancelling jobs due to economic uncertainty, as well as jobs being further postponed because the shutdown delayed construction on winter projects that must now be completed before work can begin on projects that were scheduled for spring and summer. “There’s plenty of work out there for people to get off of unemployment and go back to work,” the contractor said. “There are more vehicles on the road now. You see construction vehicles everywhere now. People are hitting their construction jobs again. The demand for workers is rising.” “I can only hope that unemployment is dropping,” he said. “I pray it is because we need workers out here.” The contractor said that above all, he just wants to get back to work. “I don’t want or need unemployment. I’ve got half a million-dollar projects sitting out there waiting to be finished.” Rebecca Mansour is Senior Editor-at-Large for Breitbart News and the host of Breitbart News Tonight on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125, which broadcasts live weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern (6-9:00 p.m. Pacific).

Pakistan’s government said it may be forced to reinstate a coronavirus lockdown amid a surge in new cases, following the end of the Eid al-Fitr Islamic holiday on Sunday, Pakistani newspaper Dawn reported. On Monday, Pakistani health officials logged 1,748 new Chinese coronavirus infections. From Sunday to Monday, officials recorded 34 deaths from the virus. In response, Pakistan’s Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health Services, Dr. Zafar Mirza, urged people on Monday to heed the coronavirus prevention measures suggested by the government, such as social distancing, despite the lifting of official lockdown measures last week. “Otherwise, this crisis could turn into a huge tragedy,” he warned. Pakistan’s Supreme Court lifted the country’s remaining coronavirus lockdown measures on May 18, citing economic reasons and the claim that there “apparently is not a pandemic in Pakistan.” The order allowed larger businesses, such as shopping malls, to reopen. On May 20, train services were also allowed to resume operations. Prior to the decision, on May 9, Prime Minister Imran Khan eased restrictions on people’s movement meant to curb the spread of the virus, allowing smaller shops and markets to open. He also cited the negative impact of the shutdown on Pakistan’s economy as the main reason for reopening. First announced in late March, Khan’s lockdown was poorly enforced from the start. As the Islamic holy month of Ramadan began in late April, Islamic clerics – who command a high degree of power and influence in Pakistan – successfully petitioned Khan to ease restrictions on large gatherings at mosques, where Muslims congregate regularly during Ramadan for communal prayers and meals. Muslims were allowed to visit mosques if they followed certain precautions, such as physical distancing; mass gatherings were still discouraged. On May 19, without waiting for the approval of the national government, Pakistan’s most powerful Islamic clerics declared mosques throughout the country to be reopened for “five-time [a day] congregational prayers,” a bold move demonstrating the autonomy of Pakistan’s Islamic community. “We hope for cooperation from the government. The government should also announce lifting the ban on congregational prayers,” Mufti Usmani, a representative for Pakistan’s Islamic clerics, said in a statement at the time. Both decisions to lift Pakistan’s lockdown restrictions this month were made amid a steady rise in the number of new coronavirus cases throughout the country. Health officials had warned that lifting the lockdowns too soon could cause a surge in new cases. Observers noted that the lifting of lockdowns was timed to facilitate increased shopping and travel traditionally observed during the then-upcoming Eid al-Fitr festivities. Eid al-Fitr celebrates the end of the month-long religious holiday of Ramadan, a pious observance during which Muslims are expected to fast from dawn to dusk every day and perform additional nightly prayers on top of the usual five-a-day prayers required. To mark the end of this month of fasting, Muslims gather with their community at a mosque for the Eid prayer, which is often performed en masse. After the Eid prayer, Muslims often hold large gatherings in their home or community for family and friends, where people host festive meals and exchange gifts. With a focus on communal gathering, it comes as little surprise that the Eid al-Fitr holiday weekend led to a surge in new coronavirus cases. “As we promised when we eased the lockdown, if this trend [of new coronavirus cases] continues we may reimpose strict lockdowns after Eid,” Dr. Mirza said in statements to the press on Monday. Eid al-Fitr concluded on Sunday. “Unfortunately, there is now this thinking among us that this disease [Chinese coronavirus] was only here till Eid and that somehow it’ll disappear after Eid. This is a huge misunderstanding,” Dr. Mirza added. “I urge the nation to act with extreme responsibility to curb the spread of the virus. The cases are rising very fast and we need to be careful, more than ever,” he warned. At press time on Tuesday, Pakistan had recorded 57,705 infections and 1,197 deaths from the Chinese coronavirus. Pakistan’s health authorities believe the country’s true coronavirus numbers to be much higher due to deficient testing, which some regional authorities blame on the national government’s reluctance to test properly; others cite Pakistan’s struggling healthcare system, which lacks basic materials such as testing kits.

Michigan is now the only state among the 19 states with more than 900 COVID-19 deaths that is not reporting the number of those deaths that are from nursing homes. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, has failed to implement state level reporting on the number of COVID-19 deaths in the state from long term care facilities more than one month after local media reports first indicated the state of Michigan has a serious problem with COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes. That pattern of failing to report this key public health information continued on Tuesday when Gov. Whitmer refused to answer a reporter’s question about long term care facility reporting in the state. “Could you update us on the status of long term care facility reporting. I know we’re transitioning to a new process. Tell us what hasn’t been worked and what we can expect?” the reporter asked at the governor’s daily briefing. “You see me grabbing my mask, because I’m going to hand this over to Dr. J.,” Whitmer responded as she dodged the question and called the state’s Chief Medical Executive and Chief Deputy Director for Health for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services Dr. Joneigh Khaldun to the podium. Khaldun’s response was evasive and indefinite: So, great question. So if you go to our website now it will say we are currently updating it because what has occurred we are working with our long term care facilities to make sure we’re getting accurate infommation and that they understand what we’re actually asking them to report. What we found before is that every facility had a different interpretation of how to report so we wanted to fix that.ho In the mean time, CMS, at the federal level, has actually asked everyone in the country to report in a certain way, so now we’re aligning what we had previously asked our long term care facilities to do with the CMS guidance with the most accurate data when that’s available. Michigan Rising Action, a conservative political action committee, tweeted out the video of the governor dodging the question: VIDEO: @GovWhitmer Still Won’t Answer Why Michigan Isn’t Reporting COVID-19 Nursing Home Data pic.twitter.com/uhNKK7SiOJ — Michigan Rising Action (@MIRisingAction) May 26, 2020  As of Wednesday, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services website to which Dr. Khaldun referred still shows the following message, two days after it had originally promised to provide updated COVID-19 nursing home reporting: Michigan’s Long-Term Care data collection is undergoing a transition May 21 -25 as  MDHHS enhances its data collection process to improve accuracy, timeliness, and to align with new guidance from the federal Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Nursing facility data will be available once the transition period has ended and data appropriately validated. Gov. Whitmer’s failure to report COVID-19 nursing home deaths provides more reason for critics who already have faulted her COVID-19 nursing home policies for contributing to the crisis in those facilities. Even Democratic legislators have criticized Whitmer’s approach to nursing homes, as Click On Detroit reported earlier this month: Whitmer issued an executive order last month that requires seniors who are positive for COVID-19 to be brought to the TCF Center in Detroit or to “regional hubs,” which are nursing homes where the state says there has to be separation of the COVID-19 positive and negative patients. Rep. Leslie Love (R-Detroit) is critical of the practice. “To return seniors into an environment, seniors with the virus still recovering from the virus, into an environment with, well, seniors, just didn’t seem — it’s not a good idea,” Love said. Conservatives and Republicans have also criticized Whitmer for mismanaging nursing homes during the coronavirus pandemic. “The Whitmer administration has failed to release accurate nursing home data for months. We now know COVID-19 in nursing homes account for 42% of deaths nationwide yet Michigan still hasn’t released data or a thorough plan to protect the most vulnerable,” Tori Sachs, executive director of Michigan Rising Action, said on Tuesday. “Gov. Whitmer and the state’s Chief Medical Executive Joneigh Khaldun have both said they are following ‘facts,’ ‘science,’ and ‘data.’ How can Michiganders take that statement seriously if the state doesn’t have data on the most vulnerable population to COVID-19?” Sachs added. Two recent studies released last week, one from the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation and a second from the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity,  show that 42 percent of all COVID-19 deaths from 37 states that report this data are from nursing home residents. As Table 1 below indicates, Michigan is now one of only 13 states that are not reporting nursing home COVID-19 deaths, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, and it is the only state with more than 900 COVID-19 deaths that is failing to provide this critical public health information.   As far back as April 3, Bridge Michigan reported on the danger COVID-19 posed to the state’s nursing home residents: Roughly 10 to 12 Michigan nursing homes have reported COVID-19 cases, according to the Health Care Association of Michigan (HCAM), an industry group, though it declined to name them. The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services also could not provide precise numbers on the coronavirus. The department is “not currently tracking data on nursing home cases or nursing home workers,” spokeswoman Lynn Sutfin told Bridge on Wednesday. That has left residents, including families of nursing home residents, to rely on  homes themselves to self-report or follow news reports of COVID-19 outbreaks: approximately 20 at the Roseville home, 36 people at Metron in Cedar Springs in west Michigan, and so on. It was not until April 24 that the MDHHS began reporting the number of positive cases of COVID-19 at nursing homes, but it has failed to officially provide COVID-19 nursing home death data. A number of Michigan media outlets, however, have been able to obtain “partial” COVID-19 nursing home death data from MDHHS sources, but that data has been inconsistent and not officially confirmed. On April 23, Click on Detroit reported partial COVID-19 nursing home death data, apparently provided by public health officials at three of the hardest hit areas in the state: Macomb County, Oakland  County, and the city of Detroit: The city [of Detroit] is running tests in 21 of its 26 nursing homes, with 357 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 129 deaths. . . Oakland County has just over 200 nursing home and rehab facilities. So far, 127 have had positive cases — 1,038 people, including staff and residents, testing positive for COVID-19. There have been 146 coronavirus-related deaths. Macomb County has 77 long-term care facilities, and 46 of them have had COVID-19 cases. There have been 332 positive cases and 128 deaths. On May 9, for instance, the New York Times reported that only 5 percent of the state’s COVID-19 deaths at the time, or 211, were from nursing homes. Then on May 22, Michigan Public Radio reported 748 COVID-19 nursing home deaths according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, but that number, they acknowledged, was likely under reported. The percentage of COVID-19 deaths from nursing homes among the 37 states that currently report that data ranges from a low of 20 percent in New York to a high of 81 percent, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. Skepticism abounds on the quality of the reporting from some states–like New York–where the percentage is at the lower end of that range. The lack of any reporting to date from Michigan on the percentage of COVID-19 deaths from nursing homes does not engender confidence in the quality of the reporting that may emerge from the state at some point in the future.

Wednesday on CNN’s “Newsroom,” National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci said he wanted to be a “symbol” for Americans to wear face masks in public amid the coronavirus pandemic. Fauci said, “I think we should be recommending it. As you know, I wear it whenever I’m outside. We can try and keep the usual distance, but sometimes it is out of your control. So there are some fundamental things that we can do, we’re very aware of and sensitive to the need to try and make those steps towards reopening. But there are certain things that you can do and still do as you reopen. One is wearing a mask. The other is avoiding crowds of more than ten people, depending upon where you are and where the dynamics of the outbreak are. The other is continuing to wash your hands, which is important. And those kinds of things are simple. They’re easy to do. I think one can do that at the same time as you gradually try to get to the point of doing the reopening. I think those are the things that everybody should seriously consider doing.” Anchor Jim Sciutto asked, “Do you think when folks, members of the public are being asked to do this, and they look at folks like you doing it, does that encourage its use to a positive degree?” Fauci said, “No, it does, Jim. I wear it for the reason that I believe it is effective. It is not 100% effective. I mean, its sort of respect for the another person and have that other person respect you. You wear a mask. They wear a mask, you protect each other. I do it when I’m in the public for the reasons that, A, I want to protect myself and protect others. Also, because I want to make it be a symbol for people to see, that’s the kind of thing you should be doing.” He added, “When I walk around the street and the neighborhood where I live in Washington, D.C., which still has a considerable number of infections, it is very clear that many people are doing that.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Wednesday on NBC’s “Today,” Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) said President Donald Trump should “just stick with the facts, not opinions” in regards to the safety of mail-in voting amid the coronavirus pandemic. Anchor Savannah Guthrie asked, “The president tweeted about you and your plans to send mail-in ballots to registered voters in the state. What do you say to the president’s concerns about fraudulent ballots?” Newsom said, “Let’s just stick with the facts, not opinions. The reality is mail-in ballots are well utilized all across the spectrum, all across this country, and have been done so thoughtfully and safely for a generation. I think the president himself has used a mail-in ballot. In the past, our service members use them overseas very confidently and securely.” He added, “There’s been study after study — don’t take my word for it, don’t take the president’s — study after study that just lays claim to no evidence whatsoever that there’s widespread voter fraud. We want to prepare to keep people safe and allow them to have their constitutional rights protected, constitutional right to vote, without putting their health at risk.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

According to a recent report, local news stations across the United States have run news segments scripted and produced by e-commerce giant Amazon. Unsurprisingly, the segments were overly positive about Jeff Bezos’ company and its employment practices. Vice News reports that local news stations across the United States recently aired a segment that was produced and scripted by e-commerce giant Amazon praising the company’s role in delivering essential groceries and cleaning products during the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic, as well as highlighting that the company is “keeping its employees safe and healthy.” Vice reports that at least eleven local TV stations aired the segment which was introduced with a script written by Amazon and recited word for word by news anchors. The segments praise Amazon and its efforts during the pandemic despite reports that the firm is struggling to provide its workers with protective equipment, support the sellers on its platform, and cutting coronavirus pay increases to factory workers. The anchors in the segments introduce the script and then cut to an Amazon-produced exclusive look “inside” an Amazon fulfillment center which is narrated by Amazon spokesperson Todd Walker, who states: Millions of Americans staying at home are relying on amazon to deliver essentials like groceries and cleaning products during the COVID-19 outbreak. For the first time we’re getting a glimpse *inside* Amazon’s fulfillment centers to see just how the company is keeping its employees safe and healthy.. While delivering packages to your doorstep. Todd Walker takes us inside. A YouTube compilation shows the segment scripted by Amazon:  The segment further shows interviews with Amazon employees who praise the company and discuss their dedication to their job. One Amazon fulfillment center site leader, Marty Kuhl, states: “I was extremely proud of my team and the way they were handling the situation on a daily basis. Every day they came to work ready to embrace change.” 
 The footage inside the Amazon fulfillment center was sent to news stations as a press release along with instructions on how to best run the segment, which states: “Go inside one of the company’s fulfillment centers to see the unprecedented ways Amazon is using innovation to continue operating, including COVID-19 testing, disinfectant spraying and physical distancing.” Walker recently wrote on his LinkedIn page that he “got to dust off my reporting skills to give local markets their first look inside our fulfillment centers to see how Amazon is protecting the health and safety of its associates to continue delivering for you. News friends, the story is available to download in this link if you’d like to give your viewers inside access. I made a plug-and-play version, as well as one anchors and reporters can track themselves. It’s already been shared in markets from Los Angeles to Lexington.” Zach Rael, an anchor and reporter at ABC’s KOCO 5 News, recently tweeted out the script and “pre-edited” story that he said Amazon’s PR team emailed to him: Just got an email from Amazon’s PR team with a pre-edited news story and script to run in our shows. They are selling this as giving our viewers an “inside look” at the company’s response to COVID-19.  No. Let us go inside a fulfillment centers with our own cameras… pic.twitter.com/7mDk2xmf4O — Zach Rael (@KOCOZach) May 24, 2020  Alyssa Bronikowski, a spokesperson for Amazon, told Motherboard: “We welcome reporters into our buildings and it’s misleading to suggest otherwise. This type of video was created to share an inside look into the health and safety measures we’ve rolled out in our buildings and was intended for reporters who for a variety of reasons weren’t able to come tour one of our sites themselves.” Read more at Vice News here.

During the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, many health officials speculated a second wave as bad as the first would hit in the latter part of 2020 as the world waits for a vaccine. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of President Donald Trump’s Coronavirus Task Force, said there is a possibility of another wave, but said “it is not inevitable.” Fauci told “CNN Newsroom” co-host Jim Sciutto that a second wave is preventable with proper testing, isolation and contact tracing as the United States slowly reopens. “It’s getting better and better, Jim,” Fauci advised. “I’m feeling better about it as we go by with the weeks that go by, and we see that we’re getting more and more capability of testing. The CDC is putting more of a workforce out there to help us do the kinds of identification, isolation and contact tracing. I feel better and better that we’re capable of doing that.” He continued, “[W]e often talk about the possibility of a second wave, or of an outbreak when you’re reopening. We don’t have to accept that as an inevitability. Particularly when people start thinking about the fall, I want people to really appreciate that it could happen, but it is not inevitable. If we do the kinds of things that we’re putting in place now, to have the workforce, the system, and the will to do the kinds of things that are the clear and effective identification, isolation and contact tracing, we can prevent this second wave that we’re talking about. If we do it correctly.” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent

China’s National People’s Congress (NPC), one of its two communist legislative chambers, proposed drafting a sovereign immunity law on Wednesday to allow Chinese people to sue the American state in courts, an act of revenge for mounting litigation against China. Lawyers around the world – in states as far from each other as Italy, Nigeria, Turkey, and India – have brought lawsuits against the Communist Party and the state of China for silencing doctors early on in the pandemic who had identified a contagious respiratory disease. The lawsuits also accuse China of pressuring foreign states not to impose travel restrictions on Chinese nationals and of pressuring global agencies like the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) to downplay the severity of the outbreak. In the United States, the states of Missouri and Mississippi have sued the Communist Party for the damage caused by the Chinese coronavirus. Lawyers have brought lawsuits against China in states like Texas, New York, and Florida. America’s Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) prevents individuals from bringing lawsuits against foreign state entities in U.S. courts. Congress can override this limitation through legislation exempting certain states in certain circumstances. Several lawmakers – prominently Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Rep. Lance Gooden (R-TX) – have backed a law that would disable sovereign immunity provisions to allow lawsuits against China for damage related to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. Similar legislation exists in China, which is why Communist Party media reported on Wednesday that the NPC is attempting to carve an exemption out of that law for lawsuits against “other countries.” The Chinese lawmaker leading the charge, Ma Yide, told the state propaganda outlet Global Times that the law would “ensure Chinese citizens’ and companies’ rights to sue the US over its blame game and cover-up of information during the pandemic.” Ma said that Chinese citizens should have a right to sue the United States citing an unsubstantiated Chinese Foreign Ministry conspiracy theory that the U.S. Army is responsible for the ongoing pandemic. “Many believe that U.S. soldiers brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Others believe that the U.S. has hidden key information, which led to the global health crisis. Why can’t Chinese citizens and companies sue the U.S. government?” Ma asked the Global Times. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian accused the U.S. Army in March of releasing the pathogen and causing the pandemic, not offering an explanation for how that could be possible when there is no evidence the virus existed anywhere prior to its discovery in Wuhan, central China. Chinese state propaganda later added as an explanation that American soldiers could have brought the virus to Wuhan during October’s Military World Games, hosted by that city. China was disqualified from the games despite being the host for “extensive cheating.” There is also no evidence of any coronavirus infection related to the Military World Games. The American servicewoman accused of infecting Wuhan, Maatje Benassi, told CNN in an interview that the Chinese government’s false claims have resulted in a “nightmare” situation of incessant harassment from emboldened Chinese nationalists. As this conspiracy theory has also largely failed to convince the world, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying also speculated that the virus existed throughout last year in the United States and was disguised as e-cigarette, or vaping disease. Hua did not account for the fact that none of the cases of respiratory illness related to vaping were contagious; the Chinese coronavirus is believed to spread very rapidly. Coverage of the NPC sovereign immunity exception indicates that, should it pass, Chinese citizens could use these theories to demand redress from the U.S. government. The Global Times claimed that some lawsuits are already surfacing. Liang Xuguang, a lawyer based in Wuhan, has filed a lawsuit against U.S. government agencies over the suspected intentional spread of misinformation over COVID-19 [the Chinese coronavirus]. Liang urged the U.S. to publicize the number of ‘influenza deaths’ that were caused by the novel coronavirus,” the state propaganda outlet reported. The Times blamed the United States for spearheading “abusive” lawsuits against China linked to the pandemic around the world, but only named the United States among those entertaining the lawsuits. In reality, courts around the world have allowed lawsuits against the Chinese state or Communist Party in relation to China’s negligence in containing the virus. Among the evidence cited in many of these lawsuits is the fact that China destroyed early samples of the virus from Wuhan, detained doctors and others sharing safety information on contagious diseases on social media, and reports that dictator Xi Jinping personally urged W.H.O. head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to downplay how contagious the virus is. Among the nations that have seen lawsuits against China are Egypt, Turkey, Italy, Nigeria, and India, totally in the trillions of dollars in damages sought. In the United States, the states of Missouri and Mississippi have sued China officially. Missouri’s attorney general sued the Communist Party in an attempt to avoid sovereign immunity barriers, arguing that the party is a corporate entity separate from the state of China. Lawyers in Florida, New York, and Texas have also filed lawsuits. Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.  

Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak announced Tuesday night the state’s casinos will be allowed to reopen next Thursday after more than two months of being shut down due to the coronavirus pandemic. Sisolak highlighted “positive trends” in the state’s data regarding the coronavirus and insisted he would work with the Gaming Control Board to ensure safety conditions are met in casinos. “We continue to see a consistent and sustainable downward trajectory of percentage of positive COVID-19 cases and a decrease in the trend of COVID-19 hospitalizations,” Sisolak said. “The Board was briefed on how these various entities have worked with the gaming industry to ensure that there is a comprehensive plan in place to respond to and mitigate the effects of positive cases of COVID-19 that present themselves in the State’s resort corridors,” Sisolak added. Sisolak also stated it was “critical” to guard the health and safety of employees, residents, and visitors first. “It is critical to put the health and safety of employees, residents and visitors first through proactive measures, coupled with the Health and Safety Policies issued by the Gaming Control Board,” Sisolak said. “This is what will help ensure that Nevada can safely reopen its gaming industry on June 4.” In his remarks, Sisolak recommended customers wear face masks or coverings “like a badge of honor.” “As always, I encourage Nevadans to stay vigilant and protect themselves against this virus,” Sisolak stated. “Our goal is to prevent a surge in cases that our health care system cannot handle. We cannot do this without each of you accepting the personal responsibility to follow the social distancing guidelines in professional and personal decisions.” With casinos set to reopen in Nevada, the state will receive a much needed economic boost. Last month, Nevada had the highest unemployment rate of any state in the country, with 28.2 percent of residents jobless. That is almost more than double the national unemployment average of 14.7 percent. According to the Center for Gaming Research, 24 casinos located on the Las Vegas strip earned over $72 million in fiscal year 2017. In addition to announcing that casinos could reopen next week, Sisolak also said religious gatherings of up to 50 people could begin on Friday and gyms, shopping malls, theaters, and bars could open with restrictions.

New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D) bought jewelry in April from a non-essential business which had been closed by her own lockdown order, according to a local report. KRQE News reports: KRQE News 13 has learned in April, when she ordered non-essential businesses to shut down and lectured all New Mexicans to stay home, a non-essential business opened up so she could buy jewelry and have it delivered to her. … [J]ust days after the April 3rd news conference and a week before Easter, KRQE News 13 has learned that Gov. Lujan Grisham called an employee at Lilly Barrack on Paseo to buy expensive jewelry. The jewelry was bought over the phone, but the employee went to the store, got the jewelry and placed it outside the door of the store where someone who knew the governor picked it up. This is according to the person who runs Lilly Barrack stores. She says she didn’t know about it until after it happened. She also said no one was allowed in the stores at that time due to the public health order. In a statement to KRQE News 13, a spokesperson for Lujan Grisham provided a different version of events described above: “Lujan Grisham did call an employee, saying they had a longstanding personal relationship. The employee came here [Lilly Barrack], got the jewelry and took it home, left it outside their home and then someone came and picked it up.” On April 30, Lujan Grisham extended her state’s stay-at-home order to May 15 but eased restrictions, allowing non-essential retailers, state parks, and golf courses to operate with strict guidelines. The report comes after Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s (D) husband is said to have urged a dock company to place his boat in the water ahead of Memorial Day weekend, despite pandemic guidelines. Detroit News reported: The owner of a Northern Michigan dock company says Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s husband wanted his boat placed in the water before the Memorial Day weekend as Whitmer urged residents not to rush to the region. No longer visible to the public, Facebook posts from NorthShore Dock LLC and its owner, Tad Dowker, focused on what Dowker said was a request last week by Whitmer’s husband, Marc Mallory. The posts have drawn the attention of Republican state lawmakers, who said the Democratic governor’s family may not be following her guidance for the rest of the state. Whitmer’s spokeswoman, Tiffany Brown, didn’t confirm or deny Monday the assertions by the marina company or its owner. Brown said the administration wouldn’t address “every rumor that is spread online.” In a Tuesday press conference, Whitmer attempted to blame her husband’s “failed attempt at humor” for the reported request. “Knowing it wouldn’t make a difference, he jokingly asked if being married to me might move him up in the queue,” the Michigan governor said. “Obviously with the motorized boating prohibition in our early days of COVID-19, he thought it might get a laugh. It didn’t.” Earlier May, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) admitted his wife recently traveled to their South Florida estate despite the state’s stay-at-home order. “My wife and daughter were down in Florida in early March and, in fact even a little before that, and you know, they sheltered in place when the stay-at-home order came up,” he said at the time.

As the country grapples with the coronavirus pandemic, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has proceeded with a change to House rules that will allow for so-called proxy voting by members, a move opposed by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA). Such a move would allow for votes to take place without some members of Congress being physically present. However, according to McCarthy, the effort is unconstitutional and being instituted by Pelosi to ensure she maintains a stranglehold on power. “This is endangering the Constitution to ensure Pelosi has more power,” McCarthy said on Wednesday’s broadcast of Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends.” “Look, our Constitution, our country expects us to convene. For 231 years, that’s what Congress has done — from the yellow fever of 17 — in the 1700s, to the Civil War, to the burning of a building during the — in the 1900s. Then you had Spanish flu. You had the 9/11 — we still convened.” “But all this does is empower Pelosi more,” he continued. “Sixty-three Democrats will not show up for work today but still be paid. You cannot read the Constitution without clearly seeing that our founders believed we should meet together, from Article 1, section four, five, or six. There is no way to read the Constitution any other way. The only reason the Democrats are doing this, it empowers Pelosi to even be stronger. Watch what she was able to do just a couple of weeks ago — passed $3 trillion with never going through a committee, no one seeing the bill. She wrote it herself and brought it to the floor. The largest bill ever in the history of the United States.” McCarthy acknowledged Democrats in charge of the U.S. House of Representatives could make rule changes, but such changes had to be within the parameters of the Constitution. “Congress can make any rule, but they cannot — they cannot go against the Constitution,” he explained. “If that is true, then Congress can make a rule that only women can vote, that only California can vote, that Republican votes only count half a percent. They cannot do something unconstitutional. That’s why what they are doing has not been done in 231 years.” “When the — when the Capitol was burnt down during the War of 1812, when we had the Spanish flu in 1918, when we had 9/11 we still were able to convene,” McCarthy added. “We are going to space today, we are opening up California, but 63 Democrats are not coming to work, and they’re still being paid. They were able to come to work a couple of weeks ago but now they can’t. Why? Because it empowers Nancy Pelosi to have all the power. Only 20 members can hold all the proxies to be able to pass bills they want on the floor — unheard of. And it is not what the founders believed this country should do.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor

The Oakland Athletics are placing their scouts and a significant number of other front office employees on furlough, suspending pay for minor leaguers and cutting the salaries of other executives as part of a cost-cutting move in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. A’s owner John Fisher announced the moves Tuesday in a rare public statement on what he called a “tremendously difficult day.” “Baseball is more than a job — it is a way of life,” Fisher wrote in a letter to fans and staff. “People who work for our team are our family — our very foundation — and they work tirelessly to help the A’s compete in this most precious game. COVID-19 has brought a tragic loss of life and sickness to so many in our community, and it has impacted us all in ways we could have never imagined. Our organization, like so many others across the country, has had to make tough and painful decisions.” The furloughs for the scouts and other front office personnel will begin next week, although the team’s amateur scouts are expected to stay on through the draft on June 10-11. Minor leaguers will stop receiving $400 weekly stipdends next week. The A’s will continue to pay the health care, 401k and pension costs for their employees.
The team also will cut pay for all front office employees making more than $60,000, with the biggest cuts coming to the highest-paid employees. “I know that many of you will wonder why the A’s are cutting costs now,” Fisher wrote. “Nobody knows how this pandemic will evolve over the long term. What is clear is that our revenues will be dramatically reduced this year. None of this diminishes the pain of today’s actions, but it is an honest acknowledgement of the circumstances of the moment.” Fisher, whose family founded the clothing retailer the Gap, is worth more than $2 billion, according to Forbes. The Los Angeles Dodgers are reducing pay for team employees who make over $75,000 because of the coronavirus pandemic. A team spokesman confirmed multiple media reports that said cuts range from 15% to 35% on salaries above $75,000. There will be no cuts for employees making less than that. “This plan allows us to avoid organization-wide furloughs and to preserve hundreds of jobs,” the team said later in a statement. “Over the last several weeks, we have considered every way to better withstand the challenges presented by the virus. Today — while we remain very hopeful that there will be a 2020 season — we are implementing a number of measures to reduce our costs. We remain ready to play as soon as that becomes feasible.” The baseball season has been put on hold since March because of the coronavirus pandemic. Owners and players are in negotiations about playing an abbreviated 82-game schedule, likely without fans.

Cases of online sexual abuse of children in the Philippines have risen by as much as 260 percent since the country’s coronavirus lockdown measures were imposed in March, Philippine news outlet Coconuts Manila reported on Tuesday. The Philippines Department of Justice [DOJ] announced the alarming statistic on Monday, citing data from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children [NCMEC], a non-profit organization. From March 1 to May 24, The NCMEC reported a total of 279,166 child abuse cases to the DOJ, compared to 76,561 cases for the same period in 2019. According to the report, the majority of child abuse cases reported to the DOJ included “possession, manufacture, and distribution of child porn; enticing kids to perform sexual acts online; trafficking minors for sex; and sexual molestation.” In a statement, the DOJ attributed the increase in cases to the Philippines’ stringent coronavirus lockdown measures: “[A] strict home quarantine is observed in all households, and internet usage surges as people stay home.” Out of the thousands of cases, just 22 have been referred to the National Bureau of Investigation, according to the report. The DOJ said this was due, in part, to the referral of some cases to the Philippine National Police. So far, authorities have arrested ten people in connection with the reported cases and have detained seven suspects, according to Coconuts Manila. State authorities rescued 34 minors in response to the reports. Two cases connected to the reports are currently on federal trial in the Philippines. Other cases have been filed in the prosecutors’ offices of four different cities: Butuan, Taguig, Caloocan, and Angeles City. DOJ Undersecretary Markk Perete said that the high number of cases may be due to “misreporting,” explaining that there were “identical materials reported by many people” as well as people reporting nude photos of children which were posted by relatives to social media “in good faith.” He also said there had been “inaccurate reports forwarded by internet service providers.” In a statement, the DOJ said that Philippine internet service providers [ISPs] should install technologies to prevent pedophiles from accessing webpages advertising child pornography. It is unfortunate that eleven years after the law that prohibits any form of child pornography was passed, the ISPs have continued to be remiss of [their] duty to install blocking or filtering technology that would have greatly reduced the amount of time necessary to identify perpetrators and victims. Last week, the International Justice Mission, a non-profit organization combating the sexual abuse of minors, published a seven-year study that found that “endemic poverty” was responsible for making the Philippines a “global hotspot” for child abuse and pornography.

Ian Blackford, leader of the left-separatist Scottish National Party (SNP) contingent in the British parliament, made a journey of over 600 miles from London to the Isle of Skye during lockdown. Blackford, a wealthy former investment banker from Edinburgh, has been relentless in his calls for Dominic Cummings, Boris’s Johnson’s chief adviser and a key figure in the Vote Leave campaign during the EU referendum, to be sacked for travelling to his family farm in Durham during the coronavirus lockdown. Cummings has contended that he was within his rights to do so given the rules allow for travel to meet particular childcare needs, which he believes he had. He has received the backing of the Attorney-General and — so far — the Prime Minister. Blackford, who perhaps not coincidentally is a staunch EU loyalist bitterly opposed to Brexit, has been pressuring the Prime Minister to withdraw this support from Mr Cummings, claiming it is “One rule for them and another for the rest of us” — but he himself made a journey of well over 600 miles from London to his Skye estate in his home constituency after the lockdown was announced; far further than Cummings travelled. Returned to Skye from Westminster but into isolation as a precaution away from Ann and everyone else given the prevalence of the virus in London. The right thing to do but hard not seeing Ann. #StayHomeSaveLives — Ian Blackford (@Ianblackford_MP) March 26, 2020  Blackford made the journey after the lockdown was announced despite the fact that, like most MPs, he has a home in London, claiming a remarkable £22,775.73 from the taxpayer in accommodation rent and Council Tax costs in 2018-19, and his own repeated calls from people not to travel from coronavirus epicentres like London to remote and sparsely populated areas like Skye, where acute healthcare infrastructure is weak. His defenders have argued that he was within his rights, under the rules, to travel to his primary residence in his home constituency after the parliamentary recess was announced — even though he did not need to do so — and that MPs have additional leeway to travel as so-called “key workers”. His detractors, however, argue that Cummings also believes his movements were permissible under the rules, and that Blackford therefore has no moral high ground to demand Cummings’ termination for leaving London when he did the same thing. Remainer Tory Who Resigned Over Cummings Made Even Longer Cross-Country Trip as Home Internet Too Slow https://t.co/llotQLpB7l — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 27, 2020  It is true that Blackford was by no means the only MP to have travelled to their home constituency from London during the lockdown — another was Douglas Ross, the Tory Remainer who travelled to his home constituency and back again due to its merely “adequate” Internet services. Ross has, somewhat inexplicably, now resigned from his junior government position over Cummings’ movements, despite the fact they were less extensive than his own.

Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has denied breaking the lockdown rules after he was pictured attending a topless barbeque in a sunny Dublin park with his partner and two other friends. On Monday, a spokesman said that that the Europhile Irish leader “broke no laws, breached no regulations and observed public health guidance” while gathering in Phoenix Park on Sunday. “The Taoiseach [Prime Minister] was in the Phoenix Park with his partner Matt and two friends on Sunday afternoon, in line with public health guidance,” the spokesperson added. The denial of any wrongdoing came after images were circulated on social media of Mr Varadkar, his partner Matthew Barrett, and two other friends lounging while having a barbeque in public, according to the Irish Independent. The gathering did, however, appear to contradict the advice that was given by the assistant secretary of the Department of the Taoiseach, Liz Caravan, who said last week that: “If you’re visiting a public amenity try not to stay too long at the site or have picnics. Please do your exercise and then go home.” Despite Mr Varadkar apparently breaking the national lockdown rules that he imposed upon Irish citizens, there has been comparatively little backlash in the mainstream media, particularly when viewed alongside the media storm surrounding UK political advisor Dominic Cummings. Farage: Remainers Want Cummings out as Excuse to Delay Brexit https://t.co/PG6ERzdWCC — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 26, 2020  Brendan O’Neill, a columnist for Spiked Online observed while discussing the differential noted that he was not particularly bothered by either supposed scandal, but asserted that the double standard in media coverage of the two incidents was a result of the different political positions the two men hold. While Varadkar has enjoyed prominence and favourable over to his position as a media darling as the anti-Brexit, first openly homosexual PM of the Republic of Ireland, Mr Cummings has long been a target for the media establishment for his role in the Vote Leave campaign in 2016, which helped secure the Brexit referendum. “They loathe him [Dominic Cummings], and their weird, obsessive, creepy focus on where he went during lockdown is transparently an extension of that loathing,” O’Neill wrote. “It’s so clear now that the Cummings fuss has nothing to do with car journeys, Durham, Barnard Castle or any of the other crap,” he added. O’Neil said that the disparity is a form of “Remoaner Revenge”, saying that is the reason why “Varadkar is forgiven for having a shirtless picnic while Cummings is demonised for driving north to protect his wife and child from media intrusion”. “How about this: we forgive them both and move the hell on,” O’Neill suggested.

ROME — The overwhelming majority of deaths with coronavirus in Italy have occurred in the presence of two or more serious chronic illnesses, according to a report from the country’s national health authority (ISS). Italian health authorities announced in a recent report that only 4.1 percent of fatalities testing positive for Wuhan coronavirus happened in the absence of serious comorbidities, while the average age of the deceased was over 80 years. The average number of comorbidities among all Italian deaths with the coronavirus was 3.1, ISS revealed. Just 15 percent of fatalities occurred with the presence of just one other serious pathology, while 21.4 percent died with two other pathologies, and 59.6 percent with three or more pathologies. The most common comorbidities were arterial hypertension (in 68.3 percent of cases), type-2 diabetes (30.1 percent of cases), ischemic heart disease (in 28.2 percent), atrial fibrillation (22.5 percent), chronic renal failure (20.4 percent). Most common comorbidities among Italy deaths with coronavirus. The report also revealed an average age of 81 among those who have died with coronavirus in Italy. One of the most astonishing findings of the report was that only 1.1 percent of all coronavirus deaths in the country happened to people below the age of 50, while more than 57 percent were over 80. “The latest numbers show that new cases and fatalities have a common profile: mostly elderly people with previous illnesses,” said ISS president Silvio Brusaferro at a news conference Friday. As of May 26, the number of active cases of coronavirus in Italy had fallen to 52,942. The total number of deaths with the disease have been 32,955, while total recorded cases stands at 230,555. This week Spain had to revise down its official death count for the coronavirus by nearly 2,000 after discovering a series of reporting errors and duplications. The Spanish Health Ministry announced Monday that it removed 1,918 spurious deaths from the official death toll, representing a seven percent drop in the total deaths reported.

Deaths have soared among the homeless population in San Francisco during the coronavirus, but not due to the virus directly. The San Francisco Chronicle reported Tuesday: “Forty-eight homeless people — an average of six per week — died in San Francisco between March 30 and May 24, according to Dr. Barry Zevin, director of the Department of Public Health’s Street Medicine Team. For comparison, 14 people died in the same time period last year.” The causes, pending official confirmation, may have more to do with the lockdown than the coronavirus itself, as many homeless people had less access to medical services and other needs. An even more important factor may simply have been drug overdoses, as there was an “explosion of fentanyl on San Francisco’s streets” over the past two years, the Chronicle notes. San Francisco, like other cities in California, initially sought to move homeless people indoors to avoid the coronavirus. But as evidence emerged that the virus was more easily spread among people sharing space indoors, the city began encouraging people to stay outside, where they could practice “social distancing” more easily. The Chronicle notes: “The number of tents and makeshift structures throughout the Tenderloin neighborhood exploded by 285% between January and May, according to city data. The city as a whole saw a 71% increase in tents and structures during that period.” In Los Angeles, officials recently reversed a policy of moving homeless people indoors to recreation centers in residential areas. The policy had faced local opposition, especially as it appeared to conflict with guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. San Francisco also opened its first officially-sanctioned homeless camp near City Hall earlier this week, with tents spaced widely. Joel B.

Swedish climate worrier Greta Thunberg restarted her global campaign against all manner of “climate sins” on Wednesday by lashing the Danish capital Copenhagen for channeling waste water overflow into the sea. According to AP, for the last six years the city has pumped large amounts of waste water into the seaway separating Sweden and Denmark during heavy rains. Since 2014, some 9.1 billion gallons of unfiltered sewer water has drained into the Oresund Strait during storms because Danish treatment plants simply could not handle the demand for treatment, according to Danish media citing the Danish Environmental Protection Agency. The city had planned to allow the Greater Copenhagen Utility HOFOR to flush 10 million cubic feet of unfiltered waste water into Oresund starting Sunday however that has been postponed until October, the London Times reports. This emergency measure, in a city of 602,481 which was designated the European Green Capital in 2014, has drawn a response by Thunberg: Denmark were about to dump 290mn liters of unfiltered toilet water into the Baltic Sea.Turns out Copenhagen has dumped over 35bn litres of such water straight into Öresund, since 2014. Yes, the same Copenhagen who claim they'll be "climate neutral" 2025.https://t.co/cbdY3yac59 — Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) May 27, 2020  Thunberg said on Facebook these actions are coming from “the same Copenhagen who claim they’ll be climate neutral by 2025,” doubtless a disappointment to her and her supporters who see global climate action as a necessity for the survival of the planet: Thunberg’s return to castigating the world for climate errors both real and perceived comes after an admission in March it’s “extremely likely” she contracted the Chinese coronavirus but subsequently “basically recovered” from it, as Breitbart News reported. The 17-year-old said she and father exhibited coronavirus-like symptoms at the time and chose to self-quarantine for two weeks following a trip through western Europe. Thunberg has urged other climate activists to opt for online protests — instead of large, public demonstrations — to combat the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. AP contributed to this story

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for an independent investigation into the origins of coronavirus, after reports that communist China misled the international community over the infectious nature of the Wuhan-origin virus. Mr Johnson made the demand while speaking to Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Tuesday, with the World Health Organization (WHO) director-general saying that he was in agreement, according to a Number 10 spokesman. “The prime minister and Dr Tedros agreed on the importance of an independent investigation into the origins of the coronavirus outbreak, so we can learn lessons to prevent future pandemics,” the spokesman said in comments reported by the Evening Standard. The WHO’s agreement to back the formal investigation perhaps came as a result of the President of the United States of America, Donald Trump, warning that the U.S. would pull financial support from the organisation unless it committed to “major substantive improvements within the next 30 days”. President Trump had called the WHO a “puppet of China” which had failed to handle the coronavirus pandemic. President Trump is entirely clear, however, of who is responsible for the deadly coronavirus that first appeared in the Chinese city of Wuhan last year. He said last week that the communist nation was guilty of “mass worldwide killing” through its “incompetence”. EU Stands in ‘Solidarity’ With China-Backing World Health Organization https://t.co/BMFGO3kdu7 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 20, 2020  In April, the British think tank the Henry Jackson Society said that Western nations should sue China if the communist country were found liable for allowing the deadly respiratory virus to spread around the world and for intentionally withholding information from the international community. The think tank’s report had found that China had provided the WHO with “erroneous information” in early January and allowed millions of people to leave Wuhan before locking it down, despite knowing of human-to-human transmission. This month, a leaked intelligence report by the Five Eyes — Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK, and the USA — found that the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had destroyed evidence on the outbreak of its virus, a result of which caused the “endangerment of other countries”. The dossier also revealed that the CCP “disappeared” whistle-blowing doctors and aggressively censored phrases such as “Wuhan Unknown Pneumonia”, “SARS variation”, and “Wuhan Seafood Market”, the latter related to the ‘wet’ live animal food market where the virus is suspected of having originated. “Despite evidence of human-human transmission from early December, PRC [People’s Republic of China] authorities deny it until January 20th,” the report stated. “The World Health Organization does the same. Yet officials in Taiwan raised concerns as early as December 31st, as did experts in Hong Kong on January 4th,” it added.

A poll revealed that the vast majority of Hungarians, 78 per cent, say they believe Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s Wuhan coronavirus response was better than other European countries. The nationwide telephone survey, which involved 1,000 participants, revealed that only five per cent of Hungarians thought that other European countries did a better job at stopping the spread of the Chinese virus. A total of 75 per cent said they were very or moderately satisfied with the government response overall, with just nine per cent said the measures undertaken by Prime Minister Orbán were excessive, newspaper Magyar Hírlap reported on Tuesday. Three-quarters of Hungarians say that the government acted in a timely manner in response to the outbreak opposed to 13 per cent who said the government did not act quickly enough. The Hungarian response to the coronavirus, which saw Orbán and his government enact emergency measures, was widely criticised by leftists, liberals, and the establishment media. Members of the European People’s Party, a European parliamentary group of which Orbán’s party Fidesz is a member, went as far as to demand Fidesz be kicked out of the group over the measures. Hungary’s Orban Prepares to Give Up Coronavirus Powers, Ready to Accept Apologies for ‘Dictator’ Accusations https://t.co/8kyhTEHPjf — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 16, 2020  “The fight against COVID-19 requires extensive measures, however, the virus cannot be used as a pretext to extend the state of emergency indefinitely. We fear that Prime Minister Orbán will use his newly achieved power to further extend the government’s grip on civil society,” members of the group said. Former United States UN ambassador Susan Rice went even further and called for Hungary to be kicked out of the European Union itself. Earlier this month, while many other European countries are still under emergency measures, Prime Minister Orbán announced that the emergency powers to fight coronavirus would end by the end of May. A bill to rescind power back to parliament was introduced on Tuesday after a cabinet meeting the day before which discussed details of ending the emergency powers period. Justice Minister Judit Varga commented on the opposition to Hungary’s coronavirus strategy, saying: “Instead of giving support… the opposition mounted an unprecedented disinformation campaign, together with the mainstream liberal media, in Hungary and internationally.”

Douglas Ross, the little-known former government minister who resigned from his junior position over Dominic Cummings’ movements during lockdown, made an even longer cross-country trip to London — because his home Internet was “adequate at best”. Mr Cummings, a key figure in the Vote Leave campaign during the EU referendum and widely despised by the mainstream media, left his London home for his family’s farm in Durham while his wife was ill with the coronavirus, because he feared no-one would be able to look after their young son if he also became sick — although he did not come in contact with his parents while he was there, staying in a separate building, even staying away from his uncle’s funeral. He contends that his movements were allowable within the lockdown rules, which make special provisions for people with particular childcare needs. Douglas Ross, on the other hand, made his journey of several hundred miles from rural Moray, in the Scottish Highlands, back to London because his home Internet connection was “adequate at best”. The Tory MP, who indicated that he was backing Remain in 2016 and backed Remainer leadership contender Mark Harper before Boris Johnson in 2019, resigned from his junior ministerial position in the Scotland Office, claiming Cummings’ interpretation of the rules was “not shared by the vast majority”. Today I’ve returned to London for the first time since restrictions were introduced and I’ve written this open letter to Moray residents to explain why. I don’t want to do anything to jeopardise the safety of my family or anyone in Moray so will take all the necessary precautions pic.twitter.com/3BrB89p3WK — Douglas Ross MP (@Douglas4Moray) May 18, 2020  Mr Ross made the long journey from northern Scotland to southern England after having managed in his home constituency for some eight weeks, claiming that, for him “home working has been successful to a point, but living in a rural part of Moray, my connection to the internet has been adequate at best.” He also complained of two occasions when his WiFi failed during a virtual Select Committee session, and some of his contributions having “broken audio”. Ross also said he was “required to take a small piece of legislation through the House of Commons” and answer parliamentary questions on behalf of the Scotland Office, claiming that, while arrangements have been put in place for parliamentarians to perform their roles remotely, the Speaker preferred that he was “physically in the House of Commons”. Politicians are, as “key workers”, permitted to travel during lockdown, although members of the public may question whether those who have travelled to and from London have the moral high ground to call for Mr Cummings’ head for doing the same thing. There is speculation that the particular ferociousness of the media and Remain-voting politicians in their pursuit of Cummings may have something to do with the fact that, on recovering from the coronavirus, he squashed a plan to extend the ongoing Brexit “transition period” — in which Britain remains an EU member in all but name — which had been “all but agreed at official level” while he and Prime Minister Johnson were out of action.

Charlene Doak-Gebauer, author and expert on digital safety for children and families, said that during the coronavirus outbreak, children who are sequestered inside homes and using devices more than usual are at higher risk for exposure to pornography and online predators. “Children are being given too much ownership for their decisions, particularly online,” Doak-Gebauer said in a report published on the EIN Presswire website. “An eight-year old has little choice as to what to have for dinner, and yet they are supposed to make the right choices while communicating online.”  “They lack the life skills and maturity to do so effectively,” Doak-Gebauer said. “We have to supervise on digital devices.” EIN Presswire reported on what Doak-Gebauer said about online safety: The Internet has provided a “virtual buffet” for predation, by unknowns, but also peers and “peer victimizers.” Peer victimizers are the fastest growing group of predators, and can be the most damaging. Too often children have sent nudes in confidence to a “friend,” only to find their pictures have been broadcast throughout a school and a community. This causes anxiety, depression, suicide, and other emotions.  “With today’s apps and digital devices, one nude picture in a school of 1,000 can circulate within minutes, less than an hour,” says Doak-Gebauer. “We are all fearful of COVID but we have to remember our children online. Police have warned they are listening to the chatter among predators. Predators are bragging about how easy it is to access their prey online – our children.” Therapists are seeing children as young as six years old who have pornography addiction issues. The pandemic crisis and the possible long-term effects of online negative experiences, has given Doak-Gebauer an even greater determination to help parents and caregivers in their challenges to protect children online.  Doak-Gebauer said her “theory of digital supervision is necessary for online child and family protection,” according to her website. She has written several books on the subject. “Too many adults are unaware their family is affected because of the sophistication of predators on the Internet with their children,” Doak-Gebauer said.

Tuesday on CNN, host Anderson Cooper criticized President Donald Trump for his messaging on masks and his tweets about MSNBC host Joe Scarborough. Cooper said, “Leadership today also apparently consists of spreading vile conspiracy theories on Twitter about a former staffer for then-Congressman Joe Scarborough and doing it over and over again. Traumatizing her family and her husband so deeply that he begged the company to take down the president’s tweets because they’re not true about his wife.” After playing a clip of Trump defending his Tweets at a press conference earlier, Cooper said, “What a little man. He’s just a little man. He’s the leader of the free world, and he is a little, little man. A self-proclaimed wartime leader — a leader in the midst, he says, of a transition to greatness for the country, spreading falsehoods about a dead woman, despite the pain and the pleas of her husband and family and doesn’t have the guts to say he doesn’t care about what they think. No, no, he doesn’t have the guts to say, ‘You know what, I don’t care what they think because this serves my political purposes.’ That’s why he’s doing it. He doesn’t have the guts to say that because he is just a little man despite his girth and size. He’s a little man inside, and he knows that. That, too, is now what leadership looks like. The president of the United States raising conspiracy theories about a dead woman, though her family is begging Twitter to take them down.” He added, “That’s where we are. In the midst of a pandemic, this is what we’re talking about, is what the president is talking about every single day. You think it’s normal. You start to think this is just normal. It’s not. Man, we are in trouble.” Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Democrat Charlotte City Councilman Larken Egleston said Monday there was “no way” the GOP convention scheduled to take place August 24 could go on as planned due to the coronavirus. “There’s no way for the governor at this point to say he could have an arena full of people or that Charlotte could have 50,000 people coming into town for any event. And frankly, I think the only thing you can say definitively is that wouldn’t be responsible three months from now,” Egleston said in an appearance on CNN’s New Day. “Mar-a-Lago might be willing to host the convention that has no safety precautions in place, but Charlotte, North Carolina, is not,” says Charlotte councilman Larken Egleston​ about President Trump threatening to pull GOP convention from the city.https://t.co/WUDk3Nt69U pic.twitter.com/uYnnXhKBKa — New Day (@NewDay) May 26, 2020  “So if we’re going to host this convention, it’s going to have to look very different than we thought it was going to, and the president should acknowledge that,” he added. President Donald Trump threatened to pull the GOP convention from Charlotte if North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper could not promise it could go on as planned. “Unfortunately, Democrat Governor Roy Cooper is still in Shutdown mood and unable to guarantee that by August we will be allowed full attendance in the arena … Plans are being made by many thousands of enthusiastic Republicans, and others, to head to beautiful North Carolina in August,” Trump wrote on Twitter. I love the Great State of North Carolina, so much so that I insisted on having the Republican National Convention in Charlotte at the end of August. Unfortunately, Democrat Governor, @RoyCooperNC is still in Shutdown mood & unable to guarantee that by August we will be allowed… — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 25, 2020  …full attendance in the Arena. In other words, we would be spending  millions of dollars building the Arena to a very high standard without even knowing if the Democrat Governor would allow the Republican Party to fully occupy the space. Plans are being…. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 25, 2020  Republicans insist that they are moving forward with plans for an in-person convention come August, despite all the uncertainty about the coronavirus and warnings from public health officials about avoiding large gatherings. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said officials from other states have offered to host the convention if things with North Carolina fall through. “We want to have it in North Carolina,” McDaniel said on Fox & Friends Monday. “The president loves North Carolina. It’s just the governor, and he’s got to work with us.” The Democrats, on the other hand, have already scaled back their convention plans in Milwaukee on August 17. Although plans have not been finalized, they plan to take key portions of the convention online.

With Loveland City Schools in Ohio closed due to the novel coronavirus pandemic, bus drivers bid farewell to the class of 2020 in their own way. “We’re the first face they see in the morning and the last one they see before they head home,” 23-year bus driver and district courier Lisa Moorhead told Good Morning America on Monday. “We share hugs, they tell us stories and make us laugh,” she added. “We share a lot with these kids — probably more than people realize.” And the dedicated workers were not going to let even a global pandemic stop them from saying farewell to the newest generation of graduates. They lined up 22 buses across the empty school parking lot in tribute to the 392 members of the graduating class, while art and photography teacher Jim Barrett used a drone to record footage. The video was posted to the school district’s official Facebook page. “Some of us have been around long enough to transport these kids since kindergarten and some of us have only been working with the district for a few years, but the one thing we all have in common is the love for our students,” driver Jennifer Bloom Bowman said. “This is a huge accomplishment and anyway we can show them some love, we will do it. So here’s to the class of 2020. Your bus drivers are proud of all of you.”

Skateboarders took matters into their own hands on Memorial Day, clearing sand from the skate park on Venice Beach that Mayor Eric Garcetti’s administration had filled in over a month ago to enforce coronavirus “social distancing.” Garcetti closed the skate parks in March. As Breitbart News reported, several skate parks were filled in with sand by local authorities in Southern California in mid-April. Local surf magazine Shacked happened to be on the scene at Venice Beach when L.A. Parks and Recreation employees began shoveling and bulldozing sand into the skate park there, too. Others also posted photos and videos:  But on Monday, with state restrictions easing and the beach itself reopened for recreation, the skaters struck back. Wielding pickaxes and shovels, brooms and buckets, skaters hauled the sand out of the park themselves. Young and old, men and women, black and white, the volunteers were a picture of Los Angeles — as they defied the city’s orders. “By mid-afternoon on Memorial Day, the park had been completely cleared of the sand … and boarders performed tricks in the bowls well into the evening,” TMZ reported. Police officers reportedly stood by, and did not interfere. Photos captured by Getty Images appeared to show skateboarders making earlier, short-lived attempts at removing the sand.

Gavin Newsom for filling in the skate parks; it was local authorities that did so, though he supported closing the beaches): California skaters are taking back the skate parks that Newsom filled with sand.

Tuesday on CNN’s “Situation Room,” presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden said President Donald Trump not wearing a mask in public amid the coronavirus pandemic was because he is an “absolute fool.” Dana Bash said, “You mentioned the mask, that you wore a mask yesterday. President Trump went to a Memorial Day service. He did not wear a mask. It’s not just some people making fun of you. He did. He went on Twitter, retweeted a photo of you wearing it, he’s trying to belittle you for wearing a mask, making it seem like a sign of weakness. Is it?” Biden said, “He’s a fool, an absolute fool to talk that way. Every leading doc in the world is saying you should wear a mask when you’re in a crowd, and especially when you know you’re going to be in a position where you’re going to inadvertently get closer than 12 feet to somebody. I know we’re 12 feet apart, I get that. But it’s just absolutely —this macho stuff, for a guy — I shouldn’t get going, but it’s cost people lives. It’s costing people’s lives. Like I said, we’re almost 100,000 dead today. 100,000 people. Columbia study showing, if he had just started a week earlier, we would have saved thousands of lives. I mean, this is a tragedy.” Bash said, “Wearing a mask has become a cultural and political flashpoint. The president is involved in that, even stoking that.” Biden said, “Sure he is, and he’s stoking deaths. That’s not going to increase the likelihood that people are going to be better off.” Bash said, “Do you think wearing a mask projects strength or weakness?” Biden said, “Leadership. What it projects is leadership. Presidents are supposed to lead, not engage in folly, and be falsely masculine. It reminds me of the guys that I grew up with playing ball. They would walk around with a ball in their hand, but they didn’t like to hit very much.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

NEW YORK (AP) — A rookie at the major league minimum would make a higher percentage of his salary than multimillionaire stars like Mike Trout or Gerrit Cole under a sliding-scale proposal by big league teams that players found “extremely disappointing.” Major League Baseball made the proposal to the players’ union on Tuesday during a digital meeting rather than the 50-50 revenue-sharing plan that owners initially approved for their negotiators on May 11, two people familiar with the plan told The Associated Press. The people spoke on condition of anonymity because the details were not announced. In addition, the union said “the sides also remain far apart on health and safety protocols” aimed at starting the pandemic-delayed season around the Fourth of July. “We made a proposal to the union that is completely consistent with the economic realities facing our sport,” MLB said in a statement. “We look forward to a responsive proposal from the MLBPA.” The revenue-sharing plan earlier this month was met with immediately hostility from the union the day owners gave their negotiators the go-ahead. That plan was not presented to players when talks began the following day.
During that session, MLB gave the union a presentation claiming billions of dollars of anticipated losses and held off making a proposal for two weeks. Salaries in the major leagues range from $563,500 at the minimum to $36 million each for Trout, the three-time MVP outfielder on the Los Angeles Angels, and Cole, the pitcher signed by the New York Yankees as a free agent. According to a study by the AP, 369 of 899 players have salaries of $600,000 or less, according to the rosters frozen in March. Under MLB’s proposal, the playoffs would expand from 10 teams to 14 and players would receive more money if the postseason is played. Usually, salaries are earned during the regular season only and players receive money from the postseason pool, a maximum of about $382,000 last year for a full share on World Series champion Washington. Players agreed March 26 to a deal in which they would receive prorated shares of their salaries based on what percentage of each team’s 162-game schedule is played. In exchange, players were guaranteed that if no games are played they would receive service time for 2020 matching what they accrued earned in 2019. MLB told the union on May 12 it hoped to play a season with an 82-game schedule that would have teams play 13 games against each division rival and six against every club in the corresponding division in the other league: AL East vs. NL East, for example. Several governors have said teams are welcome to play in their regular-season ballparks but without fans due to the new coronavirus and mandates for social distancing. MLB told the union during the May 12 presentation if teams paid players prorated salaries the clubs would combine to have negative $3.58 billion earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Players were scheduled to earn about $4 billion in salary this year. Many players and union leadership have said the March 26 agreement would stand and no additional salary should be given up. Tampa Bay Rays All-Star pitcher Blake Snell , the 2018 AL Cy Young Award winner, said he would not take the mound this year if his pay is cut further, proclaiming: “I’m not playing unless I get mine.” Teams are worried about being at risk if a second wave of the virus causes cancellation of the postseason, which results in MLB receiving $787 million in broadcast revenue this year. There is room for maneuvering in the economic negotiations, but no commitment on what areas to delve into.
Players could propose a longer regular season, which would result in receiving a higher percentage of their salary in the initial calculation of cuts. For instance, increasing to 94 games would reduce the initial cut from 49.4% to 42%. That could be accomplished by adding a week, inserting a few additional doubleheaders and eliminating a couple of off-days. In addition, the sides could start to address next offseason’s market for spending on free agents and players eligible for arbitration. The union could propose suspending the luxury tax for 2020 and 2021, which in theory would give the higher-revenue teams more money to spend, and to eliminate the loss of amateur draft picks for clubs signing qualified free agents. Lower-revenue clubs would want something in return. One possibility would be to give them additional competitive balance-round picks in amateur drafts, where a pick in the 42-52 range overall yields prospects with slot values of $1.4 million to $1.8 million who have a better chance historically of becoming big leaguers. As protection to teams against a lost postseason, salaries could be deferred with interest.

President Donald Trump said he was puzzled that former Vice President Joe Biden wore a mask on Monday during an outdoor Memorial Day event during the coronavirus pandemic, but Trump denied making fun of him. “Biden can wear a mask, but he was standing outside with his wife, perfect conditions, perfect weather,” Trump said when asked about it. Biden and his wife, Jill Biden, arrived at a Memorial Day event wearing black masks as they laid a wreath in honor of soldiers who gave their lives in service to the United States. Trump noted that he had not seen Biden and his wife not wearing masks with each other when they were indoors. “They’re inside, they don’t wear masks, and so I thought it was very unusual that he had one on,” he said. Trump denied mocking Biden by retweeting a photo of the former vice president in a mask posted by Fox News host Brit Hume. This might help explain why Trump doesn’t like to wear a mask in public. Biden today. pic.twitter.com/9l1gw1ljBE — Brit Hume (@brithume) May 25, 2020  “I thought it was fine, I wasn’t criticizing him at all. Why would I do a thing like that?” Trump asked. Trump responded to a question from Reuters reporter Jeff Mason about Biden and masks during the coronavirus pandemic. When Mason asked a second question, Trump urged him to remove his mask so he could understand him. Can you take it off, because I can’t hear you,” Trump said. “I’ll just speak louder sir,” Mason replied. “Because you want to be politically correct, go ahead,” Trump said. “No sir, it’s just because I want to wear the mask,” Mason replied.

President Donald Trump criticized governors on Tuesday who ordered that coronavirus patients be sent to nursing homes, placing the lives of elderly residents at risk. Older adults are particularly vulnerable to the effects of the disease. “We are using every tool at our disposal to protect our nursing homes from outbreaks,” the president said, speaking at a press briefing in the Rose Garden at the White House. “You saw the disaster of how badly some of the governors handled nursing homes. “It is a disgrace what they have done. What some of the governors have done is a disgrace.” Trump did not refer to any governors by name, but he was referring to states like New York, New Jersey, and others that required nursing homes to accept COVID-19 patients, despite knowing the elevated risk to the elderly. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo issued a directive on March 25 that even prevented nursing homes from testing new arrivals for coronavirus. (The only early coverage came from conservative radio host Mark Levin and the Wall Street Journal.) More than one third of all coronavirus deaths in the U.S. happened in nursing homes, and more than one half in some states. California issued a similar directive, but reversed it after early public criticism. Cuomo waited until May 10 to change his order. Other states took early action to protect nursing homes. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) notably set nursing homes apart from the rest of the community, even as he took heavy criticism from the national media for declining to shut down his state’s economy until after most other states had done so. Trump noted Tuesday that he expects to meet with Gov. Cuomo, at Cuomo’s request, later this week. He has typically pointed to his good working relations with governors of both parties during the crisis. Joel B.

America’s economy has consistently taken a hit ever since the coronavirus pandemic began and Democrats around the country have made it clear that they do not want to see President Donald Trump revive it. A newly published piece from Politico, titled The general election scenario that Democrats are dreading, provided insight and reports by former top Obama administration economist Jason Furman. In his calculations, Furman concluded, “We are about to see the best economic data we’ve seen in the history of this country.” Upon making his remarks during a Zoom call, Furman said the former Cabinet secretaries and Federal Reserve chairs looked “puzzled.” “Everyone looked puzzled and thought I had misspoken,” Furman stated. According to Politico, “Furman’s counterintuitive pitch has caused some Democrats, especially Obama alumni, around Washington to panic.” “This is my big worry,” said a former Obama White House official, who added that concern among top party officials is “high, high, high, high.” An informal adviser to Joe Biden said his campaign is “very much aware” that a roaring economy could soon be on its way before the November presidential election. In his prediction, Furman said the economic bounce-back “can be very very fast because people go back to their original job, they get called back from furlough, you put the lights back on in your business. Given how many people were furloughed and how many businesses were closed you can get a big jump out of that. It will look like a V.” “I totally agree,” Larry Kudlow, head of the White House National Economic Council, said in regards to Furman’s analysis. “Q3 may be the single best GDP quarter since regular data. 2nd half super big growth, transitioning to 4 percent or more in 2021.” “Even today when we are at over 20 million unemployed Trump gets high marks on the economy, so I can’t imagine what it looks like when things go in the other direction,” said another former Obama White House official. “I don’t think this is a challenge for the Biden campaign. This is the challenge for the Biden campaign. If they can’t figure this out they should all just go home.” Follow Kyle on Twitter @RealKyleMorris and Facebook.

On Memorial Day, while reporting from Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, MSNBC’s Cal Perry said people were not wearing masks. Host Katy Tur said, “Cal Perry, you’re in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, I’ve been following you on Twitter. I’ve seen you out there today. It seems like you might be one of the only people wearing a mask and practicing social distancing, tell me what it’s like to be there.” Perry said, “Trying to. Here’s the beachside here, Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, only a couple of hours from Chicago. This place fills up seasonally from Chicago. I walked through town yesterday, shooting some video, and it was really weird. I spent a few months in lockdown in London, a place where you don’t even go grocery shopping, you have it delivered. I think that is the case in most places in this country. Here, it’s as if it’s as any other Memorial Day, totally packed, thousands of people. I have to tell you the social distancing measures that these restaurants are putting into practice, they’re not working, they’re forcing some people outside, and then those people are standing in lines.” “As you said, not a lot of face coverings,” Perry continued. “In Illinois, about an hour away, they’re required. If here in Wisconsin, they will not. As you know, the governor put restrictions here in Wisconsin. Those were overturned by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, which has led to all this. You talked to businesses here. They say sure we’re grateful for the business, but it’s their employees who are worried about their health, the health of their families. No one knows how this is going to play out. They say they’re brave. This is way of getting out. This is their freedom from Illinois. They are telling us to go home. Doesn’t seem to be any social distancing and not a lot of care when it comes to coronavirus, Katy.” Tur said, “So the people there just not worried about it, they’re not worried about their own personal safety?” Perry said, “I haven’t met anybody who is. I met some folks from Lake Geneva. They said they’re worried about it that the second spike. They are worried about those folks coming from Chicago. At the same time, they’ll add, this is place that relies on that business. People here want a little bit more funding to these programs so that they could stay closed. Again, I think they felt the Supreme Court made the decision it’s time to open up. You can see here just around, wearing them. Katy. A man walking by said,  “Including the cameraman.” Perry agreed saying, “Yeah, including the cameraman.” Tur said, “Striking images. Kyle, thank you very much. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

The NHL will abandon the rest of the regular season and go straight into the playoffs with 24 teams instead of 16 — if it is able to resume play. The decision, announced Tuedsay by Commissioner Gary Bettman, is no guarantee that games are coming back. The NHL and the NHL Players’ Association must still figure out health and safety protocols and solve other issues. Still, ironing out the format and narrowing down its two potential playoff host cities to a list of 10 represents significant progress since global sports were largely shut down in March as the coronavirus outbreak turned into a pandemic. Play could resume in late July, with the Stanley Cup Final decided in September or even later. Groups of 12 teams representing each of the two conferences will be limited to playing in two cities, yet to be determined, with three-week training camps opening no earlier than July 1. Bettman said voluntary workouts could begin in early June. “We hope this is a step back toward normalcy,” Bettman said. Earlier this week, the league and NHLPA issued extensive protocols once players are allowed to return to their facilities. They include a maximum of six players on the ice at a time, no contact and no coaches for voluntary workouts. Instead of limiting the Cup chase to the usual 16 teams that qualify for the playoffs, the league and players agreed to expand the field to 24 of its 31 teams because of the unusual circumstances. That means the likes of the Montreal Canadiens are still alive despite being nine points out of a playoff spot when hockey was halted March 12. But not all teams will have the same path to hockey’s storied trophy. The top four teams in each conference ranked by points percentage — Boston, Tampa Bay, Washington and Philadelphia in the East and St. Louis, Colorado, Vegas and Dallas in the West — will play separate round-robin tournaments to determine seeding. The remaining 16 teams will be seeded by conference, setting up best-of-five series in the East of No. 5 Pittsburgh vs. No. 12 Montreal, No. 6 Carolina vs. No. 11 New York Rangers, No. 7 New York Islanders vs. No. 10 Florida and No. 8 Toronto vs. No. 9 Columbus. In the West, it would be No. 5 Edmonton vs. No. 12 Chicago, No. 6 Nashville vs. No. 11 Arizona, No. 7 Vancouver vs. No. 10 Minnesota and No. 8 Calgary vs. No. 9 Winnipeg. “Any plan for the resumption of play by definition cannot be perfect,” Bettman said. “But we believe we have constructed an overall plan that includes all teams that as a practical matter might have had a chance of qualifying for the playoffs when the season was paused, and this plan will produce a worthy Stanley Cup champion who will have run the postseason gauntlet that is unique to the NHL.” Games are expected to be played in two hub cities and Bettman said 10 are in the running: Chicago, Columbus, Ohio, Dallas, Las Veas, Pittsburgh and Minneapolis/St. Paul in the U.S. and Edmonton, Toronto and Vancouver in Canada. While there are still details to work out, including whether the first two rounds are best of five or seven, Bettman said he expects the best-of-seven Stanley Cup Final to be played in full in one of the two hub cities. Each team would be limited to a total of 50 people in the city it plays in. “It’s not easy getting everybody on board with all the different countries, the players, the teams that were in the playoffs, teams that may not be in the playoffs and getting that all agreed upon with the union,” Buffalo Sabres owner Kim Pegula told The Associated Press. “For us to even finish the season and award (the Stanley Cup), I know a lot of work went into it. But I know how important it was for our players, our fans, our league to make sure that we conclude it.” The decision to call off the 189 regular-season games that were not played ends the season for Buffalo, New Jersey, Anaheim, Los Angeles, San Jose, Ottawa and Detroit. Those seven teams will now prepare for one of potentially two draft lotteries to determine the top 15 selections. The lottery will be held June 26, with another scheduled later depending on which of the remaining eight teams qualify for the 16-team playoff.

Chinese officials have said they will continue to invest heavily in Africa in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic as a means of supporting the continent’s increasing debt to Beijing, according to an article published in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) newspaper Global Times on Monday. In April, the G20 agreed to a deal in which its wealthiest member nations were asked to suspend debt payments to the end of the year for the world’s poorest, most indebted nations — most in Africa — as they struggle through the global recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Beijing has hesitated to comply with the proposal, insisting it will deal with African nations on a “case-by-case” basis, but refusing to write off African debts, as the G20 suggests. As the single largest creditor to Africa, China’s reluctance to comply with the measures significantly hinders the deal. In the CCP report published on Monday, the article’s author — “a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation under the Chinese Ministry of Commerce” — reiterated Beijing’s belief that suspending Africa’s debts would not be helpful, an argument it made last month shortly after the G20 deal was announced.  “The purpose of the loans was to facilitate African development, and China aims to solve debt problems through development. Simply offering write-offs would not be in accordance with African countries’ long-term development interests,” the article read. Instead, China offered examples of what it deemed an appropriate response to the African debt problem: For countries facing extreme challenges, China may increase grants which do not need to be paid back, among other supportive measures. China’s support of projects concerning people’s livelihoods, like constructing schools and hospitals, may be enhanced so as to speed up the resumption of production. From a long-term perspective, China will continue to support infrastructure construction in African countries to help their industrialization and modernization, the essential direction of China-Africa cooperation. Through its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China expands its global reach by recruiting developing nations throughout Asia, Europe, Africa and Latin America to develop various infrastructure projects. The projects are financed through predatory loans, which Beijing uses to encourage the foreign nation’s dependence on China. Between 2000 and 2017, “China advanced more than $143 billion to 49 ­African governments and their state-owned companies,” according to data from the China Africa Research Initiative at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies.

The segment begins with MSNBC anchor Katy Tur asking Perry whether people are concerned for their safety despite the ongoing Chinese coronavirus pandemic. “I haven’t met anybody who he,” Perry replied. “I met some folks actually from Lake Geneva who lived in the area and staying a few miles outside of town and they said they are worried about it.” INSTANT CLASSIC FROM @MSNBC: ANCHOR: "Are the people there just not worried about it?

You shouldn’t have to breathe somebody else’s secondhand smoke. I shouldn’t have to breathe exhaled COVID-19 in somebody’s breath,” Gupta said. “Nobody should. We should institute mandatory masks in public when you can’t guarantee social distancing. That means retail stores, public transportation, workplaces. That’s absolutely where we should be heading.” On Tuesday, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) announced residents will be required to wear a mask inside public places as of Friday — after he was caught taking a selfie without one.

Rory McIlroy does not have encouraging news about the upcoming 2020 Ryder Cup in September: He doesn’t think it’s going to happen. Speaking to BBC Sports, McIlroy said that he does not see how the tournament can be played in this coronavirus era. “My personal hunch is that I don’t see how it is going to happen, so I do not think that it will happen,” he told the British newser. “I think the majority of players would like to see it pushed back until 2021 so that they can play in front of crowds and have the atmosphere that makes the Ryder Cup so special,” McIlroy added. “The players are the ones that make the Ryder Cup. If they are not on board with it and don’t want to play, then there is no Ryder Cup. “I see it being pushed back until 2021, and, honestly, I think that will be the right call,” McIlroy concluded. The world’s top golfer, whose caddy recently tested positive for COVID-19, joined a broadcast of the first live golf since the coronavirus threat began with a round of golf live on TV last week in a charitable match at Seminole Golf Club, in Florida. NBC Sports claimed that the game, also featuring players Dustin Johnson, Rickie Fowler, and Matthew Wolff, earned 2.35 million viewers. The PGA Tour is scheduled to restart reglar play without fans in attendance on June 11 at the Charles Schwab Colonial tournament in Texas.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer blamed her husband’s “failed attempt at humor” for the controversy surrounding his request to get preferential treatment to get his boat in the in the water just before the holiday weekend. Whitmer addressed reporters in Lansing on Tuesday and tried to preempt their questions with a statement about the matter. After lamenting the amount of alleged negative and threatening comments she receives on social media, she said, “My husband made a failed attempt at humor last week when checking with the small business that helps with our boat and dock up north.” “Knowing it wouldn’t make a difference, he jokingly asked if being married to me might move him up in the queue,” she said. “Obviously with the motorized boating prohibition in our early days of COVID-19, he thought it might get a laugh. It didn’t,” Whitmer continued. “And to be honest, I wasn’t laughing either when it was relayed to me, because I knew how it would be perceived. He regrets it. I wish it wouldn’t have happened, and that’s really all we have to say about it,” she said. A reporter asked Whitmer a question about her and her husband’s whereabouts during Memorial Day weekend and if they have visited northern Michigan. “My husband did go up to our place in Antrim County and rake some leaves and came home,” she said, not specifying when that roughly 400-mile, six-hour round trip took place. “So he was there. We did not all pile in the car to go enjoy our second home, although that would have been permitted if we had,” Whitmer said. “But the fact of the matters is, he was there briefly for a night, I think, one or two nights, and came right back home after he raked our leaves,” the governor claimed.

The Chinese city of Hangzhou is considering proposals to make the smartphone-based coronavirus health tracking system permanent, expanding it to include factors such as how much sleep citizens are getting, how much alcohol they drink, and how frequently they exercise. China’s health tracking system uses a smartphone app that became, in effect, mandatory for all citizens to carry. The app generated a QR barcode that can be scanned by various officials to determine if an individual is healthy enough to travel or enter a particular facility. There are some variations in how the app works across China, but most versions of it generate a green, yellow, or red health rating for each citizen. Use of the health-tracking app is winding down as the Chinese government claims to have the coronavirus under control, but Hangzhou – a city of about ten million that sits about an hour away from Shanghai by train and prides itself on tech innovations, serving as the headquarters for the immense Alibaba corporation – may keep the system online permanently as a means of tracking and controlling the health of every resident. CNBC explained the proposal on Tuesday, asking some unsettling questions about where the tremendous amount of data needed to micromanage the health of ten million people will come from, how carefully their privacy will be safeguarded, and precisely what will happen to those unfortunate souls with poor health ratings: In Hangzhou, the government’s proposals involve giving a person a health score. This will be based on various factors including electronic medical records, results of physical examinations and lifestyle choices. In a screenshot of the barcode-based system, a person’s health score can be seen going down because they drank alcohol and smoked cigarettes. Meanwhile, a good amount of sleep plus exercise increases a person’s score.  It is unclear how the government would collect such information or whether this app will come to fruition.  The health code that Hangzhou residents are currently using related to the coronavirus is run via Alipay, the mobile payments platform owned by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial. When asked about the new app, the company told CNBC it has “not been contacted by any party with respect to this project.” A spokesperson reiterated that protecting the privacy of users is “a strict requirement for all third party service providers on our platform.” Nervous Hangzhou residents will not be reassured by the example of China’s infamous social credit system, which began as an effort to crack down on crime and terrorism, but quickly evolved into a system that denies “bad citizens” the right to climb aboard a train. Indeed, Technode noted on Tuesday that the Hangzhou proposals already make the health code system far more complex than the traffic-light ratings employed during the pandemic, giving each citizen a “sliding-scale numerical score” whose calculations will not be entirely transparent to the general population. “How much you’ve drunk, smoked, exercised and slept on any given day can all affect your points total, boosting or lowering your ranking,” CNN noted, observing that the system will also be able to track the movement of individuals around Hangzhou because the QR code appearing on each citizen’s phone will be constantly scanned at the entrance to buildings and before boarding public transportation. CNN included a few examples of how the system would work, as proposed by Hangzhou Municipal Health Commission director Sun Yongrong: The score can be affected by your daily activities: 15,000 steps of daily exercise will increase your score by 5 points, 200 milliliters of baijiu — a sorghum-based Chinese liquor known for its high alcohol content — will lower your score by 1.5 points, five cigarettes will cost you 3 points, and 7.5 hours of sleep will add one point to your score, the demonstration shows. There might also be a “group health score” for companies and residential committees, Sun said. A demonstration shows the health score for a company can be based on factors such as how much its employees exercise and sleep per day, how many employees have conducted annual health checkups, and how well chronic disease are controlled among its employees. Sun did not give details on how the data will be collected, whether the app will be compulsory, or how the score will affect people’s daily life and business operations. According to CNN, Chinese social media users are apprehensive about the Hangzhou proposal, voicing concerns about privacy and the potential for unfair treatment by the system. Some worried that data from the system could be obtained by everyone from marketing operations to potential employers. “Points will be deducted for smoking, drinking and not sleeping enough, does this mean our lives will be completely monitored?” asked one user, evidently getting the hang of what life will be like under the increasingly aggressive high-tech tyranny that rules his country.

Thousands of people across cities in Ecuador defied Chinese coronavirus social distancing advice on Monday to protest against economic cuts passed by President Lenin Moreno aimed at tackling the crisis. Last week, Moreno announced aggressive public spending cuts including the closure of state companies and embassies around the world. The move infuriated leftist trade unions, who complain that they are paying for the austerity rather than Ecuador’s elite. He also confirmed the liquidation of the TAME airline, a state-run carrier that has lost over $400 million in the last five years. Public sector working hours have been reduced by 25 percent and civil servants are facing a hefty 16 percent pay cut. Around 150,000 people have lost their jobs as a result of the lockdown. The government claims the current cost to the economy stands at $8 billion. Around 2,000 people marched in the capital Quito, waving flags and banners and shouting anti-government slogans calling for a restoration of the education budget and opposition to police repression. Demonstrations also took place in other major cities, including Guayaquil, the epicenter of Ecuador’s coronavirus outbreak, where union leaders claimed that hundreds marched through the city. “If the coronavirus doesn’t kill us, the government will,” one trader union leader in Guayaquil told Reuters news agency.

Several protesters were injured. Police also attacked journalists who were covering the demostration, according to Diario Expreso. Police also arbitrarily detained four human rights defenders during the protest, according to the Alliance of Human Rights Organizations and CDH. For several hours, neither CDH staff nor the Ombudsperson’s Office were able to contact those arrested. According to CDH, the police report said the four detainees had verbally assaulted police officers. Vivanco added that at a court hearing the following day, a judge ruled that the police had failed to provide evidence of a crime and dropped all charges against them. Similar left-wing demonstrations broke out across Ecuador last October after Moreno proposed an end to a decades-old gasoline subsidy introduced under Rafael Correa’s former socialist administration. As part of the pushback, leftist groups began burning roadblocks and looting businesses to pressure the government into scrapping the policy, which they eventually did. There were also reports of organizers employing foreigners, particularly struggling Venezuelans, to participate in the violence in return for payment. Ecuador remains the South American country most severely affected by the coronavirus pandemic. According to the latest figures, at least 3,203 have died as a result of the virus, equivalent to 187.48 per million people, placing it just behind the United States in terms of severity. At one point, the situation became so severe that corpses were being left in the street, forcing the government to construct a mass grave for their disposal.

If you liked the XFL, there’s good news for you. If you did not like XFL founder Vince McMahon, there’s also good news for you. First, the good news for the league. According to a report from Sports Business Journal’s Ben Schriver, there are twenty different bidders vying for the XFL’s assets. All of whom, reportedly, plan on the league playing in the 2021 season. The XFL's investment banker says 20 possible bidders have already entered into confidentiality agreements as they consider buying its assets from bankruptcy. All hope to execute a 2021 season, per court filings. — Ben Fischer (@BenFischerSBJ) May 26, 2020  Also, according to the court filings, Vince McMahon will not be among those attempting to purchase the assets. "I'm not going to be a bidder," McMahon said in a deposition. The filing called the claims "inflammatory rhetoric and unsubstantiated accusations." — Kevin Seifert (@SeifertESPN) May 26, 2020  According to Pro Football Talk: The prospect of Vince McMahon trying to buy the league came up when Daniel Kaplan of TheAthletic.com noted objections raised by the league’s creditors last week. Those creditors objected to a proposals made in bankruptcy proceedings because they believed McMahon was moving to position himself ‘to acquire the debtor at a fire-sale price’ after the league’s return season came to a halt due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The XFL delivered solid ratings, averaging more than a million viewers per game. Those numbers put the league above what most English Premier League games were getting on NBC Sports Network, and more than most college basketball games were earning on ESPN. The league got through five weeks of action before having to shut down due to the coronavirus. Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn

White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany confirmed to reporters that both Katie Miller and her husband Stephen Miller had returned to work at the White House on Tuesday. Katie Miller, the press secretary for Vice President Mike Pence, tested positive for the coronavirus on May 8th, sending both she and Stephen Miller into quarantine. Katie Miller confirmed her return to the White House on Twitter. “Back at work today after three NEGATIVE COVID tests,” she wrote. “Thank you to all my amazing doctors and everyone who reached out with support.” Miller also revealed publicly that she was pregnant, thanking her husband for taking care of her. “I couldn’t have done it without my amazing husband who took great care of his pregnant wife,” she wrote.

Tuesday on MSNBC, network political commentator former Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO) accused President Donald Trump of not being a “real man” because of his refusal to be photographed wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. McCaskill said, “Yeah, you know, Peter’s reporting and many other great reporters in this country have revealed the truth of the matter and that is that Donald Trump thinks he’s the victim of this virus. That somehow, this has been done to him. And he’s never seen his role as someone to protect, to empathize, to be aggressive in terms of safety. Only Donald Trump could make wearing a mask political. And what he has done is he has basically convinced people that if you’re wearing a mask, you’re somehow not manly. Well, real men wear masks. Donald Trump is not a real man. Joe Biden was over the weekend.” Discussing Gov. Doug Burgum (R-ND) getting emotional while urging his residents to wear masks, McCaskill said, “Yeah, it’s hard not and maybe because I can cry at commercials, you know, I’m not ashamed of the fact I cry easily —when I watched that video for the first time, I choked up. And maybe it’s because I’ve got people in my family I worry about. And when I think of their safety, I realize that how others are viewing this impacts how healthy they can remain. And so it is one of these things where that governor was really kind of showing an ethos of being what Tim McGraw would say, humble and kind. He was speaking from his heart. He was talking about kindness as a value. But how long has it been since the president of the United States conveyed anything close to humble or kind? I mean, this is a braggart, this is a liar, this is somebody who is mean and mean-spirited and has done terrible things to people unfairly, through the pinnacle of power in this world. This virus hasn’t been done to him. He has done bad in relation to this virus.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

A newly-released Arizona poll shows former Vice President Joe Biden holds a slim lead over President Donald Trump for November’s presidential election in the swing state. The HighGround Public Affairs survey found Biden, the presumptive Democrat nominee, at 47 percent support among respondents, with President Trump at 45.3 percent. The “some other candidate” option garnered 4.3 percent, and 3.5 percent said they didn’t know which candidate they support, the poll shows. The poll, conducted between May 18 and May 22, comprised of 400 likely voters, and has a 4.9 percent margin of error. “The partisan advantage was set at +4% GOP based on previous election trends and expected Presidential Election turnout,” HighGround Public Affairs notes. “In the wake of the most challenging and arguably worst three months of his term, President Trump has shown that he can remain competitive in Arizona,” said HighGround, Inc. Senior Vice President of Research and Strategy Paul Bentz. He said the virtual tie will be decided by the performance of the candidates’ “turnout game”: Despite several key swing constituencies not going in his favor and a deficit in Maricopa County, the state remains a ‘toss up’ because of his team’s laser focus on his key audiences.  Plus, there is still an additional 4 to 8% of the electorate up for grabs. As this boils down to a turnout game, we will need to keep our eyes on voter registration and enthusiasm during the primary over the next few months. One question on the survey asked: “If you blame anyone for the spread of the Coronavirus in the United States, who do you think is most to blame?” The question was open-ended; it did not give any answer choices. President Trump received the most blame, from 29.3% of respondents. In second was the response “Don’t Know/No One” at 25.3%, and then China, with 20.3%. In a separate poll published last week, figures show Biden leads President Trump by seven points in Arizona. The OH Predictive Insights (OHPI) survey found Biden at 50 percent and the president at 43 percent. A Democrat presidential nominee has not won Arizona since former President Clinton did in 1996. President Trump won Arizona in the 2016 election against Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton.

A report that the NFL could open minicamps for their players in June, had cold water thrown on it by none other than the players themselves. In response to a report from Yahoo which said that coaches could report to facilities next week and players would return after that for minicamps from June 15 to June 27, NFL Players Association (NFLPA) President JC Tretter noted that the current offseason programs are set to end on June 26, and the players have not agreed to any reopening plan. Players: our union has not agreed to any reopening plan. Any reports about coming back to work are hypothetical. You will hear from the NFLPA when there are new developments. — JC Tretter (@JCTretter) May 26, 2020  NFL Spokesman Brian McCarthy responded by making it clear that the league was not putting any dates on a “potential return.” Here’s ⁦@NFLprguy⁩ on the potential return of players to team facilities. pic.twitter.com/XnKh8pVLPA — Albert Breer (@AlbertBreer) May 26, 2020  In all likelihood, the Yahoo report was entirely accurate in terms of what the NFL is likely to propose to the players, it just got out before the NFL had actually proposed it to the players. Nonetheless, with severe quarantine states like New York, New Jersey, and California, all giving approval for their pro sports teams to get going, it’s very likely that minicamps will open soon.

White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany questioned Tuesday why former Vice President Joe Biden was wearing a mask outside on Memorial Day. One White House reporter questioned why President Trump retweeted a message on Twitter from Fox News host Brit Hume about Biden’s mask. This might help explain why Trump doesn’t like to wear a mask in public. Biden today. pic.twitter.com/9l1gw1ljBE — Brit Hume (@brithume) May 25, 2020  “The president’s excited to see that Joe emerged from the basement,” McEnany said. “It is a bit peculiar that in his basement right next to his wife he’s not wearing a mask, but he’s wearing one outdoors when he’s socially distanced.” Biden made a splash online after he emerged from his home quarantine for the first time in two months to lay a wreath at a military memorial in Delaware. McEnany said that President Trump “was not shaming anybody” for wearing a mask but noted that the CDC’s guidelines only recommend and do not mandate masks for people outside.

When the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic hit its peak, the Chinese government was quick to make use of smartphones to track citizens’ movements and isolate those who might be infected. Now, privacy experts are warning that these surveillance measures may stay in place once the pandemic has ended. One communist party official claims that Chinese people want to be surveilled, saying the app is “loved so much that you cannot bear to part with it.” The New York Times reports that when the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic was in full force in China, the government was quick to use citizens’ cell phones to identify and isolate people who could potentially be spreading the virus. Now, China claims that the virus is largely under control in the country, yet the government’s monitoring apps are slowly moving towards being a permanent part of Chinese peoples’ lives. The tracking software has reportedly been collecting information such as location data on people in hundreds of cities across China, but no limits have been set by authorities on how that data can be used. Zhou Jiangyong, the Communist Party secretary of the eastern tech hub of Hangzhou, has stated that the app should be an “intimate health guardian” for residents that is used often and “loved so much that you cannot bear to part with it.” Li Sihui, a researcher at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, wrote in a recent commentary: “Epidemic prevention and control needs the support of big data technology, but this does not mean agencies and individuals can randomly collect citizens’ information by borrowing the name of prevention and control.” Wang Xin, a novelist with 2.5 million followers on the Chinese social platform Weibo, wrote: “Doesn’t this brazenly violate privacy to surveil and discriminate against unhealthy people?” Another author, Shen Jiake, wrote: “I know that in this age of big data, it’s so easy for those who control data to check and use personal information in a matter of minutes,” but Jiake added that Hangzhou’s plan “crosses a line.” Other Chinese cities are no working on ways to continue using the apps, Shanghai reportedly wants to transform the app into a digital assistant for accessing local services of all kinds. The city of Xining uses the software to unlock coupons to local stores as a way to boost the economy. Authorities in Hangzhou began linking the city’s app to citizens’ medical records in April, enabling residents to schedule hospital visits via the app. A document from eh city government also outlines situations in which people’s codes could be scanned to receive a readout of their overall health. One user on the Chinese social media app Weibo commented: “Medical history and health checkup reports are personal privacy, why should they be included in health codes to show others?” They added: “Points will be deducted for smoking, drinking and not sleeping enough, does this mean our lives will be completely monitored?” Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) announced Tuesday that residents will be required to wear a mask inside public places beginning Friday as part of an effort to combat further spread of the Chinese coronavirus. Northam said in a press conference that people must wear masks “anywhere people can congregate” inside, including retail spaces, government facilities, and public transportation. Masks will also be required in restaurants, except while patrons are eating. Residents won’t have to wear a mask during exercise, and children 9-years-old and younger are exempt from the rule. “I am taking this step because science increasingly shows us that the virus spreads less easily when everyone is wearing face coverings,” said the governor. The new mask mandate will not be enforced by police, but by Virginia’s health department, explained Northam. “I’m not sure we need to get into specifics of what authority, at this stage,” he responded when pressed on how the state health officials will enforce the rules. “The criminal code is not the place you want this enforced, there are tremendous equity issues with enforcing this that we’re cognizant of,” added Clark Mercer, Northam’s chief of staff. During another part of his press conference, Northam acknowledged that he takes “full responsibility” for failing to wear a mask while visiting Virginia Beach over the weekend, saying he forgot his mask in his vehicle. “People held me accountable and I appreciate that,” he added. Critics on social media chided Northam, a physician, for not practicing what he has preached. “Physician, heal thyself,” tweeted Todd Gilbert, a Republican who is Virginia’s House Minority Leader. Northam posed for a selfie with a woman who said she knows the governor. She gave him a pat on the shoulder. “We just have to continue to remind people that we want to keep the social distance of 6 feet apart,” he said, when asked about the touch later. “That’s a challenge for a lot of folks because they’re just not used to doing that.” Virginia has more than 34,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 1,135 confirmed deaths as of Sunday, according to the state health department. The AP contributed to this report. 

Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser confirmed Tuesday there were no Chinese coronavirus-related deaths reported in the nation’s capital over the last 24 hours, marking the first day without fatalities since the numbers began to accumulate in late March. D.C. confirmed its first case of COVID-19, the disease produced by the virus, on March 7. “Today, we report that no D.C. resident lost their life to COVID on May 25, which is a good thing,” Bowser told reporters on Tuesday. Data provided by Bowser’s office showed that D.C. marked its first day with no deaths since March on Monday. LIVE: Updates on coronavirus (COVID-19) response in the District. Learn more: https://t.co/MEWs6uPfsI https://t.co/tt9MIIBalj — Mayor Muriel Bowser #StayHomeDC (@MayorBowser) May 26, 2020  After seeing a slight increase in new cases over the weekend, Bowser indicated that the city is back on track to begin a gradual reopening on Friday, “barring any new spikes.” “Tomorrow, we hope that the [downward] trends will continue, and we will be able to provide next steps on Phased One opening to be effective on this Friday, May 29,” Bowser said. However, the mayor suggested that the target date for reopening could change if conditions on the ground call for it. “We will continue to follow the science and begin our phased reopening when the data suggests that we can,” she said on Tuesday. Bowser announced that the district stands one day away from the 14-day sustained decline in the community spread — based on a five-day moving average — it needs to begin reopening non-essential businesses shut down to stem the spread of the highly contagious disease. “If the trend holds, we will be able to report 14 days of decline tomorrow,” she proclaimed. “We, of course, track community spread to understand whether we are able to manage and rapidly respond to any new increases.” D.C. also has sufficient healthcare capacity, data unveiled by the mayor showed. The district was reportedly operating at a bed occupancy rate of over 70 percent as of Sunday, which means hundreds of beds were still available, independent and city government assessments showed. The hospital bed occupancy rate has been below 80 percent for over 14 days, double the amount of days needed for reopening, Bowser’s data noted. In D.C., the COVID-19 transmission rate has also been low for 14 days, well beyond the three days required for a phased reopening, the mayor’s data further revealed. Currently, the nation’s capital can test all priority groups, as mandated by the district’s reopening guidelines. D.C. also has a “sufficient” capacity to contact trace all new cases and their close contacts, information from the mayor’s office showed. As of noon on Tuesday, 8,334 D.C. residents had tested positive for coronavirus, about 20 percent of the people tested, and 440 had lost their lives. The cumulative number of new cases is still increasing.

Aircraft manufacturers Boeing and Airbus announced this week that they are conducting tests to determine how the Chinese virus behaves on airplanes in flight. Their efforts, along with work by the FAA and CDC, are concentrated on ensuring safe flights as the public returns to the skies. According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, Boeing and Airbus are working to expedite the return to normal for commercial air travel. Both manufacturers are using computer modeling to simulate how the Chinese virus might travel during flight, along with collaborating with experts and academics in the United States and Europe. The report claims that the Federal Aviation Administration is working with aircraft manufacturers on strategies that will help them mitigate the spread of the virus during commercial flights. Stay tuned to Breitbart News for more updates on this story.

Officials from China’s province of Guangdong said on Monday they are planning to build dozens of high-level biosafety laboratories that should be able to safely handle infectious diseases, including at least one capable of handling Ebola. The South China Morning Post quoted Guangdong Department of Science and Technology director Wang Ruijun admitting his province has a dangerous shortage of top-level biosafety facilities, which is somewhat curious given that Guangdong was the source of the SARS outbreak in 2003.  The plan to remedy this shortage involves building as many as 30 labs rated at Bio-Safety Level (BSL) 3 and at least one BSL-4 lab, which would be qualified to handle deadly diseases like Ebola. The Chinese national government wants to build at least one BSL-3 lab in every province. Of course, another deadly disease is currently occupying the attention of the world and the news about Chinese biosafety labs in that case is mixed. The SCMP noted that China currently has two BSL-4 labs and one of them is the now-infamous Wuhan Institute of Virology, from which many critics of the Chinese government believe the coronavirus escaped. Wang pointed out that since much of China’s commerce and travel to the outside world pass through Guangdong’s Greater Bay Area, it makes sense to have “platforms and infrastructure and be equipped with the ability to diagnose, recognise and research, as well as the ability to respond to emergencies.” “The U.S. has close to 1,500 BSL-3 labs, and almost all medical organizations or medical schools have them. But, China lacks high-level biosafety labs, especially in Guangdong,” he said. Building more BSL-3 and BSL-4 labs, many of which would be located in or near existing hospital facilities, would help doctors diagnose new diseases more quickly while minimizing the risks of handling dangerous diseases at insecure facilities or transporting them to distant laboratories for analysis.  The Chinese government still insists the Wuhan Institute of Virology played no role in unleashing the coronavirus pandemic, but it seems willing to acknowledge that shipping dangerous viruses cross-country is a risky endeavor. Two weeks ago, Chinese officials admitted that laboratories were instructed to destroy valuable coronavirus samples but insisted this was done purely for safety reasons, not because the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) wanted to eliminate evidence that it knew the virus was highly communicable and dangerous long before it conceded as much to the rest of the world. Shi Zhengli, deputy director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology and a researcher known as the “Bat Woman” for her focus on coronaviruses in bats, warned in an interview with Chinese state television on Monday that “the viruses we have discovered are just the tip of the iceberg” and more pandemics are probably on the way. Shi’s interview, timed to coincide with the beginning of the CCP’s National People’s Congress session, repeated the standard government lines that international cooperation is crucial, efforts to blame China for the pandemic are “very regrettable,” and her institute had nothing to do with the origins of the Wuhan coronavirus.

Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage has said that Remainers want the prime minister’s adviser, Dominic Cummings, fired, in order to have an excuse to extend the transition period. “It is clear that there are many — not all, but many, in the Remain camp particularly — who would like to see the back of him, who think Cummings going now may well aid them in getting us to extend beyond the end of this year,” Mr Farage said during his LBC show on Monday. Yesterday, Mr Cummings gave a press conference where he defended taking his family to Durham to be near relatives over concerns that both he and his wife would be incapacitated and unable to look after their four-year-old son. Mr Cummings has been under extreme scrutiny from the mainstream media, with Brexit backers criticising reporters and photojournalists for the hypocrisy of accusing him of breaching lockdown rules while breaking social distancing themselves as they huddled outside of his family home, pushing cameras into his face. They’re a bunch of shameless hypocrites.

Mr Cummings also criticised the media for reporting what he said were “false” stories about his travels during the lockdown, which he said contributed to the public outrage and calls for his resignation. Durham Police also admitted on Monday that earlier statements they had given about them speaking to the aide’s family had been misleading. The force had said previously that it had spoken to Mr Cummings’ father on April 1st to reiterate government advice on social distancing and essential travel — suggesting to the media and the public that the police suspected him of breaking lockdown rules — but backtracked to say that no such conversation was had. A police spokesman said: “We can further confirm that our officer gave no specific advice on coronavirus to any members of the family… Durham constabulary deemed that no further action was required in that regard. Our officer did, however, provide the family with advice on security issues.” Brexit Proxy Wars: Remain-Supporting Junior Minister Resigns from Boris Government https://t.co/6WmkOjIkaW — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 26, 2020  Breitbart London reported last week that while he and Prime Minister Boris Johnson were sick with coronavirus, they were working to stop a plan by Remainers to extend the transition period beyond December 31st, 2020, which would have delayed the UK finally leaving the EU’s institutions and halted the implementation of any new trade deals. A deal to extend the transition period had reportedly been “all but agreed”, but media described that Mr Cummings had returned to work “and the plan, concocted by underlings while he and Boris Johnson were laid out on their sickbeds, was scuppered”.

New Jersey’s Democrat Governor, Phil Murphy, has given the go-ahead for sports to restart in the Garden State. Murphy has given the OK for pro sports to restart, giving the NFL’s New York Giants, and New York Jets — both of which play in Jersey — the green light to open training facilities for the coming 2020 NFL season. In addition, when the NHL is ready to restart, the New Jersey Devils would also be allowed to resume play. “We have been in constant discussions with teams about necessary protocols to protect the health and safety of players, coaches, and personnel.” Murphy said in a Twitter post. UPDATE: Professional sports teams in NJ may return to training and even competition – if their leagues choose to move in that direction. We have been in constant discussions with teams about necessary protocols to protect the health and safety of players, coaches, and personnel. pic.twitter.com/yMrCFtSyqY — Governor Phil Murphy (@GovMurphy) May 26, 2020  Tellingly, Murphy also put some of the onus on the various leagues, including the NFL, to make their own decisions on how to proceed in the coronavirus era. The Jets released a message noting that the team is working closely with the governor’s office. “We are working closely with Governor Murphy’s office, the league and our medical staff to establish prudent, health and safety measures for our staff and players,” the Jets said in a statement, according to the New York Post. “Based on those guidelines, we will begin to open our facility using a phased approach at a time that is the most practical for our operations.” For their part, the Giants said, “Governor Murphy and his administration continue to guide New Jerseyans through this very difficult time. We have been in close contact with Governor Murphy’s staff to comply with the state’s protocols throughout. With (Monday’s) announcement by the governor, we are finalizing our plans to reopen the Quest Diagnostics Training Center. “We will continue to have as many employees as possible working remotely. For employees who need to return to work at our facility, we expect to begin that process next week, and we will do so in a systematic and safe way that adheres to the state’s guidelines and NFL protocols,” the Giants statement concluded. To date, the NFL has not announced a plan for going forward with the 2020 season, though a long list of ideas and proposals have been floated.

According to a recent report from the Wall Street Journal, teens across the United States are becoming almost nocturnal during the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic. Teenagers have adopted “vampire schedules” of staying up all night gaming and watching videos, then sleeping well into the day as they aren’t required to attend school in the morning. According to a recent report from the Wall Street Journal titled “Locked-Down Teens Stay Up All Night, Sleep All Day,” teens across the United States are increasingly reversing their sleep cycled during the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic. While some schools are requiring students to attend live classes, many are instead assigning work for students to complete in their own time. As a result, many teens are choosing to stay up all night and sleep during the day. Zach Zimmerman, a high-school senior in Mansfield, Texas, commented “I feel more relaxed, honestly,” explaining that he was in the habit of going to bed around 10:00 a.m. and waking in the late afternoon. Zach began taking online college classes that start at 1:00 p.m. recently, requiring him to be awake during the daytime. “When my college classes are over,” he said, “I’ll probably go back.” The WSJ writes: Some parents welcome the daytime peace and quiet. They say it isn’t worth arguing over bedtimes when teens are stuck at home and have no compelling reason to rise early. Gabrielle Powell, a 17-year-old in Escondido, Calif., spends her nights on Snapchat and video calls with friends. She plows through TV shows like “Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness” and “All American,” she said, and makes macaroni and cheese. Her post-dawn bedtime varies. She recently broke her routine for the Advanced Placement calculus exam, at the ungodly late 11 a.m. Gabrielle stayed awake the rest of the day before going to sleep, but she soon returned to the night shift. The father of another student named Cole Cancellieri commented: “It’s almost like being a crime scene investigator. I’ll find the wrappers from some snacks that he had, there will be dishes in the sink from what he ate. Sometimes he’ll leave the TV on to what he was watching….It’s like having a raccoon that came through my house in the night.” Some parents are becoming so worried about the issue that they’re seeking professional advice about the issue. Laura Sterni, director of the Johns Hopkins Pediatric Sleep Center, commented on the phenomenon stating: “If it keeps going, it really gets hard to shift back to a normal schedule. We’re really telling people, our young patients, please try and stay on as normal a schedule as possible.” Dr. Sterni explained why so many teens often switch their sleep schedules, stating that this is part of a natural transition from childhood. Teenagers’ internal clock tends to shift about two hours later than when they were children, however, they still require between eight and ten hours of sleep. As a result, many sleep scientists have campaigned for high schools to start later in the day. Read more at the Wall Street Journal here.

Tuesday on ABC’s “The View,” co-host Joy Behar said President Donald Trump’s supporters did not realize they were “pawns” in his “political game” to get reelected by making wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic a political choice instead of a health directive. On wearing masks, Behar said, “There’s certain rules that you have to follow, you know, you can’t drive if you’re drunk. You have to wear a seatbelt. You’re not allowed to smoke in public, things like that, that you sign away your freedom in a way to be restricted in your car. And if you don’t abide by this, you go to jail, or you’re fined. The rules being distorted by Trump and his enablers in the Congress, in particular, the leaders in Congress who are enabling him, he’s playing a political game with people’s lives. And these people do not realize that they are pawns in his game. He only wants to be reelected. He doesn’t really care if you live or die.” She continued, “I mean, witness the fact that he went golfing on Memorial Day when the names are being printed in The New York Times about how many people have died. He couldn’t care less. He wants to turn people against each other so that he gets reelected. Let’s take the example of the church. Does anybody really believe that he’s so religious and cares so much about people going to church? No, he doesn’t. He only wants to turn you against each other, religion against other religion. ” She added, “One of the priests I know is saying you can really basically worship the Lord from anywhere. I believe in Islam. It is a fact that you could pray in your living room, in your bathroom, in your kitchen, anywhere you want. If you are in touch with God, you can pray wherever you are. No, he has to say go and open the churches. Why does he fiddle with people’s lives, is what I want to know?” She concluded, “School children are now forced to wear bulletproof backpacks. Why is it that their freedoms are being impinged upon, but yours are not because you don’t want to wear a mask? Why are you more important than those children?” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Democrat New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told a group of reporters Monday that coronavirus projections from the experts were all misleading, and that he is no longer speculating because of it. Cuomo said he could not predict when the death rate and hospitalization numbers will drop to the necessary standards required for reopening certain parts of the state, because he said all the experts “failed at predicting.” “Now, people can speculate. People can guess. I think next week, I think two weeks, I think a month,” Cuomo told reporters on Memorial Day. “I’m out of that business because we all failed at that business. Right? All the early national experts. Here’s my projection model. Here’s my projection model. They were all wrong. They were all wrong.” Cuomo’s remark came at a press conference at the Intrepid Sea, Air, and Space Museum in New York City when the Democrat New York governor was asked when New York City might reopen. Cuomo mentioned some statewide criteria that regions needed to meet before reopening, including a 14-day downswing in deaths and hospitalizations. But the governor said he did not want to guess when New York City could hit that benchmark because past projections have been wrong. Cuomo said Saturday that New York’s one-day death toll fell below 100 for the first time since March, and Long Island and the mid-Hudson areas could open as soon as this week. In order to reopen, state regions must have a decline in the number of deaths and hospitalizations and meet standards for testing and contact tracing. New York state has seen more than 362,000 coronavirus cases, with more than 23,000 deaths, according to the latest data.

Spain has revised down its official death count for the Chinese coronavirus after a series of reporting errors and duplications were found in the tally. On Monday, the Spanish Health Ministry announced that it removed 1,918 spurious deaths from the official death toll, representing a seven per cent drop in the total deaths reported. The number of victims of the Chinese virus being reported by the government now stands at 26,834 compared to the 28,752 that were reported on Sunday. The director of the Health Ministry’s Coordination Centre for Health Alerts, Fernando Simón, said that the disparity in the figures came as a result of “several factors”, such as the “elimination of duplicates” and that regional health officials attributed deaths to the Wuhan virus without supposed victims being tested for COVID-19, according to El País. “The information is more precise to assess what is happening now. Before this, the data did not correspond to what was happening,” Mr Simón said. The region of Catalonia saw the sharpest decline in the number of deaths, with 59 per cent of fatalities being removed from the count. The revision in the numbers has thrown the government’s ability to accurately track the rate of infection into turmoil, as the Health Ministry will need to reconstruct the entire data series before being able to track the virus accurately. Spain to Introduce Mandatory Mask Wearing on Public Transport https://t.co/WKGNNX9uSi — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 3, 2020  In response to the initial outbreak, the Spanish government introduced some of the most draconian lockdown measures in Europe. On Saturday, a demonstration organised by the right-wing populist party Vox shut down the capital city of Madrid, as some 6,000 cars flooded the streets to protest against the socialist government’s handling of coronavirus. “Spaniards always turn out at decisive moments. We are here to defend our freedom. The threat to the freedom of Spain is being led by an illegitimate government that has become a criminal government, one that is incapable of protecting its people and is directly responsible for the worst management of this crisis on the whole planet,” said Vox leader Santiago Abascal. “Have no doubt that we will take them to the courts. They know it and they are afraid of your freedom, which is why they are trying to intimidate us,” Abascal added. The socialist government has pledged to introduce a €3 billion (£2.67bn/$3.29bn) per year universal basic income scheme that will result in an estimated 850,000 Spanish households being paid by the government. “Neither the government nor Spanish society is going to look the other way while our compatriots queue up to eat, something we are sadly seeing now in some parts of the country,” said Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez.

The Cal State University system announced this week that it will not lower tuition for students across its 23 campuses this fall despite its decision to keep classes online. A majority of college students claim that the quality of their education declined when their courses moved online in March. Cal State Students will even be expected to pay campus-based fees for the fall semester. According to a report by the College Fix, California State University will not lower its tuition for the fall semester despite its announcement that classes will continue online for the remainder of the calendar year. The university system claims that the decision to keep classes online was made to mitigate the spread of the Chinese virus. Cal State spokesperson Toni Molle told the College Fix this week that the university system will not lower tuition. Molle even suggested that students will still be required to pay “campus-based mandatory fees” even though they will be taking their classes from home. “There are no plans to reduce tuition and campus-based mandatory fees at this time,” Molle said. “One of the benefits of announcing our planning now is to allow for additional professional development opportunities for faculty and staff over the summer which lead to the best possible learning experience that we can provide for students.” Breitbart News reported in April that 77 percent of college students believe that the quality of their education declined when their courses moved online in March. Breitbart News reported last week that New York University Professor Scott Galloway’s prediction about the future of higher education. Galloway, who had previously predicted that Amazon would purchase Whole Foods, argues that a few elite universities will monopolize higher education. Galloway argues that many universities and colleges are in a period of “hallucination” about their tuition prices. “At universities, we’re having constant meetings, and we’ve all adopted this narrative of ‘This is unprecedented, and we’re in this together,’ which is Latin for ‘We’re not lowering our prices, bitches,’” Galloway said. “Universities are still in a period of consensual hallucination with each saying, ‘We’re going to maintain these prices for what has become, overnight, a dramatically less compelling product offering.’”

Michigan state Rep. Karen Whitsett (D-Detroit) has filed a federal lawsuit against Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) after the Democrat Party censured Whitsett over praising President Trump. The 13th Congressional District Democrat Party committee passed a resolution in April reprimanding Whitsett for being critical of Whitmer and appearing alongside Trump at the White House. The suit accuses Whitmer and the Democrats of “violations of free speech and defamation,” MLive reported. Whitsett visited the White House earlier this month to thank Trump.  “Thank you for everything that you have done,” Whitsett told Trump. “I didn’t know that saying thank you had a political line,” she said. “I thought just saying thank you meant thank you.” According to the suit, Whitmer texted Whitsett after the White House meeting and said, “You’re entitled to your opinion, I’m just disappointed you’d take your theories public without seeking to get answers first. Take care.” The resolution read in part, according to Gongwer: State Representative Karen Whitsett has repeatedly and publicly praised the president’s delayed and misguided COVID-19 response efforts in contradiction with the scientifically based and action-oriented response from Michigan’s duly election Democratic leadership … endangering the health, safety and welfare of her constituents, the city of Detroit, and the state of Michigan. Whitsett alleged the resolution was brought up at Whitmer’s “prompting,” according to MLive. “Folks in the 13th were complaining about why is she attacking, why can’t she just sit down, she’s always acting like a fool up their in Lansing,” 13th District Democrat Party Chairman Jonathan Kinloch told Breitbart News in April. MLive reported: The suit accuses Whitmer of being aware of a conspiracy to publicly shame, defame and humiliate Whitsett. Whitmer did not try to stop the scheme and actually prompted it, making her liable for damages, the lawsuit claims. The lawsuit seeks an unspecified amount of money for damages, reimbursement for all court fees, lawyers fees and other costs related to the case and any further relief the court deems appropriate.

Few sports figures have done more winning than Tom Brady, Phil Mickelson, Peyton Manning, and Tiger Woods. Therefore, it shouldn’t surprise that their recent charity golf match smashed the all-time TV golf ratings record. The Match II: Champions for Charity, which pitted Woods/Manning vs. Brady/Mickelson, drew an average of 5.8 million viewers on Sunday. Those numbers were drawn from TBS, TNT, TRUTV and HLN. Peak viewership for the event came in at 6.3 million, and the event raised $20 million for coronavirus related charities.

The previous ratings title holder for a televised golf event was the 2010 Masters, which drew an average of 4.9 million viewers. Of course, there was no lockdown or quarantine in 2010, which definitely played a part in the historic numbers for the Match II. “A golf event held one week prior featuring Rory McIlroy, Dustin Johnson, Rickie Fowler and amateur champion Matthew Wolff also drew exceptional viewership well for a charity exhibition, delivering 2.35 million viewers for NBC,” the Hill reported. The PGA Tour will return on June 11th for the Charles Schwab Challenge in Fort Worth, Texas. Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn

Twitter is reportedly having trouble using AI tools to accurately label “misleading” tweets about the Wuhan coronavirus, raising concerns about the use of artificial intelligence to accurately label content on the site. As one expert explained: “Arguably, labeling incorrectly does more harm than not labeling because then people come to rely on that and they come to trust it. Once you get it wrong, a couple hours go by and it’s over.” CNET reports that social media website Twitter is having problems automatically labeling tweets that contain alleged misinformation about the Wuhan coronavirus. The firm announced on May 11 that it would be labeling tweets that spread conspiracy theories such as the virus being caused by 5G cell towers. Twitter also stated that it will be removing tweets encouraging people to engage in behavior such as damaging 5G cell towers, other tweets which also include false or dispute claims would receive a label directing users to trusted information. The label reads: “Get the facts about COVID-19” and directs users towards a page of curated tweets debunking the 5G conspiracy theories. However, Twitter’s automatics labeling has made a number of mistakes applying labels to tweets refuting conspiracy theories and providing accurate information. Tweets that have linked to reports from Reuters, BBC News, Wired, and Voice of America about the 5G conspiracy theories have received warning labels. Experts believe that the mislabeled tweets could actually confuse Twitter users, especially if they don’t click on the label.  Hany Farid, a computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley, commented: “Arguably, labeling incorrectly does more harm than not labeling because then people come to rely on that and they come to trust it. Once you get it wrong, a couple hours go by and it’s over.” Twitter has not stated how many 5G-coronavirus tweets have been labeled or an estimate of how many labels have been incorrectly applied. The firm did state that its automated systems are new and will improve in time, with a spokesperson saying: We are building and testing new tools so we can scale our application of these labels appropriately. There will be mistakes along the way. We appreciate your patience as we work to get this right, but this is why we are taking an iterative approach, so that we can learn and make adjustments along the way. Twitter faces a huge task in moderating its platform with 166 million daily active users browsing and posting on the platform. The company has employed automatic tools to help workers review reports more efficiently but this has led to a new set of issues. Some researchers have found that about half of all accounts tweeting about the Chinese virus are bots,  instead of actual users. Farid stated that he isn’t surprised that Twitter’s automated systems are marking errors, stating: “The difference between a headline with a conspiracy theory and one debunking it is very subtle. It’s literally the word ‘not’ and you need full blown language understanding, which we don’t have today.” Read more at CNET here.

Gee, I’m old enough to remember when the “experts” told us masks weren’t helpful when it comes to preventing the coronavirus. In fact, we were told masks were actually bad for us. Yes, it was all the way back in the Year of our Lord 2020 when the CDC said it “does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19.” What’s more, masks made it more likely we would catch the coronavirus: “If it’s not fitted right, you’re going to fumble with it,” Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar testified in March. “You’re going to be touching your face, which is the No. 1 way you’re going to get disease, is unclean hands touching your face.” Remember this…? Seriously people- STOP BUYING MASKS!   They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus, but if healthcare providers can’t get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk!  https://t.co/UxZRwxxKL9 — U.S. Surgeon General (@Surgeon_General) February 29, 2020  — Like, “seriously people, STOP BUYING MASKS,” like, what’s wrong with you people buying all those masks… That was the Surgeon General then, a whole 11 weeks ago… Here’s our Surgeon General today: (1/6) A #SaturdayMorning thread this #MemorialDayWeekend to clarify some of the confusion on masks and face coverings. Follow along to get the facts & remember – I wear my mask to protect you, and you wear yours to protect me. 👇 pic.twitter.com/sHLtJCxutU — U.S. Surgeon General (@Surgeon_General) May 23, 2020  — Let me tell you a secret… A few weeks ago, when the “experts” were telling us masks don’t help, I didn’t believe them. Did it make any sense to you? Doctors and nurses have been wearing paper masks for decades to protect themselves and their patients from infection  — and suddenly we’re supposed to believe they’re useless? Come on. I didn’t believe the MASKS DON’T WORK propaganda then, and to protect my wife, who checks off a number of risk factors with the coronavirus, I immediately started wearing a mask every time I went out, as does she. And, thankfully, because I do a lot of drywall work, I was lucky enough to have a stock of those N95 masks, which are supposed to be especially effective. But less than three months ago, if you were seen wearing a mask, you were an evildoer, a selfish bastard stealing precious PPE from first responders. Thanks to the media and government, wearing a mask, then — most especially an N95 mask, served as a Scarlet Letter of sorts. How dare you, sir! How dare you! To which I would happily respond: Yeah, well, we’ve had 13 cases of coronavirus in my county, so how about you dare to kiss my ass. And even if we got wiped out by the coronavirus here, my wife comes before your wife, so you can dare to kiss my ass again. But look at what a difference a few weeks makes… Today’s Scarlet Letter is *not* wearing a mask. Now you’re a monster for not wearing a mask, you’re a serial killer for not wearing a mask… There are people who consider themselves Americans who are applauding the following mob behavior: If you don’t wear a mask on Staten Island you will be publicly shamed pic.twitter.com/6pRl33C0vU — Barstool Sports (@barstoolsports) May 26, 2020  Granted, we don’t know the full context of the video. It might be that the person not wearing the mask was obnoxious. We’ve certainly seen enough videos of maskless jerks coughing on those politely asking them to wear a mask. So the video itself is not my point. It’s the social media reaction to the video I find troubling, the “right on” aspect of it, the cheering on and celebration of mob mentality… First off, if you’re wearing a mask, what the hell do you care if someone else is not? You’re protected. If you’re worried about your eyes, put on sunglasses. This is not difficult, y’all… Unless, of course, you’re a bossypants type who loves any excuse to tell others what to do. Secondly, we now know that if you are under 50 years of age, the coronavirus has a fatality rate of just 0.1 percent, or 1 in 1,000 — which is the exact same fatality rate as the everyday flu. So why are we stuffing people under the age of 50 into masks for no valid medical reason? It should be the elderly we train our protective focus on. Instead, we’re spreading our focus out among everyone, which was the mistake that led to completely unnecessary nursing home catastrophes in Democrat-run states like New York, New Jersey, and Michigan. But this is the world in which we now live — a world where science and facts no longer matter, where bad people are looking for any excuse to feel superior and to publicly lord their superiority over others, looking for any excuse to embrace the warmth of the fascist mob knowing social media and the corporate media will cheer them on as virtuous. This is a sick, sick culture we live in; a fascist and anti-freedom culture, a theocracy built on the empty religion of pious and self-righteous moral posturing. We saw this once before in the 60s. The good news is that the result of the 60s was the 70s, where the little brothers and sisters of the self-righteous hippies threw off that self-seriousness and embraced the joys of youth and freedom.  The 70s were the freest decade of my lifetime. Let’s hope the 2020s are just as shackle free.  Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.

President Donald Trump attacked Rep. Conor Lamb (D-PA) on Tuesday as an “American fraud” and a “puppet” for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). Trump voiced support for Sean Parnell — a Cranberry, Pennsylvania, Republican and combat veteran — to take on swing district Democrat Lamb. Parnell received a Purple Heart for injuries in battle in Afghanistan. The president said Lamb has not served as an independent voice in Pennsylvania’s 17th congressional district. “Sean Parnell is an American Hero. Conor Lamb has proven to be an American fraud, and a puppet for Crazy Nancy Pelosi,” Trump wrote. “He said he would NOT vote for her for Speaker, and did. Will kill 2A. Voted to impeach (on nothing). A TOTAL & COMPLETE Sean Parnell Endorsement!” Sean Parnell is an American Hero. Conor Lamb has proven to be an American fraud, and a puppet for Crazy Nancy Pelosi. He said he would NOT vote for her for Speaker, and did. Will kill 2A. Voted to impeach (on nothing). A TOTAL & COMPLETE Sean Parnell Endorsement! https://t.co/v1OnY0MI8m — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 26, 2020  Lamb was one of the 15 Democrats that did not vote for Pelosi to become speaker in January 2019. Parnell noted on Monday that Trump attacked Lamb for “pretending to be a pro-Trump moderate in a Trump district to get elected.” “Truth is, Lamb votes Speaker Pelosi 90+% of the time & voted for both charges of impeachment,” Parnell added. The POTUS didn’t attack @ConorLambPA’s military service as a lawyer. @realDonaldTrump went after Lamb for pretending to be a pro Trump moderate in a Trump district to get elected. Truth is, Lamb votes with @SpeakerPelosi 90+% of the time & voted for both charges of impeachment. https://t.co/0de6pFBQ48 — Sean Parnell (@SeanParnellUSA) May 25, 2020  Lamb claimed in December the evidence for impeachment was “strong.” “The facts show the president abused his office and compromised our national security. I can’t think of anything more serious than that,” Lamb said. Lamb also served as one of the several Pennsylvania Democrats that ignored Breitbart News’ request for comments over his thoughts on Gov. Tom Wolf’s decision to put coronavirus patients in nursing homes. Pennsylvania reportedly has one of the highest coronavirus-related death rates in nursing homes. Parnell noted Lamb did not “have a record when” he first became a candidate, meaning that he could “lie” about being a moderate. You didn’t have a record when you first became a candidate. Which is why you could lie about being a moderate.Thing is, you have a record now & it aligns with The Sqaud 90% of the time.Maybe if you’re nice they’ll let you be the 5th member for the next couple months. https://t.co/cJMDtKY8Hb — Sean Parnell (@SeanParnellUSA) May 25, 2020  Sean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News.

Optimism is rising in the U.S. as an unseasonably cold spring weather fades and lockdowns have lifted, allowing more Americans to venture out of homes into much warmer weather. The Conference Board said Tuesday that its confidence index climbed up to a reading of 86.6 in May from 85.7 in April, in line with the expectations of economic forecasters.
“Following two months of rapid decline, the free-fall in Confidence stopped in May,” said Lynn Franco, Senior Director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board. Although still near 6-year lows, May’s stabilization is the latest sign that the worst of the economic crash from the coronavirus is past and some of the weight on the U.S. economy is lifting. The May survey also showed that the virus has not depressed the consumer outlook in recent weeks as much as it had in early spring. The share of consumers who expect business conditions to improve over the next six months rose from 39.8 percent to 43.3 percent. Those who foresee business conditions worsening declined from 25.1 percent to 21.4 percent. “Short-term expectations moderately increased as the gradual re-opening of the economy helped improve consumers’ spirits. However, consumers remain concerned about their financial prospects,” Franco said.   The gauge of present conditions declined slightly from 73 to 71.1. The share of consumers who said business conditions are “good” dropped from 19.9 percent to 16.3 percent, while those who said business conditions are “bad” rose from 45.3 percent to 52.1 percent. Consumers’ outlook for the labor market was mixed. On the one hand, the slice of Americans expecting more jobs in the months ahead declined from 41.2 percent to 39.3 percent. On the other hand, those anticipating fewer jobs in the months ahead also fell, from 21.2 percent to 20.2 percent. Regarding their short-term income prospects, the percentage of consumers expecting an increase declined from 17.2 percent to 14.0 percent. But the share expecting a decrease declined from 18.4 percent to 15.0 percent, an indication that economic anxiety is waning.  

A page on WeChat, a Chinese social media site, claimed American officials have been “processing dead bodies” of Chinese coronavirus victims into burgers and feeding them to the masses, the South China Morning Post revealed on Tuesday, claiming Beijing had shut the page down. Prior to its deletion, however, the page – the “Scholar Forum for Ultimate Truth” – had attracted 1.7 million page views, according to the Post. China has built an extensive online censorship apparatus that has successfully shut down a wide variety of factual information detrimental to the regime or simply commentary by dissidents on the failures of the Communist Party. Yet when faced with outrageous false information that disparages America or other foreign nations, China’s censors suddenly struggle to keep up with the volume of material. The Post noted that one of the most outrageous posts on the “Scholar Forum for Ultimate Truth” page, a pro-communist conspiracy WeChat account, accused Americans of eating those killed by the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. “The US has been processing dead bodies from Covid-19 [Chinese coronavirus] diseases into hamburgers,” the page reportedly claimed, adding that the bodies “were very likely of being processed into frozen meat, fake beef or pork, or processed into cooked meat as hamburgers and hot dogs.” The page offered as evidence of this claim the unsubstantiated allegation that “cannibalism has existed in the U.S. before … and only a few dozen years ago, Americans ate blacks, Indians and Chinese.” The offending post was published last month and garnered 100,000 readers as well as nearly 1,000 financial contributors to the page. The Post reported that its content was not unusual for the page, which regularly posted anti-Western, anti-American conspiracy theories and insults. The page was reportedly only taken down this week.  “While China has the world’s most sophisticated censorship system, misinformation and sensational content still runs wild on the internet. There are about 30 million social media accounts on WeChat alone,” the Post observed. There is little evidence that China is interested in shutting down anti-American conspiracy theories, especially given that the Chinese Foreign Ministry has peddled them officially. The most regularly touted conspiracy theory about the Chinese coronavirus pandemic is the claim that the virus did not originate in Wuhan, China, where the first cases were reported, but in a U.S. Army laboratory in Maryland. “It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian accused in March. “Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!” The Chinese state media outlet Global Times, which regularly uses unnamed “Chinese netizens” as a metric of public opinion, later added the claim that the Fort Detrick, Maryland U.S. Army lab was the alleged source of the virus. Neither Zhao nor the propaganda newspaper have offered any evidence for this claim, nor have any independent investigators or journalists revealed evidence for the theory. Another Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, suggested the possibility this month that respiratory illness cases in the United States related to the use of e-cigarettes, or vapes, identified last year were actually misdiagnosed Chinese coronavirus cases. Hua offered no evidence for this theory and did not explain how that was possible given the vaping illness cases were not contagious, while the Chinese coronavirus is believed to spread To explain the fact that no cases of Chinese coronavirus have been diagnosed outside of Wuhan earlier than the first known cases, Beijing offered another explanation: that American military personnel participating in the Military World Games in October, held in Wuhan, brought the virus into China. According to Vice, the conspiracy theory originated in the West, “but the Communist Party of China has promoted it so aggressively within China that it has become accepted knowledge among the Chinese populace that the U.S. military imported the coronavirus to Wuhan.” Vice quoted one Chinese-American who said that she found “most Chinese people really believe the U.S. brought the virus to China and they call it ‘USA virus.'” Chinese state media identified one American servicewoman in particular, Maatje Benassi, as the original carrier of the disease. There is no evidence tying Benassi to the pandemic, and the U.S. Army reservist told CNN that the conspiracy theory has largely destroyed her life. “I want everybody to stop harassing me, because this is cyberbullying to me and it’s gone way out of hand,” Maajte said in an interview in April. China was disqualified from the 2019 Military World Games, which it was hosting, for “extensive cheating.” Other information China has allowed to freely propagate behind its “great firewall” include claims “the coronavirus was created as a bioweapon or was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to further vaccine sales … [or] that the virus can be cured by eating garlic or drinking a bleach concoction.” The false information promoted by China’s official channels contrasts significantly with what its censors act decisively to remove from venues like WeChat. Perhaps the most outrageous example of censored content in the past year is the medical information posted on WeChat by Dr. Li Wenliang, a Wuhan doctor. Li was among the first doctors to identify and diagnose the Chinese coronavirus infection and shared tips with other doctors on WeChat on how to prevent the spread of contagious diseases – tips like washing hands and wearing protective gear. WeChat rapidly censored his tips, even though he shared them only with other doctors and not the public, and detained Li, forcing him to issue a humiliating public apology for the information. Li died in February of Chinese coronavirus infection. He was 34. Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.  

If you’re looking for optimism that the NFL season will happen, maybe even with fans, then Dolphins Owner Stephen Ross is your man. During a Tuesday morning interview on CNBC, Ross stated clearly that the NFL season will happen, the only question is whether fans will be in attendance. “I think there definitely will be a football season this year,” Ross said. “Real question is, will there be fans in the stadium? Right now — today — we’re planning to have fans in the stadium.” The Dolphins have been reportedly experimenting with the idea of social distancing inside the stadium. So, just because teams may be planning to have fans, doesn’t necessarily mean that stadiums will be filled to capacity. It’s not surprising that this level of optimism has come from a sports executive in Florida. The Sunshine State, along with Georgia, has been at the forefront of the country’s reopening and recovery effort. Florida in particular has become a symbol of the sports world’s reopening, as Governor DeSantis has moved to make the state a refuge for sports leagues and sports entertainment organizations such as the UFC and WWE, in their bid to resume holding events. “The NFL hasn’t made any firm decisions on whether to allow fans into stadiums during the 2020 season, but the league released its schedule earlier this month and plans to play its full 16-game slate on time, starting Sept. 10,” Cameron Wolfe of ESPN reported. “We all miss our sports,” Ross said. “The NFL, I think, will be ready to go. I know we’re all looking forward to it. I know I am.” Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn

ROME — The Wuhan coronavirus will suffer a significant decline in activity as temperatures rise this summer, according to an Italian report published Tuesday on the relationship between the virus and temperature. “Like all coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is influenced in a decisive manner by the climate,” said Mario Bacco, a researcher at Meleam, which specializes in occupational medicine. “In the laboratory we have seen that by increasing the temperature of the culture by a few degrees centigrade, bringing it to the range of 25-30 degrees C [77-86º F], approximately 53 percent of the strains do not survive and the rest show about 12 times less activity,” he said. While Bacco and his team feel certain that the virus will diminish substantially during the summer months, they are less convinced that it will disappear altogether. “In the summer, the virus is expected to exhibit limited activity with very slight aggressiveness, but since it manages to survive, it will probably reappear as temperatures drop,” Bacco notes. “In short, it will not go away entirely.” “My idea is that it will not disappear, as SARS did,” he proposes. Being “sensitive to the climate, SARS-CoV-2 will always manifest itself more incisively in the colder areas of Italy.” In the case of the 2003 SARS epidemic, researchers found that on days with a lower air temperature, the risk of increased daily incidence was 18-times higher than on days with a higher temperature, according to a study published by the NIH, a finding corroborated by other studies. “Our observations show that the virus manifests some perceptible mutations, brought about in a short time,” Bacco said, in reference to COVID-19. “This makes us think more and more that the possibility of making a vaccine that can be objectively effective for a time worthy of consideration is scarce.” “The observed mutations mainly concern genomic areas defined as introns, which are by definition noncoding,” he added. “Finally, we are finding, with increasing frequency, viral protein strands in biological liquids. At the moment, this observation, while interesting, does not seem to have important repercussions on the evolution of the microorganism,” he said. Bacco’s findings on the coronavirus’ sensitivity to heat replicate the results of earlier studies. As a flu-like disease — contagious viruses that cause respiratory illness — coronavirus has shown itself to be much more aggressive and contagious in colder climates. Follow @tdwilliamsrome

President Donald Trump warned Tuesday the 2020 election would be “rigged” thanks to Democrats pushing mail-in ballots during the coronavirus pandemic. “This will be a Rigged Election. No way!” Trump wrote on Twitter and Facebook. The president predicted mass voter fraud in 2020, thanks to Democrat officials using the pandemic to institute mail-in voting. “There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent,” he wrote. The president pointed to California’s governor Gavin Newsom who signed an executive order to mail ballots to all voters in the November 3 general election. “Mail boxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged and even illegally printed out and fraudulently signed,” Trump said. The Republican National Committee, National Republican Congressional Committee, and California Republican Party have filed a lawsuit to block the action, arguing that it is unconstitutional. Trump warned that Democrat activists would use the mail-in vote option to generate more votes for their party. “That will be followed up with professionals telling all of these people, many of whom have never even thought of voting before, how, and for whom, to vote,” he wrote. ….living in the state, no matter who they are or how they got there, will get one. That will be followed up with professionals telling all of these people, many of whom have never even thought of voting before, how, and for whom, to vote. This will be a Rigged Election. No way! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 26, 2020   

Security experts from the Council of Europe have warned of the possibility of biological terror in the wake of the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic, saying the outbreak has revealed societal vulnerabilities. Council of Europe Committee on Counter-Terrorism experts said that terrorist groups could be incentivised to look into creating and deploying biological weapons after seeing the dramatic effects of the coronavirus pandemic. “The Covid-19 pandemic has shown how vulnerable modern societies are to viral infections and their shock potential,” the committee said on Monday, German newspaper Die Welt reports. “The damage is quick and potentially global,” the experts added and said that a biological attack could have a far greater impact on people and the economy than traditional terror attacks have in the past. Tunisian Migrant in Court over ‘Ricin Attack Plot’ Against ‘Unbelievers’ https://t.co/S0fLhHaK2o — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 7, 2019  Germany’s Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, the country’s domestic security agency, said that it had not seen “concrete or abstract plans” regarding bioweapon terror attacks so far, but said a well-organised group such as Islamic State would likely be behind what they determined to be an “unlikely” attack. While biological weapons are rare compared to attacks using explosives, firearms, and knives, Germany has seen at least one foiled biological terror attack in recent years. In August of 2018, Tunisian migrant Sief Allah H. was arrested in the city of Cologne after authorities discovered he had planned a terrorist attack using the deadly biological compound known as ricin in what was considered Germany’s first bioterrorism plot. A year later, both he and his 43-year-old Muslim convert wife Yasmin were brought up on terrorism charges with both believed to be sympathisers of Islamic State. The Tunisian migrant was found guilty of manufacturing a biological weapon and preparing a terrorist attack in March and sentenced to ten years in a German prison.

China will “actively expand” public health projects in its Belt and Road (BRI) partner countries amid the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Sunday, according to the South China Morning Post. Speaking at a press conference on Sunday, Wang said: China will actively expand international cooperation on public health and establish pandemic control mechanisms with more nations. There will be more such cooperation along the Belt and Road [BRI]. China will work with the countries along the route to vigorously promote the construction of the ‘Healthy Silk Road.’ The “Health Silk Road” is China’s term for the system of public health projects it promotes within BRI-partner countries. So far, China has used the BRI to focus largely on trade and infrastructure partnerships with developing nations across Asia, Europe, Africa, and Latin America. Beijing advertises BRI projects as lucrative endeavors, but they ultimately force host nations to become massively indebted to China. Now, amid increased healthcare needs caused by the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic, Beijing aims to expand its BRI to include public health projects. “The potential of the Belt and Road comes from constantly opening up new areas of cooperation. After the [Wuhan coronavirus] epidemic, the desire of countries to develop the economy and protect people’s livelihoods will be stronger, and the demand for cooperation in the field of public health will also increase significantly,” Wang said. Beijing first announced the launch of its Health Silk Road initiative this year as “a new approach for perfecting global public health governance.” In April, China’s ambassador to Iran promoted the Health Silk Road in an op-ed published by an Iranian-state newspaper. At the time, Iran’s support of the initiative was criticized by many Iranians as evidence that their country was “capitulating” to China. Beijing’s public health initiative is widely considered a way for China to capitalize on the vulnerabilities caused by the devastating Wuhan coronavirus pandemic, which has killed hundreds of thousands of people worldwide and exhausted nations’ healthcare systems. By offering to support a public healthcare system in a struggling foreign nation, China paints itself as a global humanitarian. Just as with the predatory BRI projects, the Health Silk Road provides China potential access to host nations’ sensitive government health data, opening up access to foreign governments’ health-related technology and intellectual property. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) may then, in turn, use this valuable information to further expand its influence: over the host nation, throughout the region, and across the globe.

The far-left Politico admitted Tuesday that Democrats are “dreading” the idea of a fast economic boom as America reopens, which explains the anti-science push among many Democrat governors to extend their pointless coronavirus lockdowns. Thanks to these lockdowns, some 40 million people are unemployed, some 40 million lives have been shattered; lines at food pantries seem to go on forever; countless small businesses are in danger of closing or already have… Nevertheless, what America’s oh-so compassionate Democrats dread most is a quick economic rebound that might undermine their grasping desire to hold on to and obtain power. “The general election scenario that Democrats are dreading,” the Politico headline reads.  And what is that scenario? “We are about to see the best economic data we’ve seen in the history of this country,” a former economic adviser to Barack Obama told a bunch of bigwigs from both parties last month. His name is Jason Furman and Politico says he “laid out a detailed case for why the months preceding the November election could offer Trump the chance to brag — truthfully — about the most explosive monthly employment numbers and GDP growth ever.” Furman’s counterintuitive pitch has caused some Democrats, especially Obama alumni, around Washington to panic. “This is my big worry,” said a former Obama White House official who is still close to the former president. Asked about the level of concern among top party officials, he said, “It’s high — high, high, high, high.” And top policy officials on the Biden campaign are preparing for a fall economic debate that might look very different than the one predicted at the start of the pandemic in March. “They are very much aware of this,” said an informal adviser. What Furman already sees are signs of what’s known as a “V” recovery, as a opposed to a slower or gradual  recovery,  or a recovery that takes a while to get back to where we were before these stupid lockdowns began. Furman sees an economy that’s already unleashed. Consumption and hiring started to tick up “in gross terms, not in net terms,” Furman said, describing the phenomenon as a “partial rebound.” The bounce back “can be very very fast, because people go back to their original job, they get called back from furlough, you put the lights back on in your business. Given how many people were furloughed and how many businesses were closed you can get a big jump out of that. It will look like a V.” Furman’s argument is not that different from the one made by White House economic advisers and Trump, who have predicted an explosive third quarter, and senior adviser Jared Kushner, who said in late April that “the hope is that by July the country’s really rocking again.” White House officials were thrilled to hear that some of their views have been endorsed by prominent Democrats. While no one expects the second quarter numbers — the numbers that will tell us the GDP between April 1 and June 30 — to be anything but terrible, if we can come to our senses nationwide and get these absurd lockdowns behind us, the third quarter numbers (that will be released at the end of September) could show real growth. This would be good for the incumbent president, especially since that incumbent president has been predicting a “pent up” desire within the American people to get back to normal. Good news for America and Americans would, of course, be terrible news for Joe Biden, who is desperate to strangle our economy with record high taxes and an obscene amount of regulations. Biden’s policies would hurt a flourishing economy, but they would kill a post-lockdown recovery in the same way the Obama-Biden economic policies of 2009 killed any hope of a real rebound after the 2008 economic crash. It’s no accident the Obama-Biden administration oversaw the worst “recovery” since the Great Depression. Their taxes, regulations, and constant threats of more kept a boot firmly on the neck of our economy for eight long years. Plus, no matter how much Biden might crybaby about Trump’s Twitter account, his golf game, and his violation of the establishment’s “precious norms,” the American people tend not to fire a president when the economy is humming — especially if we are coming out of a downturn. But what does it say about Democrats that with nearly 40 million lives shattered, they “dread” a fast comeback for those 40 million people? Obviously, that’s a rhetorical question, but it does answer the question as to why — and for no valid scientific or medical reasons, a number of mercenary Democrat governors are desperate to push these pointless lockdowns as far into next month as possible (especially in swing states like Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania). It is all about doing whatever damage they can to those third quarter GDP numbers; even if that means more pain for those who cannot work from home — primarily the working class.

MSNBC staffer Andrea Mitchell accused President Donald Trump of “endangering the troops” while attending two separate Memorial Day events on Monday. The far-left Mitchell opened her criticism of Trump by gushing over presumptive Democrat nominee Joe Biden, who left his home for the first time in two months Monday to lay a wreath at a Delaware war memorial. “Joe Biden and Dr. Jill Biden emerged for the first time from their home since March 15th, I believe. And it showed they were both wearing masks. They went to a war memorial in New Castle, Delaware,” Mitchell said. “This is also almost the fifth anniversary of their son, a veteran, Beau Biden’s death. So these are really touching — a touching war memorial visit.” She added this is “the first time that he is coming out of his home, and I guess testing whether there were other safe ways that he can emerge, given his age, given the restrictions, and the fact that he is modeling what the government is saying to model, in contrast to the president, who’s going against his own government.” Jennifer Palmieri, the former White House communications director for Barack Obama, then did some wish-casting about what this Memorial Day might have looked like if Joe Biden or Barack Obama were president. Mitchell then jumped back in to accuse Trump of putting the American troops at risk for not wearing a mask. “Clearly, [Rapey Joe Biden’s] numbers have gone up as he’s been campaigning from home, virtually, and the president,” Mitchell said, and then harrumphed: “arguably, is endangering the troops, the people who have to travel with him, as well as the people that he meets along the way, and he has not been socially distancing or wearing a mask when he’s around them, so, obviously time will tell.” How is Trump endangering anyone if he doesn’t have the coronavirus? If anything, he is putting himself at risk, an angle hacks like Mitchell would certainly take if her precious Rapey Joe and Barry were still in office: Oh, how selfless and honorable for Barry and Rapey Joe to expose themselves in this way to America’s fighting men and women. How brave they are. But what if they get sick? That would be disastrous for democracy! And why is Biden wearing a mask while laying a wreath at a war memorial? It was just him and his wife. Why not remove the mask after getting out of the car with the Secret Service agents? He looked ridiculous. Like a balding, enfeebled Bane. There was no need to wear a mask, other than to virtue signal and make shallow liars and rape deniers like Andrea Mitchell gush. Honestly, Biden’s been quarantined in his home for weeks, who is he going to infect? The whole thing is ridiculous, as is our corrupt media. As far as endangering the troops, with the latest fatality rates from the CDC, we know now that if you’re under 50, your chances of dying of the coronavirus are 1 in a 1,000 — and that’s only if you’re infected to begin with.  That’s the same as the common flu.

The latest proxy-battle over Brexit has seen a junior minister resign from Boris Johnson’s government, as Remainers move against the prime minister’s enforcer-in-chief Dominic Cummings. Douglas Ross, Boris Johnson’s junior minister for Scotland, resigned on Tuesday morning, citing his opposition to Boris Johnson’s Brexit-focussed enforcer Dominic Cummings in his public letter to the prime minister. Telegraph: Rogue Civil Servant Tweets a Reminder Why Anti-Swamp Boris Govt was Elected https://t.co/FMPA8GAA9U — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 25, 2020  Getting Mr Cummings — variously described as either a political genius or a Svengali-type figure — out of Downing Street has become a matter of some urgency, with all major UK newspapers and the Westminster political establishment united in seeing his demise. Perhaps confounding expectations, the prime minister has so far stood by his top adviser, and at a polite but firm press conference, Monday afternoon Mr Cummings himself defended his record and said he had not offered his resignation. As Breitbart London noted on Sunday, Dominic Cummings is likely to have intensified ill-feeling towards him of late, as he was able to scotch a plan to delay Brexit concocted while he and his boss the prime minister were away from work, ill with coronavirus. Between his dogged determination to deliver Brexit — the mandated will of the British people — and his dogmatic hatred of the embedded power of the British Deep State, Mr Cummings has become public enemy number one for the theoretically-impartial Civil Service. Boris Adviser Cummings Squashed Plan to Delay Real Brexit Concocted While He and PM Had Covid https://t.co/OW7YXEm7Mb — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 24, 2020  Tuesday’s resignation is a timely reminder that, while Boris Johnson’s government is the most pro-Brexit — perhaps the only pro-Brexit — government in history, and the present Parliament is the most pro-Brexit ever, the fact remains that the majority of the cabinet were Remain-supporters at the time of the referendum. This is in part a reflection of how few thoroughly pro-Brexit politicians there are in Westminster. Strangely, British newspaper the Daily Telegraph — the UK title closest to the governing Conservative Party — appears to be providing covering fire for Ross, citing an unnamed “former minister” in their daily politics blog which offered that the Scottish MP is “a big Boris fan from the get-go and a Brexiter.” This position appears to reflect a revised view of Douglas Ross, who by his own account in earlier times declared himself in favour of Remain, and opposed Mr Johnson in the first round of the leadership vote.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Monday that all ‘non-essential’ shops can reopen in England on June 15th, with retailers planning on quarantining items touched by customers. “I want people to be confident that they can shop safely, provided they follow the social distancing rules for all premises,” Prime Minister Johnson said, outlining that shops will be obliged also to enforce new hygiene standards. Retailers have been told to maintain social distancing, make available hand sanitation for staff and customers, limit the number of people in premises, and restrict human contact wherever possible. The government guidelines also advise shops to “limit[] customer handling of merchandise” including the “rotation of high-touch stock”. In effect reducing Britons to children by telling them not to touch things in shops, cabinet minister Michael Gove told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday that the shopping habits that “people may have grown used to in pre-Covid days” have to end. “So when it comes to touching and testing goods, when it comes to trying on clothing, when it comes to trying make-up and so on, that all of us exercise restraint in not doing that and recognise that as these stores reopen, it is a new normal,” Mr Gove said. One guideline has resulted in plans for a peculiar New Normal in Coronavirus UK: quarantining items touched by people. Shop keepers are advised to store items that have been returned or tried on “in a container or separate room for 72 hours”. Kurt Geiger has said that it will quarantine shoes tried on for 24 hours before another customer can try them on, while they have told staff to wear gloves and masks at all times, with cash registers behind perspex screens. Coronavirus ‘Fashion Masks’ Set to Become ‘Essential’ Pandemic Accessory in UK https://t.co/Og6HG4BVQh — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 20, 2020  Before the measures were outlined, major British book retailer Waterstones announced that it would quarantine for three days any unbought books that had come into human contact. The government had previously advised that the virus cannot survive on post and packages — which, like books, are mostly made of paper — and Waterstones was likewise advised the same, but said in late-May that it would still quarantine their books for 72 hours. James Daunt, head of Waterstones, said this month that “book customers are very nice people who behave well”, so will likely follow the rules. “We will still have tables displaying books, but we will have systems in place to ensure books that are browsed do not remain on sale. We will ask customers that pick up a book to put it down on a trolley that we can then wheel away,” Mr Daunt said. Britain is just the latest country in Europe to introduce bizarre shopping rituals under the New Normal. The Dutch have reopened cafes with customers eating in greenhouses, while Italian shops take clients’ temperatures upon entry. And only in Germany could getting stuck in traffic become a party, after organisers staged a drive-in rave to maintain social distancing.

Across the world, the mainstream media are dying a death. Here are the latest newspaper circulation figures from the United Kingdom. Daily Mail: 944,981 (1.13million) Express: 234,373 (289,393) Mirror: 363,082 (442,610) Star: 219,275 (276,453) i paper: 134,553 (215,640) Guardian: 106,003 (129,961) Financial Times: 88,756 (146,373) Neither the Telegraph nor the Times group will disclose their latest figures but we can safely assume they are grim. It’s the same story in the U.S. where, even a month ago, newspapers were reporting an “extinction-level crisis” as advertising began to dry up. So why, having spent a large part of my journalistic career writing for national newspapers, am I so strangely reluctant to give a damn? Simple. I believe the newspapers — and all those TV news channels suffering similar collapse — have brought about their own destruction. The mainstream media have failed in their most basic duty to report on the news. Instead, what they have served up increasingly is politically-driven advertorial and propaganda. Never has this been more painfully obvious than during the coronavirus crisis. Cummings Hits Back at Mainstream Media: If People Are Upset, It’s Your Fault https://t.co/8hfopmg3Qd — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 25, 2020  One day, I believe, in the not too distant future, some very hard questions are going to be asked about the evidence on which governments across the world elected to shut down their economies and put their people under house arrest in what may well turn out to be the most catastrophic collective political misjudgement in history. Traditionally, you might have hoped, the media would have been on hand to query those governments’ decisions at every stage of the process. But they have done nothing of the kind. On the contrary, instead of attempting to sift the available evidence with cool reason, the MSM have done little else but ramp up the hysteria; and instead of holding the political Establishment’s lockdown policies to account, the media have instead acted like its cheerleaders. In the United Kingdom, the media’s performance has been dismal. There was a time, really not so long ago, when British newspapers — tabloids especially — were famed for their fearlessness, robustness, and cussed untameability. But throughout the pandemic, the entirety of Britain’s print media — both left-leaning and right-leaning — has not just pandered to Project Coronavirus Fear but stoked it with such demented enthusiasm it has managed to frighten almost the whole country into a state of abject, bed-wetting terror, spiked with a nasty hint of Stasi-style snitching, handwringing disapproval and nervy paranoia. Sure, there’s a case to be made that lockdown policies are proportionate and sensible a response to an unfamiliar virus. What has been all but absent from the MSM is the increasingly plausible counter-argument: that it has all been a massive overreaction which has done far more damage than the supposed problem. Yes, sometimes, it’s true, various maverick commentators in the op-ed sections have been permitted to make the case for liberty, rationalism, and prosperity. But almost invariably the actual news stories — the main body of the paper, in other words — have a) relentlessly promoted the scare narrative that Covid-19 is an almost unprecedentedly serious threat, and b) relentlessly promoted the official government line that the lockdown is necessary, important and scientifically justified — and also a great national moral endeavour akin to World War II. Stories that contradict the official narratives have either been played down, ignored, or reported very late in the day. Stories that promote the official narrative have been hammered home. One example of this is hydroxychloroquine, which is invariably reported in the MSM as something scary, maverick, hazardous — and which President Trump was quite irresponsible to promote as a potential solution. There are few if any countervailing stories about medics who claim to be using it successfully, and if these run they are always heavily caveated. UK Follows Trump’s Lead, 10,000 Health Workers to Trial Hydroxychloroquine as Preventative https://t.co/YUdcybwZHh — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 21, 2020  The same is true of the reporting on Sweden. There’s an argument that Sweden’s laissez-faire policy towards lockdown — with people left largely free to make up their own minds whether they want to self-isolate or not — will ultimately prove the most sensible and least economically damaging. Yet while you’ll read columnists saying this in the comment sections you’ll almost never see it reported in the news pages. Instead what you get is heavily biased reports like this recent one in the Telegraph: Sweden has now overtaken the UK, Italy and Belgium to have the highest coronavirus per capita death rate in the world, throwing its decision to avoid a strict lockdown into further doubt. According to figures collated by the Our World in Data website, Sweden had 6.08 deaths per million inhabitants per day on a rolling seven-day average between May 13 and May 20. This is the highest in the world, above the UK, Belgium and the US, which have 5.57, 4.28 and 4.11 respectively. However, Sweden has only had the highest death rate over the past week, with Belgium, Spain, Italy, the UK and France, still ahead over the entire course of the pandemic. You’d almost think that the mainstream media do not want Sweden to be proved a success because then it would embarrass those governments which have adopted more draconian policies. And you’d be right, too. The British MSM’s relentless propagandising on behalf to the official government line initially puzzled me. Normally, after all, as happened with Brexit, you might have expected a range of views — some newspapers pro-, some anti-. So why the unanimity on coronavirus? Part of the answer can be found in this government strategy document from March 22nd. It was put together by the behaviour experts who advise the government on how to nudge the public in a particular direction. Perceived threat: A substantial number of people still do not feel sufficiently personally threatened; it could be that they are reassured by the low death rate in their demographic group (8), although levels of concern may be rising (9). Having a good understanding of the risk has been found to be positively associated with adoption of COVID-19 social distancing measures in Hong Kong (10). The perceived level of personal threat needs to be increased among those who are complacent, using hard-hitting emotional messaging. To be effective this must also empower people by making clear the actions they can take to reduce the threat. But how could the government recruit Britain’s diverse and — hitherto — famously intractable media into pushing its propaganda message? Simple. Here is a report from April 20th in the publishing trade press: The UK government has aired a coronavirus public information campaign across print, TV, radio, digital and outdoor since March. The latest iteration of the campaign, which was created by the National Health Service’s ad agency MullenLowe, features frontline health workers and the tagline, “Stay home. Protect the NHS. Save lives.”  Wavemaker is the media agency leading the push. “We recognize the vital role that media organizations, including local newspapers, play in ensuring the provision of reliable, high-quality information during this time,” said a U.K. government spokeswoman. “We also understand the acute pressures newspapers are facing financially due to the steep drop in advertising revenues and the implications of the lockdown on print circulation.” Total government spend? £35 million. Admittedly this is dwarfed by the estimated losses expected to be borne by the British print media this year: Analysts at Enders analysis predict the pandemic will cause the UK newspaper and magazine sector to lose £750 million ($933 million) in ad revenue and £150 million ($187 million) in print sales this year. But in desperate times you’ll accept any lifeline, however flimsy, and it would seem that the flailing, drowning MSM has grabbed it with both hands. The supposedly independent MSM is in fact bought and paid for by the government. (And by other vested interests. Let’s not overlook the many millions the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has given to the BBC.) The British public, it’s true, are still largely in favour of the lockdown and fearful of the coronavirus — so it’s arguable that the MSM is doing no more than being led by its market. But it’s equally arguable that the reason the public remains so cowed and compliant is that the MSM so terrified them with its one-sided reporting that propaganda ended up being mistaken for real news — with devastating consequences for the economy. Could the reason for the collapse in the MSM’s sales partly be that the public are finally waking up to the fact that what they’ve been hearing from the MSM cannot be trusted? And if the result of this failure of trust is the destruction of the MSM, it would be a kind of poetic justice, would it not?

Riyadh (AFP) — Saudi Arabia will end its nationwide coronavirus curfew from June 21, except in the holy city of Mecca, the interior ministry said Tuesday, after more than two months of stringent curbs. Prayers will also be allowed to resume in all mosques outside Mecca from May 31, the ministry said in a series of measures announced on the official Saudi Press Agency. The kingdom, which has reported the highest number of virus cases in the Gulf, imposed a full nationwide curfew during Eid al-Fitr, the Muslim holiday that marks the end of the fasting month of Ramadan. The ministry said it will begin easing restrictions in a phased manner this week, with the curfew relaxed between 6 am and 3 pm between Thursday and Saturday. From Sunday until June 20, the curfew will be further eased until 8 pm, the ministry added. The kingdom will lift the lockdown entirely from June 21. “Starting from Thursday, the kingdom will enter a new phase (in dealing with the pandemic) and will gradually return to normal based on the rules of social distancing,” Health Minister Tawfiq Al-Rabiah said on Monday. Saudi Arabia has reported around 75,000 coronavirus infections and some 400 deaths from COVID-19. In March, Saudi Arabia suspended the year-round “umrah” pilgrimage over fears of the disease spreading in Islam’s holiest cities. That suspension will remain in place, the interior ministry said. Authorities are yet to announce whether they will proceed with this year’s hajj — scheduled for late July — but they have urged Muslims to temporarily defer preparations for the annual pilgrimage. Last year, some 2.5 million faithful travelled to Saudi Arabia from around the world to participate in the hajj, which Muslims are obliged to perform at least once during their lifetime.

The Detroit News reported Monday that Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s (D) husband exploited her position to urge a dock company to put his boat in the water before Memorial Day weekend, despite strict coronavirus guidelines. The paper reported: The owner of a Northern Michigan dock company says Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s husband wanted his boat placed in the water before the Memorial Day weekend as Whitmer urged residents not to rush to the region. No longer visible to the public, Facebook posts from NorthShore Dock LLC and its owner, Tad Dowker, focused on what Dowker said was a request last week by Whitmer’s husband, Marc Mallory. The posts have drawn the attention of Republican state lawmakers, who said the Democratic governor’s family may not be following her guidance for the rest of the state. Whitmer’s spokeswoman, Tiffany Brown, didn’t confirm or deny Monday the assertions by the marina company or its owner. Brown said the administration wouldn’t address “every rumor that is spread online.” When told that there was no way to rush his boat into the water, given that the governor had only recently started lifting restrictions, giving the company little time to handle a crush of requests, her husband reportedly said: ‘I am the husband to the governor, will this make a difference?'” Whitmer has earned praise from the left — and criticism from the right — for her severe, statewide restrictions on a wide variety of economic activities during the coronavirus pandemic, including landscaping and construction (which are permitted even in California). However, she — or her husband — would now appear to have joined the long list of politicians, mostly Democrats, who cannot obey the constraints they seek to impose on others. Joel B.

On Monday’s broadcast of CNN’s “Situation Room,” Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R) stated that while his state has seen a “second spike” of cases, it is difficult to know “exactly where these projections are going.” Because projections and modeling have lost a significant amount of credibility. He also stated the spike is “fairly modest compared to where we are in a lot of other hot spots.” Hutchinson stated, “Well, we’re taking significant action in both opening up our economy, which we never shut down, but also gradually lifting restrictions so we can measure where there is an outbreak or a problem that we have to address. And so, when I said that there’s a second spike that we’re seeing, it’s really hard to know exactly where these projections are going. The projections and modeling [have] lost a lot of credibility. And so, we’re having to dig deep into the data. We’re having to dig deep as to where these cases are, what’s causing those, and that’s what we’re concentrating on. And whenever you look at our numbers, our numbers are very modest, low death rate, compared to other states. We have — our hospitalizations are still less than 100. And so, even though we saw a second spike, it’s fairly modest compared to where we are in a lot of other hot spots. But we have a lot of work to do left. And I know there’s been a lot of coverage, Wolf, about the summer and everybody getting out. It is Memorial Day. We had a service today in Arkansas, socially distanced, wearing masks, the right-sized crowds.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, justified his slow reopening of the state on Monday after President Trump threatened to move the location of the Republican National Convention, currently scheduled to be held in Charlotte from August 24 to August 27, if the governor fails to move more quickly. “North Carolina is relying on data and science to protect our state’s public health,” Cooper said in a statement made in response to the president’s comments on Monday. But a look at the science and the data suggest that a complete reopening of the state is in order now. Protesters who gathered in several locations on Monday calling to “ReOpen NC” agreed. Cooper announced on Wednesday that the state would move to Phase 2 of reopening–which still prohibits bars and gyms from reopening and limits gatherings to ten or fewer–on Friday. Cooper said his Phase 2 “Safer at Home” executive order will remain in effect until at least June 26. “After two weeks in Phase 1, the state’s overall key indicators remain stable but the continued increases in daily case counts signal a need to take a more modest step forward in Phase 2 than originally envisioned,” the governor and North Carolina Health and Human Services Secretary Dr.Mandy Cohen said in Wednesday’s statement. The governor conceded that the data for all major criteria for reopening, except for total number of new cases, have either leveled or decreased. The number of new daily cases has increased, but so too has the number of daily tests administered. The percentage of those tested for COVID-19 who are positive declined from 13 percent on April 26, to eight percent on May 20, the day he made his announcement, and current hospitalizations have remained level: From April 29 to May 18, the number of patients currently hospitalized with COVID-19 declined from 551 to 487, according to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCHHS). In the intervening week, it increased back up to 554 as of May 20, when Gov. Cooper made his announcement. While the number of cases that have tested positive for COVID-19 on a daily basis increased from 380 when 5,688 were tested on April 29 to 422 when 12,595 were tested on May 20, even Gov. Cooper admits the number of those who have been tested for COVID-19 has increased dramatically over that same time period. “North Carolina has more than doubled the daily testing rate with more than 8,000 tests completed daily on average. More than 300 testing sites across North Carolina are posted on the DHHS testing information website,” Cooper acknowledged on Wednesday. WSOC TV reported on Monday’s developments: Cooper allowed the state to enter a second phase of gradual reopening Friday with some further loosening of restrictions on hair salons, barbers and restaurants. But he said the state must continue to closely watch virus trends and has ordered entertainment venues, gyms and bars to remain closed. On Monday, Cooper responded to Trump’s tweet, saying, “State health officials are working with the RNC and will review its plan as they make decisions about how to hold the convention in Charlotte. North Carolina is relying on data and science to protect our state’s public health and safety.” At noon, Mecklenburg County and the city of Charlotte released a joint statement, saying, “We are in constant communication with our local and federal counterparts to plan and prepare for a safe Republican National Convention (RNC). The City of Charlotte, Mecklenburg County and other local stakeholders will continue to plan for the RNC while respecting national and state guidance regarding the pandemic. We are working with stakeholders to develop guidelines for several large events planned for Charlotte in the coming months including the RNC and anticipate providing that guidance in June.” Gov. Cooper has consistently slow walked the reopening of North Carolina, as Breitbart News reported back on April 29 when the governor refused to move the state to Phase 1 before May 8, even though the guidelines for Phase 1 reopening had been met more than a week earlier. Cooper did not directly address the state’s apparently expanding problem of COVID-19 nursing home deaths in either his statement on Wednesday announcing Phase 2, or in his responses to the president on Monday. As of April 29, there were 187 deaths from long term care facilities (nursing homes and residential care facilities) in North Carolina, or 49 percent of all COVID-19 deaths, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. In the subsequent four weeks, deaths from long-term care facilities have increased as a percentage of all COVID-19 deaths in North Carolina. According to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, data provided by NCHHS showed that, as of Tuesday May 19, the state had 436 COVID-19 nursing home deaths, or 63 percent of the total COVID-19 related deaths in the state. The NCHHS website reported that as of Friday, nursing homes and residential care facility COVID-19 deaths totaled 458, or 63 percent of the state’s 728 COVID-19 deaths as of that time. (Total COVID-19 deaths in North Carolina as of Monday had increased to 754.)

The net worth of the United States’ billionaire class has increased by $434 billion during lockdown orders implemented by most states to slow the spread of the Chinese coronavirus. Between March 18 and May 19, the nation’s more than 600 billionaires have increased their net wealth by 15 percent from $2.9 trillion in March to now nearly $3.4 trillion, even as more than 36 million Americans are jobless. The analysis of Forbes data, conducted by researchers with the left-leaning Americans for Tax Fairness group, detailed how the wealth of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Microsoft Co-Founder Bill Gates, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffet, and Oracle CEO Larry Ellison has increased by $75.5 billion since the nation’s coronavirus lockdowns began in March. These five billionaires’ growth in net wealth, alone, accounted for 21 percent of all the wealth growth over the last two months among the more than 600 billionaires in the U.S. (Americans for Tax Fairness) (Americans for Tax Fairness) Jeff Bezos, alone, has increased his net wealth by almost $35 billion, or 30.6 percent, since the beginning of the coronavirus lockdowns that forced small and medium-sized businesses to close while big businesses like Wal-Mart, Target, Amazon and Amazon-owned Whole Foods, and Walgreens were allowed to remain open as they were deemed “essential.” While Bezos has grown his wealth, whistleblowers at Amazon have been fired after they revealed outbreaks of the coronavirus at their warehouses. In an exclusive interview with Breitbart News, a whistleblower said he was fired after he exposed a coronavirus outbreak. “We all should have been quarantined with pay,” said former Amazon worker Chris Smalls said. “The building should have been shut down immediately. But that didn’t happen. By the end of the week, Saturday, March 28th, they decided to quarantine me and only me, none of the employees, not even the person I ride to work with every day. So that tells you right there, they put a target on my back to silence me, but what I did was I mobilized a walkout on March 30th that resulted in my termination.” Economists have noted that the wealthiest of Americans, members of the top one percent, are paying a lower tax rate than all other Americans. In 2018, the richest Americans paid a 23 percent tax rate — a 47 percent drop since 1950, when their tax rate was 70 percent. House Democrats’ coronavirus relief package offered the rich even more of a bailout with a provision that would eliminate the cap on the little-known SALT tax deduction. In short, the provision would give millionaires and billionaires more than $100,000 in tax windfalls for the next two years. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

The coronavirus pandemic led to the closure of schools across the United States, leaving districts scrambling to arrange online learning. In Florida that included catering to minors who say it is upsetting that their birth name instead of their chosen name is used when logging in and, in some cases, “outing” those students who have not revealed they are “transgender.” A school district in Jacksonville, Florida, is tweaking its log on protocol to allow students to change their name, according to USA Today: When students log on to Duval HomeRoom — the Duval County school district’s online hub for distance learning — their school-assigned email account or a Microsoft TEAMS video session with their teacher, their legal name is displayed for all to see. For transgender students who go by a different name, it’s a constant sting. “Each and every time I log on to the website to complete my daily assignments, seeing my birth name makes me uncomfortable,” said one student, whom The Florida Times-Union did not name for privacy. “It also makes me uncomfortable to interact with other students, as well as my teachers because I don’t want people to see my birth name on the screen, I want them to see my true one instead, that I plan to go by for the rest of my life.” The student said the practice makes day-to-day tasks like attendance a nuisance because they don’t want teachers and classmates to perceive them differently. “Some of my classmates don’t even know that I am transgender,” a Duval County student said in the USA Today report. “Seeing my birth name is a dead giveaway to that.” “When home learning was launched due to the pandemic, the district developed a process to provide support in the virtual-learning environment,” Duval Schools spokeswoman Sonya Duke-Bolden said in the USA Today report. “The district has been actively providing support to students whenever issues, concerns or challenges arise.” The article noted that the policy has nothing to do with making a legal name change but only applies to the school’s online login system. “No school districts in Florida are changing or removing a student’s legal name without a court order,” said Ian Siljestrom, the associate director of the Safe and Healthy Schools program at Equality Florida. He went on: School districts are simply adding an affirmed name within their existing student information system to ensure that legal names are not a barrier to student success. When an affirmed name is used, a student’s mental and emotional health improves, positively impacting their grades and attendance. Duke-Bolden said in the USA Today article that other schools in Florida are also putting these kinds of measures in place but that it various from school to school, including one that requires a note from parents if the student is a minor — something LGBT activists say is a “red flag” and that children know themselves better than their parents. “According to Trinity Baker, student support coordinator at JASMYN — Jacksonville’s LGBTQ youth center — a parent sign-off is a red flag,’” USA Today reported. She added: That would be an issue in outing students who we know don’t know the safety of their home environments. I can see where we might see some pushback and negative responses to this, but we must trust our children to know themselves better than anyone else. USA Today cites a report from the discredited Southern Poverty Law Center that claimed LGBT students are suffering being away from social clubs backed by Gay Straight Alliance, an organization that has pushed its agenda in U.S. public schools for decades.

Monday on MSNBC, former Rep. Donna Edwards (D-MD) accused President Donald Trump of being “incompetent” and “incoherent” in his messaging. On political conventions amid the coronavirus pandemic, Edwards said, “I think it’s really good for the base to gin up their energy to go back to their states and be enthusiastic and excited going back to help the candidate, help the nominee. But the reality is, Democrats are trying to figure out how to have either a safe convention or ways in which their delegates can engage that keep them healthy. I don’t know what Republicans are doing. I think Governor Cooper to his credit is really trying to look out for the health and safety of North Carolinians, and also, all of those who would come and go, maybe carrying this virus.” Edwards added, “But look, this is a referendum on Donald Trump. And I think the Biden campaign and Democrats understand that and let the president be out there all he wants. And every day, he looks more incompetent and more incoherent in terms of the message he wants to send to the American people.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Three-time Olympic gold medalist Shaun White granted a special request from some small but enthusiastic fans on Wednesday.     When you drive by a request like this you can’t say no. Definitely brought back some memories seeing these kids killing it on their starter ramp in the neighborhood, so I stopped to skate with them from a safe distance. Hard to see cuz the masks but I was stoked to put smiles on some young faces during these tough times and these kids definitely brightened my day… thanks for the session 😷🏻 A post shared by  Shaun White (@shaunwhite) on May 19, 2020 at 5:13pm PDT In an undeniably adorable video posted to Instagram on May 20, legendary snowboarder and skateboarder Shaun White stops his car to grant a special request. White, wearing a mask and carefully distant from the children amid the global COVID-19 pandemic, can be seen pulling some basic tricks on small wooden ramps set up for the children, who eagerly watched. In between his own miniature runs, White can be seen clapping and cheering the children on as they make heroic attempts to imitate the extreme sports star. The post has already garnered more than 200,000 likes as of the time of this writing. “When you drive by a request like this you can’t say no.

Monday on MSNBC, Rep. Bobby Rush (D-IL) discussed the Trump administration supporting Republican State Rep. Darren Bailey’s lawsuit challenging Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s (D-IL) stay-at-home order. Host Katy Tur said, “I want to get your reaction to the DOJ’s lawsuit, and here’s what they say in a statement, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. ‘The governor of Illinois has over the past two months sought to rely on authority under the Illinois emergency management agency to impose sweeping limitations on nearly all aspects of life for citizens of Illinois, Significantly impairing in some instances their ability to maintain their economic livelihoods.’ What’s your response to that?” Rush said, “I think that that suit is insane. Not only insane, but it’s an inane suit. The governor of Illinois has done an outstanding job in terms of trying to keep Illinois safe, keep us healthy, keep this disease contained. We’re all uncomfortable, but at least we’re alive, some of us.” He added, “I think the governor has done an outstanding job leading this state to put us in a position where we can contain this dreaded disease. So I applaud the governor. I stand behind him. I’ll certainly advocate for the measures that he’s taking. It’s inconvenient. What is inconvenient when you’re talking about lives? Particularly for our senior citizens, for those who are poor, those who are sitting on the sideline. The governor is doing a fantastic job. A very courageous job. I absolutely, beyond a shadow of a doubt, stand shoulder to shoulder with him, no matter what arises from the suit. What misguided people — whatever actions they may take.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

The U.S. economy is on the mend. The coronavirus and shutdown orders were devastating for the U.S. economy, sending unemployment to record highs and output crashing at the fastest pace in modern history. But there are several signs that the worst hits from the shutdowns are in the rearview mirror and that the economy has begun to recover. It’s not exactly off to the races, however. We were laid low and now we’re up again, limping but moving ahead. Forget the debate over what alphabetical symbol or piece of athletic equipment the recovery will resemble. Unlike a V or a W or even hockey stick, the economy is a process without an end. The gauges we use to measure the economy, such as gross domestic product, are at best rough outlines that attempt to describe conditions created through an endless series of exchanges of products and services through the mediums of currencies and credit. But by looking at various measures of activity, we can get a sense for whether our economic activity is contracting further, stagnating, or expanding. And many of those available to us as “high frequency” or “real-time” data suggest recovery has already begun. Rail traffic, for instance, has been climbing for five weeks after tumbling dramatically in mid-February and then falling through the following 10 weeks. The upswing has not been anywhere near as sharp as the downturn, however, which suggests the recovery is proceeding slowly and, perhaps, deliberately. Data on driving and walking provided by Apple, based on requests for directions from its map application, also indicates increased activity. A week ago or so, requests for driving routes moved up beyond the mid-January baseline Apple uses to represent pre-coronavirus America. It dropped off again, below the baseline, and returned this weekend. What’s more, walking directions are up above the baseline for the first time. Transit requests are still below the norm. Some of this recovery is seasonal. More people are out driving and walking because the weather has turned far nicer in much of the country. People are not sheltering in place, staying home, as much as they did in March and April, when it was unseasonable cool in much of the country. But seeing some regular seasonal behavior is a sign that the economy is on the mend.  We still do not know if warmer weather will temper the rate of coronavirus infections but we do know it has decreased the propensity for Americans to avoid venturing out. That’s very important. It suggests that many Americans will be willing to return to work and return to other forms of economic activity, such as shopping in non-essential stores, even if we do not have a vaccine or certainty on how to treat the virus. Hotel reservations have been rising for a few weeks now. And there is evidence that this is more than a seasonal effect. All forms of mobility requests from Apple maps are now 16 percent above the January baseline in the U.S. But that is not true everywhere else we would expect to see a similar seasonal boost. Germany is down 8 percent. Italy is down 25 percent. The U.K. is down 35 percent. Air travel is up. The daily tracking of people passing through TSA checkpoints rose to 348,673 on Friday, the highest point since the outbreak hit. A month earlier, less than 100,000 people flew. The latest figures are still far below the 2.7 million who flew a year ago. Restaurant reservations have picked up from almost non-existent in early May, according to data from OpenTable. As the month opened, reservation volumes were down 99.9 percent compared with a year prior. Now they are down 87.8 percent. That’s better than Canada, U.K., Ireland, an Australia. Germany, however, has seen a massive recovery from 100 percent in early May to a 54 percent decline this weekend. Home sales tumbled in April but did not melt away completely as some expected. Applications for building permits were well above expectations in April, as were housing starts. There will be an avalanche of negative news in the weeks to come. Jobless numbers are likely to show layoffs continue, with millions losing their jobs every week. But the pace of layoffs has slowed, with each week coming in lower the last. But the official unemployment rate, already at a record, will likely climb higher before it begins to moderate. Most forecasters seeing it remaining elevated into early next year. And the GDP numbers for the second quarter will likely confirm that we are in a deep recession. Most forecasters think the economy will shrink at an annualized rate of 40 percent in the second quarter after contracting at a 4.8 percent rate in the first quarter. But it is expected to bounce back in the third and fourth quarters, although the economy will likely end the year 6 to 7 percent smaller than it was at the end of 2019. But those quaterly figures can conceal the fact that the real economy doesn’t really have quarters. It has months, weeks, days, and moments. And while April and May were horrendous in many ways, the second half of May looks better than the first half and June looks even more promising.      

The popular Theodore Roosevelt Park located on an island in the Potomac River in Washington, DC, is not accessible by car because the parking lot is closed, but walking trails are still open, according to local radio station WTOP. An article listing outdoor venues where people can get out of the house and stay safe included Theodore Roosevelt Park, which is also a popular spot for watching planes take off and land at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.. “Over on Theodore Roosevelt Island, get a good workout in and then take a stroll along one of the three walking trails,” WTOP reported. The National Park Service’s web page on Theodore Roosevelt Park has a coronavirus banner: Following guidance from the White House, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and state and local public health authorities, we are increasing access and services in a phased approach across all units of the National Park System. Before visiting a park, please check the park website to determine its operating status. Updates about the overall NPS response to COVID-19, including safety information, are posted on www.nps.gov/coronavirus. Two bullets points on the website homepage state: • In an effort to slow the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) and encourage social distancing, the parking lot at Theodore Roosevelt Island is closed. • Public restrooms are currently unavailable on Theodore Roosevelt Island, so please plan your visit accordingly. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has announced that the nation’s capital will start Stage 1 reopening on Friday, May 29. The park authorities could not be reached to ask about the parking lot decision due to the national holiday. Follow Penny Starr on Twitter.

A historic Massachusetts drive-in cinema reopened on Memorial Day to sold-out screenings after the state lifted coronavirus restrictions on certain businesses as part of its phased approach to restarting its economy. The Mendon Twin Drive-In cinema kicked off the holiday with midnight screenings of Jurassic Park and The Rocky Horror Picture Show, with both movies selling out, according to multiple reports. The cinema, located in Worcester County, first opened in 1954 and is regarded as one of the best drive-in theaters in the country. Watch below:   Drive-in’s have seen a resurgence in popularity in several states during the coronavirus era, offering moviegoers the communal cinematic experience with natural social distancing. In Florida, two new drive-in movie theaters are coming soon to the Miami area. In New York, moviegoers will be able to watch the big screen in Yankee Stadium’s parking lot as part of the “Uptown Drive-In Experience,” a festival that will take place each weekend this summer. Demand is also strong in states including Texas and New Jersey as most regular cinemas remain closed due to the Chinese coronavirus. But in New Mexico, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D) has reportedly halted the reopening of a popular drive-in movie theater despite local city officials believing it would be legal. Massachusetts began its phase one reopening last week, allowing a limited number of businesses to resume operations and to welcome back customers. Businesses including construction, manufacturing, and real estate were allowed to reopen May 18 while drive-ins, barbershops, and others were allowed to resume on Memorial Day.

Appearing Monday on MSNBC, network contributor Dr. Vin Gupta suggested that lawmakers should mandate mask usage to combat further spread of Chinese coronavirus, comparing the proposal to the ban on smoking inside public facilities. MSNBC’s Dr. Vin Gupta: “We should make masks mandatory in public. Just like we ban indoor smoking, because you know what? You shouldn’t have to breathe somebody else’s secondhand smoke. I shouldn’t have to breathe exhaled Covid-19 in somebody’s breath.” pic.twitter.com/9N61Pjf2uw — Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) May 25, 2020  A partial transcript is as follows:  CRAIG MELVIN: Would requiring masks across the board help? Is that feasible? DR. VIN GUPTA: I’m going to say this for the benefit of your family — I know you have young kids — for my family, and for all Americans, we should make masks mandatory in public, just like we ban indoor smoking, because you know what? You shouldn’t have to breathe somebody else’s secondhand smoke. I shouldn’t have to breathe exhaled COVID-19 in somebody’s breath. Nobody should. We should institute mandatory masks in public when you can’t guarantee social distancing. That means retail stores, public transportation, workplaces. That’s absolutely where we should be heading. It makes no sense we’re not already there. People are flouting the rules. A security guard at a retail outlet in Michigan died trying to encourage a customer to wear a mask. They shot him because they didn’t like the way it was trying to be enforced, that policy. We need to not put the onus on security guards at local outlets to enforce this policy or to encourage Americans to abide by it. It’s all in our interests that we wear masks. The evidence is overwhelming. We just need governors to do their job.

Monday on CNN’s “Newsroom,” network host and political commentator S.E. Cupp accused President Donald Trump of being “not healthy and not well,” amid the coronavirus pandemic. On Trump’s coronavirus response, Cupp said, “I think we should say, this has long gone past offensive, and distasteful. I think what we’re seeing is the president losing it. I don’t think the president’s behavior is that of a healthy, stable, balanced person, that he can’t spend all of his energy, efforts and attention on this global pandemic, on securing the physical and economic safety and health of this country is very alarming. Instead, devolving down these rabbit holes of conspiracy theories, baseless conspiracy theories as you pointed out, attacking women for their looks and their weight, you know, threatening governors, one in Michigan for mail-in voting, another in North Carolina for not guaranteeing a full house at the RNC. This is not how a healthy controlled person would behave at all, let alone during a pandemic, and on a weekend meant to honor the memories of our fallen soldiers. I think it’s time for us to just call this what it is. The president is not well.” On Trump’s tweets over the weekend, Cupp said, “I say this is beyond offensive, because of course it’s offensive, it’s grotesque, it’s not healthy behavior to do that. It’s not helping him. It’s not helping his own cause politically. I saw some members of his own party in Congress tweeting at him. Please stop doing this. This is not helpful. This is not productive. So there’s no good reason why he’s acting this way, which leads me to believe, I think what anyone can plainly see is obvious, that he’s not healthy and not well and at the worst possible time for our country to have someone in charge who cannot master basic control and discipline to focus on this incredibly serious task at hand.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

A World War II veteran about to turn 100 years old in June has made it his quest to walk 100 miles to raise money for those suffering financially from the coronavirus pandemic. Mickey Nelson, who turns 100 this June, is calling his quest “Walking to 100,” and chose the Salvation Army to receive the donations he receives from his endeavor, according to a statement from the Salvation Army. Nelson said he was inspired by a British army veteran who did 100 laps in his garden to raise millions of pounds for the United Kingdom’s National Health Service. “I know that people are struggling, either from the illness or a job loss from all the businesses shutting down,” said Nelson, who lives in Clarks Grove, Minnesota. “I just thought there was something I could do to help.” Nelson has lived in Clarks Grove — a small city 90 miles away from Minneapolis — his entire life, with the exception of when he went off to fight in World War II. He still lives in the same house he was born in back in 1920, according to the Salvation Army. Nelson maintained tanks during World War II, owned a thriving bus business for 58 years, as well as a successful sand and gravel company. Since mid-March, nearly 22 percent of Minnesotans, or 700,000 people, have filed for unemployment. The state’s unemployment rate skyrocketed to 8.1 percent in April, marking the highest its been since 1983. Nelson selected the Salvation Army Northern Division to receive the proceeds he gets from his walk. The charity provides food and emergency assistance to North Dakota and Minnesota. “We have been working very hard to help those in need since mid-March. Our staff is working overtime and our resources are being stretched like never before,” said Lt. Colonel Lonneal Richardson, commander of The Salvation Army Northern Division. “But this effort being made by Mickey is truly selfless, and we are grateful for and inspired by his efforts.” Those who wish to donate to Mickey’s cause can do so by going to SalvationArmyNorth.org/mickey.

Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro once again joined a large crowd of supporters on the streets on Sunday, this time in Brasilia, hugging children and shaking hands in defiance of medical advice to engage in social distancing. Bolsonaro’s display – he flew a helicopter to the rally and took his mask off before engaging the crowd – occurred hours before President Donald Trump announced a ban on entry into America of non-U.S. citizens who have been in Brazil in the last 14 days. Trump has imposed similar measures, most famously his ban on Chinese nationals and visitors to China, in response to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. Brazil has currently documented more coronavirus cases than any nation on earth except America, not counting suspected fraudulent numbers from hard-hit nations such as China and Iran. Sunday’s rally congregated outside of the presidential palace in Brasilia, the nation’s capital, in support of Bolsonaro amid mounting potential scandals, most prominently accusations by former Minister of Justice Sergio Moro that Bolsonaro’s administration was not committed to fighting corruption in the government. Bolsonaro, a conservative, won the presidency largely by campaigning against the widespread corruption of socialist politicians. Moro joined the administration after leading an investigation that led to the conviction and imprisonment of former socialist President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Brazilian newspaper O Globo reported that Bolsonaro donned a mask to get on a Brazilian Air Force helicopter to visit his supporters, flanked by several cabinet members, but took the mask off once he approached the crowd. Video from the event shows the crowd yelling supportive slogans at the president, including referring to him by their nickname for him, “the legend,” and seeking to shake hands. The crowd appears tightly packed together and many wore soccer shirts display the yellow and green of the Brazilian flag. In several videos, Bolsonaro can be seen, without a mask, embracing a small girl and giving a boy in a Neymar shirt a piggyback ride. O Globo noted that the state government that controls Brasilia has made it illegal to be out in public without a mask. Bolsonaro described the event in one video as a “spontaneous rally by the people” and a sign of the health of Brazil’s democracy.   As in the United States, Brazil’s governments have the power of calling for specific public health measures if they deem necessary. Many have done so, often against open challenges from Bolsonaro, who has dismissed the pandemic as a “little flu” and warned against collapsing Brazil’s economy in the name of protecting citizens from infection. In addition to criticism from governors, who imposed regulations to prevent mass gatherings and encourage mask use, reports began to surface in April that Brazil’s criminal drug gangs had begun hiring doctors to go into the nation’s favelas, or slums, to care for the poor who live there and showed symptoms of the Chinese coronavirus. “The virus is here, we’re going to have to confront it. Confront it like a man, not a boy,” Bolsonaro told supporters at another rally in Brasilia in March. “We’re all going to die one day.” Bolsonaro has challenged lockdown measures by going out in public and encouraging crowds to form, urging Brazilians to patronize local businesses and engage in normal daily life. “What I have said from the beginning is that ‘we are going to be careful, the over-65s stay at home.’ We just can’t stand still, there is fear because if you don’t die of the disease, you starve,” Bolsonaro said during a public appearance in March. Bolsonaro is 65 years old. “Brazil cannot stop or we’ll turn into Venezuela,” he said in another public appearance against the lockdown. As a candidate, Bolsonaro campaigned on curbing growing Chinese Communist Party influence in the country, warning that “the Chinese are not buying in Brazil. They are buying Brazil.” As president, however, Bolsonaro has actively encouraged communist investment, traveling to Beijing in October and signing eight economic agreements with dictator Xi Jinping. Bolsonaro also gifted Xi a soccer shirt. The Communist Party actively discouraged measures to contain the Chinese coronavirus during the early days of the outbreak, most prominently opposing travel bans on Chinese citizens. On Sunday, President Donald Trump announced a travel ban on non-U.S. citizens who have been present in Brazil in the past 14 days – the believed incubation period of the Chinese coronavirus – taking effect on May 28. The ban mirrors similar, and widely criticized, action Trump took regarding travel to China at the peak of the outbreak there. Bolsonaro’s administration, which has enjoyed friendly relations with Washington since the president took over in 2019, has urged against perceiving the ban as a slight against Brazil in particular, noting that Trump imposed similar travel limitations on other countries with high numbers of coronavirus cases. At press time, Brazil has documented 363,211 cases of Chinese coronavirus and 22,666 deaths. Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.

Monday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Sen. Gary Peters (D-MI) accused President Donald Trump of extreme “hypocrisy” over his objections to mass vote by mail in light of the coronavirus pandemic. Host Joe Scarborough asked, “The president has been attacking Michigan repeatedly, attacking the governor. Now claiming that Michigan’s doing something inappropriate as it relates to absentee ballots. Tell us what’s going on there. Is Michigan doing anything differently now than it’s done in the past under Republican governorships? Peters said, “Well, it’s outrageous what the president has been saying about absentee voting and the ability for folks in Michigan to request an absentee ballot. In 2018, we had a proposal on the ballot, and the folks here in the state voted by a very large majority to have the right to request an absentee ballot for no reason. Prior to that, you had to be a senior citizen or verify that you were going to be out of town. Now anybody can ask to have a ballot sent to their home and vote. The president apparently doesn’t like that. And yet it is the constitutional right of everybody here in Michigan to be able to exercise their right to vote, to have the ballot on their kitchen table to be able to take time to think through the various issues and to vote.” “And yet this president is saying that that is wrong,” he continued. “And the amount of hypocrisy is extreme given the fact that my understanding is that the president nearly every time he has voted, he votes by mail. Everybody in Michigan should have the right to be able to vote by mail as well. And it is all we’re seeing from the secretary of state now. She’s mailing out applications to folks here in the state asking whether or not they would like to vote by mail. It is their right and to threaten holding back funding for that is simply outrageous.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

The coronavirus-era phenomenon of weekly public applause for medical workers has taken a less positive turn, as opponents of Britain’s Conservative government have called on followers to indulge in a public shaming ceremony. Plans to give opponents of the government a chance to vent their frustration in a united public show of “hate” — an emotion invoked by many in their writings about the plan online — has metastasised on social media, apparently in response to the prime minister’s decision to stand by the pro-Brexit special adviser Dominic Cummings. Mr Cummings acting as a flashpoint for anti-government “hate” underlines the way attitudes towards the 2016 Brexit referendum still acts as the greatest faultline in British politics — even during coronavirus. As a guarantor within the government for Brexit being delivered as promised — and having only recently thwarted a plan to delay Brexit again, cooked up while he and Mr Johnson were incapacitated with the virus — Mr Cummings has made himself plenty of enemies. Twitter blue-tick anti-Brexit musician-comedian Vikki Stone — cited by local news media as instrumental in setting up the idea of launching a ‘Boo for Boris’ — told the Derby Telegraph that the fact Mr Cummings was not resigning was “beyond what is acceptable”. This is getting a lot of online traction #booforboris https://t.co/M2C2YFhAH8 — Owen Jones says join a union🌹 (@OwenJones84) May 25, 2020  Calling the planned nationwide expression of hate “cathartic”, Stone said opponents of the government should tell “those in power that we are angry”. The concept since been shared or promoted by such luminaries as The Guardian‘s Owen Jones, and sometimes of the BBC John Sweeney. Just in case the nature of the present feeling against the prime minister and his adviser Dominic Cummings was not clear enough, the Orwellian mood music was underlined Saturday when an enormous television screen was parked outside Cummings’ house. Footage from journalists camped outside the property hoping for a glimpse of the special adviser showed part of the video was a close up on the prime minister’s face discussing the lockdown.

What started out as a voluntary expression of support for carers quickly took on more authoritarian tones in some neighbourhoods, however, with one notable incident reflecting the leverage of social shame to punish individuals not turning out to applaud. As Breitbart London reported in April, a hard-worked British mother found herself too tired to take part and was subsequently named and shamed by an online mob. Explaining she had had a “rough night” with her child, the woman said at the time of her community turning against her: “I was mortified. The post said everyone else turned out and I showed the street up and if I can’t spend a minute showing my appreciation I don’t deserve to use the NHS if I or my family get ill… It’s really disturbing how quickly people are ready to turn on each other and ‘report’ each other.” Online Mob 'Names and Shames' British Mother for Not Clapping for NHS https://t.co/38uAiZHpMo — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 25, 2020 

Reports from across the Middle East, Africa, and Asia this weekend described Muslims ignoring coronavirus lockdown bans on large gatherings to celebrate Eid al-Fitr, the end of the Ramadan holiday season, usually celebrated in a highly social manner. A lockdown was imposed in Iraq for the duration of the Eid holiday, for example, and while some Muslims used social media to celebrate without meeting in person, others insisted on gathering at homes and in mosques. The Palestinian Authority felt obliged to ease its coronavirus restrictions after large numbers of Palestinians ignored them to fill the streets and demand the right to hold Eid prayers and celebrations.  After a throng of demonstrators marched to PA security headquarters in Hebron chanting “Allahu Akbar! We want to celebrate Eid al-Fitr!” officials announced that mosques in nearly a dozen towns would be allowed to open for Eid prayers.  In parts of the West Bank where the lockdown remained in effect, Muslims ignored the restrictions to stage large prayer services on streets and in sports arenas, leading to some clashes with security officers and several reports of injury from gunfire. Many business owners also defied the lockdown to open their shops, since Eid is one of their most important shopping holidays. “What we saw in the past 24 hours was a mini-intifada against the harsh restrictions imposed by the Palestinian government. The people feel that these measures are exaggerated. If people are allowed to go to shopping malls, why can’t they pray at their mosques?” one resident of Hebron told the Jerusalem Post. In Egypt, the staff of an isolation hospital in Alexandria defied a government ban to hold a large Eid prayer service. They also handed out balloons, snacks, and toys to their patients. The hospital director noted that in consideration for especially sick patients who need their rest, prayer chants were only broadcast over the public address system a few times. Defiance of the lockdown was widespread in Kabul, Afghanistan, as people filled the streets to buy traditional Eid treats and gifts. The Afghan government urged citizens to respect the lockdown because coronavirus cases spiked over the past ten days, raising fears that Eid celebrations will cause a new outbreak. “We are concerned that if the lockdown is not imposed properly, the number of cases will get out of control and beyond our capacity to treat or test them. We want a strict lockdown,” said Deputy Health Minister Waheed Majroh at a press conference on Saturday. Packed mosques were reported in Indonesia despite the coronavirus pandemic:  Muslims were also seen defying pandemic controls to celebrate Eid in Africa, with crowds gathering to pray at mosques in Cameroon and Nigeria.  Nigerian officials lifted most of the pandemic restrictions and attended large prayer services themselves, along with top religious officials. One Eid prayer service was held in an open field large enough to accommodate tens of thousands of people. Hundreds crowded into numerous mosques across the country, with very little attention paid to social distancing protocols, although a few imams reported lower-than-normal attendance due to coronavirus concerns. “We are here to pray, so I don’t think it is necessary to wear a nose mask or leave a space between myself and the next person,” one mosque attendee explained. Public officials were said to be dismayed that one of the few restrictions they left in place, a ban on women and children attending Eid services, was widely ignored. Cameroon saw thousands of Muslims gather for Eid prayers despite a strict ban on such assemblies. The police used force to disperse several gatherings during the Ramadan season and shuttered at least 13 mosques for defying lockdown orders. Government officials expressed surprise that so many citizens were ignoring their safety instructions, while defiant citizens explained it would have been disrespectful to the Quran if they failed to perform Eid prayers in public with other worshipers. Some Cameroonian Muslim leaders urged their followers to at least observe social distancing practices if they insisted on holding Eid group prayers and celebrations.

Dominic Cummings has criticised the establishment media for making false reports about his lockdown while suffering from coronavirus, claims which he said resulted in threats of violence against him and his family. Mr Cummings had rejected media claims that he had driven from London to Durham simply to stay with his parents, rather that he had stayed at an isolated cottage on his father’s farm, “worried if my wife and I were ill, there was no one in London that we could reasonably ask to look after my child”. He said had arranged for two nieces aged 17 and 20, whom he said were old enough to look after a child but young enough to be out of the danger zone, to be on standby if both he and his wife Mary were incapacitated by Chinese coronavirus. He added that he did not interact with people while ill, did not visit or stay with his parents, and food was brought to his family by relatives and left outside of the property. The activist media has been giving wall-to-wall reporting of claims that Mr Cummings had repeatedly broken the lockdown laws, echoing calls for the prime minister’s trusted adviser — a Vote Leave alumnus who seeks to drain the Westminster swamp and purge the Remain-backing Civil Service (at times referred to as the British “Deep State”) — to be fired. Mr Cummings told reporters in the gardens of Downing Street on Monday evening: “I think there is understandable [public] anger, but a lot of that anger is based on reports in the media that have not been true. It’s extremely regrettable, but the media that were reporting some of these things that were wrong were told they were wrong, but they reported them anyway. “And that has caused a lot of anger. I know. People have shouted at me in the street: ‘Why did you go back? Why did you go back to see your parents just because you wanted to?’ But I did not do that.” He added that due to the intense scrutiny by the media, “I was subjected to threats of violence. People came to my house shouting threats. There were posts on social media encouraging attacks.” Boris Adviser Cummings Squashed Plan to Delay Real Brexit Concocted While He and PM Had Covid https://t.co/OW7YXEm7Mb — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 24, 2020  “Stories that I returned to Durham on April 13th are false and that I returned on April 19th. Data on my phone, such as texts and pictures, can prove this,” he added. “I don’t regret what I did. I think reasonable people may well disagree about how I thought about what to do in the circumstances, but I think what I did was actually reasonable in these circumstances. The rules made clear that if you are dealing with small children, that can be exceptional circumstances. “And I think that the situation that I was in was exceptional circumstances and the way that I dealt with it was the least risk to everybody concerned if my wife and I had both been unable to look after our four-year-old,” he rationalised. “I would stress to people that they should not believe everything they read in the newspapers and everything they see on TV. Because lots of things that are reported are not, in fact, the case,” he urged the British public. Breitbart London reported on Sunday that while he and the prime minister were “laid out on their sickbeds” with coronavirus, they were working to squash a plan by Remainers to extend the transition period, delaying a clean-break from the EU.

Actress Rosanna Arquette says removing “fascist” lawmakers from government will be one outcome from the Chinese coronavirus pandemic in the U.S., where she says the death toll will eventually rise to millions. “We’ve handled this so poorly in America, the pandemic — we didn’t have an incredible president like (Prime Minister Jacinda) Ardern in New Zealand. We handled this in such a terrible way that now it will spread and kill, I think, millions. It’s terrifying,” the Pulp Fiction and The Whole Nine Yards actress said in an interview with AFP. Deaths in the U.S from COVID-19 (at press time) were just over 98,000. “Women are powerful. They’re smart. And they’re mothers. And so they have a natural instinct to protect, and immediately take care.” Arquette — a hardcore #MeToo activist, who proudly says “I’m voting for Biden,” despite Biden facing sexual assault allegations — also told the outlet that one solution to the pandemic will be riding the U.S. government of fascists. “And I believe that the young people that are coming up are going to be voting. And we’re going to get rid of these people that are so fascist (in) government,” she said, without naming who the fascists in government needing removing are. Actress Rosanna Arquette kneels in front of American flags. Arquette captioned her now-deleted tweet: “I’ll never stand for the flag again.” “We’re seeing that big money rules everything, and that very well may continue,” Arquette, whose net worth is estimated at about $9 million, said. “But so many human beings are seeing that this is just not fair. It’s unfair on every level.” (Does Rosanna Arquette know or care to know that her candidate Joe Biden was raking in “big money” with the help of a top Amazon leader six months ago… and now he’s bashing… wait for it… Amazon)?  .@JoeBiden We pay every cent owed. You spent 3 decades in the Senate & know that Congress wrote these tax laws to encourage companies to invest in the US economy. We have. 500k jobs w/ a min wage of $15/hr across 40 states.

ROME — Two and a half months of forced lockdown has pushed many married couples into crisis, Italian media report, and divorce filings have seen a whopping 30 percent increase since the outbreak began. Marriage counselors took to Skype and WhatsApp to help struggling couples cope with the stress of lost jobs and extended co-confinement during the 67 days of national lockdown but this did not stop the surge in requests for divorce, Corriere della Sera reported last week. According to accounts related by counselors, the irritation caused by everything from badly squeezed toothpaste tubes, socks left on the floor, suspicious phone calls, and tight shared spaces has been magnified by the extended lockdown, resulting in a run on the divorce courts. The occasional relief of home tensions from a dip in the sea or a walk in the woods was no longer an option, resulting in homes becoming virtual pressure cookers, with prolonged silence alternating with outbreaks of angry shouting, recriminations, and even domestic violence. For this reason Italy’s National Lawyers Council made the decision to allow couples in certain regions to request divorce by email, to be followed by an online hearing to be conducted virtually by the lawyers, without the participation of the parties. One marriage counselor, Annamaria Bernardini de Pace, says she received no less than sixty emails after the lockdown began and when phase 2 was launched on May 4, twelve couples initiated divorce proceedings. “One client of mine kicked her husband out of the house, who had to go back and live with his mother,” she said. “In the auto-certification, he wrote that he needed to take care of her because she was sick.” According to Gian Ettore Gassani, president of the Italian association of marriage counselors, a number of marriages fell apart because affairs were discovered. “One husband hoped to get away with the excuse of the mile-long line at the supermarket,” Gassani said. “In reality he was visiting his lover, who was also the next-door neighbor, and he sent another person to the supermarket in his place.” “The problem was that his wife became suspicious and followed him,” Gassani added. “The result was that they called me at one o’clock in the morning and I don’t know who was screaming more, the wife or the husband.” In just two days he saw 8 couples looking to end things, he said, an outcome he expected after weeks of consulting via Skype, telephone, and WhatsApp. Valeria De Vellis, a well-known divorce lawyer, said that her usual practice is to send troubled couples to therapy if they are still talking to each other, especially if they have children, but that is not working these days. “Of the cases arriving on my desk these days, there is little to salvage,” she said, “since the situation, which exploded during isolation, has had too much time to fester.” She also described unprecedented divorce hearings with judges via video-conferencing, which lacked the opportunity for reconciliation that occasionally happens when the meetings take place face to face. As some media have suggested, the health crisis caused by coronavirus has turned out to be just the tip of the iceberg, now being rapidly overshadowed by the economic crisis, the suicide crisis, the marriage crisis, and the loan-sharking crisis.

China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi urged the world in remarks Sunday to “champion” global governance and globalization in light of the ongoing Chinese coronavirus pandemic. “Globalization, multilateralism and global governance should be championed and optimized in the post COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] pandemic world,” Chinese state media quoted Wang as saying, speaking to reporters in an extended session. In a rare admission, Wang also said that globalization creates some problems, including “unbalanced” development on a worldwide scale. He offered a novel solution for these issues. “We need to mitigate the unbalanced regional developmental issues and inequality created by globalization, but the issue of globalization needs to be solved with globalization,” Wang reportedly said. “The most important lesson that can be learned from the [Chinese coronavirus] pandemic is that people’s lives and health are closely connected with each other’s and that all countries are in the same global village.” Wang’s remarks are part of a greater campaign on the part of the Chinese Communist Party to diminish the power of state governments and expand the scope of international governing venues, particularly those it controls in bodies like the United Nations. Chinese dictator Xi Jinping has made multiple remarks in the past two months urging the world to develop global public health hubs – and establish them in China – and supporting maintaining centralized Chinese control of global supply chains. Xi has mentioned expanding global governance regularly during public remarks in recent memory. “Whether it is domestic governance or global governance, we must have people’s sense of fulfillment as the objective and continue to provide confidence and expectations of stability for the people,” Xi said after meeting with United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Gutérres in April 2018. “We need to keep pushing for and improving global governance to deal with this challenge.” At that year’s BRICS summit – an economic coalition uniting China with Brazil, India, South Africa, and Russia – Xi announced “the next decade will see a profound reshaping of the global governance system.” More recently, Xi has promised to expand China’s control of global supply chains and its pharmaceutical production capacity, nominally in an attempt to help the world fight the pandemic it created. At the World Health Assembly last week, Xi announced that China would develop a vaccine against the Chinese coronavirus and offer it for free, effectively dissuading the world’s pharmaceutical companies from conducting competing research. Xi also announced that China would build a “global humanitarian response depot and hub” in China that would hoard medical supplies to more efficiently distribute them worldwide in the event of another pandemic. While dismissing concerns that trends towards globalization weaken national sovereignty on Sunday, Wang also insisted in the defense of China’s sovereignty, including over territories it does not have legal sovereignty over, like in the South China Sea. “China will be firmer in its determination and take much stronger measures to safeguard its national sovereignty, security and development interests and resolutely prevent the external forces from interfering in its domestic affairs,” Wang said, referring to what the official newspaper of the Communist Party, the People’s Daily, described “the tasks of Chinese diplomacy in 2020.” China claims nearly the entire South China Sea, including the sovereign territory of the Philippines, Vietnam, Brunei, Taiwan, and Malaysia. A 2016 ruling from the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague declared Beijing’s claims illegal, but the Communist Party has disregarded that ruling. Last week, satellite evidence revealed that the People’s Liberation Army had flooded Fiery Cross Reef, a Philippine territory China has turned into a military base, with a fleet of fighter jets. Wang called the situation in the South China Sea “more stabilized and better.” Wang also reportedly defended Chinese “sovereignty” in the face of a growing number of lawsuits against the Chinese state around the world, including in places like the United States, Egypt, Nigeria, and Italy. At least one of the American lawsuits, brought by the state of Missouri, specifically identifies the Communist Party of China as the defendant, not the state of the People’s Republic of China, in an attempt to bypass sovereign immunity. Missouri Senator Josh Hawley (R) has also proposed a law to allow an exception to sovereign immunity – which prevents lawsuits against state persons – in cases of coronavirus victims suing China. “Beijing will not accept lawsuits from other countries on losses from COVID-19 and such attempts to infringe on China’s sovereignty and dignity are doomed to failure,” Wang asserted. Leaked Chinese documents show that the government was aware of cases of Chinese coronavirus as early as November 2019, yet waited until late January to alert the world to an outbreak in the central city of Wuhan. By the time the outbreak was made public, five million people had left Wuhan for the Lunar New Year holiday, according to the city’s mayor, Zhou Xianwang. Chinese officials also admitted this month that they destroyed early samples of the virus, making it impossible for scientists to study them and trace the pathogen’s evolution. In addition to “safeguarding” China’s sovereignty, Wang listed in his remarks Sunday among his goals the safeguarding of several economic realities that grant China dominance over world trade: “Wang said the country will also strive to maintain the stability of the global industrial chains, promote trade liberalization and facilitation to counter the downward pressure on the world economy.” Wang’s remarks suggest an expansion of Xi’s promise in March to ensure that China continues to control global manufacturing.

University of Michigan President Mark Schlissel has nixed the return of football, unless on-campus classes have also restarted. Some thought that the Wolverines could return whether the rest of the campus had reopened or not, but Schlissel shot that idea down, the Detroit News reported. “If there is no on-campus instruction then there won’t be intercollegiate athletics, at least for Michigan,” Schlissel told the Wall Street Journal. He later added he has “some degree of doubt as to whether there will be college athletics (anywhere), at least in the fall.” Schlissel also noted that however they decide to reopen the campus, that plan will stay intact for the rest of the school year. The school’s announcement seemed to run contrary to plans floated by the NCAA Division I Council, which was working for an early college football return. The sport’s governing body voted to approve the re-opening of college football and women’s basketball beginning on June 1. Some colleges, including Ohio State, have already told athletes that they can begin using training facilities in the first week of June. Still, Schlissel says he imagines that on-campus classes might resume for the fall semester. “We’re hoping to have a fall semester,” he told the Detroit News. “What I am calling it is a public-health-informed fall semester.” Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh recently said he would be okay with playing in an empty stadium. “Heck yeah I’d be comfortable coaching a game without any fans,” Harbaugh said. “If the choice were, play in front of no fans or not play, then I would choose to play in front of no fans. And darn near every guy I’ve talked to on our team, that’s the way they feel about it.” Harbaugh also noted that it is probably unrealistic to assume that a stadium full of fans could be tested and determined to be free of the coronavirus.

Then they can think about games. “Eventually, you look at playing games. Is that possible? That’s the No. 1 question that our players have, and we have,” he said. “But you can see the path that you could play with players being tested, coaches being tested. Referees, that if you test negative, you can participate in the game.” “So, let the kids play. Hopefully, we’ll get some more good news as the summer progresses,” he concluded.

Former NFL wide receiver Dennis McKinnon questioned arbitrary government determinations of “essential” and “non-essential” businesses on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Sunday with host Joel B. Pollak. “Government has put a price on your head,” said McKinnon. “They’re determining what your value is. “What’s essential to me is not what’s essential to Joel.” “How does the government determine what’s essential for you to survive?” asked McKinnon. “Americans, taxpayers, citizens, you have more value than what has been exercised since this virus.” LISTEN:  McKinnon addressed furloughs during the coronavirus outbreak. “Too many executives — especially CEOs — get way too much money when things go bad,” McKinnon stated. Many executives overlook the “blood, sweat, and tears” of employees while treating employees’ sacrifices as an “afterthought,” he added. McKinnon said, “I don’t believe in furloughs. Furloughs mean, ‘You know, what? You can be out for awhile, but chances are we’re not going to bring you back.’ It’s just allowing you to have a few more weeks of misery.'” Americans constitutional rights are being violate during the viral outbreak, determined McKinnon. “This country was built on democracy,” McKinnon remarked. “We fought for the Constitution, for the First, Second, and Fifth amendments, which have been violated every day, right now.” Federal aid money is not being appropriately distributed, assessed McKinnon. “The ones who really did not need any money were the first in line,” McKinnon said. “They should have never been in front of the line in the first place. There’s always some excuse when those who really need the most [are not helped.] ‘Oh, we’re sorry. We had a glitch.’ No, it wasn’t a glitch. It was predetermined.” Pollak asked about resuming NFL games. “I’m really biased when it comes to sports,” replied McKinnon. “Basketball, baseball, soccer, wrestling, nothing moves the needle like football. Football is in our DNA, and I think from that perspective, we have to have it.” McKinnon continued, “Moving forward in 2020 without fans might be the only way that we can get back to work and getting back to our game. Maybe 2021 will be different once there’s a vaccine, but now we’ve got to be careful. We’ve got to be smart. We are going into uncharted territory.’ “There is no perfect way of doing anything,” added McKinnon. “The most important thing is safety first, and if we come out of the gate and things don’t go well, we stop it.

During Monday’s “New Day” on CNN, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D) sounded off on people in his state pushing to reopen businesses and the beaches by staging protests and being critical of him via aerial advertising. “New Jerseyians have been incredibly responsible throughout this entire crisis, and I have no reason to believe they won’t continue to be,” Murphy said. When it comes to the criticism of how he is handling the lockdown, Murphy said he is not swayed by protesters demanding to reopen the state. Instead, he told “New Day” host Alisyn Camerota he is swayed by “the facts and the data and the science.” “I don’t begrudge their right to protest, but they don’t sway me,” he stated. “The only thing that sways me are the facts and the data and the science. And listen, I want to open salons and gyms as much as anybody, but I think folks know this, but when you talk about indoors, lack of ventilation, close proximity, sedentary — you saw that hairstylist or salon worker in Missouri in the spread that she engendered, that’s real. So, gyms … I want to get them opened as much as the next guy, but we’re not there yet. I want to do it responsibly, and I don’t want to kill anybody.” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent

France has announced that it will be imposing “reciprocal” quarantine measures on British arrivals after the UK said that international travellers will be required to self-quarantine for two weeks upon entering the country in order to prevent a second wave of the Chinese coronavirus. French ministers said that the quarantine would be set in place from June 8th, the same day in which the UK will begin quarantining airport arrivals. “We take note of the British government’s decision and we regret it. France is ready to put in place reciprocal measures as soon as the system comes into force on the British side,” a spokesman for the French interior ministry said, according to The Times. “For travellers arriving from European countries whose authorities have decided, in an uncoordinated fashion, to apply 14-day quarantine measures to travellers entering their territory from European countries, a voluntary 14-day quarantine period will be reciprocally requested,” the French Embassy website announced. “Travellers arriving from the United Kingdom, whatever their nationality, will be asked to go into a 14-day quarantine period when the British 14-day quarantine measure actually comes into force,” the statement added. ‘Too Late’: Farage Criticises Open Borders While Britons Locked Down in Coronavirus Crisis https://t.co/M2By5p6V6F — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 23, 2020  Last week, home secretary Priti Patel announced that those entering the country through the nation’s airports will be required to fill out an online form stating where they plan to spend the 14-day quarantine. People will be subject to random spot checks from health officials to determine if they are abiding by the quarantine and will face a fine of up to £1,000 for failing to comply. Notable exceptions to the quarantine rules will include the arrival of foreign workers who have been shipped in from Eastern European countries like Romania and Bulgaria to pick vegetables and fruit. Freight industry and haulage workers will also be exempt from the quarantine in order to keep the flow of goods coming into the country. “As the world begins to emerge from what we hope is the worst of the coronavirus pandemic, we must look to the future and protect the British public by reducing the risk of cases crossing our border,” Ms Patel said. “We are introducing these new measures now to keep the transmission rate down and prevent a devastating second wave,” she added. Over 1,800 Private Planes Arrived in UK During the National ‘Lockdown’ https://t.co/BCUWfNs56z — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 19, 2020  As opposed to most countries in the world, the British government refused to shut down entry for foreign travellers, allowing an estimated 100,000 unscreened airport arrivals to pour into the country per week, despite a nationwide lockdown being imposed on the British public. The government has claimed that because of the speed at which the virus was spreading, any restrictions on airport travel would have been ineffective at slowing the spread of the Wuhan virus. However, the decision to impose quarantines starting in June suggests that this was not the case. The move to introduce quarantines at this stage of the pandemic, instead of the early stages of the outbreak, has been widely criticised by members of the aviation and tourism industries, who fear that it would have dire consequences for the already struggling British economy. “Introducing a quarantine at this stage makes no sense and will mean very limited international aviation at best. It is just about the worst thing government could do if their aim is to restart the economy,” the chief executive of industry body Airlines UK, Tim Alderslade, said.

President Donald Trump has taken criticism from his opponents and the media for golfing on Memorial Day weekend. But his predecessor, President Barack Obama, golfed on seven of the eight Memorial Day weekends of his presidency. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic Party nominee to challenge Trump in the fall, tweeted a criticism that Trump was golfing on Saturday, in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic: Nearly 100,000 lives have been lost, and tens of millions are out of work. Meanwhile, the president spent his day golfing. pic.twitter.com/H1BVNtgVjA — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) May 24, 2020  The media echoed that criticism. However, President Obama was notorious for golfing — even when the country was at war, or in mid-crisis. And he golfed on Memorial Day weekend every year but one. According to the tally at trumpgolfoutings.com, Obama golfed: The only exception was in 2010, when Obama went back to visit Chicago — and drew criticism from conservatives for failing to lay a wreath at Arlington National Cemetery on Memorial Day to mark the occasion. (He laid a wreath at Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery near Chicago, instead.) In a series of tweets, President Trump responded to the criticism, noting it was the first time he had golfed in months — and that Obama had infamously golfed after speaking briefly about the beheading of American James Foley by ISIS: Some stories about the fact that in order to get outside and perhaps, even a little exercise, I played golf over the weekend.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 25, 2020  ….3 months and, if I waited 3 years, they would do their usual “hit” pieces anyway. They are sick with hatred and dishonesty. They are truly deranged!

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 25, 2020  Trump also returned to the golf course as several states began opening public amenities for recreation, and after Dr. Deborah Birx of his coronavirus task force told Americans to enjoy the outdoors while observing “social distancing.” Before Saturday’s outing, Trump last golfed on March 8, 2020.

Several thousand race fans flocked to a North Carolina speedway on Saturday and watched a race. However, while fans were in abundance, there were very few masks or gloves to be seen. According to reports, only about one in ten fans wore either gloves or masks, as 4,000 racing fans sat in the stands at the Ace Speedway. “They’ve been locked up,” Gene Yarboro, 64, told the Charlotte Observer. “They want to go somewhere, and this is the only place, really, legal to come around.” According to the Observer: All week, that had been a point of contention — the legality of this gathering. When North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper announced that the state would enter Phase Two of its gradual reopening amid the pandemic, the news came with limits. Cooper’s executive order, for one, prohibited mass gatherings, and those had been defined as any gathering of more than 10 people indoors, or more than 25 outdoors. Within about 10 feet on either side of Yarboro, there were more than 25 people. He didn’t mind. Nobody here minded, and whatever concerns anyone had were outweighed by the desire to be a part of the mutual experience. Only a few people wore any kind of coverings over their face and Bare, the man checking the bags at the gate, was among them. ‘It’s been years since we had this many people,’ he said. NASCAR returned to the racetrack on May 17th, but did so without fans. Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn

The British government will make plans to reduce the United Kingdom’s reliance on imports from foreign countries like China after a study revealed that the UK is reliant on the communist country for the supply of 71 “critical goods” including pharmaceuticals, personal protective equipment (PPE), and electronics. Headed by Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Dominic Raab, codename “Project Defend” will examine the resilience of the UK’s economy and supply chain vulnerabilities of “essential supplies” strategic for national security. One of the two Whitehall groups conducting the review will look into what the UK needs to do to bolster “onshore” supplies production, such as chemical components for drugs, with the government even considering intervening to “repatriate” essential manufacturing. “The way China has been acting has really alarmed people in Downing Street,” one source told The Times.  Another insider told the newspaper of record: “We’re seeing resilience as a national security issue. If we are reliant on other states for particular things that is, in effect, a national security concern. The question is how can you mitigate that? You’ve got an awful lot of national security people working into these kinds of things.” The UK struggled to obtain coronavirus testing kits for the Chinese virus, as well as ventilators and personal protective equipment (PPE), with the production of these items being outsourced overseas in recent decades, including to China. Even with purchasing the desperately-needed items from China, many European nations found the Chinese imports faulty and even potentially deadly. Conservative MPs Urge Govt to Reduce ‘Dangerous’ Dependence on Communist China https://t.co/uIS6kiId9t — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 14, 2020  Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, who takes a hard line on Chinese dominance, warned in March that coronavirus exposes Western countries’ reliance on the oppressive communist country for their strategic supply chains. Earlier this month, a report by the Henry Jackson Society revealed that the UK is dependent on China in its supply chains for 71 “critical goods” categories including electronics, chemicals, and drugs essential for producing anti-viral drugs and antibiotics. Between 80 and 90 per cent of the UK’s drugs production relies on foreign imports. The government has been coming under mounting pressure from its own MPs to reduce dependence on China as well as to cut ties with Chinese government-backed firm Huawei, which Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in January could be involved in developing the UK’s 5G network. The move was condemned by intelligence partners and British politicians who warned it could threaten security and even endanger relations between the Five Eyes (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America) and trading partners. Conservative MPs have also warned that China is going to use the economic crisis caused by its coronavirus to swoop in and buy struggling British technology companies. Senior Tories Accuse Chinese Interests of Exploiting Coronavirus Crisis to Dominate UK Tech https://t.co/VyI8f6dM6E — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 15, 2020  On Wednesday during Prime Minister’s Questions, Tory MP for South Dorset Richard Drax asked Mr Johnson if the UK would follow France and conduct a “root and branch review” of the defence supply chain, following French concerns that China is buying up defence-rated companies that are going bust during the pandemic. Mr Drax also asked whether the prime minister is considering rowing back on his Huawei decision. While failing to answer the question on the Chinese tech giant directly, Mr Johnson said: “We are certainly bringing forward measures to ensure that we protect our technological base. [The defence committee will] be hearing a lot more about that in the next few weeks.” A YouGov poll from May 19th found that nearly half, 47 per cent, of Britons saw the prospect of China becoming a superpower “more of a threat” to Britain, with just 11 per cent thinking it could represent an “opportunity” (22 per cent responded “neither”, 20 per cent “don’t know”). While Britons, on the whole, appear sceptical of China’s motives on the world stage, they also in the majority back the communist country facing a lawsuit for covering up the dangers presented by the Wuhan-born COVID-19 in the early weeks of the outbreak. When the Henry Jackson Society said in April that Western countries should sue China for compensation, 71 per cent of Britons agreed with 74 per cent blaming China for the spread of the deadly virus.

Despite assurances by officials, Mexico continues to see a steady increase in deaths from the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). Health leaders are also seeing a daily escalation in confirmed cases. During the daily news conference, Mexico’s Undersecretary of Health Hugo Lopez Gatell revealed that Mexico reached 7,394 fatalities and 68,620 confirmed cases. In recent days, Mexico has been saw a spike in confirmed cases despite official claims about a flattened curve. Al 24 de mayo de 2020 hay 68,620 casos confirmados, 14,247 confirmados activos y 28,931 sospechosos por #COVID19. Se han registrado 121,613 negativos, 7,394 defunciones confirmadas, 595 defunciones sospechosas y fueron estudiadas 219,164 personas. 1/3 pic.twitter.com/KTpIAyRAog — Hugo López-Gatell Ramírez (@HLGatell) May 25, 2020  Mexican health officials have only carried out 219,164 tests, while the U.S. leads with nearly 15 million. Mexico ranks 10th globally for deaths and 52nd in testing. Federal health officials are roundly criticized for only estimating the impact of the virus and artificially deflating numbers. Lopez Gatell previously admitted that some of his figures only account for government hospitals. Several states now release their own statistics. In recent days, an NGO claimed that figures for Mexico City only account for one-third of the total Coronavirus deaths. The organization accessed death certificates for their study.

Sunday, Fox News Channel’s Steve Hilton opened his “The Next Revolution” program with a call for policymakers to reopen schools. which he said was a needed part of the recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. Hilton pointed to other nations, which have already begun opening their schools up, and argued there were consequences from a prolonged shutdown of the school system “Get on with it and reopen schools now before you do even more needless damage,” Hilton said. Partial transcript as follows: HILTON: There won’t be a recovery unless we reopen schools now. If children can’t go to school, parents can’t go to work. We’re told schools must be closed to keep kids safe, but they’re not in danger. According to CDC data, children under 18 make up only two percent of cases and 0.6 percent of hospitalizations, children under 14 make up just 0.02 percent of deaths. Now, the media misinformation machine is fear-mongering about a new mystery disease that affects children. Dr. Fauci cited this when pushing back on Rand Paul’s demand to reopen schools this year. But we’re talking about a handful of cases which are almost always treatable. How offensive to try and frighten parents about the safety of their children? A more serious argument for school closures is that while children may not get sick themselves, they can infect others. Do they? We are constantly told to follow the science and the data, well, here it is. One study found, quote, “Even if children do get infected, they are less likely to transmit the disease to others than adults. We have not found a single instance of a child infecting parents.” They lecture us about contact tracing while they did it for a boy with coronavirus. They found that even though he came into contact with 172 classmates and teachers while symptomatic, he didn’t transmit the disease to any of them, not one out of 172 people. In Switzerland, the country’s head of infectious disease says scientists, quote, ” … now no young children don’t transmit the virus.” And because of all of this, France, Israel, Germany, Greece, Portugal, South Korea and many other countries have already begun letting their children back into schools. Two weeks after Denmark reopened their schools, a scientist in the Department of Infectious Diseases at Aarhus University said, “There are no signs whatsoever that the partial reopening has caused the biggest spread of infection.” Yet still, the schools here are closed, even in states where bars and restaurants are reopening. Where in all of this is our own CDC, by the way? Why do we have to rely on scientists from Switzerland, Denmark, Iceland? Yet another reason for the bungler in chief, useless Dr. Robert Redfield to go. Meanwhile, the mental health toll on children grows by the day, as does the loss of learning — all of it hurting the poorest areas most, especially those in remote parts of the country, with unreliable internet and the poorest families. Any leader anywhere in America who is not planning to reopen schools now, not in the next few months, not in the fall, but now is a data denier and a science denier. Get on with it and reopen schools now before you do even more needless damage. But once we reopen schools and businesses, we can’t have stupid regulations stifling the recovery. Masks, fine. But what’s this unscientific nonsense about compulsory temperature checks? Totally pointless. You’ll miss most people with coronavirus and catch many who don’t have it. These completely arbitrary social distancing rules, 25 percent occupancy, 33 percent, 50 percent. What’s it even based on? Only one or two people allowed in an elevator at one time? Good luck trying to reopen New York like that, or any downtown business district frankly. This over-prescriptive regulation is typical of the infantilizing mindset of our technocratic ruling elite. If you boss people around with arbitrary rules, they’ll resist, but ask people to behave responsibly with commonsense, and they will. Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor

Chinese dictator Xi Jinping once again made public remarks admitting major shortcomings in Communist Party public health management, telling a delegation from Hubei province on Sunday to make “prompt efforts” to fix “weak links” in the system. Hubei’s capital is Wuhan, the city where the Chinese coronavirus pandemic began. The delegates are in Beijing as part of what the Communist Party calls its “Two Sessions,” the annual meetings of its two federal lawmaking bodies, the National People’s Congress (NPC) and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). China’s Xinhua news agency quoted Xi discussing public health during a meeting Sunday with Hubei deputies at an NPC session. Xi’s remarks were the first about public health since his speech at the World Health Assembly last week, where he announced that China would be developing a Chinese coronavirus vaccine and distributing it globally for free. Xinhua published photos of the occasion on Sunday, showed Xi at the center of a high table sitting about six feet apart from other deputies, as doctors have recommended adhering to social distancing guidelines. Xi is the only one seen in the photo not wearing a mask:  The photos are notably different from those of the CPPCC, where hundreds of representatives were apparently forced to sit in tightly packed quarters; Xi was not in attendance for their session last week: China’s “Two Sessions” legislative meeting on May 21, 2020. “China’s public health and medical service systems have played their key roles in dealing with the epidemic, but some weak links and inadequacies were also exposed, urging prompt efforts to fix them,” Xinhua paraphrased Xi as telling the Hubei delegation. (State media often eschew quotes, opting for paraphrasing.) Xi reportedly “emphasized more targeted and effective prevention and the fulfillment of responsibilities for reporting infectious disease epidemics and public health emergencies.” Regarding any specific reforms, the Xinhua coverage only quoted Xi as specifying small work items such as “wearing masks, sorting garbage, social distancing and online reservation for hospital visits.” He urged the construction of more public health centers at the national and regional levels but did not details what those centers would do. Xi also “called for adopting the philosophy of full life cycle management.” The Chinese dictator did not reportedly mention any specific weak links or shortcomings in how Hubei handed the local outbreak, instead applauding Hubei Communist Party officials for the “enormous sacrifices” they allegedly made. Xi’s lack of criticism did not reflect what many at the national level have done outside of Chinese media since the outbreak began in Wuhan last year: turn on local Wuhan officials and blame them for allowing the virus to get out of control. “The local authorities didn’t like to tell the truth at that time,” Zhong Nanshan, China’s top respiratory illness doctor, told CNN last week of the pandemic. “At the very beginning, they just kept silent.” In January, Zhou Xianwang, the mayor of Wuhan, admitted that his government kept the outbreak secret but blamed convoluted Communist Party law for preventing him from making public health emergency information public. Since Beijing made it illegal to warn his residents, Zhou said at the time, five million left Wuhan before the Communist Party alerted the world to a novel coronavirus outbreak. Zhou has been notably absent from media appearances since those statements, though he appears to remain mayor of Wuhan at press time. This month, China admitted that, in addition to hiding pivotal epidemic information from the public, local officials also destroyed early samples of the Chinese coronavirus taken from infected patients and from an open-air meat market Chinese officials initially claimed was the likely source of the outbreak. By “disinfecting” the market and destroying the samples, Communist Party officials made it impossible for scientists to compare the virus’s features in currently infected patients to its early iterations, thus making it less likely that they will be able to trace the virus’s evolution or find its original source. Prior to admitting this, Chinese officials had dropped the wet market origin theory for the virus and had begun spreading the conspiracy theory that the U.S. Army was the true source of the pandemic. Xi’s praise for Wuhan officials on Sunday echoes his remarks at the World Health Assembly, where he once again claimed that the pandemic had stopped being a problem for China. “In China, after making painstaking efforts and enormous sacrifice, we have turned the tide on the virus and protected the life and health of our people,” Xi told the global public health body. “All along, we have acted with openness, transparency, and responsibility. We have provided information to the W.H.O. [World Health Organization] and the relevant countries in the most timely fashion. … We have done everything in our power to support and assist countries in need.” Just a week prior, Xi told the steering group of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee – the most powerful communists in the country – that “huge uncertainties still linger over the pandemic … and the country is still seeing infections among clusters of people in certain areas.” There is no evidence that the shift from “the country is still seeing infections” to “we have turned the tide” was a truthful reflection of a major change in the pandemic’s effects in one week’s time. Multiple reports suggest that Wuhan continues to see infection clusters, many potentially hidden by local officials not counting patients likely infected. Xi’s remarks to the “steering group” also appear to contradict his declarations from Wuhan in March that the outbreak had been contained and the nation could return to normal business activities.

California Secretary of State Alex Padilla (D) responded Sunday evening to Republicans’ lawsuit against the state to block Gov. Gavin Newsom’s (D) recent vote-by-mail order, suggesting the move is a “political smear campaign” by President Donald Trump, designed to use the Chinese coronavirus pandemic for voter suppression. “Expanding vote-by-mail during a pandemic is not a partisan issue — it’s a moral imperative to protect voting rights and public safety. Vote-by-mail has been used safely and effectively in red, blue, and purple states for years,” Padilla wrote on social media. “This lawsuit is just another part of Trump’s political smear campaign against voting by mail. We will not let this virus be exploited for voter suppression.” Earlier Sunday, the Republican National Committee (RNC), National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), and California Republican Party (CRP) sued Newsom and Padilla, alleging an executive order mandating that all state registered voters receive mail-in ballots is an “illegal power grab.” “In a direct usurpation of the legislature’s authority, Governor Newsom issued an executive order purporting to rewrite the entire election code for the November 2020 election cycle,” the lawsuit reads. “This brazen power grab was not authorized by state law and violates both the Elections Clause and Electors Clause of the U.S. Constitution.” The complaint alleges that Newsom has “created a recipe for disaster” that could possibly invite voter fraud. The suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California. “Democrats continue to use this pandemic as a ploy to implement their partisan election agenda, and Governor Newsom’s executive order is the latest direct assault on the integrity of our elections,” RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said of the suit. “Newsom’s illegal power grab is a recipe for disaster that would destroy the confidence Californians deserve to have in the security of their vote.” The suit was filed hours before President Trump accused Democrats of attempting to use the pandemic to push mail-in ballot plans for the November election, warning the move will lead to “the greatest Rigged Election in history.” “The United States cannot have all Mail In Ballots. It will be the greatest Rigged Election in history. People grab them from mailboxes, print thousands of forgeries and “force” people to sign,” the president tweeted. “Also, forge names. Some absentee OK, when necessary. Trying to use Covid for this Scam.”

According to a recent report, American billionaires have enjoyed a huge boost in net worth in the first two months of the Chinese virus pandemic, earning around $434 billion since March 19, when many states went into lockdown.
 According to a new report published by left-leaning think tanks Americans for Tax Fairness and the Institute for Policy Studies, as many Americans struggle with financial hardship due to the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic, U.S. billionaires have actually seen an increase in their net worth by approximately $434 billion, Business Insider reports. Forbes reports that 623 billionaires live in the United States, this includes Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, investor Warren Buffett, Oracle founder Larry Ellison, and Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg. The report from the think tanks alleges that just those five billionaires alone saw their wealth increase by 19 percent, or approximately $75.5 billion. Approximately 600 U.S. billionaires saw their wealth from $2.948 trillion to $3.382 trillion within just two months. Americans for Tax Fairness executive director Frank Clemente said in the report: “The pandemic has revealed the deadly consequences of America’s yawning wealth gap, and billionaires are the glaring symbol of that economic inequality.” Clemente added: “Post-pandemic, the rich and corporations must begin to pay their fair share of taxes so we can build a society that works for everyone, not just billionaires and others at the top.” This week, U.S. weekly jobless claims reached 2.4 million bringing the nine-week total to nearly 39 million.

PRAGUE – A coal mine in the north-eastern Czech Republic near the border with Poland has halted work after a major Covid-19 outbreak among the miners. In recent days, tests of some 2,400 people revealed a total of 212 positive for coronavirus, mostly miners from the Darkov mine in the town of Karvina and their family members. It´s currently the biggest local outbreak in the country. Ivo Vondrak, the head of the regional government, said Monday that only workers who are necessary to deal with ventilation and water pumping remain in the mine. Local health authorities have limited public gatherings in Karvina county to 100, while it is 300 in the rest of the country. Visits to nursing homes and hospitals are banned The daily increase of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the entire Czech Republic was 65 on Sunday. A total of 8,957 people have tested positive in the country, while 315 have died.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz told reporters this weekend it is not clear that worship constitutes something essential, challenging President Trump’s assertion it is. “I think the case that the president is making and that may be up for debate in this country of deeming houses of worship essential, essential services and that’s one that we take into consideration,” the Democrat governor said during an hour-long briefing on opening up religious services during the coronavirus lockdown. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> During the briefing, in which he was joined by state Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm, Gov. Walz announced new guidelines for religious services, saying he would allow houses of worship to reopen at 25 percent occupancy. The governor’s decision came on the heels of confrontation with the Catholic Bishops of Minnesota, who announced last week that public Masses would resume as of May 26, in defiance of the governor’s restrictions. Many people of faith “were disappointed in Governor Walz’s May 13 announcement that he would end the Stay-at-Home order to allow more commerce but prohibit religious gatherings of more than ten people,” an order that “defies reason,” declared the bishops in a May 20 letter. Insisting that the life of faith is “essential,” the bishops declared that they have given Catholic parishes “permission for the resumption of the public celebration of Mass on Tuesday, May 26, which will give us time to be ready for the celebration of Pentecost on May 31.” “Parishes will be required to follow the strict protocols we have published for sanitation and social distancing and will have to limit attendance to one-third of the seating capacity of the church,” they said. “No one will be obliged to attend, as the bishops of Minnesota will continue to dispense from the obligation to attend Sunday Mass.” The bishops insisted that they have striven to work collaboratively with the Walz Administration as well as highlighting their overarching concern for the spiritual and physical well-being of their flock. They also noted the injustice of the governor’s arbitrary targeting of religious practice for especially strict regulation. The letter said that both the Catholic hierarchy and “some Lutheran colleagues” had submitted a joint plan to the Governor on May 8 detailing their sanitation measures and proposing a cap on church attendance limited to 33 percent of building capacity, a plan that the governor rejected. “Given our willingness to coordinate with the Governor, we are especially disappointed that his most recent order (20-56) does not address both the vital importance that faith plays in the lives of Americans, especially in this time of pandemic, and the fundamental religious freedom possessed by houses of worship that allows our country to thrive,” the bishops declared. “The Governor’s remarks today further underscored a failure to appreciate the role of our Church and other faith groups in serving the community,” they said. “The human cost to this pandemic has been extraordinary, not just in terms of lives lost to the virus but the rapidly growing problems of job loss, depression, crime and violence, and substance abuse.” The bishops affirm their unanimous “conviction” that they can safely resume public Masses in accordance with both our religious duties and with accepted public health and safety standards. The bishops also stated that they had suspended the public celebration of Mass “not because we were compelled to do so, but because we judged that the circumstances required it.” “We are blessed to live in a nation that guarantees the free exercise of religion,” they said. “This right can only be abridged for a compelling governmental interest, and only in a way that is narrowly tailored to be the least restrictive means of achieving the desired end.” “We think that the executive order issued last Wednesday fails this test. An order that sweeps so broadly that it prohibits, for example, a gathering of 11 people in a Cathedral with a seating capacity of several thousand defies reason,” they add. Following the governor’s press conference on Saturday, St. Paul & Minneapolis Archbishop Bernard Hebda said he was pleased with Walz’s change of heart. “I am so thankful for the honest, open, and fast-paced dialogue we had over these past days and am pleased we could come to a consensus about a reasonable and safe path forward that allows a greater number of people to safely return to worship,” Hebda wrote.

Former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair has airily dismissed U.S. President Donald Trump’s leadership during the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, instead harking back to his work alongside Bill Clinton and Barack Obama as examples of how global inter-governmental cooperation can win the day. His remarks in an interview with NBC News last Friday followed an earlier intervention in the crisis when his own globalist think tank claimed it is “embedded in governments around the world,” as Breitbart News reported. In his most recent observations, he told NBC News he was worried about the lack of global coordination in tackling the crisis. “The worry I have that an absence of global coordination and global leadership that’s necessary for it is a huge problem,” he said. “When I think back to the times when I’m dealing with American presidents whether it’s Bill Clinton or George Bush, Barack Obama as well, the most important thing at a time like this is to say, ‘How do you bring the world together?”‘ <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> By building more and bigger global government, Blair believes leaders could find a vaccine together, accelerate the development of therapeutics and testing capability, while keeping the international economy afloat. “It’s that global coordination, the absence of which means that each individual country’s less effective at dealing with the disease. That’s the thing that worries me,” he stated. The left-wing former Labour leader was asked his opinion on Trump’s suggestions on fighting the epidemic, he said: “I think most people would understand what I would think, but it’s probably better sometimes not to say it.” Earlier this month the Tony Blair Institute announced it has “teams” advising world governments “to keep their people safe during this pandemic — not just in respect of Covid-19 itself but also the political and economic collateral damage.” It also echoed his own personal call for more resources to be poured into the World Health Organization: Our teams are now embedded in governments around the world, helping them to keep their people safe during this pandemic – not just in respect of Covid-19 itself but also the political and economic collateral damage.

Bush. Under his leadership, the U.K. joined the U.S.-led coalition fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq. In comments made after the release of a 2016 report on the UK’s entry into the Iraq conflict, John Chilcot said he did not believe Tony Blair was “straight with the nation” over the issue. Speaking to BBC News, the chairman of the public inquiry into the 2003 military engagement said Blair pinned his account of events leading up to the war on belief rather than fact.

ATHENS, Greece (AP) – Greece restarted regular ferry services to its islands Monday and cafes and restaurants were also back open for business as the country accelerated efforts to salvage its tourism season. Travel to the islands had been generally off-limits since a lockdown was imposed in late March to halt the spread of the coronavirus, with only goods suppliers and permanent residents allowed access. But the country’s low infection rate in the Covid-19 pandemic prompted the government to start the holiday season three weeks earlier than the expected June 15th date, as other Mediterranean countries – including Italy, Spain, and Turkey — are grappling with deadlier virus outbreaks. Greek Locals Angered over Migrant Camp for 3,000 Placed in Village of 500 https://t.co/qX2IPTATh7 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 19, 2020  Greece has had nearly 2,900 infections and 171 deaths from the virus. Italy has seen nearly 33,000 coronavirus patients die, Spain has had nearly 29,000 dead ,and Turkey has had 4,340 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Social distancing regulations and passenger limits have been imposed on ferries and at restaurants to ward off new infections. State-run health services to combat the coronavirus are being expanded to the islands, with intensive care units being placed on five islands: Lesbos, Samos, Rhodes, Zakynthos, and Corfu, along with existing ICU facilities on the island of Crete. Tourism is a vital part of the Greek economy, directly contributing more than 10 per cent of the country’s GDP. More than 34 million visitors travelled to Greece last year, spending 18.2 billion euros ($19.5 billion), according to government data.

Tom Brady delivered the shot of the match that made it easy to forget the rest of his swings. Tiger Woods didn’t miss a fairway and earned a small measure of revenge against Phil Mickelson. The PGA Tour is set to return in just over two weeks, and it has a tough act to follow.
In the second and final charity match that brought live golf to TV, this exhibition was as entertaining as the real thing. Woods lagged a long birdie putt close enough that his partner, Peyton Manning, didn’t have to putt. That secured a 1-up victory over Mickelson and Brady in “The Match: Champions for Charity.” The goal was to raise $10 million or more for COVID-19 relief funds, and online donations sent money climbing toward about twice that much. This made-for-TV exhibition would have have worth pay-per-view, the model Woods and Mickelson used for a $9 million winner-take-all match in Las Vegas over Thanksgiving weekend in 2018 that Mickelson won in a playoff under lights. It felt forced, lacked banter and turned out to free because of technical issues. Throw in two NFL greats in Brady and Manning, and this allowed viewers to ride along for 18 holes at Medalist Golf Club among four of the biggest stars in sport. Justin Thomas pitched in as an on-course reporter, bringing a mixture of humor and insight with the right amount of words. Woods and Manning took the lead on the third hole and never trailed, building a 3-up lead in fourballs on the front nine, with Manning making two birdies (one was a net par). Brady, whose six Super Bowl titles are more than any NFL quarterback in history, took a beating on social media and in the broadcast booth from Charles Barkley, who twice offered $50,000 of his own money toward charity if Brady just hit the green on a par 3. He missed so far right it would be comparable to a pass that landed three rows into the stands. New Orleans Saints coach Sean Payton weighed in on Twitter, noting Brady signing as a free agent with Tampa Bay by saying he liked the “Florida” Brady much better. Brooks Koepka offered $100,000 if Brady could just make a par. One shot shut everyone up. Never mind that Brady had to take a penalty drop before getting back to the fairway on the par-5 seventh. With his fourth shot, with Barkley needling him relentlessly, Brady’s shot landed beyond the pin and spun back into the cup. “Shut your mouth, Chuck,” said Brady, whose microphone piece dangled off the back of his pants. Woods still thought he won the hole with a 25-foot eagle putt that instead spun hard off the back of the lip. All that, and they ended up halving the hole. Donations for COVID-19 relief funds kept piling up, and the entertainment didn’t stop even as the rain returned. It caused a 45-minute delay at the start, and as Woods said on the practice range, “I don’t normally play in conditions like this.” Mickelson brought out his “Tiger Slayer” putter that he used to shoot 64 at Pebble Beach in 2012, the last time they were in the final group on the PGA Tour. Woods shot 75 that day. It didn’t help Lefty with a few critical birdie putts to square the match, though he rolled in a 15-foot par putt to stay 1 down with two to play.
The back nine was modified alternate shot — all players hit tee shots, and it was alternate shot from there. It was key for the quarterbacks to find the fairway for the pros to hit shots into the green, and Brady came through until the 18th. Woods was playing for the first time since Feb. 16 when he finished last at Riviera in Los Angeles. He chose not to play the next four weeks with his back not feeling just right, and then the pandemic shut down golf and sports worldwide. Woods looked sharp for the most part, with his game and his words. Mickelson on the fifth hole asked Woods to mark his ball from some 80 yards away. “You want me to mark with a U.S. Open medal,” said Woods, a three-time champion of the only major Mickelson hasn’t won. “Do you have one? I have some silver ones,” Mickelson said, referring to his record six runner-up finishes.
Mickelson boasted about taking Woods down on his home course at Medalist, and now their TV matches are tied at 1, even with each getting a little help. Mickelson says he was a little nervous on the front nine until he found his groove, driving the green on the par-4 11th with Brady making a 20-footer for eagle that began their rally. “Phil said he was nervous. I know Tom and I were comparing notes,” Manning said. “To be behind the ropes in these guys’ worlds, to be in the arena with them, it was really a special experience. I was not comfortable the entire time. Knowing $20 million was raised and helping people going through tough times, it was an honor to be invited. “It’s something I’ll always remember.”  

During an appearance on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures,” Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar weighed in on the possibility of a COVID-19 vaccine by the end of 2020 after the CEO of pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca voiced his confidence the company could deliver 100 million doses of coronavirus vaccine in October. Azar noted it is “a very credible objective” for the United States to have “100 million doses” of a coronavirus vaccine as early as October and triple that amount by the early part of next year. “This is a very credible objective,” Azar said to a question about the White House’s optimism of a vaccine by the end of the year. “You know, we just signed a deal with AstraZeneca for the Oxford vaccine, where by October we could have 100 million doses of vaccine and 300 million doses by early next year. And we’re going to place multiple bets like this and drive operation warp speed because President Trump said he demands that we reduce inefficiency in that system when we get these kind of results if at all possible.” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent

On Sunday, Chicago’s first openly gay mayor, Lori Lightfoot, mounted a raid on a black South Side church for holding services in defiance of her coronavirus lockdown orders. Lightfoot reportedly sent three marked squad cars and two unmarked cars full of officers to the Chicago Cornerstone Baptist Church in the South Side’s Woodlawn neighborhood. Woodlawn is just south of Hyde Park, the area in which the Obamas lived for a short time before Barack became president. Who’s growing tired of this lunacy?https://t.co/LXfabUIdBB — Prov356🇺🇸 (@cujo_14) May 24, 2020  The pastor of the mostly black congregation, Courtney Lewis, reportedly shut and locked the doors and refused to allow the officers to gain entry to the building, Todd Starnes reported. Pastor Lewis told Starnes that he felt like he was confronting “the Soviet-style KGB” as the officers pounded on his doors and demanded entry to shut the church down. “Thankfully, our doors were locked as a normal safety precaution we take each service to protect our members from the escalating gun violence in Chicago,” Lewis said. A sentry that is usually posted outside the sanctuary to monitor the street during service also reported seeing occupants of a dark car with tinted windows filming the incident through one opened window. “All we are seeking is the same consideration and trust that is being tendered toward the liquor stores, abortion clinics, and Walmart,” Lewis told Starnes. Lewis is also seeking help from U.S. Attorney John Lausch. “We are trying to follow the laws of man as much as reasonably possible, but when the laws of man conflict with the laws of God, I, as a pastor, have a duty to follow the laws of God,” Lewis wrote in a recent letter to Lausch. “We will not be intimidated by this overhanded government bully, but we are requesting the assistance of our president and our Justice Department in correcting this grave miscarriage of the law.” Lightfoot, Chicago’s Mayor since May of last year, has been targeting the city’s churches for several weeks as houses of worship have begun balking at her draconian lockdown orders. Late last week, Lightfoot excoriated the city’s churches, saying that their desire to re-open is “dangerous and foolish.” Also last week, the city began fining churches that Lightfoot thinks are violating her coronavirus lockdown orders. After some churches started holding services on the second weekend of May, fines were handed out to churches, including Philadelphia Romanian Church of God, Elim Romanian Pentecostal Church, Metro Praise International, and others. Law service Liberty Counsel reported on May 23 that Elim Pentecostal Church and other Romanian churches in the city received letters from the Chicago Department of Public Health, invoking emergency orders and deeming churches a danger to society. The letters also invoked “summary abatement,” which gives the city the power to forcibly enter properties without a judge’s orders and impose the mayor’s will on occupants. On Friday, President Donald Trump updated federal guidelines for re-opening the economy and added that churches are essential institutions and should be allowed to re-open without government opposition. “Today, I am identifying houses of worship, churches, synagogues, and mosques as essential places that provide essential services,” Trump said on Friday, announcing the release of new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. A similar flurry of harsh orders has come from the state’s governor, as well. Illinois’s recently elected Gov. J.B. Pritzker, heir to the billion-dollar Hyatt Hotel chain, continues to maintain that Illinois must remain on near-total lockdown as a measure to stave off the coronavirus. Pritzker, who has instituted the most draconian lockdown in the country, recently decreed that churches must not allow more than 50 worshippers inside at a time, “until there is a vaccine” for the coronavirus. Meanwhile, Pritzker took criticism for demanding that everyone stay at home even as he allowed his wife to fly off to their Florida estate where lockdowns are not as strict. He was also caught ordering construction crews from Illinois to travel to Wisconsin to work on his property there despite those strict stay-at-home orders he was doling out to his constituents. But Pritzker is facing mounting pressure to roll back his authoritarian coronavirus policies. Last Wednesday, the governor succumbed to pressure to cancel his order to criminally charge businesses that opened their doors in defiance of his coronavirus orders. Illinoisans are becoming increasingly restive under Pritzker’s rule. Multiple lawsuits have been filed against the state’s coronavirus decrees, and many county governments are shying away from the lockdowns. A growing number of county sheriffs and board members are refusing to enforce the governor’s orders. Follow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston.

President Donald Trump suspended travel from Brazil to the United States on Sunday as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to worsen in South America. The order, which will take effect on May 28 at 11:59 p.m. ET, denies entry to “all aliens” who were in Brazil two weeks prior to their attempt to gain entry into the United States. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany released the following statement regarding the president’s decision: Today, the President has taken decisive action to protect our country by suspending the entry of aliens who have been in Brazil during the 14-day period before seeking admittance to the United States. As of May 23, 2020, Brazil had 310,087 confirmed cases of COVID-19, which is the third-highest number of confirmed cases in the world. Today’s action will help ensure foreign nationals who have been in Brazil do not become a source of additional infections in our country. These new restrictions do not apply to the flow of commerce between the United States and Brazil. The World Health Organization (W.H.O.) has warned that the epicenter of the deadly coronavirus has shifted from Europe and the United States to South America as Brazil has quickly become one of the hardest-hit countries. “We’ve seen many South American countries with increasing numbers of cases and clearly there’s a concern across many of those countries, but certainly the most affected is Brazil at this point,” said Mike Ryan, executive director of the W.H.O.’s emergencies program. The latest data from Johns Hopkins University revealed Brazil to have more than 347,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus with at least 22,013 deaths. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has continuously downplayed the pandemic within his country and referred to the virus as a “little flu” and the global reaction to it as a form of “hysteria.” Bolsonaro also warned those who contract the virus to take it “like a man” and return to their normal lives. Bolsonaro’s press secretary tested positive for the virus in March after a gathering with President Trump and Bolsonaro at Mar-a-Lago. Both President Trump and Bolsonaro tested negative for the virus afterward. Follow Kyle on Twitter @RealKyleMorris and Facebook.

Up to 94 percent of American voters say they want an economic nationalist overhaul of the United States’ economy in the wake of the Chinese coronavirus crisis, a survey reveals. A survey conducted by FTI Consulting finds that American voters overwhelmingly want economic nationalist policies implemented — including more tariffs on foreign imports, mandatory country-of-origin labeling, and a requirement that goods be made in the U.S. In total, about 66 percent of Americans support increasing tariffs on foreign imports while only 34 percent want more free trade agreements between the U.S. and other countries. Likewise, 76 percent of Americans said they are willing to pay 5 percent to 100 percent more for U.S.-made products over products made overseas. Just 24 percent said they are not willing to pay more money for U.S.-made products. The poll shows that Americans are increasingly growing tired of their goods being made in China. Today, about 4-in-10 Americans say they will not buy products imported from China. A plurality of about 34 percent of the 60 percent of Americans who said they will still buy products from China said they will do so but do not like the fact that they are made in China. Americans are most supportive of economic nationalist policies that mandate country-of-origin labeling so consumers are fully aware of where products are made and imported from, as well as requirements that key supplies, goods, and products be manufactured in the U.S. About 94 percent of Americans said they support requiring labels on each product that indicates all of the countries where the product was designed, manufactured, and assembled and indicates what percentage of the product was made in each country. Only six percent oppose the requirement. A petition asking President Trump’s administration to require country-of-origin labeling for beef, pork, and dairy products has gained traction online while Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Rick Scott (R-FL) have filed legislation to require products sold online to disclose where they are made and manufactured. Americans, the survey finds, by large majorities want the U.S. to mandate that medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, products bought by the Defense Department, airplanes, and airplane parts be made in America. On medical supplies, 88 percent of Americans support a requirement that it be made in the U.S. Only 12 percent oppose such a requirement. For pharmaceuticals, products bought by the Defense Department, airplanes, and airplane parts, 81 percent to 87 percent of Americans support requiring they be made in the U.S. As Breitbart News has chronicled, the U.S. has suffered from a shortage of vital drugs, rubber gloves, and plastic bottles due to decades-long free trade policies. The plurality of these basic necessities are made in China. Similarly, about 95 percent of ibuprofen and 70 percent of acetaminophen imported to the U.S. arrive from China. Since the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was enacted and China entered the World Trade Organization (WTO), five million American manufacturing jobs have been eliminated from the U.S. economy — 3.4 million of which are due to U.S. free trade with China — and 50,000 manufacturing plants have shuttered. The mass elimination of working and middle class jobs, as a result, have coincided with a more than 600 percent increase in trade deficits. American manufacturing is vital to the U.S. economy, as every one manufacturing job supports an additional 7.4 American jobs in other industries. The FTI Consulting was conducted from May 12 to 14. The poll has a margin of error of +/- 3.09 percent. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter at @JxhnBinder.

Boris Johnson’s under-fire chief adviser Dominic Cummings squashed a plan to delay Britain’s true Brexit day which was “all but agreed” while he and the Prime Minister were “laid out on their sickbeds”. Cummings, resented by much of the media establishment and the “deep state” for his role in the Vote Leave campaign and open disdain for journalists and bureaucrats, is currently the subject of a media circus over allegations he broke lockdown rules by travelling from London to Durham so his family could look after his young child if he and his wife were incapacitated by their coronavirus infections. Much to journalists’ chagrin, Boris Johnson has elected to stand by Cummings, saying he acted “responsibly, legally, and with integrity” — causing anti-Cummings commentators such as Piers Morgan of Good Morning Britain to demand that state officials scour his personal data for evidence of potential wrongdoing: Check the CCTV. Check his phone. Check his car GPS. #cummings pic.twitter.com/TLdvF2Le0T — Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) May 24, 2020  Less extensively reported is the fact that, on recovering from the Chinese virus, one of Cummings’ first was to squash a plan “concocted by underlings” while he and the Prime Minister were laid low to delay Britain’s true Brexit day. Technically, the United Kingdom has already left the European Union, but it remains in a so-called “transition period” in which it remains subject to the bloc’s laws, trade policy, judges, and migration regime — effectively EU membership in all but name, but minus representation in EU institutions such as the Commission and the Court of Justice. Remainers had seen the coronavirus as an opportunity to extend this “transition”, currently due to expire in December 2020, and apparently a plan to do so had been “all but agreed at official level” while Johnson and his adviser were out of action. "Is it one rule for you, Mr Cummings, and another rule for everybody else?" … ask journalists, tightly huddling around his car, hilariously in contravention of social distancing rules. This whole thing is absurd and everyone knows it. pic.twitter.com/J44RHSfOHa — Ben Goldsmith (@BenGoldsmith) May 24, 2020  “A deal to extend the transition in light of the [pandemic] had been all but agreed at official level,” reported Jeremy Warner, the Remain-voting assistant editor of The Daily Telegraph, in an article published earlier in May. “The EU was to have spared the UK’s blushes by proposing it, rather than the other way around. This would have allowed the UK government to present the concession as a favour to the EU, rather than a climbdown,” he explained. “But then Dominic Cummings, the Prime Minister’s chief adviser, returned and the plan, concocted by underlings while he and Boris Johnson were laid out on their sickbeds, was scuppered,” he lamented. They’re a bunch of shameless hypocrites.

For example, social media users have observed that reporters hounding him for the alleged dangerousness of his journey to Durham were crowding him and each other in large numbers while making no effort to observe social distancing and not even wearing masks outside his house. A sign with an electronic billboard playing official “stay at home” messaging driven to Cummings’ home by the anti-Brexit activist group Led by Donkeys may also have been flouting the lockdown rules the adviser is alleged to have broken.

A $21 million field hospital in Brooklyn, New York, authorized by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration at the peak of the coronavirus pandemic opened and closed without seeing any patients. The Brooklyn Cruise Terminal in Red Hook was one of several makeshift hospital sites throughout the city intended to relieve the city’s overcrowded hospitals brimming with coronavirus patients, the New York Post reported. De Blasio announced plans for the 750-bed $20.8 million field hospital in Red Hook on March 31, one day after the USNS Comfort hospital ship arrived in New York to aid in the fight against coronavirus. WABC reported that the USNS Comfort treated 182 patients over three and a half weeks before it departed at the end of April. The makeshift hospital in Brooklyn was slated to open in April, but it was not ready for use until May 4, and the site is now being disbanded after not being used, the City reported. “As part of our hospital surge, we expanded capacity at a breakneck speed, ensuring our hospital infrastructure would be prepared to handle the very worst. We did so only with a single-minded focus: saving lives,” de Blasio spokeswoman Avery Cohen told the Post Friday. “Over the past few months, social distancing, face coverings, and other precautionary measures have flattened the curve drastically, and we remain squarely on focused [sic] taking that progress even further,” Cohen added. The funding for the Red Hook makeshift hospital is expected to be reimbursed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

Several Democrats who have insisted on strict stay-at-home orders — including the wearing of face masks when out of doors — have been caught violating the rules that they wish to impose on others for fear of spreading the coronavirus. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D), who has suggested he might make wearing face masks mandatory, was spotted on the boardwalk in Virginia Beach on Saturday — without a mask. The Daily Beast quoted a spokesperson for the governor, who tried to help him save face: Alena Yarmosky, a spokeswoman for the Democratic governor—a physician who has repeatedly urged Virginians to wear face coverings in public—said he was “outside yesterday and not expecting to be within six feet of anyone. This is an important reminder to always have face coverings in case situations change,” adding, “we are all learning how to operate in this new normal, and it’s important to be prepared.” However, the governor was pictured taking selfies with beachgoers — at far closer range than six feet: A day after teasing that he’s making masks mandatory, Northam is out taking selfies? I didn’t believe the pictures were real, but they are…https://t.co/UFXyU8daaf pic.twitter.com/wXHyLZXBHG — Brent Scher (@BrentScher) May 24, 2020  The spokseperson also said that Northam simply wanted to make sure his social distancing rules were being enforced.

Pritzker noted that construction is an essential industry, though he did not explain why the workers’ cross-border travel was essential. Pritzker’s wife has also traveled to the family horse farm in Florida; when caught, Pritzker demanded reporters respect his family’s privacy. Earlier this month, photographs emerged of first-term Rep. Harley Rouda (D-CA) on a private beach in Orange County, California, after he said that it was “reckless” for local authorities to allow ordinary people to go to public beaches. Joel B.

An Ohio judge deemed the state’s lockdown in response to the Chinese coronavirus illegal, and stated that the state’s top health director “acted in an impermissibly arbitrary, unreasonable, and oppressive manner.” Lake County Common Pleas Judge Eugene Lucci ruled that Amy Acton, the director of the Ohio Department of Health, is prohibited from punishing nonessential businesses that defy Ohio’s orders to stay closed in response to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, Cleveland 19 News reported. The report added that the Lake County General Health District, police officers, prosecutors, and the Ohio Attorney General are also prohibited from punishing so-called “nonessential” businesses, as the companies already operate in compliance with standard safety regulations. Moreover, Lucci declared that Acton “has acted in an impermissibly arbitrary, unreasonable, and oppressive manner,” reported the Columbus Dispatch. Lucci’s ruling was in response to a May 8 lawsuit filed by 1851 Center for Constitution law on behalf of Rock House Fitness Inc, and 34 other gyms, which have been deemed nonessential businesses and thus told to stay closed under Ohio’s statewide “Stay Safe Ohio” order. “Constitutions are written to prevent governments from arbitrarily interfering in citizens’ lives and businesses,” said 1851 Center Executive Director Maurice Thompson, according to Cleveland 19 News. “On that front, the call to action is clear,” he added. “The Governor and health director may no longer impose their own closures and regulations and write their own criminal penalties to enforce those regulations and closures.” In issuing her orders, Acton relied on a statute that grants her department “ultimate authority in matters of quarantine and isolation.” Lucci, however, says that Ohio law only permits Acton to “isolate” the sick and “quarantine” those who have been exposed to an illness during the period of incubation for the disease, and that in the case of the Wuhan coronavirus, the incubation period is 14 days. Therefore, Judge Lucci has concluded that Acton’s powers are to stop after 14 days. “The director has quarantined the entire people of the state of Ohio, for much more than 14 days,” wrote Lucci. “The director has no statutory authority to close all businesses — which she deems non-essential for a period of two months.” You can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo, and on Instagram.

Sunday on MSNBC, former Housing Secretary Julian Castro called President Donald Trump’s coronavirus response “one of the worst failures in the history of our country.” When asked about the Trump administration pointing to China initially covering up the severity of the coronavirus, Castro said, “The Trump administration and this president is looking for any way that they can distract Americans from the fact that at the very moment when we needed strong leadership, when we needed a president and administration that was prepared to keep Americans safe, Trump and his administration failed, and they failed spectacularly.” He added, “To look at The New York Times cover today, to think that we’re closing in on 100,000 deaths in this country, so many of those deaths that did not have to happen that happened because this administration was unprepared. And so they could try and blame other countries, they could, you know, talk about anything they want, what they can’t do is avoid the fact that they were unprepared and because of that so many Americans have died.

NORCROSS, Georgia — Vice President Mike Pence told Breitbart News exclusively that China “let the world down” on the coronavirus pandemic, and that the Trump administration is developing plans to hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable for its actions. In an interview that aired on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel on this weekend, conducted here on Friday at Waffle House corporate headquarters outside Atlanta, Pence said that China and the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) hurt the world’s ability to prepare and respond to the pandemic by misleading and withholding “vital information.” “China let the world down, and the World Health Organization was their willing partner in withholding from the United States and the wider world vital information about the coronavirus that would have made it possible for us to stand up a national response sooner,” Pence, the chairman of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said. “It’s remarkable to think that China didn’t even let American CDC personnel in on the ground until mid-February to see what was going on.” The W.H.O., in response to Pence’s comments in this Breitbart News exclusive interview, issued a lengthy statement to Newsweek. “WHO works with 194 member states to promote health, China and the U.S. among them, to keep the world safe and serve the vulnerable,” W.H.O. said in response to Pence’s Breitbart News interview. “WHO’s work with China is identical to its work with any other member state. Moreover, its work with governments across the globe is science-based, with the aim of tackling disease outbreaks. WHO coordinates the international COVID-19 response in a transparent way and publishes on its website guidance, recommendations, reports and any other information that can help countries and individuals.” The statement from W.H.O. continued: WHO will initiate an independent evaluation at the earliest appropriate moment to review experience gained and lessons learned, and to make recommendations to improve national and global pandemic preparedness and response. We call on all nations to invest in strengthening and implementing the many tools at our disposal – especially the International Health Regulations. To be successful, we must all commit to mutual ownership and accountability. WHO is committed to constantly refining its actions. WHO undertakes internal operational reviews during emergencies, to course correct during the response, and after-action reviews to capture and build on lessons learnt during emergency responses. Newsweek also noted that the Chinese embassy in Washington, DC, did not respond to Pence’s comments. “The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not return Newsweek’s requests for comment before publication,” Newsweek wrote. Pence in his exclusive interview added that President Donald Trump’s decision to ban travel from China to the United States in late January bought the U.S. time in standing up its response to the pandemic, but also that the United States is preparing actions to ensure China is “held accountable” for the coronavirus. Pence also said that the administration is going to push for major “reforms” at the W.H.O. “The fact that the president suspended all travel from China at the end of January is a real testament to this president’s judgment. But make no mistake about it, China will be held accountable for what the world has gone through because of their lack of transparency. We’re going to continue to demand that the World Health Organization enact the kind of reforms going forward that if the world needs to know about any potential health threat, that we’ll know in the future,” Pence said. Pence’s comments confirming that the United States will hold China accountable come just a week after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Breitbart News that President Trump is “committed” to holding China accountable for the pandemic. “I don’t want to get out in front of what President Trump will ultimately decide, but I think we all know in this administration that we have to make sure that something like this can never happen again,” Pompeo said last weekend on Breitbart News Saturday. “That means deterrence. That means setting up processes. The president has already stopped funding to the W.H.O. so that we can evaluate that and figure out which pieces of the W.H.O. might actually work and which pieces don’t, so that we can deliver good outcomes and keep Americans safe and make sure this doesn’t happen again. Then, there will come a time, there will come a day when we evaluate what it is that needs to be done to convince the Chinese Communist Party that there are real costs—real costs—connected to this kind of misbehavior. You know this—we say this all the time inside the United States, but around the world too, we have to hold nations accountable. I’m talking with many of my counterparts around the world. We have to hold nations accountable for the things and actions that they undertake which create risk, and in this case created enormous loss of life here in the United States. President Trump is committed to doing that. The precise mechanisms we will choose. I want to make sure he gets fully briefed to make those decisions.” It also comes as President Trump wrote in a letter to W.H.O. Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus where he maintained the U.S. will continue to entirely cut off W.H.O. funding until such time as there are systemic reforms at the organization. Trump also told Tedros in the letter that the U.S. is considering altogether withdrawing from the W.H.O. This is the letter sent to Dr. Tedros of the World Health Organization. It is self-explanatory! pic.twitter.com/pF2kzPUpDv — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 19, 2020  Meanwhile, Australia is leading a group of 122 countries in seeking an investigation into how the pandemic began. The Australian effort approved by the W.H.O. member countries last week does not mention China, but Chinese Communist Party officials have expressed opposition to it. Trump confirmed that the United States is part of that push. The Chinese Communist Party leadership in Beijing has not been happy.about western efforts to push for transparency and accountability on this matter, whether it be the United States efforts or Australia’s or others’—and has launched a series of attacks through state-controlled propaganda media to attack western leaders. Pompeo, in his exclusive interview last weekend with Breitbart News Saturday, denounced such attacks. “I think this shows that the Chinese Communist Party understands the risk that they’ve put on top of their own nation,” Pompeo said, also noting that the state media attacks from China hit him as well as U.S. lawmakers and American media outlets. “Those attacks demonstrate weakness, not resolve, by the Chinese Communist Party. You and I are both old enough to remember how Communist regimes, how autocracies behave. Once they know they have done things that are wrong, they strike out. They try to blame others. I think that’s what you’re seeing. They also try to maneuver around the world through disinformation. We have been clear—President Trump, myself, the State Department—have been clear about making sure that everyone understands the facts surrounding the Chinese Communist Party.” LISTEN TO VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE ON BREITBART NEWS SATURDAY: 

Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) said he believes states can conduct mail-in voting for the November election amid the coronavirus pandemic safely. Scott said, “Well, what I’ve always believed is, I want people to go vote, and we’ve got to do it where there’s no fraud, so 100%, zero percent fraud. We have absentee ballots in Florida. We figured out how to do it in a safe manner. Now, I think what a lot of the Democrats want to do is do only mail-in ballots, and I don’t think that’s right. I think as long as you can do it safely, and as long as you can make sure there’s no fraud, we ought to be able to do absentee ballots like we do it in Florida.” He continued, “If you follow the law, and you enforce the law, and you set up the laws the right way, you can do it.” On President Donald Trump’s objections to mail-in voting, Scott said, “Well, I think what he’s saying is that it’s only, they’re talking about only doing mail-in ballots. I believe you can do it safely and you have the laws, and everybody follows the laws, I think that’s the key,” Scott responded. “I’m fine with absentee ballots the way we do it in Florida, with early voting the way we do it in Florida, with Election Day voting, which is clearly the safest.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

ROME — The Italian government announced Sunday it is recruiting 60,000 volunteer “civic assistants” as informants to report on anyone violating norms concerning the use of masks and social distancing. The government is recruiting unemployed citizens, especially those who receive social security or unemployment income, as an extension of its uniformed security services during the second phase of the coronavirus lockdown, Italian media reported. The plainclothes informants have received instructions to watch for abuses of state-mandated safety norms and to report on violators. The new measure is meant to prevent citizens from being tempted to slack off in compliance with government norms just because no uniformed police are present, since anyone could be an informant. The deployment of the army of “civic assistants” is reminiscent of measures taken by Italian mayors, such as Rome mayor Virginia Raggi, during the first phase of the lockdown. Ms. Raggi set up a special website where Italians could snitch on their neighbors if they saw them failing to comply with the established norms. The measure met with considerable opposition, with some suggesting that the move typical of the dark days of national fascism. The new measure was announced Sunday in a joint statement signed by the Minister for Regional Affairs and Autonomies Francesco Boccia and the Mayor of Bari (Puglia), Antonio Decaro, who serves as the President of the National Association of Italian Municipalities. Mr. Decaro rose to national prominence after a video went viral showing the mayor personally harassing citizens on the streets during phase one of the lockdown. Along with threatening them with police action, the mayor is seen shouting that he is the boss and that all are required to return to their homes. Sunday’s statement noted the difficulty of controlling citizen compliance with the lockdown norms since they are no longer confined to their own homes but can no visit shops and restaurants. “We are gradually entering a new normal where there is a gradual recovery of productive activities and citizens are returning to populate cities day after day,” the statement reads. Municipalities “will be able to take advantage of the contribution of ‘civic assistants’ to enforce all the measures put in place to counter and contain the spread of the virus, beginning with social distancing.” “Now is the time to recruit all those citizens who want to help the country, demonstrating a great civic sense,” it states. The authorities said that they expect to have their new army of informants ready for deployment by the end of next week. Follow @tdwilliamsrome

New England Patriots Owner Robert Kraft’s charity auction of his 2017 Super Bowl ring brought a winning bid of more than one million dollars on Thursday. Two weeks ago, Kraft announced that he would put his Super Bowl LI ring up for auction to benefit a charity that feeds needy Americans. The ring is forever a part of NFL history and memorializes the Patriots’ 34-28 come-from-behind victory over the Atlanta Falcons at Super Bowl LI on Feb. 5, 2017. With a starting bid of $75,000, the diamond-encrusted, 5.1-carat ring finally sold for $1.025 million, with 35 bids over the 12-day auction. “What could I do that would be special? I’ve been thinking about it for weeks,” Kraft said in a video posted to ESPN’s Twitter feed on May 10. “I finally thought about our experience in Super Bowl 51 against the Atlanta Falcons. We were down 28-3 [in the third quarter] and had 99.6% [odds] to lose. And we came back, and we won. “And I thought about what is going on at this time and wanted to give something of extreme value in support of our health care workers. So, I thought it would be good to give this ring, our fifth Super Bowl win because it showed how we came back,” Kraft added. Kraft’s auction will benefit the All-In Challenge, a movement to help multiple charities that fight food insecurity during the coronavirus pandemic, including Feeding America, Meals On Wheels, World Central Kitchen, and No Kid Hungry. “More than ever before, families will struggle to provide food as tens of millions are out of work, kids are out of school, many are at risk of losing their income, and our most vulnerable are self-isolating,” the group explains on the All-In Challenge website. Thus far, the All-In Challenge has raised more than $4.5 million for coronavirus relief. Follow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston.

Sunday on  ABC’s “This Week,” White House coronavirus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx said it is difficult to tell if the country will close again in the fall because of the coronavirus pandemic. Brix said, “I want to be very clear to the American people – we are preparing for that potential fall issue.” Guest host Martha Raddatz asked, “But you don’t see the country closing down again?” Birx answered, “It’s difficult to tell. I really am data-driven, so I’m collecting data right now about whether governors and whether states and whether communities are able to open safely. What do I mean by that? We have to do much better with proactive testing. Not just count the number of tests we’ve done. That’s great, but really ensure those tests are being applied in a way that we find the asymptomatic cases. It’s much easier to find symptomatic cases because people are sick. And when people are sick, they’re often not out and about, particularly if a severe case of COVID with a fever. What I’m worried about is, what are we putting in place to find asymptomatic cases? That’s why we’ve asked for proactive, 100% testing of all residents and workers and then proactive ongoing testing of workers in nursing homes, proactive testing where people are living together in large groups, whether they’re living together to serve a meatpacking plant or agricultural workers. I really want to call them events rather than targeting individuals because individuals are unknowingly spreading the virus. Let’s talk about events. All of this proactive testing needs to be in place and needs to continue to be in place because that will determine safely remaining open in the fall.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Hungarian-American plutocrat George Soros attacked populist Italian senator Matteo Salvini, claiming the League (Lega) leader wants to get Italy out of the European Union and the euro currency. The left-liberal billionaire launched his attack on the former Italian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior because he was worried about Italy leaving the European Union as Britain has done, saying: “I am particularly worried about Italy. Matteo Salvini, leader of the League, is working to get the country out of the euro and the EU.” While claiming that Salvini has lost some support since his time as Interior Minister, Soros was wary of the fact that “support for his positions is gaining momentum. What would Europe be without Italy? Italy was the most pro-European country. The Italians had more confidence in Europe than in their own governments, for excellent reasons, but they were mistreated during the refugee emergency of 2015.” He went on to add that during the Chinese coronavirus pandemic Italy has also been badly treated, saying EU aid rules have favoured countries like Germany rather than countries like Italy which were hardest hit by the virus, Il Giornale reports. 40 Per Cent of Italians Want to Leave The Euro and the European Union https://t.co/trFhJ4yOxB — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 24, 2020  While support for Salvini’s League has diminished slightly in the last several months, polls still consistently show the party to be the most popular in the country. A Euromedia Research survey published on Friday showed the League with 24.9 per cent of the vote and the centre-right coalition Salvini is a member with 47.6 per cent, ahead of the current leftist government coalition with 41.5 per cent. Anti-EU sentiment has risen dramatically in Italy over the last several months of the Wuhan virus crisis due to the lack of solidarity between EU member-states. A survey published in late April revealed that as many as 40 per cent of Italians want to leave the EU and the euro currency.

The purpose is to raise $10 million or more for COVID-19 relief efforts, and provide entertainment with four of the biggest stars from the PGA Tour and NFL. Another appeal to the Sunday made-for-TV exhibition, “The Match: Champions for Charity,” is a chance to see Tiger Woods swing a golf club for the first time in 98 days. Live golf is on television for the second straight Sunday, this one with the game’s biggest headliner. Woods was last seen on television Feb. 16 at the Genesis Invitational, where he moved cautiously in California’s chilly late winter weather and posted weekend rounds of 76-77 to finish last among the 68 players who made the cut at Riviera. He skipped a World Golf Championship in Mexico City, and said his surgically repaired back wasn’t quite ready in sitting out the opening three weeks of the Florida swing. And then the pandemic took over, and there has been no place to play. This is a reasonable start. Woods and retired NFL quarterback Peyton Manning will face Phil Mickelson and Tom Brady, who won six Super Bowls with the New England Patriots and signed this year with Tampa Bay. The match will be at Medalist Golf Club in Hobe Sound, Florida. It is Woods’ home course and about 20 minutes from Seminole, where last week Rory McIlroy, Dustin Johnson, Rickie Fowler and Matthew Wolff ushered golf’s return to live television. What to make of Woods? His only interviews were with GolfTV, the Discovery-owned channel with whom Woods has a financial deal, and a playful Zoom call with the other match participants hosted by Ernie Johnson of Turner Sports, which is televising the match. He described his health in the April 9 interview with GolfTV as “night and day.” “I feel a lot better than I did then,” Woods said. “I’ve been able to turn a negative into a positive and been able to train a lot and get my body to where I think it should be.” Mickelson has missed the cut in four of his five tournaments this year — the exception was third place at Pebble Beach, where he started the final round one shot behind Nick Taylor and closed with a 75. Just like last week, rust is to be expected for players who haven’t competed in two months — three, in the case of Woods. Manning, meanwhile, is retired and is a golf junkie. Brady remains employed, and this week got in some informal work with his new teammates in Tampa Bay. No fans will be allowed, just like last week at Seminole. One difference is the players will be in their own carts, whereas the four PGA Tour players last week carried their bags. But this is as much about entertainment as competition. It’s the second edition of a match between Woods and Mickelson, the dominant players of their generation and rivals by name, but not necessarily by record. Woods has 82 career victories to 44 for Mickelson, leads 15-5 in major championships and 11-0 in winning PGA Tour player of the year. Mickelson won their first made-for-TV match over Thanksgiving weekend in 2018, a pay-per-view event that ran into technical problems and was free for all. Lefty won in a playoff under the lights for $9 million in a winner-take-all match. He also has a 5-3-1 advantage over Woods in the nine times they have played in the final round on the PGA Tour, most recently in the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am in 2012 when Mickelson shot 64 to a 75 for Woods. He also stopped two streaks. Woods was going for his seventh straight PGA Tour victory when Mickelson beat him at Torrey Pines in 2000. Later that year, Woods had won 19 consecutive times on the PGA Tour when he had at least a share of the 54-hole lead until Mickelson beat him at the Tour Championship. Woods, however, captured the streak that mattered, holding off Mickelson in the final group at the Masters in 2001 to hold all four professional majors at the same time. The banter was lacking in Las Vegas, and perhaps having Manning and Brady will change the dynamics. The broadcast includes Charles Barkley providing commentary and Justin Thomas, whom Woods has embraced, on the course as a reporter in his television debut. After this exhibition, golf has two weeks before the PGA Tour is set to return at Colonial in Fort Worth, Texas. Mickelson plans to play. Woods has not said when he will return.  

Universities are beginning to cut sports programs as budgets continue to be devastated by the coronavirus. However, one professor thinks that those schools are using the pandemic as an excuse to cut sports programs they wanted to get rid of anyway. B. David Ridpath, associate professor of sports business at Ohio University and interim president of the Drake Group, a national nonprofit advocacy organization, blasted the schools looking to cut sports to make up for budget holes. “There’s a lot of fat that can be cut before sports being dropped,” Ridpath said. “I think dropping sports is basically a knee-jerk reaction, and many of the schools are using the pandemic as an excuse for something they already wanted to do. There may come a time where dropping a sport is a viable solution, but it should be the last one and based on many different things. “Dropping a sport and saying you are doing it for gender equity, I think, is an excuse,” the professor exclaimed. Looking a the programs that have been cut, it does appear that men’s programs have been hardest hit. “All but three of the 15 programs that have reportedly been eliminated at Division I colleges,” the paper notes, “including Cincinnati, Old Dominion, Akron, Central Michigan, East Carolina, and Florida International are men’s sports, which are often the first to be trimmed as schools, especially those with football programs, strive to comply with Title IX, the federal law requiring gender equity for participation and scholarship opportunities.” There are reportedly 499,217 student-athletes in the U.S. system of higher education, the more programs that are cut, the more of these students who will not be paying tuition, the paper reminds readers. “Dropping these sports, you’re likely losing bodies, and that counts against your overall enrollment,” Ridpath noted. “Enrollment is going down nationwide, and (colleges cutting sports) are not really looking at the whole picture here.” The cuts seen already including four sports cut at Akron, the elimination of baseball at Bowling Green, an end to the men’s indoor and outdoor track and field programs in Central Michigan, and the suspension of men’s and women’s tennis at Green Bay, the paper said.

Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell said it was “horrifying” President Donald Trump is making wearing a mask a political issue. Host Chuck Todd said, “One of the things that I think is already a theme from just this show this morning is how, very gently, whether it’s Republican governor Mike DeWine or the national security adviser,  they want to make the point that, let’s not politicize the mask debate.” Mitchell said, “But the president has politicized the mask debate. The president is the one who is fighting his own medical guidelines from the CDC and others, sidelining the medical advisers. We haven’t seen very much of them with the one exception of Dr. Birx the other night briefly, and she was in a very ambiguous situation at that last briefing. So, the president is fighting his own government, and his rebellion tweets. I mean, he is the one who has made this red state/blue state, and it is really horrifying in a pandemic to be making it a political issue. It should be a medical issue, a health issue, not a political issue.” Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” White House senior economic adviser Kevin Hassett warmed the unemployment rate would soon be “north of 20%.” Guest host Dana Bash said, “Do you think the worst effects of the coronavirus pandemic behind us or is the worst still to come?” Hassett said, “I think we’ll still see more bad data because the data tend to be in the rearview mirror. If you look at employment or businesses or percentage of businesses that are open or even the credit card data which we get a peek at, then you can see things pretty much inflicted in early May. So my expectation is since there’s still initial claims for unemployment insurance in may, that the unemployment rate will be higher in June than in May, but then after that it should start to trend down. So I think we’re very, very close to an inflection point in terms of business activity and probably a month away in terms of employment.” Bash asked, “You think unemployment is going to be even higher?” Hassett said, “Yeah, it’s going to be quite a bit higher. And there were some technical things that kind of messed up, it could be an economics lecture if we go into them, but if they fix the things from last time, you’ll end up with a number north of 20%.” Bash asked if “it’s possible that unemployment will be in double digits in November.” Hassett replied, “Yes, I do. But I think that all the signs of economic recovery are going to be raging everywhere.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Three “youths” in the notorious radical Islamist hotbed municipality of Molenbeek in Brussels were arrested after spitting on police vehicle door handles in an effort to spread the Chinese coronavirus. The three individuals arrested were members of the so-called “White Vests”. The group wear white vests while supposedly trying to raise awareness among the youths of Molenbeek about the dangers of coronavirus, advising people to abide by social distancing rules, wash their hands, and engage in other helpful actions such as redistributing food. A police source told Flemish newspaper Het Nieuwsblad on Wednesday that the three arrested White Vests were spitting on the police vehicles hoping “that they themselves were infected with corona and that they, in turn, could make police officers sick”. The incident is not the first to discredit the work of the White Vests group, as they are also under investigation for allegedly holding a party in contravention of the Belgian coronavirus lockdown measures currently in place. Woman Claiming to Have Virus Jailed for Spitting on Police She Called 'Dirty Whites' https://t.co/1pxCfmh02x — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 30, 2020  Spitting attacks have been seen in multiple countries since the start of the coronavirus outbreak in Europe, leading to arrests and imprisonment in some cases. In France, a woman was handed a prison term of seven months after she spat at police officers while calling them “dirty whites” and saying: “I hope you will all die of Covid.” She also remarked “I have the coronavirus, you’re all going to die” as she was being detained. A month later in the city of Montauban, a 39-year-old homeless migration-background man was sentenced to two years in prison after robbing other homeless people at knifepoint and later spitting on police while telling them he had tested positive for coronavirus. Police in Vienna, Austria, were also attacked last month, with three spitting attacks taking place in a single day in the city. One of the attackers was later confirmed to be infected with coronavirus.

The Chinese coronavirus has killed more than 342,000 people around the globe, decimated economies and laid waste to the hopes and dream of millions of people, yet the bungled response of World Health Organization (W.H.O.) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to the crisis was warmly applauded Sunday by China’s Communist government. Beijing’s top diplomat Wang Yi said the Ethiopian bureaucrat has done a good job and countries “with decency” will support him and the W.H.O. in its future work. Speaking at a press conference on the sidelines of the Chinese Communist Party’s annual People’s Congress in Beijing, Wang claimed the W.H.O. was beyond reproach, although he declined the opportunity to offer a single fact to back his claim. “We hope all countries will realize that humanity is a community with a shared future. We must render each other more support and cooperation, and there should be less accusation and confrontation. We call on all nations to come together and build a better world for all,” he said. “As for W.H.O.’s international standing and its place in history, I’m sure clear-eyed people the world over will reach a fair conclusion, one that will not be altered just because some country doesn’t like it,” Wang added. Those who throw mud at the W.H.O. will only leave a stain on themselves, said Wang, in defiance of a host of countries who see nothing but hopeless mismanagement almost from the first day the virus was isolated. U.S. health secretary Alex Azar has already blamed the W.H.O. for not obtaining or providing the information needed to stem the pandemic. “We must be frank about one of the primary reasons this outbreak spun out of control: there was a failure by this organisation to obtain the information that the world needed, and that failure cost many lives,” he said earlier this month. The evidence backs that assertion. As far back as January 14, two months after health officials are believed to have detected the first case of the virus in China on November 17 of last year, the W.H.O. was promoting a Chinese claim via Twitter that there was “no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.” Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in #Wuhan, #China🇳. pic.twitter.com/Fnl5P877VG — World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) January 14, 2020  Meanwhile, the disease was spiraling out of control. The W.H.O. tweet came a day before the first case to reach the United States reportedly flew from Wuhan to the state of Washington. At the same time, the W.H.O. explicitly warned against travel restrictions for those coming from Wuhan or elsewhere in China, despite the fact that these restrictions could could have saved the lives of tens of thousands of people who have since succumbed to the deadly virus. Tedros’ visit to Beijing was, in part, a vote of confidence in favor of keeping global travel ties to China. “The W.H.O. noted that some countries are planning to evacuate their citizens from China, saying there is no need to overact and the W.H.O. is fully confident that the Chinese government can bring the spread of the disease under control,” Chinese state media reported while Tedros was in Beijing on January 28. In the months since, the W.H.O. has delivered other mixed messages about the Chinese coronavirus and even had its U.S. finances cut off, such is the level of frustration with its inability to carry out the most simple of tasks in warning the world of an approaching pandemic. It has done nothing to dismiss allegations it speaks solely for the Chinese Communist Party, a point noted in Washington: For his part, Tedros said on Friday his organization “worked day and night to coordinate the global response” to the coronavirus , “providing technical advice, catalysing political solidarity, mobilising resources, coordinating resources and much more.” “So far almost $800 million has been pledged or received towards W.H.O.’s appeal for COVID-19 programs, leaving a gap of just over $900 million,” Tedros told the 34 members of the W.H.O. Executive Board in a three-hour teleconference, stressing the need – again – for more funding.

ROME — The long-term cost of Italy’s nationwide coronavirus lockdown is slowly emerging as media report that nearly a third of the country’s businesses will not reopen and millions remain without work or income. The Italian newspaper Il Giornale reported Sunday that one in three stores in Rome and Milan will not reopen their doors and many are not applying for state-guaranteed loans. Moreover, a significant percentage of those who have accepted loans are not expected to be able to repay them. A study carried out by Confesercenti also found that after Italy’s unprecedented 67-day lockdown, a mere 26 per cent of Italians have resumed shopping for “non-essential” items. Of the establishments that have reopened, 68 per cent acknowledge to be working so far at a loss, and more than a third (37 per cent) report more that sales are only half of their normal level, with only 17 per cent saying they have maintained revenue levels equal to the pre-virus period. Italy: Illegal Migrant Labourers Threaten General Strike If Not Given Amnesty https://t.co/n82NM6wnqy — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 14, 2020  Italy’s fashion industry has been particularly hard hit, and those who reopened faced stockpiled inventories of Fall-Winter collections, according to Francesca Venturi, founder at Rome-based luxury fashion consultancy Elevate. Reduced demand for products “Made in Italy” has negatively impacted a long list of fashion and luxury brands including Prada, Dolce & Gabbana, Versace, and Armani, Venturi said. And while established luxury brands certainly suffered during the pandemic, the smaller, family-run fashion enterprises have borne the brunt of the damage, she said. Venturi added that the majority of retailers are not immediately rehiring furloughed employees but are waiting to see whether demand takes off again before committing to paying wages. The tourist industry, on the other hand, which accounts for some 13 per cent of the country’s GDP, has lost all revenue over the past three months and will only recover slowly. Italy will reopen to international travel on June 3rd, but for many, strict regulations on hotels and restaurants will keep numbers below the required profit margin to stay open. Italy’s service sector risks losing some 4 billion euros of added value in 2020 with the disappearance of about 30 thousand companies and almost 90 thousand jobs, according to a study carried out by Asseprim Confcommercio, a federation of professional services, in collaboration with Format Research.

Saturday on Fox News Channel’s “Justice,” host Jeanine Pirro took aim at what she deemed “authoritarian governors” and other elected officials who are insisting a prolonged shutdown as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Pirro recognized the Memorial Day holiday, calling it the quintessential American holiday, but noted the actions of some elected officials contradicted American ideals. “[A]uthoritarian governors and local officials looking to flex their pathetic muscles to keep us on lockdown are another story,” she said. “New York City and L.A. Are still on lockdown. Democratic Mayor Garcetti says la will not fully open until there is a vaccine. And schools probably will not re-open until kids can get tested weekly. Democrat Gov. Gavin Newsom in line with him. Democrat Gov. Andrew Cuomo never figured out seniors needed to be isolated and protected.” “And he did nothing when complaints were made, and people begged that COVID-infected patients not be put into nursing homes and long-term care facilities where 5,800 seniors died,” she continued. “Curious, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in Florida, with 2 million more people than New York, criticized by the left mercilessly for not doing enough early on, only lost 1,000 seniors, although one is too many. But he knew to protect and isolate the seniors.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor

The New York Times has devoted the entire front page of its Sunday edition to a list of names of those who have died from the coronavirus. The front page of The New York Times for May 24, 2020 pic.twitter.com/d14JhFp4CP — The New York Times (@nytimes) May 24, 2020  The Times deleted an earlier tweet of the image of its front page because of an error, as it explained: Correction: Earlier editions of Sunday’s front page included at least one name in error. Our original tweet containing an image of that front page has been deleted and replaced with an image of the late edition. — The New York Times (@nytimes) May 24, 2020  Though the Times used the number “100,000,” the actual death count on the newspaper’s own running count is just above 97,000 as of early Sunday morning. President Donald Trump ordered flags lowered to half-staff over Memorial Day weekend to commemorate the victims of the coronavirus. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) had asked him to lower the flags on the date the U.S. hit 100,000 deaths, but Trump chose to use Memorial Day as the focus instead. The impact of the pandemic shocked leaders around the world and took many scientists and observers by surprise — including the Times itself, which reported Jan. 8: “The new coronavirus doesn’t appear to be readily spread by humans.” Joel B.

During Friday’s Democratic Weekly Address, Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) stated that passing another coronavirus relief package is urgent, and that Congress can help to honor the sacrifices of America’s fallen veterans by ensuring that veterans, and all other Americans, can stay safe. Duckworth also touted legislation she introduced to cut healthcare costs for veterans. Transcript as Follows: “Hi, I’m Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois. Before serving in Congress, I spent 23 years in the military, serving with some of the bravest men and women our nation has to offer. Men and women who placed the values of our country, the liberty and ideas on which we stand, before their very own well-being. Who understood that we are all stronger when we work together to achieve a common good—and when we refuse to leave anyone behind. I’m going to spend this Memorial Day thinking of all those warriors who sacrificed everything for the nation they loved. I’m going to be thinking about my friends who never made it home from war. I’m going to be thinking about the stories they told about their families and the hopes they shared about their futures. We can never begin to repay the debt we owe them and their loved ones. But it’s on us to try. That doesn’t mean just spending 24 hours once every May reflecting on their memories. It means spending every day trying to lead the lives that actually honor sacrifices that they made in the way that they deserve. Right now, those of us in Congress can begin to do that by ensuring that our Veterans, along with all other Americans, have what they need to stay as safe as possible during this global pandemic. Because even while Mitch McConnell is trying to slow-walk the next relief package, claiming that he hasn’t yet, quote, ‘felt the urgency of acting immediately,’ the reality is that the folks I’m hearing from aren’t having any trouble feeling that urgency. And I don’t know McConnell’s definition, but when more than 90,000 Americans, including more than 1,000 Veterans, have died in just three months, that certainly qualifies as urgent in my book. The fact that countless Veterans are more vulnerable to COVID-19 because of their service, because they were exposed to Agent Orange when serving in Vietnam or exposed to burn pits in Iraq or suffering from Gulf War Syndrome, boy that sure seems urgent to me. That’s why I just introduced a bill to slash Veterans’ healthcare costs and ensure they don’t have to pay more for vaccines or COVID-19 preventive services than any other insured American. That’s why we Democrats have been fighting to expand testing and contact tracing, to get hospitals the resources that they need, to boost grant funding for small businesses, including those that are owned by Veterans, and to funnel more support into hunger prevention programs like SNAP, which more than a million Veterans rely on to survive. And it’s why we’re working so hard to ensure that every eligible American can register to vote safely, securely, accessibly, and as conveniently as possible. After all, it’s unthinkable that Republicans like McConnell and Trump might refuse to do so—forcing our Veterans to choose between protecting their health and exercising a Constitutional right their brothers and sisters in arms gave up their lives defending. Towards the end of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln said that we must always strive to ‘care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow, and his orphan…’ This Memorial Day weekend, as our nation faces a very different crisis, let’s recommit to heeding President Lincoln’s words, for there is no better way to honor the sacrifices of our fallen heroes than by acting in service of others. Thank you. God bless all of our troops in harm’s way right now. God bless all of our Veterans. God bless each and every one of you and of course, as always, God bless the United States of America. Be well.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

Harvard psychology professor Steven Pinker said Thursday that the push for reopening society from lockdowns comes from Christianity’s “malignant delusion” of belief in an afterlife. Atheists who believe in this life alone are more concerned with health and safety, Professor Pinker suggested in a Tweet, while Christians tend to devalue “actual lives” and live a riskier existence. Belief in an afterlife is a malignant delusion, since it devalues actual lives and discourages action that would make them longer, safer, and happier. Exhibit A: What’s really behind Republicans wanting a swift reopening? Evangelicals. https://t.co/ppo2bwiVGn — Steven Pinker (@sapinker) May 21, 2020  Pinker was responding to an article this week in the Washington Post, which examined findings that Democrats take the virus “more seriously” than Republicans and are more willing to support restrictive government edicts in response to the pandemic. In that article, contributing columnist Gary Abernathy declares that a “literal belief in eternal salvation — eternal life — helps explain the different reactions to life-threatening events like a coronavirus outbreak.” He states: Evangelicals take it to heart when James reminds them, ‘What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes,’ or when Paul writes, ‘I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us,’ or when Jesus asks, rhetorically, ‘Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life?’ It should be no surprise that a person’s deepest beliefs about the world influence how they measure the risks they’re willing to take. So, when ruminating over why there are millions of people who don’t seem to panic over a global pandemic or other life-threatening event, critics should remember that, right or wrong, it often involves a belief in something even bigger than people named Trump, Hannity or Limbaugh. Historically, Christian belief in eternal life has rarely resulted in disengagement from the common task of bettering the world and looking out for the needs of others. Nor is belief in the afterlife the exclusive domain of evangelicals, but forms part of the common creed of all orthodox Christians. To take just one example, the Catholic Church asserts explicitly that belief in eternity should spur Christians on to work for the good of human society in this life. “While rejecting atheism, root and branch, the Church sincerely professes that all men, believers and unbelievers alike, ought to work for the rightful betterment of this world in which all alike live,” states the pastoral constitution Gaudium et Spes from the Second Vatican Council. The text states: Therefore, while we are warned that it profits a man nothing if he gain the whole world and lose himself, the expectation of a new earth must not weaken but rather stimulate our concern for cultivating this one. For here grows the body of a new human family, a body which even now is able to give some kind of foreshadowing of the new age. Study after study has found that such “theory” is borne out in practice as well, with religious people proving far more generous with their time and money than atheists. In one of the largest studies of its kind, the massive Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey in 2000 found that religious people are 25 percentage points more likely than secularists to donate money and 23 points more likely to volunteer their time.

Georgia is moving faster than California in its effort to re-start Hollywood production, with Gov. Brian Kemp (R) issuing COVID-19 guidelines on Friday to help ensure that cast and crew members remain safe when they eventually return to work. While studios will ultimately decide when they will resume shooting on movies and TV shows, individual states serve as a key component by providing health guidelines that serve as a common benchmark for all studios and production companies. Georgia is the first state to issue COVID-19 recommendations covering nearly every aspect of production, including casting, shooting, and even the food catering process. California is expected to release a similar document on Monday. Best practices for film & TV in Georgia are available as planning continues & additional industry protocol is issued. The same elements that have made Georgia attractive to film remain in place. We look forward to a safe return when productions are ready! https://t.co/8gIHjtu3zo pic.twitter.com/6opGaC1xxv — Georgia, USA (@gdecd) May 22, 2020  Gov. Kemp praised Georgia’s production industry for weathering the coronavirus crisis. “We are so grateful to the hardworking people who make up and contribute to Georgia’s incredibly successful film and TV industry, and we thank them for all the ways they have given back throughout the state’s response to COVID-19,” he said in a statement on Friday. “The Georgia Film Office has maintained their close work with industry executives to develop these outlines for how productions can help protect cast and crew members. ” The major Hollywood studios, as well as Netflix and Amazon, have yet to indicate when they will resume domestic production. The studios are currently working with the Hollywood trade unions to develop a white paper that will provide industry-wide standards to keep people safe while working on sets. Norman Reedus, Melissa McBride, Khary Payton, Lauren Cohan, Danai Gurira, Sydney ParkPhoto by Jackson Lee Davis/AMC Filmmaker and producer Tyler Perry has already leap-frogged ahead of others by announcing that he will resume production on a limited basis at his Atlanta studio on July 7. His studio will start shooting two BET series — The Oval and Sistas — over a two week period. Natalia Dyer, Caleb McLaughlin, Sadie Sink, Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, Charlie Heaton, and Noah Schnapp in Stranger Things (Netflix, 2016) This week, Perry put out his own comprehensive safety plan outlining the testing and quarantine procedures all personnel will have to follow. Georgia is one of Hollywood’s favorite filming locations thanks to generous financial incentives that include a 20 percent tax credit for certain productions. When shooting came to a halt in late March, the state had five feature films and 29 series in production, with many more in pre-production. For the most recent fiscal year, the state saw 391 film and television shoots, with $9.2 billion in total wages. The popular Netflix series Stranger Things and Ozark shoot in Georgia. Disney has filmed many of its Marvel movies at the Pinewood Atlanta Studios, including Black Panther and The Guardians of the Galaxy movies. Georgia’s new set of best practices recommends masks to be worn at all times, except when actors are in front of cameras. It also calls for social distancing, COVID-19 testing, and limiting personnel on set.
The state’s film office is asking studios to use the Georgia recommendations together with the industry-wide labor standards when they are eventually released. Follow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg. Have a tip? Contact me at dng@breitbart.com

Several casinos in the greater Los Angeles area have reopened for Memorial Day weekend after nearly two months of being shut down due to the deadly coronavirus. On Friday, Morongo Casino in Cabazon, located near Palm Springs in Riverside County, reopened at 2:00 p.m. Additional casinos Tortoise Rock, Agua Calient, and others located in Coachella Valley opened earlier on Friday.

In addition to their reopening efforts, representatives for the casinos have stated that certain safety precautions and measures have been implemented. A few of those measures include limiting the number of customers inside at one time, temperature checks at entranceways, and a modified cleaning schedule. Those using table games and slot machines will also be spread out so that social distancing guidelines are met. Certain slot machines will also feature modified barriers. Certain casinos that have chosen to reopen have prohibited smoking and require all customers and employees to wear face masks. Some restaurants within the casinos will also reopen, including Tortoise Rock and nearby Spotlight 29 casino.

Gavin Newsom warned casinos against reopening their doors. Tribal land, which is federally protected, is not required to adhere to local guidelines. Last week, Newsom sent a letter to tribal leaders urging them to follow the state’s plan to reopen. It said: I cannot stress enough that the risk of COVID-19 transmission remains a serious threat for all Californians. In the spirit of sovereign-to-sovereign engagement I respectfully request that until a surrounding or neighboring local jurisdiction has legally progressed into Stage 3, your tribal casinos remain closed. Other counties, including Ventura, Santa Barbara, and San Diego, have also begun efforts to reopen amid California’s strict stay-at-home mandates. Riverside County officials have stated that they will no longer enforce stay-at-home orders.

The founder and CEO of Ad Astra, a company using data mining technology to help colleges and universities improve their quality for students, suggested that colleges redesign schedules so that more students are able to enroll in the courses they need to graduate and get a job. In a recent piece published in Inside Higher Ed, founder and CEO of Ad Astra Tom Shaver recommends that institutions of higher learning make it easier for students to “get the courses they need to continue to move toward graduation and ultimately employment,” as many students face unprecedented problems in the wake of the Chinese virus pandemic. “With incoming students, it’s unclear whether the crisis will scare them off or if enrollment will grow in the fall, as it typically does during a recession when millions of jobless Americans suddenly find themselves searching for new skills,” writes Shaver, adding that schedule building and registration “must be rethought in this environment.” The CEO goes on to suggest that this is especially important because if life were to quickly change for students — and they suddenly find themselves homeschooling children or stocking shelves at a grocery store during a pandemic — they should be able to “move more quickly” through their degree program “and into a new job.” “Institutions should focus on providing access to courses based on need, not credits,” writes Shaver. “This can help reduce the impact of bottleneck courses — which can be a massive barrier to degree completion.” According to the California State University system, “bottleneck” courses are defined as “anything that limits students’ ability to make progress toward graduation,” which might be considered core curriculum — classes that students typically take in their first year of college, which are considered basic — or more advanced courses. Shaver also describes bottleneck courses as necessary classes that are harder for students to get into because there is a high demand and limited capacity. “Our research shows that nearly a quarter of all courses are overloaded, signaling they may be bottlenecked,” writes Shaver. “And those percentages may grow as COVID-19’s disruption pushes students toward certain courses at the same time that budget cuts force colleges to cut sections.” “With better data, institutions could redesign their operations to focus more on helping students whose lives have been disrupted or were already complicated prior to this crisis,” he adds. “They can do so, in part, by ensuring that early access to classes is given to students based on need, not arbitrary credit or year thresholds.” Shaver argues that if this does not become a priority, students raising children or who otherwise live “complex” lives, then “being shut out of a required course can mean an additional semester or year in college.” “It can mean more debt,” adds Shaver. “It can mean they never graduate.” You can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo, and on Instagram.

A Brooklyn field hospital closed without seeing any patients, city officials confirmed this week. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) announced the construction of the multimillion-dollar field hospital at the end of March — the day after the USNS Comfort docked at Manhattan’s Pier 90. “They are going to set it up rapidly and we’re then going to go to the next site, the next site, the next site to meet our goal,” de Blasio said, detailing the 670-bed plus site at the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal in Red Hook. He also announced another overflow facility at the Billie Jean King Tennis Center in Flushing. That 350-bed facility only saw 79 patients, according to THE CITY. However, the Red Hook facility never saw a single patient, and both locations ended up costing over $40 million combined. THE CITY reported: Earlier this month, the makeshift hospital at the tennis center closed after taking in 79 patients, according to City Hall officials. It cost $19.8 million to construct and revert back, the officials said. The lower-profile Red Hook terminal hospital was slated to open in mid-April but wasn’t ready for service until May 4. By then, citywide hospital utilization had already fallen by half its April 12 highpoint, to about 6,000 patients. City officials say the $20.8 million site, constructed by Texas-based contractor SLSCO under a no-bid emergency contract, is now being demobilized after seeing no medical activity. Similarly, the USNS Comfort, which was originally slated to take pressure off New York hospitals by taking non-coronavirus patients, departed after seeing just 182 patients over its month-long stay. Even though ship agreed to designate 500 of its 1,000 beds for coronavirus patients, it never came close to reaching capacity. The 1,000 bed USNS Mercy, which docked at Los Angeles Harbor March 27, departed May 15 after treating just 77 patients. It came prepared with 800 crew members “12 fully-equipped operating rooms, laboratories, a pharmacy, [and] radiological equipment … becoming the largest hospital in the city,” KTLA reported. Similar occurrences have been reported in other areas of the country, as many of the doomsday scenarios touted by experts never came to fruition. As Breitbart News reported: Other areas of the country are telling similar stories — preparing for a surge that never came. A 250-bed field hospital set up by the Army in Seattle’s CenturyLink Field Event Center, for example, shut down in April after just three days. It never saw a single patient. Gov. Jay Inslee (D) said they requested the hospital “before our physical distancing strategies were fully implemented and we had considerable concerns that our hospitals would be overloaded with Covid-19 cases.” The McCormick Place field hospital in Chicago, Illinois, is also gradually reducing its presence, taking down half of its 1,000 hospital beds as medical centers in the region did not reach capacity. “As part of our hospital surge, we expanded capacity at a breakneck speed, ensuring our hospital infrastructure would be prepared to handle the very worst. We did so only with a single-minded focus: saving lives,”  City Hall spokesperson Avery Cohen said, according to THE CITY. “Over the past few months, social distancing, face coverings, and other precautionary measures have flattened the curve drastically, and we remain squarely focused on taking that progress even further,” Cohen added. The news comes as the country slowly begins to reopen, state by state, following the peak of the Chinese coronavirus. It virtually halted the U.S. economy, resulting in 38.6 million of Americans reporting jobless claims in the last nine weeks.

The Department of the Interior announced earlier this month that it will begin to restore access to national parks to the American people. Many of the 419 parks managed by the National Park Service have remained open in some capacity since the virus hit the United States in March. The DOI website listed some of those parks and the Trump administration’s effort to reopen them: The health and safety of visitors, volunteers, partners, and federal employees continues to be paramount as the Department restores public access to public lands again.  President Trump recognizes the magnificence and grandeur of our National Park System and public lands and the incredible benefits of the great outdoors. Access to public lands continues to be evaluated in accordance with federal, state, and local public health guidance with some notable locations beginning to welcome visitors back this week: ABC reported on the parks on the first unofficial summer holiday weekend: Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, whose department oversees the park service, said he’s confident Americans will be safe in national parks this summer. “We feel that we can play an important role in the moving forward picture. And I think a lot of people will be out utilizing us this summer,” Bernhardt said in an interview with ABC’s Aaron Katersky. Bernhardt said he’s encouraged by events like the Thunderbirds and Blue Angels flyover in Washington, D.C., earlier this month, when he said visitors to the National Mall naturally spaced themselves out to respect social distancing in what he called “social clumping.” “I’m frankly encouraged by this,” Bernhardt said. “And what I saw was what I’m gonna call clumping. And that’s not a scientific term.” He continued: It’s my belief that groups of people have decided that that – they’re colleagues and maybe they’re a family member, maybe it’s a cohort of workers – but whatever it is, they’ve decided in some way that they are comfortable with social distancing with them in a very narrow space, so maybe like three feet. But what you saw is clumps, so like family units or groups that were together, and then space and then individual and space and another clump and space. National Park Service spokesperson Alexandra Picavet said in the ABC report that visitors should have any supplies they need and recognize that trash cans and restrooms may be less accessible. “Every Memorial Day weekend is a busy Memorial Day weekend in a national park,” Picavet said. “What we want to do is try and help people find their way of honoring people who have lost their lives in service to our nation which is what memorial day is about.” “That’s why we have really worked hard to try and find a way to help people continue to have that connection with our American history and what Memorial Day is about,” Picavet said. “Several national park locations are hosting live stream events, including demonstrations, tributes, and virtual campouts, to commemorate the weekend,” ABC reported. “The National Park Service has created a website to search virtual events at different parks.” Follow Penny Starr on Twitter

Democrat New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said New York’s one-day coronavirus death toll has fallen below 100 for the first time in weeks. Eighty-four people died in New York from the coronavirus on Friday, down from 109 the previous day, CBS News reported. “Eighty-four is still a tragedy, no doubt,” he said. “But the fact that it’s down as low as it is is really, overall, good news”: We lost 84 New Yorkers to COVID-19 yesterday. By any normal standard this is a hideous number. But we are thankful this number has fallen below 100 for the first time since late March. — Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) May 23, 2020  At its peak, the single-day death toll for coronavirus in New York hit close to 800 in one day. New York City, the center of the state’s outbreak, hit its peak number of fatalities on April 7, when 590 people died in one day. Deaths and hospitalizations in the city have also fallen in line with recent trends, with the city reporting 15 deaths from the coronavirus on Thursday — the most recently available data from the city’s health department. Cuomo said Saturday that New York’s Long Island and Mid-Hudson regions, which border New York City, could reopen as soon as next week if deaths continue to decline and residents continue to practice social distancing. According to data from Johns Hopkins University, 28,853 people have died of the coronavirus in New York state since the pandemic began and has had more deaths than every state in the country. However, more than 63,000 New Yorkers have survived and recovered after contracting the virus.

A leading conservative national public interest law firm has defended President Trump’s call for the reopening of churches, insisting they provide “essential” services. “We appreciate and fully endorse the President’s call to reopen the churches,” said attorney Stephen Crampton, special counsel at the Thomas More Society. “Churches are essential organizations; they provide essential services that are desperately needed during these desperate times.” “As President Trump said, ‘We need more prayer in America, not less,’” Crampton noted in a statement sent to Breitbart News Saturday. “The discriminatory labeling of churches as nonessential by many governors across the nation has infringed our rights and injured our recovery from this terrible pandemic.” “It is high time to reopen the churches,” he said. The Chicago-based Thomas More Society provides pro bono legal services in defense of life, family, and religious liberty, and is currently involved in fighting for the rights of churches in various states, including Illinois, California, Mississippi, New Jersey, among others. In one such case, the South Bay United Pentecostal Church in Chula Vista is heading to the Ninth Circuit Federal Court of Appeals after filing a lawsuit claiming that the state’s governor issued unconstitutional orders during the coronavirus pandemic in violation of religious rights. The Thomas More Society filed an Urgent Motion for an Injunction Pending Appeal on May 16, 2020, with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which the court has set on the fast track for a quick decision. In a separate federal lawsuit in the Southern District of California, the Thomas More Society noted that California is one of only eight states “whose response to the COVID-19 pandemic has included no accommodation for — hardly even a mention of — the religious rights of its citizens.” “After weeks of government suppression of their religious freedoms, our clients have said enough is enough,” said Charles LiMandri, special counsel for the Thomas More Society. “The First Amendment still protects their right to freely exercise their faith, even during a pandemic.” Follow @tdwilliamsrome

NORCROSS, Georgia — Vice President Mike Pence told Breitbart News he believes any fourth phase coronavirus relief package from Congress must focus on directly supporting American families and workers. Pence, who sat for an exclusive with Breitbart News at Waffle House corporate headquarters after a roundtable with business leaders and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp about reopening America as the pandemic recedes, met this week with House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to discuss a pathway forward. In the Friday interview that aired on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel on Saturday, Pence said such discussions are “very preliminary” at this stage. “I would characterize the discussions as very preliminary because we’re still moving a lot of the resources that Congress has already approved out and literally hundreds of millions of dollars—billions of dollars—of support directly to families, directly to small businesses, resources to states not only to support state services, but first responders, as well as unemployment benefits and a whole range of resources we’ve made available to hospitals and healthcare facilities,” Pence said. “But I think as we go forward, the focus is going to be on the American people, on American families. President Trump said it plainly: we’re going to do whatever it takes to get the American people through this. That’s the reason why the core of the CARES Act was direct payments to Americans, to every American family. The average family of four would receive $3,400 in a direct payment from the federal government, supporting people who were at risk of losing their job, or had lost their job, through Paycheck Protection and, of course, the unemployment benefits. But we really do believe that whatever else might be necessary to get the American people and families and small businesses through his time, we’ve got to have provisions that will promote economic growth and accelerate this recovery in the second half of this year and in 2021.” The House Democrats, under the leadership of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, passed a $3 trillion spending bill last week meant to be an opening bid from Democrats. But that bill is dead-on-arrival in the Senate because it did not address coronavirus relief and, instead, was packed to the brim with Democrat political wish list priorities. Republicans have just begun discussions about a phase four deal, one that would actually address the pandemic, unlike the Democrats’ political bill. It is unclear if there will actually be a phase four deal, but if there is one, Pence said the White House and Republicans have certain priorities they think would truly help the country turn a corner past coronavirus. Pence specifically said a payroll tax cut is a must in whatever deal may be in the works, as it would increase workers’ take-home pay by more than seven percent immediately. He also said the Trump administration is looking at other possible tax cuts and deductions, such as a capital gains tax cut and certain deductions to incentivize economic activity in certain arenas — restaurants and entertainment, for example. “The president believes that a payroll tax cut, which would increase the take-home pay of working Americans by 7.6 percent immediately and puts money in the pocket of working Americans, would have an enormously beneficial effect on generating economic growth,” Pence said. “It would help Americans have more money in their pocket, it would create more demand in the market, and combining that with continuing the payroll tax relief for businesses, we believe, is a prescription for going forward. We’re also looking at a capital gains tax reduction, we’re looking at restoring a business deduction for dining out or restaurants and entertainment; we think that would also stimulate people being back out. It’s amazing to think that one out of four of the jobs lost during the coronavirus lockdowns in states across the country were in the restaurant industry. The president, having spent a lot of time in the hotel industry and resorts, really believes that one of the ways we could encourage people to go back—encourage working people to go back into restaurants and getting people to take advantage of entertainment options—is restoring the deductions.”
McConnell, the Senate leader, has made clear that any future package must have liability protection for businesses as they reopen to prevent frivolous lawsuits from trial lawyers trying to make a buck off the pandemic. As Breitbart News reported this week, trial lawyers are chomping at the bit to unleash a wave of lawsuits on the country—and Pence told Breitbart News that such “liability protection” from those trial lawyers is also important for the reopening of the country. Pence said the government will aim to provide a “legal shield” to prevent frivolous lawsuits that could stall reopening measures. “So we’re looking at all those things—and liability protection. What we want to do is make it possible if businesses or professional sports reopen and begin to operate consistent with CDC guidelines that they can do that with confidence and that they will have liability protection,” Pence said. “What we don’t want, in the midst of a recovering economy, we don’t want it to be saddled down with thousands of frivolous lawsuits filed all over the country. We want to give people a safe harbor where they do like businesses here in Georgia are doing and that is implement the CDC guidance for safe and healthy practices in operating their restaurants or operating their sporting events, that they can do so with confidence, and they can have that legal shield and umbrella while we bring this country all the way back.” LISTEN TO VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE ON BREITBART NEWS SATURDAY: 

Brazil’s federal government tried to alter the label on chloroquine packaging to include a recommendation for its use to treat the Wuhan coronavirus, the country’s former health minister said in an interview with Brazil’s Globo news network, published on Thursday. The revelation comes as Brazil’s Health Ministry approved new guidelines on Wednesday recommending the widespread use of the anti-malarial drug chloroquine and a less toxic derivative, hydroxychloroquine, to treat coronavirus cases. In a May 20 interview, Brazil’s former health minister, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, said: The president advised himself by or surrounded himself with other medical professionals. I remember when, at the end of a day of ministerial council meetings, I was asked to enter a room and there was an anesthesiologist and an immunologist, who were [in possession of] a draft of a probable or future, or something like that, a presidential decree … And the idea they had was to change the package insert for ANVISA, putting the indication for Covid-19  [Wuhan coronavirus] in the package insert. Mandetta said members of Brazil’s Attorney General’s Office (AGU), the president of Brazil’s Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA), and other government ministers were present at the meeting in which President Jair Bolsonaro proposed altering the label on chloroquine packaging for use as a coronavirus treatment, according to the report. Bolsonaro has been a proponent of the anti-malarial drug to treat coronavirus, although some health authorities say its use may cause dangerous side effects and refrain from recommending its use in coronavirus treatment. In April, Mandetta was fired from his post after clashing with the president over the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat cases of coronavirus. He was replaced by Nelson Teich, who reportedly resigned last week, also over disagreements with the president about expanding the use of chloroquine to treat coronavirus, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported. On Wednesday, Teich’s replacement, Interim Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello, signed new hydroxychloroquine guidelines recommending chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat the coronavirus, including mild cases. According to AFP, after Pazuello approved the new treatment guidelines, Bolsonaro said he planned to keep him in the health minister post for “a very long time.” On Tuesday, Bolsonaro said he keeps an emergency stash of hydroxychloroquine at home for his 93-year-old mother in case she contracts the coronavirus.

President Donald Trump went golfing on Saturday, the first time he has hit the links since the height of the coronavirus outbreak. Trump has spent the past weeks urging the country to reopen and return to normal despite fears of the virus. On Sunday, Trump called in to the NBC Sports broadcast of a golf tournament for coronavirus relief efforts and discussed the importance of sports. “We want to get sports back. We miss sports,” Trump said. “We need sports in terms of the psyche, the psyche of our country.” Trump also spoke Sunday about missing the game, as the last time he golfed was on March 8 at his course in West Palm Beach, Florida. “I do miss it. I haven’t played, really, since this problem that we have started. I haven’t been able to play golf for a while. I’ve been very busy,” Trump said. The president traveled via motorcade to the Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia, on Saturday morning. Golf courses in the Washington, DC, metro area have largely been reopened. Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House Coronavirus Task Force coordinator, said Friday that it is fine for Americans to be outdoors for the Memorial Day weekend, citing golf, tennis, and visits to the beach among approved activities.

In an act of what he calls “economic disobedience,” Erik Kiilunen is posting “All Business is Essential” billboards around Michigan to protest Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s shutdown orders. Billboards will be appearing in Grand Rapids, Detroit, and Howell, and Kiilunen said it’s only the beginning. “All business is essential, and the government, and state governors, do not have the legal authority to pick and choose who has the right to work and feed their families, and who doesn’t,” he said. Kiilunen appeared on The Kyle Olson Show and said, “What I want to do with this campaign is 1. Eliminate fear, 2. Educate the public, and 3. Restart the economy.”  He said he doesn’t fear contracting the coronavirus after looking at the data, but something he does fear is “doing this another 2-3 months, taking $5-6 billion out of the state’s economy and saying, ‘okay, now what do we do with 3-4 million unemployed people?'” Kiilunen said when the state shutdown, his manufacturing business “lost $600,000 overnight. I had a 10-man contracting company, I laid everybody off. There was just nothing to do.” He said as the lockdown dragged on, “You cannot just stop and start a business. It just doesn’t work that way.” So he decided to launch the effort posting billboards around the state with the “All Business is Essential” message. “When your government’s busy throwing rocks at each other and doing nothing productive for the country, it’s up to us to stand up and straighten it out,” he said. “Michigan’s on life support and if we don’t fix it now, we’re going to have a problem of colossal proportions coming down the pike,” he told The Kyle Olson Show. Kiilunen started a GoFundMe to help finance his efforts and has raised over $31,000 so far. “If we all just get up and go to work, there’s nothing they can do to us,” he said.

AAA Mid-Atlantic is not issuing a Memorial Day travel forecast for the first time in two decades but speculated on its website that due to the coronavirus this year’s holiday weekend could mark a record low number of Americans traveling. This comes after last year’s record-high number of more than one million Americans taking a trip on the three-day weekend. AAA Mid-Atlantic posted an article about the contrast of pre- and post-coronavirus travel plans: This Memorial Day, Americans may harken back to the “See the USA in a Chevrolet” halcyon “road trip” days of yore. For those who opt to venture out on a one-day road trip over the upcoming holiday weekend, they will experience the cheapest holiday gas prices around Memorial Day in two decades. Although “traveling in the age of COVID-19 can be tricky,” yet with gas prices this low, some Washingtonians may set out on shorter jaunts by car to vistas along the rolling northern Virginia countryside or the Shenandoah Valley, or to Civil War sites in Maryland, or to the peaks of West Virginia, or to a wide array of other venues. Locally, Washington D.C., remains under a stay at home order until Monday, June 8. In Maryland, Prince George’s County will remain under a stay at home order through June 1 and Montgomery County is under a stay at home order without a current end date. Several Northern Virginia counties also remain under a stay at home order until May 28. “Gas prices around Memorial Day have not been this cheap in nearly 20 years. However, as the country continues to practice social distancing, this year’s unofficial kick-off to summer is not going to drive the typical millions of Americans to travel,” John B. Townsend II, manager of public and government affairs for AAA Mid-Atlantic, said. “Despite inexpensive gas prices, AAA anticipates this year’s holiday will likely set a record low for travel volume.” The average price for gas nationally is $1.89, with the cheapest in the region at $1.70 in Virginia. CURRENT AND PAST GAS PRICE AVERAGES Regular Unleaded Gasoline (*indicates record high) Courtesy of AAA Mid-Atlantic The report noted that Memorial Day 2009 (toward the end of the Great Recession) currently holds the record for the lowest travel volume at nearly 31 million travelers.

The NBA is in talks with The Walt Disney Company on a single-site scenario for a resumption of play in Central Florida in late July, the clearest sign yet that the league believes the season can continue amid the coronavirus pandemic. The National Basketball Players Association is also part of the talks with Disney. Games would be held at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex, a massive campus on the Disney property near Orlando. NBA spokesman Mike Bass said the conversations were still “exploratory,” and that the site would be used not only for games but for practices and housing as well. “Our priority continues to be the health and safety of all involved, and we are working with public health experts and government officials on a comprehensive set of guidelines to ensure that appropriate medical protocols and protections are in place,” Bass said. The ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex is a 255-acre campus with multiple arenas that could host games simultaneously and has been home to, among other things, the Jr. NBA World Championship in recent years. ESPN is primarily owned by Disney, one of the NBA’s broadcast partners. Space won’t be an issue, even if Major League Soccer — which is also in talks to resume its season at Disney — is there at the same time as the NBA. The entire Disney complex is roughly 40 square miles, with nearly 24,000 hotel rooms owned or operated by Disney within the campus. The NBA suspended its season March 11, becoming the first of the U.S. major pro leagues to do so after it became known that All-Star center Rudy Gobert of the Utah Jazz tested positive for COVID-19. The list of NBA players who were known to test positive eventually grew to 10 — not all were identified — and Commissioner Adam Silver said last month that the actual total was even higher. But the league has been working on countless return-to-play scenarios for several weeks, all with the caveat that testing would be an integral part of any resumption of the season. Teams have been allowed to welcome players back to their training facilities for voluntary sessions since May 8, and more than half of the league’s franchises have taken advantage of that opportunity. The next steps would likely include a loosening of the restrictions for those voluntary workouts — no more than four players are currently allowed inside any facility at a time — and then a plan for when training camps could open. If the league plans to resume play in late July, then camps conceivably could open around the start of that month.

Several Swedish medical experts have slammed the government’s response to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, stating that the death toll is “catastrophically high” as a report reveals herd immunity is likely not on the horizon. The six academics, including Uppsala University Professor of Infectious Diseases Björn Olsen and Professor Emeritus of Clinical Virology at the Karolinska Institutet Anders Vahlne, compared Sweden to several other countries and noted that nearly all others had successfully decreased infections. “Other countries with high death rates are starting to get a curve that slopes downhill. This is as a result of the strict anti-infection measures implemented in almost all countries,” the experts said in an opinion article published in Aftonbladet on Thursday. They went on to add that while Sweden has a stable position in terms of deaths and new cases, the overall trend is bad compared to other countries which have reduced cases and deaths. “But that does not reflect that our situation from a global perspective must be considered disastrous. If the Public Health Authority does not address this fact, it is high time that the decision-makers in our country, government, and parliament do so,” they said. Results of the Swedish National Health Authority’s tests for coronavirus antibodies was also announced on Wednesday and showed that in Stockholm, the city hardest hit by the outbreak, just 7.3 per cent of candidates tested positive for antibodies with other areas of Sweden testing as low as 3.7 per cent. Danes Want to Re-open Land Borders to Everyone Except No-Lockdown Sweden https://t.co/A2nX8Gi4Xo — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 17, 2020  Anders Tegnell, Swedish state epidemiologist and head of the government’s coronavirus response, claimed the numbers were not accurate and Stockholm was probably at 20 per cent, not seven. But the numbers mean that so-called “herd immunity” will not be achieved in Sweden this month, as previously predicted by mathematics professor Tom Britton. The consequences of Sweden’s coronavirus policy is also set to impact the Swedish tourism sector and Swedish holidaymakers, as many countries around Sweden are opening their borders to each other — but not to Sweden. Mika Salminen, health safety manager at Finland’s Institute for Health and Welfare, said it was much riskier for Finland to allow Swedish tourists in as opposed to tourists from other countries that enacted lockdown measures, like Norway or Denmark. “It is a political decision, but the actual difference in the spread of infection is a fact, and I suppose the government, of course, takes that into account,” he said on Wednesday.

A physician in Sacramento, California, said this week the cancellation of regular medical care during the coronavirus pandemic could yield a “massive wave” of cancer patients in the future. In an interview with California Public Radio (CapRadio) Tuesday, Dignity Health thoracic surgeon Dr. Costanzo DiPerna said even though Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) announced in late April that hospitals and healthcare providers could resume some nonemergency medical care, many patients are still not scheduling appointments. “Many patients are concerned about coming to visit us, to be screened for cancer, to be surveilled for their previous cancers we’ve taken out,” DiPerna explained. From CapRadio: What I’m concerned about right now, not just for lung cancer but for all cancers, is are there patients out there that don’t want to come in because they’re afraid of getting COVID-19? And, so, they avoid mammograms, they avoid cat scans, they avoid colonoscopies … Then in two years we’re hit with this massive wave of patients that are all at a later stage of essentially incurable cancers. In California and many other states, medical visits governors decided are of a “nonemergency” variety have included routine mammograms, breast ultrasounds, and colonoscopies – which often detect cancers at their earliest stages, when they are most treatable. Similarly, heart valve replacements, angioplasty, and tumor removals have all been delayed because of the orders of many governors as they focused solely on the infections caused by the Chinese coronavirus and associated massive testing and contact tracing expansions. Hundreds of physicians, led by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS), signed a letter to Vice President Mike Pence and the White House Coronavirus Task Force Friday urging the reopening of the nation’s business and schools and warning that delay will show a negative impact on the health of millions of Americans. The physicians observed: Our patients have suffered needlessly in pain and physical decline with disease progression because of short-sighted government edicts to stop all non-emergency care that is unrelated to COVID19. Some patients now face inevitable death because the diagnosis and treatments were delayed too long. Too many of our patients have suffered far more from the psychological, physical, and economic effects of the shutdown of communities and businesses than the direct impact of COVID 19 itself. Hospitals and doctors’ offices are allowed to reopen for regular business after weeks of telling patients to stay home due to COVID-19.  But some doctors say people are not coming in. The potential long-term consequences of this trend.Read More ⤵️https://t.co/g8JCND7Ggy — CapRadio News (@CapRadioNews) May 20, 2020  Additional data published Friday by global public health experts warned millions of children under a year old could be at risk for diseases such as diphtheria and polio due to the delay of their routine immunization visits to pediatricians and family practice physicians during the pandemic. Delays in immunization efforts begun in the 1970s could have far-reaching effects. “The countries reported at least moderate interruptions to the programs, with some countries suspending their programs completely,” STAT News reported, adding that “27 countries have postponed campaigns of vaccinations that protect against measles, while more than a dozen have paused some polio vaccination programs.” DiPerna told CapRadio many patients are gripped by fear that they will be exposed to the coronavirus if they go into doctors’ offices for their regular medical care. He said he has a “frank discussion” with his cancer patients whose medical care has been disrupted due to executive orders for emergency care only. These patients, he said, “need to be screened,” “evaluated,” and “need to be having surgery for cure.” DiPerna added he is trying to reassure his patients “that the experience of seeing us, of going to the hospital, of having surgery … that experience really should not expose them, and most likely will not expose them, to COVID virus.”

Actress Mia Farrow took her hostility toward President Trump and his MAGA base up a notch on Friday, saying his is “gonna kill off” his supporters by urging governors to reopen places of worship across America. “Youre gonna kill off all your supporters,” the Great Gatsby actress said in response to President Trump announcing CDC guidelines to allow places of worship — including churches, synagogues, and mosques — to reopen during the coronavirus pandemic. Youre gonna kill off all your supporters — Mia Farrow (@MiaFarrow) May 23, 2020  “Today, I am identifying houses of worship, churches, synagogues, and mosques as essential places that provide essential services,” Trump said at Friday’s surprise briefing. “Some governors have deemed liquor stores and abortion clinics as essential but have left out churches and other houses of worship. That’s not right,” the president continued, adding that blue state governors, some of whom have tried to crack down on religious gatherings, can call him with questions. “If there’s any questions, they’re going to have to call me, but they will not be successful in that call,” Trump said. “Governors need to do the right thing and allow these very important essential places of faith to open right now — for this weekend,” he added. Farrow has taken aim at the president in recent weeks, experiencing a full blown meltdown before her 403k Twitter followers following Trump’s decision to halt funding to the World Health Organization (W.H.O.), which is suspected of playing a role in China’s efforts to keep the severity of the coronavirus outbreak under wraps. “This is deplorable and an OUTRAGE. We should give more to the WHO. My God. This vindictive little man knows how to deflect from his own failures,” she said in a now-deleted tweet. “I want a real president,” Mia Farrow added in another tweet, along with “I need a Xanax.” I want a real president — Mia Farrow (@MiaFarrow) April 14, 2020  I think i need a Xanax — Mia Farrow (@MiaFarrow) April 14, 2020 

An agri-business advertising for jobs under the government’s ‘Pick For Britain’ farm job scheme for furloughed workers required applicants to speak a foreign language to pick vegetables and fruit. A job opening for an Irrigation Assistant, advertised on the government’s website by the Kent-based food producer S&A, said that some applicants will need to speak Romanian and or Bulgarian to be hired, despite the fact that the job scheme is supposedly geared towards out of work Britons. “To apply for a skilled position, you will need to speak Romanian and/or Bulgarian fluently. English language is essential for some positions,” the advert said, according to a report in The Sun. Bosses keen on foreign labour and mass migration advocates in the political and media class have often claimed that Britons are “too lazy” to do farm work, and justified flying in migrant workers from overseas on crowded planes despite the coronavirus pandemic and mass lay-offs at home because locals will not take the jobs. However, the fact that British workers are not even being considered for at least some farm roles unless they speak obscure foreign languages would seem to lend credence to the claims of commentators such as Gawain Towler, a long-time colleague of Nigel Farage, that domestic recruitment schemes like ‘Pick for Britain’ have been “designed to fail”. Has Pick for Britain been deliberately designed to fail? Worth a read. By @GawainTowler https://t.co/E0VjvQ3YSw — James Crisp (@JamesCrisp6) May 21, 2020  On Tuesday, the Prince of Wales urged students and furloughed workers to apply for seasonal farm work, which would allow them to fill farm vacancies while continuing to receive 80 per cent of their paycheck from the government. It is estimated that some 7.5 million people are having their pay subsidised by the government during the national lockdown and, in April, it was revealed that of the 50,000 Britons that applied to pick fruit and vegetables. Just 112 were given positions. UK Economy Falls At Fastest Rate Since 2008 Crash, Massive Tax Rises Loom https://t.co/0jqGWrsz9O — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 13, 2020  The job openings, it seems, very often came with onerous requirements attached to them, seriously disadvantaging the typical Briton in the hiring process. For example, the Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) has listed requirements that workers must live on-site, whether or not they live nearby the farm — even though it was perfectly normal for British farmworkers to be picked up on minibuses or the like near their homes and returned at the end of their shift in the decades before they were displaced by EU migrant workers from poor countries. Workers that are hired by the farming firm Concordia, meanwhile, are required to spend two weeks in self-isolation, followed by another two weeks of training before being able to start work — requirements which seem almost deliberately designed to favour the lone, temporary migrant worker over the Briton with local connections and familial obligations. “Anyone who can’t work as part of a small team, or for the full length of the placement, increases the risk of infection to all those on the farm,” the company claimed. Agri-businesses are alleged by some to prefer hiring foreign workers required to live on-site in temporary accommodation in part because they can be made to pay rent for that accommodation, substantially reducing bosses’ effect wage costs.

The study’s researchers say this suggests that the rest of the world was slow to start research on the virus and that the “Chinese knew something that the rest of the world didn’t,” the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported on Friday. For the University of Oxford study – posted on Tuesday on Cornell University’s preprint website, “arXiv.org” – the researchers analyzed more than 3,000 peer-reviewed papers from a database called the Web of Science Core Collection, which contains research exclusively from leading scientific journals. The study found that seven of the ten most prolific institutes that also owned Wuhan coronavirus research in the database were from China. Further analysis led the researchers to conclude that a Chinese government agency is the single-largest funder of Wuhan coronavirus research in the world. According to Oxford’s non-peer reviewed paper, as of May 16, the National Natural Science Foundation of China – affiliated with China’s chief administrative authority, its State Council – had provided financial support to 124 studies on the Wuhan coronavirus published in top science journals. University of Oxford scientist Petar Radanliev, the paper’s lead researcher, said the number of studies was greater than the combined number of similar studies on the Wuhan coronavirus funded by the U.S. Department of Health and National Institutes of Health (NIH). According to the paper’s authors, this was unprecedented, as Chinese researches have not been at the forefront of this particular field of research on virology and epidemiology. The scientists said that since 1900, research on viruses and related diseases has been dominated by Western institutes such as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Oxford University, Harvard University, and Johns Hopkins University. This could suggest that “the world was slow in responding with scientific research on Covid-19 [coronavirus],” the Oxford scientists said. The researchers found that China, by comparison, was the “fastest” to act in studying the novel coronavirus, beginning its research as early as December 2019. The scientists cited thousands of research papers posted online since the first coronavirus cases were reported in Wuhan last December. In the paper, the authors question why the world’s leading research institutions were seemingly delayed in beginning their study of the virus: This triggers many questions on have the leading organisations on pandemic and epidemic management reacted at the appropriate speed? If so, why are they behind in the production of scientific journal? Has there been a gap in communications and data sharing? Leaving these organizations oblivious to what was happening? According to the SCMP, the scientists said the study’s surprising results elicited questions such as if the “Chinese knew something that the rest of the world didn’t,” adding that this was speculation. China has been accused of purposefully holding back information about its initial coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan late last year, hiding the extent and severity of the epidemic for at least several weeks before notifying global health authorities that a novel coronavirus had emerged in the country.

The NHL Players’ Association’s executive committee authorized moving forward in talks with the league on returning to play from the coronavirus suspension, approving 24 teams making the playoffs with other aspects still to be negotiated. The NHLPA did not provide a breakdown of the vote of its 31 player representatives in making the announcement Friday night, a day after the proposal was presented to the union’s executive board. In giving the format the green light, the NHLPA stressed several details still need to be negotiated before games can begin. The proposal will now go to the NHL board of governors, which is expected to approve the plan in the next few days. Once approved, the proposal effectively ends the season of the league’s bottom seven teams. Under the plan proposed by the NHL/NHLPA Return To Play committee, the top four teams in each conference would play each other in a mini-tournament for seeding while the remaining 16 teams face off in a best-of-five series play-in round to set the final 16 to compete for the Stanley Cup. Though the approval is considered significant, the task of establishing a path to getting players back on the ice remains challenging. The next step would have the Return To Play committee sort out a host of other issues, ranging from health and safety protocols to determining where games will be played, with the league preparing to group teams in a select number of hub cities. Las Vegas has become the city most mentioned as a potential site, particularly because of its large concentration of hotels that could house numerous teams. Other cities mentioned include Columbus, Ohio; Nashville, Tennessee; Raleigh, North Carolina; St. Paul, Minnesota; and Edmonton, Alberta. Numerous other questions remain unanswered, including when players can return to their respective teams and what non-playoff teams will be allowed to do during what could potentially become a 10-month break between games.
NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly said the league has a plan in place, but stopped short of providing details by saying it would be premature to do so at this time. “All good questions and all questions with answers. But not in a position to answer any of them at this point in time,” Daly wrote in an email. “If and when we are in a position to make an announcement, we will try to make sure they are answered in that context.” At the very least, the league has the framework of a plan on which to build off for the first time since the regular season was placed on pause on March 12. Games would likely be played without fans present. It’s unclear how the league will address players’ concerns over spending potentially lengthy stretches of time in self-isolation away from their families. Both sides agree there is no ideal plan, while acknowledging the limitations they face because of the uncertainty created by the pandemic. The NHL’s regular season was paused on March 12, with 189 games remaining and its 31 teams having played an uneven number of games. “Obviously, it’s not ideal, but I think in a time like this, how can anything be super traditional?” Toronto Maple Leafs defenseman Tyson Barrie said this week. “I think we all have to adapt and be willing to adapt and kind of realize that it’s not going to be this perfect, classic NHL playoffs. I think for the situation we’re in, for a year, I think that’s fine.” Under the proposed 24-team format, Montreal would be the final team to qualify in the East based on a slim points-percentage margin. With 71 points in 71 games (.500), the Canadiens edge out Buffalo, which had 68 points in 69 games (.493) and would extend the league’s longest active playoff drought to a ninth consecutive season. The difference in the West is much larger, with Chicago (.514) beating out Anaheim (.472). All three California teams would miss the playoffs for the first time since 1995-96. A person with what would be one of the seven non-playoff teams told The AP the performance staff is already preparing workout programs for players during what will be a long layoff. “Overall, I think players will be fine during the summer months,” the person said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the return to play format has not been approved. “Finding creative ways to keep them motivated in the fall will be the challenge.” The NHL is open to having the playoffs extend into September and pushing the start of the 2020-21 season as late as January — or when fans can begin attending games in some capacity. Whatever it takes, Winnipeg Jets forward Patrik Laine said Friday. “I just want to play, and I can do whatever format they decide,” Laine said. “It’s just still hockey, but I don’t mind the format. It’s not an issue for me.” Carolina Hurricanes player representative Jordan Martinook said finishing the season and awarding the Stanley Cup would be a considerable feat. “In a year of such negativity and uncertainty, for you to have that kind of celebration, I feel like it would be a big positive for you, your family, your team, your city,” Martinook said.

A majority of swing voters indicated that they will base their vote in November on the issues rather than “how they feel about President Trump,” a KFF Health Tracking Poll released on Friday showed. The survey, taken May 13 – 18, 2020, among 1,189 U.S. adults, asked respondents to indicate how they plan to base their vote in November’s presidential election. “Thinking ahead to November, do you think your vote for president will mostly be based on the candidates’ positions on the issues, or mostly be based on how you feel about President Trump?” it asked. Overall, a majority of voters, 57 percent, said they will base their vote on the issues, compared to the 39 percent who said President Trump. However, the percentage indicating that they will base their vote on issues rather than personal feelings regarding the president grew even higher among independents and swing voters, with 65 percent and 75 percent, respectively. Fifty-seven percent of Republicans indicated that will base their vote on issues rather than feelings toward the president, and Democrats remain split, with 48 percent choosing each option. The news comes as the establishment media and Biden allies continue in their efforts to demonize the president — from the Muller “witch hunt” to their failed impeachment attempt — and politicize the coronavirus pandemic. Thirty-percent of swing voters consider health care the “most important” issue when choosing a candidate, and 25 percent chose the economy. Climate change, one of the progressive left’s most prominent issues, remains a low-tier priority, with just five percent categorizing it as an “important” issue and central factor to casting their vote. According to the survey, the economy remains the “most important” issue among registered voters. President Trump is performing strongest in this area, with 57 percent approving of the way he is handling the economy, even amid the negative effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Fifty-nine percent of independents, specifically, indicated that they approve of the way the president is handling the economy as well. “Even among the largest job loss in recent history and economists’ warning about long-term unemployment, President Trump continues to receive positive ratings in his handling of the economy (+17 percentage points net approval),” the Kaiser Family Foundation noted. The margin of error for the survey’s full sample is +/- 3 percent. The tracking poll follows a Restoration PAC poll released Thursday, showing Trump trouncing Biden in the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania, 50.2 percent to 45.5 percent.

NORCROSS, Georgia — Vice President Mike Pence told Breitbart News that he and President Donald Trump are excited to get the United States reopened and moving again as the coronavirus pandemic recedes nationwide. Backstage after a roundtable with local business leaders here at Waffle House corporate headquarters, where Pence and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp appeared to encourage the continued reopening of the country, Pence told Breitbart News that Georgia’s efforts led by Kemp to reopen aggressively have been successful and are a model for the nation. All 50 states have begun reopening in one way or another, Pence noted in the interview that aired on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel, citing Georgia and Florida—where Pence visited earlier in the week with Gov. Ron DeSantis—as examples for the country. “It would be on April 15, 30 days into the mitigation efforts that we presented to the country—that the president directed the White House Coronavirus Task Force to publish guidelines for opening up America,” Pence said. “We believed because of what the American people were doing and continued to do over that 45 days that we would be in a position for some states and some counties around the country to begin to reopen and put America back to work. Nobody wants to reopen this country more than President Donald Trump. So we equipped governors around the country to be ready for when the 45 Days to Slow the Spread came to an end. Georgia and Florida and other states around the country evaluated the cases in their state, evaluated the data, and have been and have taken steps that are now demonstrating that we can safely and responsibly reopen our economy without putting the people of this country’s health and wellbeing at risk. I think Gov. Kemp also and Gov. DeSantis also recognize that this isn’t a choice between health and a growing economy. It really is a choice between health and health. There are serious health consequences if we were to continue indefinitely the lockdowns that we asked the American people to embrace for 45 days. I must tell you, I know the president is as grateful as I am that as we sit here today, 50 states—all 50 states—have begun the process of reopening their economies. But Georgia is leading the way and demonstrating that you can safely and responsibly reopen your businesses, reopen your restaurants, and put the people of your state back to work, and still, hospitalizations are declining, cases are declining, and, most importantly, fatalities are declining. The people of Georgia are doing it, and I couldn’t be more proud to be here.” Asked if some Democrat governors, such as Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer and Pennsylvania’s Tom Wolf, are moving fast enough, Pence cited his close relationship with governors and noted that every state is ready to reopen. He also praised the protesters nationwide pushing for a faster reopening of their states. “When the president tapped me to lead the White House Coronavirus Task Force, he directed me to forge a seamless partnership with governors around the country of both political parties. We’ve done that,” Pence said. “We continue to believe, whether it be on a statewide basis or a regional or county basis, that every state in America is in a position to begin the process of reopening. Fortunately, as of this week, all 50 states have begun that process. What we’re committed to doing, whether it be providing supplies for testing, whether it be providing personal protective equipment not just for healthcare workers, but for businesses that are beginning the process of reopening, we’re absolutely committed to being a full partner with states. But the president and I truly believe we [have] got to get this country open again. There are profound costs that go well beyond the economy to a prolonged shutdown. I’ve always believed this was a freedom-loving country. I’m very heartened to see people across the country letting their voice be heard, letting governors in every state know they want their freedom back. What Georgia is demonstrating is people are prepared to continue practicing the hygiene and social distancing necessary to protect their families and their neighbors and members of their community. We’ll continue to urge every state to look at the president’s guidelines to open up America again and look for ways, whether it be a portion of a state or the entire state, to get the economy moving again.” Pence, whom Trump appointed to lead the White House Coronavirus Task Force nearly three months ago, told Breitbart News that the country has learned a lot about the coronavirus since the beginning of this whole process as well. “It’s been a learning process every day,” Pence said. “We knew early on that the coronavirus was several times more contagious than the common flu. But there’s been hopeful developments as well. We’ve seen that because of what the American people have done and the sacrifices they’ve made that, despite the fact we’re dramatically increasing testing, cases are still going down. Positivity rates are declining. Today, more than 40 states are finding that less than ten percent of the people who are tested test positive for the coronavirus—and 22 states, less than five percent of those tested are testing positive. So we’ve learned a great deal about the impact of social distancing.” Pence also pointed to a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) scientific study that demonstrates the half-life of the virus drops off significantly with ultraviolet light, higher heat, and humidity. Such “summer conditions,” which are now here in most of the country, he said, will hopefully stop the spread of the virus even more. “We also, the Department of Homeland Security, did a study we published a month ago that found that ultraviolet light—sunlight—and humidity, summer conditions, actually have a profound impact on reducing what’s called the half life of the virus and reducing its potential threat,” Pence said. “But, finally, I think what we’ve also learned is that this is primarily conveyed through respiratory habits. It’s the reason social distancing and hygiene continue to be important. The CDC issued guidance reiterating the threat of transmission on hard surfaces is significantly less than conveyed through respiration. So we’re understanding a great deal more about it, but I can tell you what I think we’ve learned the most is the American people will rise to any challenge when called upon to do so—when families that have put loved ones, especially the elderly’s health first, they make great sacrifices — businesses large and small. We heard today from some small businesses before they learned there was going to be any federal assistance went out and a business owner borrowed against his home so he could keep people on the payroll. I’m very proud of the CARES Act and I’m very proud through Paycheck Protection that we found a way to keep people on the payroll of businesses that were shuttered through the 45 Days to Slow the Spread and through the course of this pandemic, but businesses responded with great charity and great generosity, and I think we’ve learned a lot about the virus, but I think we’ve reaffirmed everything we always knew about the goodness and common sense of the American people.” LISTEN TO VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE ON BREITBART NEWS SATURDAY: 

A greater share of registered voters trust President Trump over Joe Biden (D) when it comes to the country’s economic recovery following the coronavirus pandemic, a Morning Consult survey released this week revealed. When it comes to the nation’s economy — which suffered tremendously at the hands of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, seeing jobless claims topping 38.6 million over the last nine weeks — a greater share of registered voters trust Trump to handle the economic recovery moving forward. Forty-three percent of the 1,994 registered voters surveyed May 15-18, 2020, indicated that they trust Trump to oversee the economic recovery following the pandemic, compared to 40 percent who chose Biden, giving the president an advantage outside of the survey’s +/- 2 percent margin of error. Similarly, 44 percent trust Trump on the economy in a general sense, compared to 41 percent for Biden. Forty-four percent of registered voters also trust the president on the issue of jobs — a four percent advantage over Biden. While the survey showed the Democrat Party’s presumptive nominee leading on health care, uniting the country, leading during a crisis, and containing the spread of the coronavirus, several polls have shown voters listing the economy and jobs as top issues as they head to the polls in November, signaling an advantage for President Trump. “However, if the virus appears relatively under control by the fall and voters are more focused on rebuilding the economy, those conditions could be more favorable for Trump,” Morning Consult said of the results.

The number of suicides documented by a hospital in Northern California during the ongoing lockdown has exceeded the number of Chinese coronavirus deaths, doctors in the city of Walnut Creek revealed this week as they called for an end to the region’s lockdown order. In an interview with the Los Angeles-based ABC7 news outlet aired on Thursday, doctors from the John Muir Medical Center in Walnut Creek stressed that there had been an unprecedented rise in suicides, noting that there have been more attempts over the last month than in most full years. “We’ve never seen numbers like this, in such a short period of time,” Dr. Mike DeBoisblanc, the head of trauma at the Walnut Creek hospital, told the local ABC outlet. “I mean, we’ve seen a year’s worth of suicide attempts in the last four weeks.” “What I have seen recently, I have never seen before,” Kacey Hansen, a trauma nurse at the medical center for over three decades, added. “I have never seen so much intentional injury.” “Social isolation has a price and I know why we’ve done it,” she also said. “It just has a bigger price tag than I thought.” Hansen reportedly noted that the Walnut Creek hospital is unable to save as many patients as usual due to a near single-minded focus on coronavirus. Other doctors, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director Francis Collins, have acknowledged that there is a clear and present danger that lockdown measures may fuel mental health issues like suicide. Lockdowns have “not been necessary to save lives but instead inflicted devastating harm on tens of millions of people,” hundreds of doctors wrote in a letter to the White House. Contra Costa County’s Walnut Creek is in the eastern region of the San Francisco Bay area. Dr. DeBoisblanc and Tom Tamura, the executive director of the Contra Costa County Crisis Center, noted that most of the suicides involve young adults who are “worried about the stress that isolation and job loss can bring as this quarantine continues.” In a statement to ABC7 responding to the trauma team’s concerns about the rise in suicides amid the lockdowns, the county’s crisis center proclaimed: We strongly encourage everyone in distress to seek help from mental health professionals and local resources such as 211 (the Crisis Center). We understand that this is a very difficult time for many people, and it can feel very isolating to practice social distancing. We want to stress that the shelter-in-place order is saving lives at the same time. Noting that the region’s shutdown order is having a devastating impact on mental health, Dr. DeBoisblanc declared: Personally, I think it’s time. I think, originally, this [shelter-in-place order] was put in place to flatten the curve and to make sure hospitals have the resources to take care of COVID patients.We have the current resources to do that and our other community health is suffering. Nevertheless, the John Muir Medical Center stressed that it is supportive of the shelter-in-place order in the Bay Area, saying in a statement to ABC7: We realize there are a number of opinions on this topic, including within our medical staff, and John Muir Health encourages our physicians and staff to participate constructively in these discussions. We all share a concern for the health of our community, whether that is COVID-19, mental health, intentional violence, or other issues. The shelter-in-place order in the region will expire by May 31. Every state in America has begun a phased reopening process as conditions across the country improve, particularly a drop in COVID-19 hospitalizations and new cases.

Suspected members of Nigeria’s Boko Haram terror group currently await a trial date while in military detention, but the start date has been delayed indefinitely due to the country’s inadequate criminal justice system, Africa’s Institute for Security Studies (ISS Africa) asserted in an article published on Thursday. For several months, Nigeria has expected to conduct the fourth phase of mass trials of suspected members of the Boko Haram terror group, but the government has taken no concrete action to start the process. In October 2019, Netsanet Belay, Amnesty International’s Advocacy and Research Director said: It appears that the government of Nigeria has dumped further ‘information’ on the Office of the Prosecutor [OTP] in an attempt to delay the inevitable investigation. There is mounting evidence that the government of Nigeria is willingly unable to bring perpetrators to justice and it is past time that the OTP proceeds with an investigation into crimes committed by both Boko Haram and the Nigerian military. The delay has gone on for far too long and the OTP needs to do what is right for victims of these horrific crimes who have been waiting for justice for more than a decade. The [International Criminal Court] ICC should proceed to open an investigation into atrocities committed in the North-East of Nigeria. For more than ten years, Boko Haram’s jihadist terrorist campaign across northeast Nigeria and neighboring regions has caused Nigeria massive destabilization. Starting with a major uprising in July 2009, Boko Haram began a campaign of violence in Nigeria that, despite periodic lulls, continues to this day. Recent reports indicate that the terror group has capitalized on lockdowns caused by the ongoing Wuhan coronavirus pandemic to stage a formidable resurgence in the country. Boko Haram often clashes with Nigerian state security forces, which has led to mass arrests and the detention of suspected members. These mass arrests “began in 2009 and reached a peak in 2013,” ISS Africa reports. Although Nigeria has previously conducted mass trials for terrorism offenses in 2017 and 2018, these trials “exposed significant problems with Nigeria’s criminal justice system,” according to the report. “Weak investigations, arbitrary arrests, unlawful detention, and the absence of legal aid and evidence marred the cases,” the report said. The three mass trials conducted in 2017 and 2018 were considered the first three phases of trials, with the fourth phase currently awaiting a start date. According to ISS Africa, for the fourth phase of trials to finally start and be conducted fairly, Nigeria’s criminal justice system must first undergo significant “legislative reform” to “address the challenges of investigating, prosecuting, and adjudicating terrorism offenses.”

A state health official in Mexico claims federal health officials are ignoring confirmed coronavirus cases that are asymptomatic and only counts cases where patients need medical attention. The claim is the latest accusation that Mexico’s government is hiding the true reach of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in that nation. The new case of alleged undercount took place this week in the coastal state of Yucatan where state officials carried out a series of aleatory tests at two open-air markets in the city of Merida. According to information released by the Yucatan Health Department, they carried out the tests on both customers and shopkeepers alike. The tests yielded 47 positive tests for COVID-19 leading authorities to close down the markets on a temporary basis. During a news conference, Yucatan’s Health Secretary Mauricio Sauri Vivas said that of the 47 cases, only the five symptomatic cases were loaded the national database under definitions ordered by Mexico’s federal health officials. According to El Diario de Yucatan, Sauri Vivas claimed that they were following the guidelines set forth by Mexico’s Health Secretariat that only account for the “confirmed cases that present symptoms”. The allegations of undercounting come just days after an NGO in Mexico revealed that health officials in Mexico City were only accounting for one-third of the deaths that listed coronavirus as a cause of death. In addition to several allegations of undercounting, Mexico’s Undersecretary of Health Hugo Lopez Gatell admitted that some of his figures do not include coronavirus cases from private hospitals and only include the cases from government hospitals. The discrepancies several states to release their own figures that include both categories of cases. To reopen the markets in Yucatan after the imposed quarantine, shopkeepers would need to implement a series of increased safety protocols. Government officials claimed that during the closing, they would provide a stipend to shopkeepers to help them get through the closing.

LONDON (AP) – British researchers testing an experimental vaccine against the new coronavirus are moving into advanced studies and aim to immunize more than 10,000 people to determine if the shot works. Friday’s announcement came as Chinese scientists who are developing a similar vaccine reported promising results from their own first-step testing, seeing hoped-for immune reactions and no serious side effects in 108 vaccinated people. Last month, Oxford University researchers began vaccinating more than 1,000 volunteers in a preliminary study designed to test the shot’s safety. Those results aren’t in yet but the Oxford team announced they’re expanding to 10,260 people across Britain, including older people and children. If all goes smoothly, “it’s possible as early as the autumn or toward the end of the year, you could have results that allowed use of the vaccine on a wider scale,” predicted Andrew Pollard, head of the Oxford Vaccine Group. But Pollard acknowledged there were still many challenges ahead, including how long it will take to prove the vaccine works — particularly since transmission has dropped significantly in Britain — and any potential manufacturing complications. The Oxford shot is one of about a dozen experimental Covid-19 vaccines in early stages of human testing or poised to start, mostly in China, the U.S. and Europe. Scientists have never created vaccines from scratch this fast and it’s far from clear that any will ultimately prove safe and effective. So today I became a Lab Rat Ǵ volunteer and had my #COVID vaccine trial injection as part of the @UniofOxford @ImperialMed study.  Don’t know if I’ve had the new vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or MenACWY Vaccine. pic.twitter.com/saoKMjy0P0 — Andy Wigmore (@andywigmore) May 12, 2020  Moving on to such a huge late-scale test doesn’t guarantee Oxford will reach the finish line, either. Pollard couldn’t provide any data from the first tests, but said an oversight board hasn’t seen any indications of worrisome side effects. A small study in monkeys offers a note of caution: Teams from Oxford and the U.S. National Institutes of Health found the vaccine protected against pneumonia but didn’t eliminate the coronavirus in the nose. Pollard said it was still an open question whether the shot could make a dent in how the disease spreads. Likewise, Friday’s report about a similar vaccine being developed by China’s CanSino Biologics couldn’t address how protective the shot might be. All 108 test participants were quarantined in a hotel for 14 days after vaccination, to ensure they weren’t exposed to the coronavirus during a study meant to track safety. Most volunteers reported at least one reaction typical for vaccines such as pain at the injection site, fever or fatigue. But there were no serious side effects, researchers reported in the journal Lancet. A month after vaccination, researchers spotted important immune responses including antibodies needed to block infection. But those responses were lower in the small number of volunteers ages 45 to 60, the oldest tested. “The ability to trigger these immune responses does not necessarily indicate that the vaccine will protect humans from Covid-19,” lead researcher Wei Chen from the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology said in a statement provided by Lancet. “This result shows a promising vision for the development of Covid-19 vaccines, but we are still a long way from this vaccine being available to all,” Chen said. Both the CanSino and Oxford vaccines are made in a similar way: They use a harmless virus to carry genes for the “spike” protein that coats the coronavirus into the body, priming the immune system to react if the real infection comes along. CanSino uses a weakened common cold virus called an adenovirus – and Friday’s study showed people whose bodies recognized that cold virus didn’t get as much of the presumed Covid-19 benefit. To avoid that problem, the Oxford vaccine uses an adenovirus that normally infects chimpanzees. CanSino is awaiting results from 500 volunteers injected in a next-step study. In Britain’s soon-to-begin larger tests, researchers will address how Oxford’s shot will affect older adults, who are at high risk from Covid-19. Pollard noted that people over 70 often don’t get as much protection from vaccines as younger people. Earlier this week, drugmaker AstraZeneca said it had secured its first agreements to produce 400 million doses of the Oxford-developed vaccine, bolstered by a $1 billion investment from a U.S. government agency. The AstraZeneca investment hopefully will make the vaccine available globally, including in developing countries, said Lawrence Young of the University of Warwick. But he cautioned the shot’s effectiveness still is unclear, citing the monkey research. “This raises serious questions about the ability of this vaccine to protect against infection in humans and to prevent virus transmission,” he said in a statement. “We need to be urgently exploring other vaccine candidates.” Often, possible vaccines that look promising early fail after testing expands to thousands of people – one reason the crowded field is important. Many of the candidates work in different ways, and are made with different technologies, increasing the odds that at least one approach might succeed. Other leading candidates – including one from the NIH and Moderna Inc., and another by Inovio Pharmaceuticals – simply inject a piece of the coronavirus genetic code that instructs the body itself to produce spike protein that primes the immune system. Meanwhile, companies and governments are beginning to scale up production now, aiming for hundreds of millions of doses of the candidates they think might win the vaccine race. It’s a huge gamble that could waste a lot of money if their choices fail and must be thrown away. But if they get lucky and a stockpiled vaccine pans out, it could help mass vaccinations start a few months faster.

On Friday’s broadcast of CNBC’s “Halftime Report,” White House Coronavirus Task Force member Dr. Anthony Fauci said “staying locked down for a prolonged period of time” is not the right approach, and “most of the country” is reopening “in a prudent way.” Fauci said, “I don’t want people to think that any of us feel that staying locked down for a prolonged period of time is the way to go.” He continued that while locking down at the beginning was needed, “now is the time, depending upon where you are and what your situation is — is to begin to seriously [look] at reopening the economy, reopening the country to try and get back to some degree of normal. I’m totally in favor of that, if done in the proper way, in the appropriate setting.” Fauci added that he is concerned if places are reopening while cases are increasing and they’re not following the recommended benchmarks. He further stated, “[I]n general, I think most of the country is doing it in a prudent way. There are obviously some situations where people might be jumping over that. I just say please proceed with caution if you’re going to do that.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

Many Republicans have criticized House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) for her so-called HEROES Act, which is the latest effort from congressional Democrats to respond to the coronavirus pandemic. That includes Rep. Scott DesJarlais (R-TN), who labeled it “blatant political scammery” during an interview with Huntsville, AL radio’s WVNN. The bill, seen by Republicans as a messaging bill for the 2020 general election, would have a profound impact on the economy if passed according to DesJarlais. DesJarlais told WVNN’s “The Jeff Poor Show” that while the bill has perks for young voters, it would also stall the economic recovery from the coronavirus downturn, which would be used against President Donald Trump in his reelection bid. “I think things are getting better,” he said. “You can see it in the new cases and death rates, the flattening of the curve, and so on and so forth. Most states are going to be reopened by the end of this month. And we’re doing so with caution. But I find it interesting, for example, in this last HEROES Act that Pelosi tried to push through — in my opinion, it was just blatant political scammery at its best where they have this wish list that has very little to do with coronavirus. And it’s almost like they’re hoping for a slow financial recovery. We happened to have a presidential election in November. The economy often drives elections. President Trump was presiding over one of the best economic times of our nation’s history. Then this virus hits.” “He acted quickly,” DesJarlais continued. “He was criticized for doing too much, too soon. And then, ‘Oh, in hindsight, he should have done more.’  Governors were slow to respond and shut down the states quickly. There’s a study out of Columbia … that says that if we had just shut down a week or two early, we could have saved 36,000 lives. It’s easy to speculate that it is the president’s fault, that it is the governors’ fault. But this huge spending package dealt with postal workers and getting $10,000 off of student loans, even though they’ve suspended student loan payments for six months, is obviously targeting young voters, trying to do things that will woo voters to the Democratic side, extending the $600-per-week unemployment through January 2021, where people are being paid more not to work than they were when working.” “To me, it just seems like a Democratic ploy to stall the economy and somehow blame Trump in the fall,” he added.

White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx on Friday urged Americans to keep social distancing during Memorial Day weekend, even as she encouraged celebrations and going outside. “It’s very important to maintain that six-feet distance and very important to have your mask with you in case that six-feet distance cannot be maintained,” Dr. Birx said. She said that it was fine for Americans to go outside and play golf, tennis, or go to the beach, provided that they take steps to stay six feet apart from others. “Remember that is your space and that is the space you need to protect to ensure you are social distancing for others,” she said. Birx noted that some people under the age of 30 could have the virus without symptoms and shed it unwittingly and infect other people. “There are a lot of healthy people that look healthy with COVID,” she said. Birx also suggested Americans should maintain proper hygiene and use disposable utensils at parties. “I know you can do this,” she said. “I know the American people can do this.”

A new Reuters/Ipsos poll suggests that more than one-third of America would be less likely to get any vaccine that President Donald Trump endorsed. According to Reuters, “most respondents in the survey of 4,428 U.S. adults taken between May 13 and May 19 said they would be heavily influenced by guidance from the Food and Drug Administration or results of large-scale scientific studies showing that the vaccine was safe.” But even with the FDA’s support, 36 percent of Americans polled said that President Donald Trump telling them the vaccine was safe would make them more skeptical about taking it. Further, less than two-thirds of the people questioned are interested in a vaccine at all. In fact, 40 percent of respondents believe the vaccine could end up being more dangerous than the novel coronavirus itself. “It’s a little lower than I thought it would be with all the attention to COVID-19,” said Vanderbilt University Medical Center infectious disease and vaccine expert Dr. William Schaffner,  “I would have expected somewhere around 75 percent.” It is a dismal number, especially when you consider that studies estimate at least 70 percent of citizens need to be on board before vaccination will provide the needed herd immunity. Trump has claimed that there will be a vaccine available in 2020. While vaccines typically take over a decade to safely develop, testing is already underway.

Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) announced on Friday that all restrictions on summer and youth camps in Floriday will be lifted, effective immediately. “Our kids have been out of organized activities for a couple months now,” DeSantis said on Friday in Jacksonville. “We need to have a pathway to get it back.”  The governor did say that the Florida Department of Health would likely post a list of best practices to its website and that local leadership will be allowed to make independent decisions. “We believe that this makes sense based on the data and observed experience. We are not going to be instituting a lot of rules, or really any rules,” DeSantis said. “At the end of the day, we trust parents to be able to make decisions in conjunction with physicians.” Broward and Miami-Dade officials remain cautious. Broward County Spokesperson Margaret Stapleton reiterated that the county is “not offering any youth sports or summer camps at this time,” but “Parks and Recreation staff is assessing how programming can resume, with adherence to the requirements for social distancing, facial covering and sanitation.” Miami-Dade had a similar response: “We do not have a timetable as yet for any openings,” said Miami-Dade spokesperson Myriam Marquez. State pediatric authorities are also in disagreement about reopening summer camps — famous for their crowded throngs of children and lack of showering — so soon. “We still don’t know enough about the disease,” said Dr. Bruce Peters, a professor at the Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Osteopathic Medicine at Nova Southeastern University. “We don’t even have a vaccine. It’s way too early.” But Dr. Bonnie White, a pediatrician who attended DeSantis’s announcement, asserted that it was more important for children to “be able to laugh with their friends,” and parents should simply practice due diligence, keeping their kids from the activities if they are sick. Camps across Florida are looking carefully at how to manage reopening activities for children amid the global pandemic. Many are cutting enrollment in half, restricting larger group activities, and removing field trips from the schedule. “We are still assessing the issue and have not made a final determination yet,” said Kevin Pickard, director of the City of Sunrise Leisure Services. “In addition to the risks associated with COVID-19, the lack of school sites is a major concern for us. We would have to substantially lower our registration numbers if the determination is made to continue on with a camp program,” he added. Many parents remain skeptical. “I will absolutely not send my child to a camp this year,” Mayte Arteta-Martinez of Hollywood told Fox. “I do not feel it is safe because children do not understand the concepts of social distance, nor do I believe camp counselors/teachers are willing to take the time to constantly be watching over them to keep these parameters.”

Former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick will be released from prison early, according to a state representative in contact with Fox News. “State representative Karen Whitsett says President Trump told her Thursday that Kwame Kilpatrick would be one of 3000 prisoners released because of #coronavirus,” Fox 2’s Charlie Langton tweeted Saturday afternoon. Kilpatrick was convicted in 2013, currently serving a 28-year sentence on 24 corruption charges. Prosecutors said Kilpatrick ran a “private profit machine” from his office, manipulating public funds and contracting to enrich himself, his family, and friends. Kilpatrick was elected to office in 2001, then resigned in 2008 for a completely separate scandal, pleading guilty to obstruction of justice in an investigation regarding sexually explicit text messages and an extramarital affair with his chief of staff. #BREAKING State representative Karen Whitsett says President Trump told her Thursday that Kwame Kilpatrick would be one of 3000 prisoners released because of #coronavirus @FOX2News @WWJ950   @realDonaldTrump  @KayLyme — Charlie Langton (@charlielangton) May 22, 2020  Rep. Whitsett said that while President Trump told her Kilpatrick would be one of 3,000 Michigan prisoners to be released because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, he would remain under house arrest. Whitsett is primarily known for her break from the Democratic party to push for national unity during the crisis. She has been censured by the 13th Congressional District Democratic Party Organization — meaning they will not support her upcoming reelection campaign. When asked for comment during his Friday coronavirus briefing, current Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan said people who know him know his connection to Kilpatrick is “very personal.” “Known him since he was in high school. When he was teaching at Marcus Garvey and going to law school at night at DCL, he’d study in his father’s office which was next to mine and his twins would play on the floor in my office,” Duggan said, stressing that Kilpatrick was one of the most talented people he knows. “He has a lot to contribute and if, in fact, the reports [of his early release] are true, I’ll be doing anything I can to help him get a fresh start,” the mayor said.

Friday on MSNBC’s “The Beat,” liberal documentary filmmaker Michael Moore accused President Donald Trump of attempting to “rig” the 2020 presidential election said Democrats must fight “tooth and nail” with Trump for mail-in voting. Melber asked, “Your concern about that, and as someone who has always been tough and loud and clear about your politics in public, what do you think people like you, fellow liberals, should do if Trump is playing games with 2020 voting?” Moore said, “He has to be fought tooth and nail. There can be no compromise now. I can see, I think others can see what he is up to here. He is trying to do a number of things to make the election go in his favor by rigging it, by trying to make it uncomfortable or uneasy or, if the virus still going on in November.” He continued, “I don’t know why he would oppose this, because it seems like a lot of seniors, that was his strongest demographic, why he would oppose making it easier for them so that they don’t have to go to a polling place and maybe get the virus. A lot of stuff doesn’t make any sense right now.” He added, “But I’ve learned in terms of how we lost to him last time, how he won the White House by losing the election, to not take him for granted. Every move he is making, whether it’s getting rid of the inspector generals, so there is no watchdogs in the last six to nine months, whether it’s the business with the post office, whatever he is doing and whatever he is up to, suggesting maybe we postpone the election because of the virus. We must not postpone the election. We must make it easy for every American to vote. We must not be afraid of men carrying guns in our state capitols. They are the minority.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

World Health Organization (W.H.O.) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Friday that his organization “worked day and night to coordinate the global response” to the coronavirus pandemic, “providing technical advice, catalysing political solidarity, mobilising resources, coordinating resources and much more.”  “So far almost $800 million has been pledged or received towards W.H.O.’s appeal for COVID-19 programs, leaving a gap of just over $900 million,” Tedros told the 34 members of the W.H.O. Executive Board in a three-hour teleconference, stressing the need for additional funding. Voice of America News reported on the list of W.H.O. achievements by Tedros, who does not appear to have discussed criticisms of his performance in-depth but appeared conscious of charges that W.H.O. relayed too much misinformation from the Chinese Communist Party about the Wuhan coronavirus: In its first virtual meeting, the board and its newly-elected chairman, Indian Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, heard Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus say the WHO had worked “day and night” to coordinate a global response to the pandemic. Tedros said the WHO published its first comprehensive package of guidance on COVID-19 on January 10, and said it has since issued “almost 100 technical documents.” He said the organization has held more than 50 news briefings and worked with multiple high-tech platforms, including Facebook, Google and Instagram, to fight what he called the “info-demic” of misinformation about the coronavirus that has spread throughout the world. Since February, he said the WHO has convened more than 400 researchers worldwide to “identify research priorities,” and that they are tracking more than 700 clinical trials globally. The United States, which has frozen its disproportionately large share of W.H.O. funding pending a full investigation of the organization’s errors during the pandemic, told the Executive Board that it wants the review to begin “now.” The Associated Press on Friday described the message sent from the U.S. government to the overseers of the United Nations’ health organization: Adm. Brett Giroir, an assistant secretary in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, sent a letter to the U.N. health agency’s executive board meeting on Friday saying the United States believes the WHO can “immediately initiate” preparations such as bringing together independent health experts and setting up guidelines for the review. “This review will ensure we have a complete and transparent understanding of the source, timeline of events, and decision-making process for the WHO’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic,” wrote Giroir, who is one of the board’s 34 international members. Giroir did not deliver that statement in person, but did briefly participate in the board’s first-ever “virtual” meeting. Giroir alluded to a resolution passed Tuesday by the WHO’s assembly calling on Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to launch a “comprehensive evaluation” of the WHO-coordinated international response to the outbreak “at the earliest appropriate moment.” […] “As President Trump just made clear in his May 18 letter to Director-General Tedros, there is no time to waste to begin on the reforms needed to ensure such a pandemic never happens again,” Giroir added. “We applaud the call for an impartial, independent, and comprehensive review, to be undertaken in consultation with member states, and urge that work begin now.” The AP described Giroir’s letter as having “a decidedly more diplomatic tone” than the one sent to Tedros by President Donald Trump, but Giroir gently stressed the importance of the points Trump made. “We further appreciate the mandate given to the WHO in the resolution to investigate the origins of (the coronavirus), and we are confident that researchers and medical practitioners around the world will be empowered in the pursuit of vaccines and other countermeasures through this knowledge,” he wrote in one passage, a very polite way of reminding W.H.O. that it had better complete that investigation in a timely and comprehensive manner. Giroir also said that when W.H.O.’s governing body, the World Health Assembly (W.H.A.), reconvenes this autumn, it must address “the ability of Taiwan to participate as an observer.” Taiwanese participation has been blocked by Communist China for purely political reasons, at enormous cost to the rest of the world, since Taiwan provided vital early challenges to the false information fed to W.H.O. by China and devised the world’s most effective response to the pandemic.

House Democrats wrote to President Donald Trump on Friday, questioning his decision to send 200 ventilators to Russia to help coronavirus patients there. In a letter signed by three committee chairs (Oversight, Foreign Affairs, and Appropriations) and two subcommittee chairs (Coronavirus and National Security), Democrats objected to the donation, claiming that the president was “providing or selling ventilators to other countries as gifts or favors to serve your own political or personal interests without any meaningful strategic justification, thorough interagency process, or policy rationale for doing so.” While they claimed that they are not averse to being “part of the global solution to the coronavirus pandemic,” the Democrats added that “we must first ensure that cities and hospitals across the United States can address their own ventilator shortages.” The White House has repeatedly noted that every American who has needed a ventilator during the coronavirus pandemic has had one thanks to the administration’s guidance of private sector production. The president has begun calling the U.S. the “king” of ventilators. “With your help,” President Trump told employees at a Ford Motor Company plant in Michigan on Thursday, “not a single American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator. Not one.” In their letter, House Democrats wrote: “The use of American taxpayer dollars to purchase and deliver ventilators overseas cannot and should not be used as political favors.” But they provided no evidence that Trump has done so. Instead, Democrats demanded the White House preserve and provide documents, including “[c]omplete and unredacted flight manifests for U.S. ventilator shipments to foreign governments or entities” and “[f]ull summaries of any and all conversations between yourself and President Putin during which the shipment of ventilators was discussed.” Trump announced this week that the U.S. was sending 250 ventilators to Nigeria — more than the U.S. is sending to Russia. The administration has said that it will provide 8,000 ventilators to foreign countries by the end of July, since there will be an oversupply in the U.S. Joel B.

Chinese people voted the U.S. “the most disappointing country” in the world for its response to the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic, according to an opinion poll conducted by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) newspaper Global Times, which published a report on the findings on Friday. “1,568 respondents across ten Chinese cities, participated in the opinion poll themed ‘public anticipation of economic life after the pandemic,’ conducted by the poll center of the Global Times,” the article said. “An overwhelming 86.7 percent of the respondents deemed the U.S.’ [Wuhan corona]virus prevention measures as the most disappointed one; followed by the U.K. with 29 percent. Only a small minority of the participants, 4.9 percent, expressed their disappointment with China’s battle against [the Wuhan corona]virus,” the newspaper claimed. Beijing’s own response to the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak, which emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, has been widely condemned by world health authorities and national leaders. Studies have found the CCP’s coverup of China’s initial Wuhan coronavirus outbreak allowed the isolated epidemic to evolve into an ongoing global pandemic, responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. China’s poll follows shortly after the Pew Research Center found that Taiwanese nationals prefer the U.S. to China by a “nearly two-to-one margin” in a survey released on May 12. According to the poll: Overall, just 35 percent of adults give positive marks to mainland China, while about six in ten hold unfavorable views. There is widespread support for increased economic and political ties with Washington; enthusiasm for similar relations with mainland China is much more muted. According to Pew Research, the poll was representative of Taiwan’s adult population and carried out from October to November of last year. Although Taiwan has never been ruled by Beijing in its history, China considers the island a renegade province. Taiwan successfully functions as its own sovereign nation, commanding its own military and government. The U.S. has increased its support of Taiwan in recent months amid increased bullying by China. On May 19, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, along with other world leaders, congratulated Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, on her reelection to a second term, signaling America’s support of her ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). According to Pew’s report, the DPP asserts that Taiwanese national identity remains distinct from Chinese identity and supports increased political ties with the U.S. over China. The opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), prefers closer relations with mainland China. Among politically independent Taiwanese, meaning those who fail to identify strongly with either the DPP or the KMT, “positive feelings for the U.S. are much stronger than towards mainland China,” according to the report. Among those who identify solely as Taiwanese, favorable views of the U.S. are “three times higher than towards mainland China (75 percent versus 23 percent),” according to the report.

Friday on MSNBC’s “Deadline,” network host Al Sharpton reacted to presumptive Democratic nominee former Vice President Joe Biden’s telling radio host Charlamagne tha God that voters who have trouble deciding whether to support him or President Donald Trump “ain’t black.” Sharpton said, “I watched the interview that he did with Charlamagne tha God. First of all, Charlamagne tha God is respected as one can be in the black community and in general. There’s no way he’s pressing someone in an interview on behalf of Donald Trump. He presses everyone in interviews and ironically the questions he was raising about Vice President Biden, I raised, and others have raised in interviews. He presses me when I go on the show, and we’re friends. He is one that wants answers. So I think that his being something other than black is as ludicrous as saying that I’m going to be in the Rockettes when Radio City opens up again. I can dance, but I can’t do the Rockettes.” He continued, “But the other point is, I think whether it was said in jest by the vice president or not— I think Symone Sanders, who is also unquestionably black, said the vice president said it in jest if you have to decide between Trump and I — you’re not black. Whether you say it in jest or not, no one should qualify who’s going to be black or anything else. I think that’s inappropriate. I think that clearly, the vice president ought to deal with his record. Many of us questioned the Crime Bill. In fact, I marched on it then.” He added, “Eight years this man was vice president and did things that he can concretely point to, including helping President Obama reduce the federal population of inmates by 38,000. He was there. I sat next to him when they announced the whole thing around policing task force.” He concluded, “He has a concrete record to run against a man whose own aide Omarosa Manigault, was the spokesperson to the Black community for Donald Trump and was in the White House with him, she calls him a racist. So deal with the record. Don’t say things in jest that are inappropriate. People can be black and still make wrong political decisions, but Charlamagne tha God is not one of them.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Audio resurfaced Thursday in which Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) suggested that her husband, John Bessler, had taken hydroxychloroquine during his battle against coronavirus, from which he later recovered. The audio was cited by the Gateway Pundit blog, which in turn referred to P. J. Gladnick at the Citizen Free Press blog,  who cited an April 7 interview on the Michael Smerconish Program on Sirius XM Radio 124 (9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. ET, weekdays). Smerconish and Klobuchar discussed her husband’s recovery, and had the following exchange (here from 4:47 to 5:41): Smerconish: Has it influenced your thought process relative to the discussion or debate about hydroxychloroquine? Klobuchar: Well, I think that I listen to the science there. I believe he did briefly take that drug, I’d have to check with his doctors, because of course I wasn’t there. But I think that — or some drug like it — but I think that we have to listen to the science and you have to listen to your doctors, [about] what is going to work in each individual situation. Sometimes you might have other conditions that make it so you can’t take certain drugs, sometimes your own condition with the virus wouldn’t demand that, and so I think people have to look at what works. And I just believe in science, something this president has been not listening to. Curiously, Klobuchar mocked President Donald Trump on Wednesday for taking the drug (prescribed by his medical team at the White House, with zinc, as a prophylactic): They say that hydroxychloroquine can lead to hallucinations. https://t.co/jCfls8eZpf — Amy Klobuchar (@amyklobuchar) May 20, 2020  The Washington Examiner‘s Kerry Picket also flagged the Smerconish interview, and evidently tried to obtain comment from Klobuchar’s office, but did not receive a response.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) on Friday extended the state’s safer-at-home order to June 12. The order was slated to expire next week, on Thursday, May 28, but Whitmer warned residents that they are “not out of the woods yet,” citing the possibility of a second wave of the coronavirus. “If we’re going to lower the chance of a second wave and continue to protect our neighbors and loved ones from the spread of this virus, we must continue to do our part by staying safer at home,” she said, according to the Detroit Free Press: Whitmer’s announcement comes a day after she made several changes to further relax a sweeping stay-at-home order that has been in place since March, allowing social gatherings of 10 people or less immediately and telling retail businesses that sell goods they can reopen to customers for appointment-only shopping Tuesday. That change also allows for non-emergency dental and doctor services to resume next Friday and Whitmer said Thursday that she would continue to relax the order as warranted by the data. She had previously allowed some retail businesses, such as garden stores and bicycle repair shops to reopen, and at 12:01 a.m. Friday, bars, restaurants and other businesses and offices on the Upper Peninsula and in northern Michigan around Traverse City, could open to customers, provided they limited their customers, made sure people stayed six feet apart and required masks. “All of us know the importance of getting people back to work and the economy moving again,” Whitmer, who has faced a wave of scrutiny over her lockdown orders, said. “But the worst thing we can do is open up in a way that causes a second wave of infections and death, puts health care workers at further risk, and wipes out all the progress we’ve made,” she added. Michiganders gathered at the Michigan capitol lawn on Wednesday for “Operation Haircut” as part of a greater effort to “demonstrate the insanity still rampant in Lansing.” “Michigan needs to be reopened now to end the reign of Michigan’s power hungry bureaucrats. We are suffering from a #Whitmerdepression,” MCC co-founder Marian Sheridan said. Whitmer’s administration took a blow this week after a judge ruled that Karl Manke — a 77-year-old barber in Owosso, Michigan, who had his license suspended without a hearing — did not have to close his shop. As Breitbart News detailed: “(The attorney general) has not presented any studies underlying the doctor’s conclusion. (The attorney general) has not shown any nexus between the cutting of hair and an increased risk of transmission,” Stewart wrote, the Detroit Free Press reported. “(The attorney general’s) filings rest more on general facts about COVID-19 than specific practices or conditions at (Manke’s) business.” Nessel’s office said she would appeal the ruling. Whitmer has come under criticism for her heavy-handed approach to the coronavirus pandemic, initially issuing far-reaching lockdown orders that even barred neighbors from visiting each other.

On Friday, Georgetown university announced that one of its legendary basketball players and current head coach Patrick Ewing, has tested positive for the coronavirus. “I want to share that I have tested positive for COVID-19,” Ewing said in a statement. “This virus is serious and should not be taken lightly. I want to encourage everyone to stay safe and take care of yourselves and your loved ones. Now more than ever, I want to thank the healthcare workers and everyone on the front lines. I’ll be fine and we will all get through this.” The news comes in the same week that the NCAA gave schools the approval to hold on-campus voluntary workouts with their athletes beginning on June 1st. Ewing reportedly contracted the virus while away from the team, lowering the risk of infection to the rest of the team and staff. Ewing, 57, is currently receiving care at a local D.C. hospital.

The U.S. Census Bureau announced this week that each Wednesday it will post online a survey of American households to measure how people are doing during the coronavirus outbreak on a number of issues, including employment, “food security,” and access to health care. “The survey is intended to provide crucial weekly data to help understand the experiences of American households during the COVID-19 pandemic,” the announcement of the survey said. The announcement said: In this initial release, the Household Pulse Survey Interactive Tool provides data for select indicators at national and state levels. National data also are available in table format. We plan subsequent weekly releases through late July, and will include additional estimates for states and the 15 largest metropolitan statistical areas. For the April 23-May 5 period, invitations to take part in the survey were sent to 1,867,126 households and a total 74,413 responded (63,003 complete interviews and 11,410 partial interviews). Some of the key findings include: • Among the population of adults 18 and over, 47 percent either lost employment income or another adult in their household had lost employment income since March 13. Thirty-nine percent of adults expected that they or someone in their household would lose employment income over the next four weeks. • About ten percent of adults reported that they did not get enough of the food they needed some of the time or often. Another 32 percent report getting enough, but not the kinds of food they needed. On average, households spent $196 a week to buy food at supermarkets, grocery stores, online, and other places to be prepared and eaten at home. • Adults who responded reported feeling anxious or nervous more than half the days last week or nearly every day 29.7 percent of the time. They reported not being able to stop or control worrying more than half the days last week or nearly every day 22.8 percent of the time. For measures related to depression, 18.6 percent of adults report feeling down more than half the days or nearly every day last week, and 21.4 percent reported having little interest or pleasure in doing things more than half the days or nearly every day last week. • 38.7 percent of adults report that over the last four weeks, they delayed getting medical care because of the coronavirus pandemic. • When asked about the likelihood of being able to pay next month’s rent or mortgage on time, 21.3 precent reported only slight or no confidence in being able to pay next month’s rent or mortgage on time. Another 2.5 percent reported next month’s mortgage is or will be deferred. • In households with children enrolled in public or private school (K-12), adults spent 13 hours on average on teaching activities during the last seven days. The Bureau said it partnered with five other federal agencies to develop the Household Pulse Survey, including the Bureau of Labor Statistics, National Center for Health Statistics, USDA Economic Research Service, Department for Housing and Urban Development, and the National Center for Education Statistics.

Baltimore Mayor Jack Young (D) is once again demanding President Donald Trump scrap his planned visit to the city on Memorial Day, arguing that he believes the trip is against the law, citing the city’s stay-at-home order still being in place due to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. “We don’t need to be spending our resources for the president who’s coming here under our orders to stay at home. I think he’s violating the law,” Young said, according to CBS News Baltimore. The White House announced this week that President Trump and first lady Melania Trump will travel to Baltimore to visit the Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine. President Trump said in a statement: The City of Baltimore remains under a Stay at Home order that was put in place to help safeguard our residents from the dangers associated with COVID-19. We have worked closely with our health professionals to educate the public about the benefits of social distancing and staying home, unless leaving for an essential reason, like visiting a doctor or picking up groceries. On Thursday, Young first called on President Trump to cancel his trip, citing health concerns stemming from the pandemic and the price tag associated with a presidential visit. Young said, reported CBS Baltimore: I wish that the President, as our nation’s leader, would set a positive example and not travel during this holiday weekend. I would hope that the President would change his mind and decide to remain at home. If he decides, however, to move forward with his scheduled trip to Baltimore we will, of course, be prepared for his visit. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R), who has repeatedly criticized the Trump administration, said he will not meet with the president and instead plans to celebrate his birthday with his family. He said: We are honored that the President and the First Lady have chosen to spend  Memorial Day at Fort McHenry. Although Marylanders are encouraged not to gather in large numbers this year – now more than ever – it’s important to reflect on the American heroes who sacrificed their lives for our freedom. Monday is the governor’s birthday, and he has plans to mark the day at home with his family. Joining President Trump and first lady Melania Trump to visit Fort McHenry are Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Interior Secretary David Bernhardt.

Friday on Fox News Channel’s “The Daily Briefing,” network senior judicial analyst Andrew Napolitano said President Donald Trump’s declaring during the White House press briefing that he could “override” governors to reopen houses of worship was incorrect. Perino asked, “Does he have the power to do that?” Napolitano said, “In a word, no. As ill-advised as these gubernatorial orders are, as essential as is the right to worship, as fundamental as it is, as absolutely protected by the First Amendment as it is, the president does not have any authority to override the governors. I will tell you, but the president can do. He can’t dispatch the Department of Justice to file lawsuits in federal court, and judges can override the governors. But the president on his own —no matter well intended he may be, and I believe he’s well-intended here— is without authority to do that.” All right, but let me ask a question then because if it’s what the governors are doing is unconstitutional, what is the remedy then? Are you suggesting the church needs to bring a lawsuit against the governor or the DOJ to file against the State? Napolitano said, “One of the jobs of the DOJ is to keep the states at heel when they interfere with the fundamental liberties of people in their states. I have been begging the Department of Justice to sue Governor Murphy here in New Jersey, who has found the houses of worship are not essential. Here, the doors are locked, and you cannot go in for private prayer on your own, much less an organized prayer service or a Catholic mass. So that is one thing that the DOJ can do. Individuals, of course, can sue. Judges can interfere with governors when governors violate the state constitution or the federal constitution. But the president is without authority to exercise that interference on his own.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Dr. Deborah Birx on Friday at the White House expressed concerns that new coronavirus cases were reported in the Washington, DC, metro area and other cities like Los Angeles, and Chicago — even though the areas remained closed. “We still see these ongoing cases,” she said. She presented a chart showing there was not a dramatic decline in the Washington, DC area of new cases or emergency room visits with coronavirus-like illnesses. White House coronavirus chart for DC area “I’ve asked the CDC, and the CDC is working with the local areas in Chicago, and this area and L.A. to really understand where are these new cases are coming from and what do we need to do to prevent them in the future,” she said. Birx also questioned studies suggesting that the United States could have saved more lives if they had closed down states earlier. On March 14, she said, New York had less than 50 cases reported, Chicago had less than ten, Washington state had less than ten and Los Angeles had less than 20. She noted that Washington state had over 100 cases, but that there were only about 500 cases in the country nationwide. The White House Coronavirus Task Force announced the first 15-day shutdown recommendations on March 16th.

Tens of millions of children under 12 months are potentially at risk for diseases such as diphtheria and polio as the Chinese coronavirus pandemic interrupts routine vaccinations, according to data published by global public health experts on Friday. STAT News reports: Vaccine campaigns have been disrupted in at least 68 countries, according to data released by the World Health Organization, UNICEF, the Sabin Vaccine Institute, and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. The interruptions could affect 80 million children under 1 year old in those countries. The agencies said that the disruptions are occurring at a scale unseen since widespread immunization campaigns began in the 1970s. The countries reported at least moderate interruptions to the programs, with some countries suspending their programs completely. The organizations said 27 countries have postponed campaigns of vaccinations that protect against measles, while more than a dozen have paused some polio vaccination programs. Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organization (WHO), said in a statement: Immunization is one of the most powerful and fundamental disease prevention tools in the history of public health. Disruption to immunization programs from the Covid-19 pandemic threatens to unwind decades of progress against vaccine-preventable diseases like measles. Public health experts are urging immunization programs remain operational to both ensure children are protected against current illnesses and are ready to distribute coronavirus vaccines if they become readily available. Gavi CEO Seth Berkley said in a statement: More children in more countries are now protected against more vaccine-preventable diseases than at any point in history,” Gavi CEO Seth Berkley said in a statement. Due to Covid-19, this immense progress is now under threat, risking the resurgence of diseases like measles and polio. Not only will maintaining immunization programs prevent more outbreaks, it will also ensure we have the infrastructure we need to roll out an eventual Covid-19 vaccine on a global scale. Due to the pandemic, polio and measles vaccination campaigns have been heavily impacted, with the former having been halted in 27 countries. Conversely, polio campaigns have been halted in 38 nations. On Wednesday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) warned that administered vaccines have plummeted 63 percent for children in the Big Apple in the last year. Two new studies offer hope for an effective coronavirus vaccine — and for the notion that prior infection also confers immunity. Both studies were conducted on rhesus macaque monkeys, so testing on humans is required for more definitive proof. But in one study, monkeys developed immunity against the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus after receiving experimental vaccines. “Our findings increase optimism that the development of COVID-19 vaccines will be possible,” said lead researcher Dr. Dan Barouch. He directs the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. As part of the new research, macaques were given experimental coronavirus vaccines that expressed six different forms of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, a structure on the virus’ surface that it uses to bind with and invade human cells. The vaccines provide DNA that enables host cells to make the spike protein, so that they can then generate antibody responses to it. In this way, the immune system is trained to recognize coronavirus and quickly respond to it if it appears. The vaccines were given to 25 adult macaques in initial vaccinations and also in follow-up boost immunizations. Another ten monkeys got a sham vaccine. All of the macaques were infected with the new coronavirus six weeks after vaccination, and those that had received the real vaccines produced levels of antibodies in their blood that were high enough to neutralize the virus within two weeks. In fact, eight of the 25 vaccinated monkeys showed no detectable virus at any point following exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and the other vaccinated animals showed only low viral loads, the researchers reported in the March 20 issue of the journal Science. In all cases, as the production of immune system antibodies rose, viral load declined. That suggests that there’s a direct correlation between the two — an important factor to consider as vaccine development goes forward, the researchers said. In another important finding, a second study conducted by the same team found that monkeys who were infected with the new coronavirus developed immunity. In that research, nine adult macaques were infected with the virus, but then cleared it from their bodies when they were re-exposed to it 35 days later. All nine also had few or no symptoms after re-exposure and had immune responses that appeared to protect them against a second infection. Further research is needed to find out how long this natural immunity lasts, the study authors noted. The UPI contributed to this report. 

For those anxiously anticipating the beginning of college football, you got good news today. The Southeastern Conference approved voluntary on-campus workouts for student-athletes beginning on June 8th. The nation’s premier college football conference made the allowance with the guidance that the workouts be conducted “under strict supervision of designated university personnel and safety guidelines developed by each institution.” The decision comes on the heels of the NCAA’s decision earlier this week, to allow football and basketball players to return for voluntary workouts on June 1st. “This is an important first step toward having a season this fall, and we will continue to collectively work together as our top priority is to ensure the safety and well-being of our student-athletes, coaches and staff,” Auburn coach Gus Malzahn said. Texas Governor Greg Abbott, whose state is home to one SEC school, recently expressed optimism that the college football season would start on time, with at least some fans in attendance. “Our goal right now is to have college football season start as planned with fans in stands,” Abbott told KXAN. Athletic activities in the SEC have been suspended since March 12th.

A recent report claims that leading figures in the data science industry believe that the computer code developed by Professor Neil Ferguson, which convinced governments that lockdown was the best choice to prevent the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus, was “totally unreliable.” A recent report from the Telegraph alleges that experts have begun to question the computer code developed by Professor Neil Ferguson which largely influenced world governments to enter states of lockdown to prevent the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus. David Richards, the co-founder of the British data technology firm WANdisco, derided Ferguson’s data model of coronavirus infections as a “buggy mess that looks more like a bowl of angel hair pasta than a finely tuned piece of programming.” Richards added, “In our commercial reality, we would fire anyone for developing code like this and any business that relied on it to produce software for sale would likely go bust.” The Imperial College’s model placed the fatality rate higher than others and predicted that in the United Kingdom alone 510,000 people would die without a lockdown. This reportedly prompted a dramatic change in policy from the UK government which ichluded shutting down businesses, schools, and restaurants. The Telegraph writes: The Imperial model works by using code to simulate transport links, population size, social networks and healthcare provisions to predict how coronavirus would spread. However, questions have since emerged over whether the model is accurate, after researchers released the code behind it, which in its original form was “thousands of lines” developed over more than 13 years. In its initial form, developers claimed the code had been unreadable, with some parts looking “like they were machine translated from Fortran”, an old coding language, according to John Carmack, an American developer, who helped clean up the code before it was published online. Yet, the problems appear to go much deeper than messy coding. Many have claimed that it is almost impossible to reproduce the same results from the same data, using the same code. Scientists from the University of Edinburgh reported such an issue, saying they got different results when they used different machines, and even in some cases, when they used the same machines. Researchers from the University of Edinburgh commented on the Imperial College’s Github file: “There appears to be a bug in either the creation or re-use of the network file. If we attempt two completely identical runs, only varying in that the second should use the network file produced by the first, the results are quite different.” A fix to this bug was later provided but appeared to be one of a number of bugs within the system. The developers claim that the model is “stochastic”, and that “multiple runs with different seeds should be undertaken to see average behaviour.” But some specialists have argued that “models must be capable of passing the basic scientific test of producing the same results given the same initial set of parameters…otherwise, there is simply no way of knowing whether they will be reliable.” Michael Bonsall, Professor of Mathematical Biology at Oxford University, commented that: “We’d be up in arms if weather forecasting was based on a single set of results from a single model and missed taking that umbrella when it rained.” Konstantin Boudnik, vice-president of architecture at WANdisco, also stated that Ferguson’s previous models which incorrectly predicted up to 136,000 deaths from mad cow disease, 200 million from bird flu, and 65,000 from swine flu, do not inspire confidence. “The facts from the early 2000s are just yet another confirmation that their modeling approach was flawed to the core,” says Dr. Boudnik. “We don’t know for sure if the same model/code was used, but we clearly see their methodology wasn’t rigourous then and surely hasn’t improved now.” A spokesperson to the Imperial College COVID19 Response Team stated: The UK Government has never relied on a single disease model to inform decision-making. As has been repeatedly stated, decision-making around lockdown was based on a consensus view of the scientific evidence, including several modelling studies by different academic groups. Multiple groups using different models concluded that the pandemic would overwhelm the NHS and cause unacceptably high mortality in the absence of extreme social distancing measures. Within the Imperial research team we use several models of differing levels of complexity, all of which produce consistent results. We are working with a number of legitimate academic groups and technology companies to develop, test and further document the simulation code referred to. However, we reject the partisan reviews of a few clearly ideologically motivated  commentators. Epidemiology is not a branch of computer science and the conclusions  around lockdown rely not on any mathematical model but on the scientific consensus that COVID-19 is a highly transmissible virus with an infection fatality ratio exceeding 0.5pc in the UK.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated during a recent livestream that employees considering leaving Silicon Valley for areas with cheaper cost-of-living could be subject to pay cuts. Many Facebook employees are working from home during the Chinese virus pandemic and questioning the need to live in the extremely costly San Francisco Bay area. During a recent livestream, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated that as Facebook plans to “aggressively” ramp up its hiring of remote workers, those that choose to live outside of the Silicon Valley area may be subject to pay cuts, CNBC reports. Zuckerberg stated that he predicts that 50 percent of Facebook’s employees could be working remotely within the next five to 10 years, stating: “We’re going to be the most forward-leaning company on remote work at our scale.” Facebook plans to allow certain employees to work remotely full time, but those that move to a different location will have to notify the company by January 1, 2021. Employees that have moved outside the Silicon Valley area could have their salaries cut based on their new locations, according to Zuckerberg. “We’ll adjust salary to your location at that point,” the CEO said noting that this is necessary for tax and accounting reasons. “There’ll be severe ramifications for people who are not honest about this.” Zuckerberg stated on his weekly employee livestream that he believes that this decision will help the company improve its employee retention and allow the firm to hire from talent pools that previously could not move to big cities to work with the firm. “When you limit hiring to people who either live in a small number of big cities or are willing to move there, that cuts out a lot of people who live in different communities, different backgrounds or may have different perspectives,” Zuckerberg said. Zuckerberg stated that 95 percent of Facebook’s employees were now working remotely, according to a survey of staff 50 percent of the employees stated that they were as productive working from home as they were at the office. 40% of employees said they were extremely, very, or somewhat interested in full-time remote work according to the survey, and among that subset of employees 75 percent stated that they were considering they might move to a different city if they could work remotely. Zuckerberg added: “It’s somewhat of an unfortunate and unsustainable setup for people to have a lot of these jobs they have to move to a small number of big cities.” Facebook will reportedly allow existing employees to request permanent remote work if they meet a specific criteria. Zuckerberg’s announcement comes shortly after Facebook unveiled new features for the company’s enterprise communication software, Workplace. Workplace has grown its base from 3 million users in October to 5 million now amidst the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic. Facebook share prices rose by nearly 1 percent following Zuckerberg’s announcement. Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

ATLANTA, Georgia — Vice President Mike Pence defended Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp against establishment media and leftist critics who just weeks ago inaccurately predicted widescale doom as Georgia moved to aggressively reopen its economy ahead of schedule. “Let’s be clear: Gov. Brian Kemp has proven them wrong every day,” Pence said when Breitbart News asked him and Kemp during a press gaggle to respond to critics throughout the media and left who ripped Kemp at the outset of the reopening process. “The people of Georgia have proven them wrong every day.” The vice president’s praise of Kemp’s handling of the coronavirus crisis comes just weeks after Georgia in late April moved to aggressively reopen its economy—and the state faced a bevy of criticism from establishment media outlets and leftists. “Georgia’s Experiment in Human Sacrifice,” was a headline, for instance, in the Atlantic for a piece by Amanda Mull. Others in media and on the left were similarly vicious to Kemp. Now, though, the data demonstrates that Kemp was right and they were wrong. A month into Georgia’s reopening process, the first and most aggressive anywhere in America, cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are all on the decline. Georgia continues its reopening process, and providing hope to other states across the country following its lead. While Pence was much more direct in noting that the establishment critics of Kemp were wrong, Kemp brushed them off and said to Breitbart News that he is not interested in battling with media critics—he is more focused on winning the war with the coronavirus and energizing his state’s economy. “I’ll just say the way I’ve been dealing with that is I’m not criticizing anybody,” Kemp said. “There’s no playbook on this. We’ve all been in this together. Everybody has had to make tough decisions, whether it’s at the federal level or local level or certainly at the state level. I think everybody has the lives of their citizens and constituents [in mind], and they’re concerned about them when they make those decisions. I haven’t been too worried about criticizing the press too much either. I just want to keep driving our numbers down and keep making sure we give people an opportunity to get back to work and save this great economy that we have.” Pence’s trip to Georgia began with a lunch visit the Star Cafe in Atlanta with Gov. Kemp and Georgia’s first lady Marty Kemp. Later in the day, he visited Waffle House corporate headquarters in Norcross for a roundtable with Kemp and Waffle House’s CEO. The vice president’s trip comes during a broader effort by the White House to reopen America, one that President Donald Trump and Pence have been cheerleading across the country. Trump was in Michigan on Thursday to pressure Democrat Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to move faster, and Pence was in Florida on Wednesday to cheer on GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis and enjoy a burger with him.

Pence told the press as they left. pic.twitter.com/4tavNhmdJb — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) May 22, 2020  .@VP Pence, appearing alongside @GovKemp, at the reopened Star Cafe in Atlanta: “Georgia is leading the way.” Breitbart's @mboyle1 is on the ground in Georgia. pic.twitter.com/SNbtbDS9fA — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) May 22, 2020  Later, during the Waffle House roundtable, Pence noted that case numbers and hospitalizations continue dropping in Georgia even as testing increases–a remarkable feat, he said, since one would think that increasing testing would lead to a spike in cases. In the press gaggle inside Star Cafe, Pence told Breitbart News that all 50 states are reopening now. Pence also said that America does not face a choice between the economy or the public health—he said it is a choice between “health and health.” “I was just in Florida a few short days ago where I heard tell of the level of criticism that had been waged there against the efforts of Florida to safely and responsibly reopen,” Pence said. “I’ve been working with governors in both political parties every day since the president tapped me to lead the White House Coronavirus Task Force. There is not a governor in a state or territory in this country that hasn’t done everything in their power to put the health and well-being of their people first. What governors recognize and what President Trump and I recognize is this is not a choice between health and a growing economy. This is a choice between health and health. There are very serious health consequences to having our economy continue to be closed. I think the American people understand that.” “We asked people during the most difficult days of the coronavirus pandemic to avoid elective surgery, but the better part of a month ago we saw hospitalizations dropping around the country, so we encouraged states to open up elective surgery again.” Pence continued. “I want to take this time to tell everyone in Georgia: Now is the time to go back to your local hospital and have that procedure and have that routine checkup to support your health and to support your local healthcare community. The truth is when people forgo routine checkups, there are health risks with that. When people go a long time without work, there are profound emotional and physical impacts of that. That’s what Gov. Kemp has recognized and the people of Georgia have recognized and other governors around the country like the governor of Florida are doing.” “All 50 states today are now in some measure of reopening their economies, ” he said. “They’re demonstrating we can do it safely and responsibly. But what some of the critics have to recognize is it’s not a choice between health and a strong economy. It’s between health and health, and the president and I and the governor here are determined to move forward and safely and responsibly reopen. That’s because that is the best way for a safe and strong America.” Kemp, during his comments in response to Breitbart News during the press gaggle, said that he has been focused on making scientifically sound decisions—and his push to reopen, which has happened as the coronavirus has receded here, proves that. “If you think back a few months ago, it’s the best economy we’ve ever seen. I’ve been a small business guy for 30 years,” Kemp said. “I’ve been through ups and downs and I’ve had weeks where I didn’t know if I was going to be able to make payroll. Marty and I were scratching every penny we could get to get our people paid. We were at that point in Georgia and I knew that—and the president and the vice president said to us that we can’t let the ill effects of the virus be worse than the virus itself. We’re fighting two battles—the COVID battle but also the battle to get this economy back to where it was when we started. That’s what I’ve been focused on—I’m not too worried about critics that are out there. I’m making decisions based on science and public health advice—every decision I’ve made with [Georgia Health Commissioner] Dr. [Kathleen] Toomey has been in conjunction with that and I just appreciate the support and the help of the administration, as we’ve been on this battle for months now.”

The City of San Francisco opened its first officially-sanctioned homeless camp this week, located outside City Hall. The camp, called “Safe Sleeping Village,” includes 80 tents, set up inside rectangles marked in white paint on asphalt, and “provides meals, showers, clean water and trash pickup” to camp residents, according to the Associated Press. San Francisco has opened its first sanctioned camp for homeless people, in a parking lot right outside its city hall. The camp, called "Safe Sleeping Village," has designated areas marked out for tents to maintain social-distancing. pic.twitter.com/9id3Zjilhn — CBS News (@CBSNews) May 22, 2020  SFGate.com reports that the camp opened May 13 for “individuals who were already established in the City Hall area” In addition, “Occupants must sign a community guidelines agreement and are expected to meet certain expectations around conduct. Only occupants can enter the site through entrances that are monitored by officials 24 hours a day.” Other official homeless camps are to be opened later, to address the problem of crowded informal camps on city streets. The coronavirus gave new impetus to San Francisco’s experiment with homeless tent cities. As Breitbart News noted in March, both San Francisco and Los Angeles originally planned to move as many homeless people indoors as possible to prevent the spread of the virus in homeless encampments. However, experts soon learned that the virus spread more easily indoors than outdoors, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advised against moving the homeless indoors. San Francisco reversed course and encouraged homeless people to stay in tents during the outbreak. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Dr. Ben Carson recently told Breitbart News Daily that homeless tent cities that are set up on public land, and that provide medical services, might be the best way to address the problem.

Housing and Urban Development Secretary Dr. Ben Carson reacted Friday to the report of a New York State directive which sent over 4,300 recovering coronavirus to nursing homes within the state as a means to free up space in the hospitals. Carson acknowledged on Fox News Channel’s “America’s Newsroom” that the decision to mingle coronavirus patients with the elderly “was clearly a mistake,” and said even if the move was following CDC guidelines, people need to use “a bit of logic” before making such decisions. “It was clearly a mistake to be sending these people to the nursing homes without having done the necessary preparation in the nursing homes, teaching the staff in the nursing homes, providing the PPE in the nursing homes. That’s been done now, and as you can see, it’s dramatically made a difference. Whether there were appropriate guidelines in place before by the state, we can argue about that all day and all night, but we can use a little bit of logic here. Obviously, we don’t want to take people who have an infectious disease and concentrate them in a place that doesn’t appear to receive them.” Carson responded to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) saying he was merely following President Donald Trump’s CDC guidance and that nursing homes cannot discriminate against a coronavirus patient. “That’s a ridiculous argument,” Carson stated. He added, “Obviously, you want to accept people if you have provisions and have taken the appropriate safeguards, but you just can’t say, ‘OK, let’s bring somebody with tuberculosis in here because we are not supposed to discriminate against them’ without having prepared for that. That makes absolutely no sense whatsoever to a Republican, a Democrat or anybody with a brain.” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent

Appearing Friday on CNBC’s Halftime Report, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said keeping the United States shut down for too long could bring “irreparable damage” to the country.  A partial transcript is as follows: SCOTT WAPNER: There’s a growing debate in this country about the pace and progress of reopening and I’d like to read you today a tweet from the former CEO Goldman Sachs Lloyd Blankfein and get your reaction to it, if I could: “Hospitals are not overwhelmed. Most of us will be exposed anyway since we can’t sequester until there’s a vaccine, and we know which groups need protection from worst outcomes. Is the public health benefit from broad lockdowns at this point worth such extreme damage to livelihoods?” There are also people who argue for herd immunity. How do you address what Mr. Blankfein is saying today and what others have said in the past days, that’s it’s just time to open this country up and protect the most vulnerable. DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: A) We have no disagreement. We must protect the most vulnerable. And B) Yes, depending upon the dynamics of the infection in the particular state, city, region, county that you’re in we certainly want to in a cautious way, reopening. We can’t stay locked down for such a considerable period of time that you might to irreparable damage and have unintended consequences, including consequences for health. And it’s for that reason that guidelines are being put forth, so that the states and the cities can start reenter and to report.

President Donald Trump announced Friday at a surprise briefing at the White House new detailed federal guidelines allowing churches to reopen during the coronavirus pandemic. “Today, I am identifying houses of worship, churches, synagogues, and mosques as essential places that provide essential services,” Trump said, announcing the release of new Centers for Disease Control guidelines. “Some governors have deemed liquor stores and abortion clinics as essential but have left out churches and other houses of worship,” Trump said. “That’s not right.” Trump said he wants every governor to reopen all churches “right now.” “If there’s any questions, they’re going to have to call me, but they will not be successful in that call,” Trump said. The president made a brief announcement about churches and left the podium as Dr. Deborah Birx detailed information about the fight against the coronavirus. Earlier in the week, reports noted that the White House disputed guidelines from the Centers for Disease Controls as too strict, withholding official federal guidance for a few days. Since then, Trump has repeatedly called for governors to allow churches to reopen. “The churches are not being treated with respect by a lot of the Democrat governors,” Trump commented to reporters as he left the White House for a trip to Michigan on Thursday afternoon. “I want to get our churches open, and we’re going to take a very strong position on that very soon.” The president confirmed that the new guidelines would apply to churches, synagogues, and mosques. Despite many churches holding services online, President Trump remarked Thursday that it was not the same as attending in person. “It’s wonderful to sit home and watch something on a laptop, but it can never be the same as being in a church and being with your friends,” Trump said during an event with black leaders on Friday.

Coronavirus shutdowns around the country have succeeded in showing that numerous Democrat governors do not view the Second Amendment as essential. Shutdown orders all contain a list of businesses that are listed as “essential,” and therefore exempt from closure. But the Democrat governors of California, New Jersey, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and New York, did not list gun stores as essential. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D) did pivot, and listed gun stores as “life-sustaining” businesses after the Second Amendment Foundation filed suit, because Wolf’s initial order–issued March 21, 2020–required the stores to close down, Breitbart News reported. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D) reopened gun stores on March 30, two days after the Trump administration’s March 28 announcement listing them as “essential.” But Breitbart News reported that prior to ceding to the Trump administration’s pro-Second Amendment announcement, Murphy laughed in a citizen’s face when the citizen expressed concern over not being to purchase guns for self-defense. Meanwhile, a gun store that is over a century old is closing up shop for good in New York. The owner said they cannot pay rent without customers, and they cannot have customers when they are shut down by Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s (D) order. In New Mexico, Gov. Michelle Lujan-Grisham (D) deflected from her refusal to count gun stores as “essential” by suggesting New Mexicans could just buy guns online if they needed them. The NRA was quick to note that other gun controls signed by Lujan-Grisham mean New Mexicans cannot buy a gun from any source if their local stores are closed. The story is the same story in California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) did not list gun stores as “essential.” The Mercury News reported that Newsom took a slightly different approach than his Democrat colleagues in other states, insomuch as he left the decision to open or close gun stores to the various sheriffs in counties around the state. Therefore, while he did not mandate closure, he simultaneously did not label gun stores “essential.” Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) emerged as an exception to the Democrat view of gun stores as non-essential. On March 21, 2020, Breitbart News reported that his shutdown order listed gun stores as “essential.” AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

The number of new coronavirus cases per day in New York State is down, bringing the Empire State to a level “lower than when we first began,” Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) announced on Friday. “News is good today. Hospitalizations are down. Net change in hospitalizations is down. Number of new cases per day is down,” Cuomo announced. “This is a level now that is lower than when we first began, so that’s good”: JUST IN: New COVID-19 cases in New York State are lowest since start of outbreak, Gov. Andrew Cuomo says. "This is a level now that is lower than when we first began." https://t.co/aCG7eIdIbL pic.twitter.com/PblSyOiJQX — ABC News (@ABC) May 22, 2020  While the number of fatalities are “painfully high” at any number, that number has also been descending, Cuomo stated. There were 109 reported deaths on Thursday, nearly one-third of which occurred in nursing homes: "You see that this number has been stubborn on its way down," New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo says as 109 more people in the state have died from COVID-19. https://t.co/aCG7eIdIbL pic.twitter.com/fpNy1gvrMP — ABC News (@ABC) May 22, 2020  Cuomo emphasized the importance of reopening the state in a “smart” way and said it must be phased by metrics — testing, tracing, isolations, and sufficient hostile capacity. “So all your actions are based on data,” he said, announcing that the Long Island and Mid-Hudson regions will be permitted to reopen if deaths continue to decrease. Cuomo’s reports coincide with other states and hospital systems, which have reported declines in hospitalizations and cases. Pennsylvania’s Lehigh Valley Health Network (LVHN) announced this week, for example, that it has experienced a “steep decline” in patients hospitalized with the coronavirus: Look at that steep decline in the number of COVID-19 patients in LVHN hospitals! It’s even better than predicted. Proof… Posted by Lehigh Valley Health Network on Wednesday, May 20, 2020 New York State reported 361,313 cases and 28,663 deaths as of Friday morning.

A new study suggests that 20 percent of university students may not return to college for the fall semester. Some analysts believe that the ongoing Chinese virus pandemic has drastically shifted American attitudes towards higher education. According to a report by Axios, the coronavirus pandemic may reduce fall enrollment at American universities and colleges by as much as 20 percent. Universities and colleges around the nation have been forced to lay off employees to make up for budgetary shortfalls caused by the pandemic. Ted Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education, told Axios this week that colleges typically lose 10 percent of their enrollment each year. Mitchell claims that universities and colleges should view the additional 10 percent loss as a positive sign for future recovery. “Let’s look at it the other way around: About 80% of students say they plan on enrolling in the fall. They’re planning on enrolling in the same institution and continuing with their education. I think that students get it. Families get it,” Mitchell said. Mitchell argues that universities and colleges need to rapidly adapt their offerings to meet the evolving needs of students. Mitchell suggested that higher education needs to focus on giving students the skills necessary to succeed in the labor market. It’s going to be an important moment for a range of institutions, some of whom will need to find good partners to be able to provide the robust online learning that, Kim, you and I are talking about now. Other institutions are going to be more creative about expanding who they think of as their students. A majority of college students today are not 18-22-year-olds. Colleges need to cater more to the lifelong learner, the adult learner. And certainly in this economy, individuals who need to train and resell for the next generation of jobs. Breitbart News reported this week that Michigan’s public universities face $1 billion in combined losses due to the Chinese virus pandemic. Stay tuned to Breitbart News for more updates on this story.

TOKYO (AP) — Uncertainty grips next year’s postponed Tokyo Olympics: Will there be fans or empty stadiums in 14 months? And how will thousands of athletes, staff, and technical officials travel, be housed, and stay safe amid COVID-19? And Tokyo is not alone. China — where the COVID-19 outbreak was first detected — will hold three mega-sports events within a year after Tokyo is set to close. The World University Games in Chengdu in western China open 10 days after the Tokyo Games close, with up to 8,000 athletes. Next come the Beijing Winter Olympics beginning on Feb. 4, 2022, and the Asian Games in Hangzhou starting on Sept. 10. The previous edition of the Asian Games in Indonesia drew 11,000 athletes and featured more sports than the Olympics. A fourth major event, soccer’s 24-team Club World Championship, was to open in China in June of 2021, but has been postponed because of scheduling conflicts created by the pandemic. China is a go-to country for these mega events, through expertise gained from the 2008 Beijing Olympics and because it absorbs the massive costs. It spent at least $40 billion to organize the 2008 Olympics, and there was no national debate since the authoritarian state prohibits voting or referendums. Voters in Europe and North America have repeatedly said “no” to referendums to hold the games. China landed the 2022 Winter Olympics when several European bidders withdrew. Beijing won narrowly in a vote by the IOC against Almaty, Kazakhstan. “Telling the citizens of Bavaria or Switzerland that another Winter Olympics would benefit them greatly doesn’t work,” Jonathan Grix, who studies sports policy at Manchester Metropolitan University, wrote in an email. He said voters sense that “citizens rarely benefit the most from such events.” “Authoritarian states have no need to ask the populace, they have no need to compromise on policy, there is no political opposition (by definition) and most delivery services are state-run, ensuring the smooth running of the event,“ Grix added. Japanese and International Olympic Committee officials have given few details about how the Tokyo Olympics will be staged, the cost of postponement, and who will pay for it. They’ve teased the problems and floated tenuous solutions. They’ve agreed on one thing: If the games can’t open on July 23, 2021, they’ll be canceled. In a joint news conference last weekend, the director general of the World Health Organization cautioned it would not be “easy” to make the Olympics a safe global gathering spot. But Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus expressed confidence: “I think it’s possible,”
IOC President Thomas Bach has been cautious in speculating how the Olympics can be held. He’s suggested a possible quarantine for athletes, hinted at limited fan access to venues, and has not ruled out events in empty stadiums. Of course, he says that’s not his preference. IOC member John Coates, who oversees preparations for Tokyo, has been direct. “We’ve got real problems because we’ve got athletes having to come from 206 different nations,” Coates said, speaking at a News Corp Australia digital forum and reported in The Australian newspaper. “We’ve got 11,000 athletes coming, 5,000 technical officials and coaches, 20,000 media.” There’s also about 4,000 working on the organizing committee and an expected 60,000 volunteers.” Some scientists in Japan and elsewhere believe a vaccine is needed to guarantee safety for athletes. But some have asked if young, healthy athletes should be a priority for vaccination. The biggest challenge might be guaranteeing the safety of fans who have already bought millions of tickets. If there are no fans, will there be refunds? Will there be lawsuits? Tickets provide at least $800 million income for local organizers with the added cost of postponement estimated in Japan at $2 billion to $6 billion. Eric Saintrond, the CEO of the FISU — the Switzerland-based governing body of the World University Games — said in an email to The Associated Press that decisions related to “security and health will be taken” by the Chinese government. He said final decisions in this area do “not in fact rest with FISU.” He said all preparations were “on track.” University Games spokesman Wang Guangliang was asked about housing for athletes, fans, and so forth, but offered little clarity, deflecting back to the FISU. “The impact of the pandemic is still unforeseeable and we are still studying the situation and need to discuss with FISU about what to do to reduce the impact and ensure the safety of all participants,” Wang wrote in a email to the AP. Postponing the Summer Olympics by a year has raised questions about marketing the Winter Olympics, which open six months after Tokyo closes. Construction is on schedule, but sponsors may face challenges. “Sponsors and business partners of the games will have to keep investing extra money in their marketing programs for Tokyo if the games are postponed, potentially forcing them to reduce their budgets for the next Olympics,” Wei Jizhong, a former secretary general of the Chinese Olympic Committee, told the China Daily. The Associated Press emailed questions about Beijing 2022 preparations to Juan Antonio Samaranch, the IOC vice president who oversees Beijing preparations. He did not immediately reply to the request, nor to a follow-up. Beijing could also face the issues of athlete quarantines, fewer fans, and the fear of spreading the virus even more. In an interview in February with China’s official Xinhua News Agency, Samaranch was laudatory about preparations. He praised Beijing organizers, President Xi Jinping, who heads of the Chinese Communist Party, and China’s handling of the virus. Sheena Greitens, who studies Asian politics at the University of Texas at Austin, said large sports events give China high visibility and “can keep reporters focused on the sporting events rather than having them use their time in-country to dig around on other topics that might reflect poorly on the CCP (Chinese Communist Party).”
“They provide a way for China to boost its cultural and ‘discourse power’ globally,” Greitens wrote in an email. “And they do so in a forum that generally emphasizes international cooperation and is weighted away from the serious disagreements that many countries have with China over territorial conflict, human rights, and trade, among other topics.”

The spread of the Chinese coronavirus in war-torn Yemen “has in effect collapsed” the country’s healthcare system, the United Nations warned on Friday, appealing for urgent humanitarian funding. The spokesman for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), Jens Laerke, told a briefing in Geneva on Friday that health workers were being forced to turn people away for treatment, due to lack of medical supplies and personal protective equipment. “Aid agencies in Yemen are operating on the basis that community transmission is taking place across the country,” he said. “We hear from many of them that Yemen is really on the brink right now. The situation is extremely alarming, they are talking about that the health system has in effect collapsed.” On Thursday, a flight carrying international aid workers landed in the city of Aden, yet the country still remains desperately short of the number needed to properly manage the situation, which experts believe is far worse than being reported. Laerke warned that various essential aid programs, including ones set up for an effective coronavirus response, may have to be cut off in the coming weeks because of funding shortages. The U.N. will consequently host a virtual fundraising conference with Saudi Arabia on June 2nd. “It is very, very critical that the international community steps up now and at the pledging conference on the 2nd of June because we are heading towards a fiscal cliff,” he explained. “If we do not get the money coming in, the programs that are keeping people alive, are very much essential to fighting back against COVID, will have to close.” “And then the world will have to witness in a country what happens without a functioning health system battling COVID,” he continued. “I do not think the world wants to see that.”  Yemen has officially recorded 184 cases and 30 deaths as of Friday, but the medical charity Doctors Without Borders revealed this week that these figures are incorrect and that at least 68 have died from the virus at its Aden facility in the first half of May alone. Laerke asserted that the U.N. was “working on the assumption that there is already widespread communal transmission going on,” while its population is also at risk from other major diseases including a cholera outbreak estimated to have infected over two million people. Yemen’s healthcare system has been on the brink of collapse for several years now amid a lengthy civil war that has forced millions of people to flee their homes as refugees. The war between Saudi-backed government forces and the Iran-backed Huthis began in March 2015, when a Saudi-led military coalition intervened against insurgents began taking over the country. The war has left tens of thousands of Yemenis dead, the majority of them civilians, and the U.N. estimates around 24 million people, around 80 percent of the population, are dependent on some form of humanitarian aid.

LAS VEGAS (AP) — Add boxing to the list of sports on the comeback trail. Promoter Bob Arum said Thursday he plans to stage a card of five fights on June 9 at the MGM Grand, the first of a series of fights over the next two months at the Las Vegas hotel. A second fight card will be held two nights later, with ESPN televising both cards, kicking off twice weekly shows at the hotel in June and July. No fans will be allowed, and Arum said fighters and everyone else will be tested at least twice during fight week for the new coronavirus. The fights are pending approval of the Nevada Athletic Commission, which meets next week to consider the events, along with two cards that the UFC plans to stage at its facility in Las Vegas. They are also pending the reopening of the MGM and other Las Vegas hotels, something that is widely expected to happen the first week of June, though no dates for a second phase of easing virus restrictions have been announced by Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak. “Once we get those fights in and UFC gets its initial fights in, both of us will ask for additional dates,” Arum told The Associated Press. “The key was getting enough testing, and we’ve got plenty of testing in Nevada to hold our events.” In addition to Arum’s fights, British promoter Eddie Hearn said this week he plans to hold fights beginning sometime in July from the backyard garden of the family mansion outside London where he was raised. Hearn told The Athletic that the first fight card is tentatively set for July 15. Golden Boy promoter Oscar De La Hoya has also talked about returning with a July 4 card, though he has offered no details. UFC returned to action earlier this month with cards in Florida, including a pay-per-view event, that took place without fans. Arum declined to say who would be fighting on June 9, saying ESPN wanted to make the announcement after the fights are approved. But he said the cards would feature the same quality of fighters who were on ESPN before the shutdown of sports around the world. The cards would be expanded to three-hour shows, Arum said, and feature a main event, a co-main and three supporting fights. “These will be the same guys we were going to have before to the extent possible,” he said. “Guys like (Olympic medalist) Shakur Stevenson and others who would have been fighting on our cards.” Stevenson was set to headline a Top Rank card in March at Madison Square Garden when it was called off at the last minute because of the pandemic. Another Top Rank fighter, Ireland’s Michael Conlan, was to fight in New York on St. Patrick’s Day, but Arum said Conlan won’t be on the upcoming cards because he’s unable to travel from Ireland. Arum said fighters and cornermen will be tested when they arrive in Las Vegas the week of the fight and will be housed on a “bubble” floor at the MGM Grand. They will be allowed out only to eat at an approved restaurant in the hotel or to train at the Top Rank gym. Fighters will also be tested the night before they fight. The double tests should eliminate the issue the UFC had when a fighter tested positive and was removed from the UFC 249 card, Arum said.
“Our protocols will be much more stringent than UFC had in Florida,” Arum said. “In ours you wouldn’t have a fighter testing positive the day of the fight or the day before.” Arum credited Jim Murren, the former MGM CEO who leads a state task force dealing with the virus, with making sure there are enough tests available for fighters, judges, commissioners and anyone else involved on site. He said 60-70 people may be tested on fight day alone, using tests that can give results in a couple hours. While pre-pandemic fights were held in the 16,000-seat MGM Grand Garden, Arum said the fights will be held in a convention area or ballroom at the hotel. There will be no media allowed, at least at the beginning, he said, because of the logistical difficulty of testing more people. Arum’s Top Rank has a long-term deal with ESPN for fights that before the pandemic hit were on the main network and streaming service ESPN+. The network also combined with Fox to televise the pay-per-view of the Tyson Fury-Deontay Wilder heavyweight title card in February that was Top Rank’s last card. Arum said he talked to Fury on Thursday and that plans are underway to hold the rematch — probably somewhere outside the U.S. — late this year. He said there are also still plans for a highly anticipated lightweight title unification fight between Vasiliy Lomachenko and Teofimo Lopez by the end of the year.

The Hong Kong stock market was rocked by a massive sell-off on Friday after the Chinese Communist government in Beijing declared its intention to bypass the Hong Kong legislature and impose a draconian security law to shut down the protest movement. That single act effectively ended the island’s limited autonomy in the eyes of many residents and concerned international observers. AFP reported on Friday that real estate and financial stocks were among the hardest hit as “investors fled for the hills with many worried about Beijing’s increasing influence in the semi-autonomous finance hub and what that could mean for doing business there.” “Markets are now worried that the city’s freedoms – unseen on the mainland and protected by an agreement made before Britain handed the territory back in 1997 – could be curtailed,” AFP added. In this respect, Beijing’s proposed security laws are even worse than the notorious extradition law that sparked the Hong Kong protest movement in 2019. The extradition law made both Hong Kongers and foreign investors worry about the island’s autonomy dissolving, which would jeopardize special trading relationships established on the basis of Hong Kong’s unique position as the tolerably free, attractively appointed lobby for the grim factory of totalitarian oppression that is China.  There were also fears that the extradition law would make it easy for China to judicially kidnap foreigners by trumping up charges in China’s opaque, heavily politicized courts and using extradition to drag the victims away from Hong Kong. Both of these concerns are greatly exacerbated by the security law proposal, so foreign investors are swiftly growing nervous about sending either their money or their personnel to Hong Kong, resulting in six to nine percent drops in key property and financial stocks, while the Hang Seng index fell by four percent overall on Friday morning. The Hong Kong dollar also dropped as a result of nervous sell-offs. The silver lining in this dark financial cloud is that China has not revealed the full details of its security law or effectively imposed it through the rubber-stamp legislature in Beijing yet, and urgent international efforts are underway to persuade Beijing to back down. “Traders around the world are playing the waiting game to see details of the new Hong Kong law to gauge how severe the terms are. And more specifically, the White House response to decide whether Hong Kong’s special economic status will be affected,” Stephen Innes of AxiCorp told AFP. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday condemned China’s plan to “unilaterally and arbitrarily impose national security legislation on Hong Kong” and said China’s next move could significantly impact American policy toward Hong Kong. “Hong Kong has flourished as a bastion of liberty. The United States strongly urges Beijing to reconsider its disastrous proposal, abide by its international obligations, and respect Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy, democratic institutions, and civil liberties, which are key to preserving its special status under U.S. law,” Pompeo explained.   “Any decision impinging on Hong Kong’s autonomy and freedoms as guaranteed under the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law would inevitably impact our assessment of One Country, Two Systems and the status of the territory,” he warned. MarketWatch saw the financial shock waves from Hong Kong hitting London on Friday, slamming U.K. stocks with heavy Hong Kong exposure hard enough to produce losses as high as eight percent.  “Investors were also asking how the national security law in Hong Kong would affect U.S./China relations. The actions will stoke fears of another wave of protests in the country and cause unwanted disruption at a time when the region is trying to get back on its feet after the coronavirus crisis,” warned AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould. CNN suggested China is calculating that its deadly coronavirus pandemic may have left the international community in general, and the UK in particular, too weak to resist the Hong Kong power grab. In CNN’s view, the UK is especially unlikely to pick a massive fight over Hong Kong because it is “dependent on trade with China to boost its flagging economy” now that it no longer belongs to the European Union. CNN warned the security law “could end Hong Kong as we know it,” not only because the increased Chinese intelligence presence on the island will scare off foreign businesses, but because Hong Kong’s legal stability will be shattered by the brute-force implementation of Chinese Communist control: “Implementation of the law in Hong Kong could also prove to be a nightmare for the city’s courts — which operate separately to the Chinese legal system and free of the political pressures put on mainland judges. This does not mean the law is at much risk of being overturned, however. The NPC is the court of final appeal in Hong Kong and can issue an “interpretation” of any constitutional issue, essentially rewriting the Basic Law on the fly. But the confusion and uncertainty the new rules may create, and a potential prolonged fight in the courts, could pose a major blow to the city’s reputation for upholding the rule of law, which has long been seen as vital for Hong Kong’s position as an international finance and business hub. The South China Morning Post on Thursday predicted turbulence in the Hong Kong markets because the U.S. Congress was already mulling several regulatory actions that would damage Chinese tech companies. Analysts quoted in the piece suggested China could be planning to herd its tech giants away from foreign stock markets and back to a more tightly controlled Hong Kong, whose exchange would become a Chinese alternative to Nasdaq. CNBC noted that major changes were made to Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index this week that make it more welcoming to big Chinese companies like Alibaba while also allowing them to remain listed in the U.S. stock market. This would have the effect of slipping billions of index fund dollars into those Chinese companies, as their stocks began appearing in more investment portfolios, possibly offsetting some of the financial damage from Hong Kong losing its special trade status.

Based on new facts, I have no choice but to officially retract my earlier statement that Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-NY) should not be held responsible for any coronavirus deaths. Unfortunately, Cuomo is directly responsible for a number of coronavirus deaths. Possibly thousands. My earlier assumption was based on a sound premise: there’s nothing we can do about plagues. Like floods, tornadoes, and other natural disasters, this is the price we pay to live in the natural world. To blame a politician, or anyone, for a single death caused by a virus is obscene. Further, in the event of a plague, all we can expect from our government is to avoid triage. The government’s responsibility is to save as many lives as possible, and our government — at the local, state, and federal levels — met this responsibility admirably. Incredibly, no one in this country died due to a lack of medical care or lack of a ventilator. Everyone who could be saved was saved. What more can any reasonable person ask? Well, in the case of Andrew Cuomo, we could have asked that he not pour plague into New York’s nursing homes and assisted living centers, that he not mandate these facilities accept discharged hospital patients recovering from, and, therefore, still infectious with the coronavirus. Weeks before — literally, weeks before — the coronavirus hit New York, we knew the virus was a unique threat to the elderly. In fact, a full six weeks before Cuomo shut down New York on March 20, warnings were being posted to take special care to protect nursing homes. So Cuomo had to have known the coronavirus ravaged the elderly, not just disproportionately, but disproportionately by incredibly high and, therefore, impossible-to-ignore numbers. But Cuomo not only ignored those numbers; he went so far as to require — require — that coronavirus patients who were recovered enough to be discharged from a hospital, but still infectious, be accepted into nursing homes. According to NBC News, Cuomo authorized a “state mandate requiring nursing homes to accept those recovering from COVID-19, even if they still might be contagious.” The predictable results were catastrophic, a mini pandemic within facilities that are nothing close to equipped to handle a pandemic, which has so far resulted in 5,300 mostly unnecessary deaths. How was this devastating outcome not predictable? Well, of course, it was predictable, which is why one of the first things Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) did — we’re talking as early as March 15 — was to prohibit the return of the coronavirus hospital patients to nursing homes until they were no longer infectious. The difference in the results thus far is heartbreaking. Florida lost only 3.5 nursing home residents per 100,000, while New York lost a whopping 27 per 100,000. And that is an apples-to-apples comparison that has nothing to do with New York’s population density or mass transit. A nursing home is a nursing home. If that’s not heartbreaking enough, Cuomo signed his mandate ordering nursing homes to accept those still infectious on March 25. And to prove he knew he made a terrible error, Cuomo eventually rescinded it, but not until May 9. So for six deadly weeks, Cuomo’s order ensured plague was poured into facilities ill-equipped to handle such a thing, facilities full of the very human beings the virus was most likely to kill. For a few seconds on Wednesday, America’s useless and corrupt media, America’s fawning Cuomosexuals, actually stopped fawning to ask the governor about his deadly nursing home policy. To defend his indefensible directive, Cuomo made three absurd and easily debunked excuses. Here’s the first: Is the best use of a hospital bed to have somebody sit there for two weeks in a hospital bed when they don’t need the hospital bed … and you need that hospital bed for somebody who may die without it? The premise of Cuomo’s answer is simply not true. While there’s no question New York hospitals were hit hard, they were inundated, not overwhelmed. There was always bed space. But riddle me this… How is pouring plague into nursing homes supposed to result in the need for fewer hospital beds? Good heavens, placing infectious patients among the very population most likely to require hospital care is not freeing up beds; it is a deliberate act that ensures more hospital beds will be needed. Furthermore, let’s not forget that the USNS Comfort and its 1,000 beds arrived in New York just five days after Cuomo signed his nursing home decree. There was nothing stopping Cuomo from placing nursing home patients there; the Navy ship remained almost entirely empty the entire time it was docked in New York Harbor. Another facility that remained almost entirely empty was the field hospital built at New York’s Javits Convention Center, a 1,000-room facility that opened less than two weeks after Cuomo signed his deadly nursing home decree. The center treated fewer than 1,100 patients over its five-week lifespan, which means its 1,000 beds remained “largely empty ” and had plenty of room to accept nursing home patients. Cuomo’s second excuse, predictably, has been to blame President Trump: Why did the state do that with COVID patients in nursing homes? It’s because the state followed President Trump’s CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] guidance. This, of course, is gibberish. Cuomo wasn’t forced to do anything any more than DeSantis was. The difference is that DeSantis made the correct decision, while Cuomo made one deadly decision after another. Plus, Cuomo reversed his deadly decree without the CDC ever altering its guidelines. But let’s pretend Cuomo’s hands were tied. What we have here is a governor more than willing to defy the federal government when it comes to protecting illegal aliens but not the elderly. What we have here is a governor willing to defy the federal government to protect tax breaks for the rich but not the elderly. Cuomo’s final excuse was to blame — unbelievably — the nursing homes: For a COVID patient, a nursing home must say “I can quarantine, I can isolate, I have the right staff, I have the right PPE,” or else that nursing home should not take that patient … So any nursing home could just say, “I can’t handle a COVID person in my facility.” This is simply not true. Cuomo’s mandate not only required that nursing homes accept coronavirus patients returning from hospitalization — incredibly, Cuomo outlawed the right of the nursing home to even ask if the patient tested positive for the virus. How can you request to not accept a patient if you don’t know his status? What’s more, uncovered emails prove that New York state denied requests from nursing homes to send “suspected covid patients” to the empty Javits Center facility. “We don’t have the ability to cohort right now based on staffing and we really want to protect our other patients,” Cobble Hill Health Center CEO Donny Tuchman wrote to the state Health Department. The request was denied, even though only 134 of the Javits Center’s 1,000 beds were in use; only 62 of the 1,000 beds aboard the USNS Comfort were in use. Sadly, the New York Post reports that “Cobble Hill has led all state nursing homes in the number of residents killed by the coronavirus[.]” Cuomo is not the only governor who poured death into nursing homes. In New Jersey, where 51 out of every 100,000 nursing home resident has died of the coronavirus, the state’s Democrat governor signed an order similar to Cuomo’s that outlawed nursing homes refusing an infectious patient. Like New York, New Jersey also barred nursing homes from asking that patients be tested before accepting them. The bottom line is that thousands and thousands of people died unnecessarily because of Andrew Cuomo’s fatal mismanagement and equally fatal error of judgment. This is all on him, hence my retraction.  Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.

The Ministry of the Interior of Saudi Arabia on Friday announced a 24-hour coronavirus lockdown and nationwide curfew for the Eid al-Fitr holiday, which is scheduled for May 23 to 27 in the kingdom.  The exact date of Eid, which marks the end of Ramadan, is determined by sightings of the crescent moon. Under the rules of the lockdown, Saudi mosques will not open for Eid prayers, so Muslims were advised to pray at home. Eid is usually a highly social occasion, but the Ministry of the Interior banned gatherings of more than five people, or more than one family if the respective family members live in different houses. Penalties for violating the lockdown include steep fines beginning at about $2,600 in U.S. dollars and increasing for repeat offenses. Both organizers and attendees will be fined for social gatherings that exceed the prescribed limits. Although Saudi malls and retail stores were open during Ramada, they will be closed during the Eid lockdown. Arab News reported this week that Egypt is planning a six-day curfew during the Eid holiday and Jordan will “restrict movement of vehicles on the first day of Eid al-Fitr.”  Voice of America saw Pakistani shoppers rushing to buy food, gifts, and sweets for the traditional Eid celebration ahead of possible restrictions, while Indonesia and many other countries with large Muslim populations have joined Saudi Arabia in banning large gatherings, while generally stopping short of complete lockdowns. A notable exception is Iran, whose horrific coronavirus epidemic was concealed as much as possible by the ruling regime, and which now seems determined to proceed with large Eid gatherings provided the participants observe social distancing rules. CBS News noted the decision to lock down over Eid was made because “infections have surged back in recent weeks.” Saudi Arabia’s 42,925 confirmed cases give it the largest coronavirus outbreak in the Gulf region, alarming Saudi health officials so much that they have considered suspending the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina.

WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. (AP) — Little League is offering youth baseball organizations a pathway forward as they eye a restart amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The organization released a series of “best practices” guidelines this week that highlight how to create a safe playing environment whenever state and local authorities give youth sports in a given area the the all clear to restart. Little League canceled the 2020 Little League World Series and other championships because of the pandemic last month but remains hopeful a regular season may still be possible. Little League president Stephen Keener said during a roundtable discussion hosted by Republican Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania on Thursday that it compiled the outline after consulting with medical professionals and receiving guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, among others. While Keener stressed the decision will ultimately be made by each family, he believes it was important to show parents that playing “can be done, we think as safely as possible … if you follow these guidelines.”
The recommendations include eliminating all non-essential contact and banning the postgame handshake line in favor of lining up along the respective baselines and tipping caps to opponents. All players should wear masks while in the dugout and coaches and volunteers should wear masks and protective medical gloves at all times, the guidelines said. Players should also be separated by six feet while in the dugout or in the stands and the shared use of equipment is prohibited when possible. Umpires would move from behind home plate to behind the pitcher’s mound and game balls would be switched out every two innings. Concession sales would also be prohibited. So would ballpark staples like sunflower seeds and spitting. The recommendations also include limiting the amount of family members allowed into a facility to watch games.
Toomey said he would sign his 10-year-old son up for baseball “tomorrow” because he believes it can be done safely. “I think it is time that we begin resuming normal life,” Toomey said.
The best practices were released a week after Major League Baseball put together a 67-page proposal outlining how it could conceivably return to play this year.

The leader of Russia’s majority-Muslim Chechnya region, Ramzan Kadyrov, is in Moscow with a suspected case of the Chinese coronavirus, Russian media reported on Thursday. No government officials have confirmed the news, but Kadyrov has remained out of the public eye in recent days. The report that Kadyrov, the highest-ranking Muslim in Russia’s government, had become ill with a suspected case of Chinese coronavirus surfaced in Russian state media, suggesting it came directly from government sources. The TASS news agency did not cite government sources in its report, however, instead identifying “a source in medical circles” as the person confirming the news. “Ramzan Kadyrov has been brought to Moscow with the suspected coronavirus infection. [He] is now under medical observation,” TASS reported that the source said, clarifying that no official confirmation of the news exists, meaning neither the Chechen Republic nor Russian officials have confirmed it. “Kadyrov’s aide Ahmed Dudayev emphasized that the Chechen leader was personally observing the work of the regional anti-coronavirus crisis center,” TASS added. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) noted that Interfax and RIA-Novosti, other Russian government-linked news networks, also reported that Kadyrov was in Moscow on Thursday and “under medical supervision.” In contrast, RFE/RL noted that the Chechen government outlet Grozny TV appeared to have contradicted the reports out of the Moscow media outlets, saying “that Kadyrov was still in control.” Akhmed Dudayev, the head of Grozny TV, said on his Instagram account that Kadyrov “is personally in control of the situation, he is taking all necessary measures. The work of his headquarters is under his personal control.” Kadyrov is one of Russia’s most controversial political figures, a strongman dictator accused of perpetrating horrific human rights abuses on suspected LGBT people in Chechnya. In 2017, human rights groups sounded the alarm after Russian newspaper Novoya Gazeta reported that Kadyrov had established “concentration camps” to detain suspected gay people. A government spokesman replied that the report was not true because “if such people existed in Chechnya, law enforcement would not have to worry about them, as their own relatives would have sent them to where they could never return.” Kadyrov similarly denied the existence of LGBT Chechens in an interview that year. “We don’t have those kinds of people here,” he told HBO. “We don’t have any gays. If there are any, take them to Canada. Praise be to God. Take them far from us so we don’t have them at home. To purify our blood, if there are any here, take them.” Kadyrov claimed he was considering retirement in 2017 and has reportedly clashed with Putin behind the scenes, though he has vocally asserted loyalty to Moscow. He remains the head of Chechnya at press time. If his coronavirus infection is confirmed, Kadyrov would join a growing number of high-ranking Russian officials fighting a coronavirus infection, among them Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov, who is currently hospitalized. Peskov personally confirmed his infection to Interfax on May 12. Reports at the time noted that Peskov was last seen in public in the same room as Putin on April 30, weeks before the confirmation of his health status, so it is not yet clear if Putin was exposed to the virus. Russia has more documented Chinese coronavirus cases than any country in the world except the United States, largely due to deceptive documentation practices outside of America in places like China, where the virus originated. At press time, Russia has reported 326,488 cases of Chinese coronavirus and 3,249 deaths. Russia’s numbers may be significantly artificially deflated. Last week, Moscow officials admitted that as many as 60 percent of the city’s coronavirus deaths may not have been added to the official tally because of co-morbidities; many governments around the world count those infected with coronavirus as official coronavirus deaths even if they also suffered from other ailments. “Over 60 percent of deaths occurred from obvious alternate causes, such as vascular accidents, stage four malignant diseases, leukemia, systemic diseases linked to organ failure and other incurable deadly diseases,” Moscow’s Health Department said. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin has also estimated that the number of total cases in the city may be three times what authorities documented. Russian authorities have received significant criticism for their response, some of it from doctors complaining that they do not have sufficient protective gear and medical equipment to treat the large number of patients. Multiple doctors have mysteriously fallen out of windows after making these criticisms since the outbreak started. The head of Russia’s Coronavirus Information Center, Alexander Myasnikov, also courted controversy this week by encouraging Russians to become comfortable with the large number of deaths. “The infection will still take its toll, and we’ll all get it. Those meant to die will die. Everyone dies,” Myasnikov said in a television interview. “Even if it’s coronavirus, so what? Of course, you need to get a test to avoid infecting others, but you do understand it’s an illusion. We’ll run out of tests if everyone runs out to check after every sneeze.” Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.

Senator Lamar Alexander (R-TN) on Friday stressed the need for testing to get students back in school in the fall. Alexander said children should plan to be in school in the upcoming school year, but said proper testing and social distancing will be “key” to reopening schools, which he said is important to avoid the risk of “social, intellectual, emotional damage.” Fox News Channel’s “America’s Newsroom” host Sandra Smith asked Alexander, “Should … kids plan on going back to school this fall?” “My opinion is yes,” Alexander replied. “There are some health risks — Dr. Fauci warned against cavalierly dismissing those — but we do know that COVID has been less damaging to younger people, even though they may carry it to older people. So, I think most principals, most school boards are making plans now to go back to school in August.” He continued, “[A]ny teacher can tell you there are other risks — the risks of social, intellectual, emotional damage to a child who might lose an entire school year, and we want to avoid that.” As for safely reopening schools, Alexander said children should wear masks and continue practicing social distancing, in addition to more testing being provided by the schools. “If you find a child in a classroom who is infected, he … or she is removed from the classroom, you test all of the other kids in the classroom, and make sure the school is safe,” he advised.

Friday on Hugh Hewitt’s nationally syndicated radio show, Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) said that given the circumstances of China’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic combined with the nation’s aggressive economic practices, the United States had entered a so-called “cold war” with China. Scott touted an effort he was spearheading to require transparency regarding where products were manufactured as a measure of accountability. “Absolutely,” Scott replied when asked about “Cold War 2.” “There’s no question about it. Now they’re clearly in it. They’re in for world domination. We’ve been naïve. So we’ve got to say to ourselves, we’ve got to say to ourselves how do we take care of ourselves. Understand you have an enemy. They’re an adversary. It’s called Communist China. They’re not here to help us, all right? They didn’t. They intentionally didn’t tell us about the Coronavirus. It was intentional. It was not, you know, there was, there was nothing, oh, maybe, gosh, we didn’t do a good job.” “No, it was intentional what they did,” he continued. “You can see it was intentional. We’ve got to hold them accountable, the World Health Organization accountable. And so I’ve got a bill that says from now on, the online resellers like Amazon, you will disclose, you should be doing it anyway. Tell us where things are made so we can buy American products. Walmart, Costco, show us.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor

The climb in Coronavirus-related deaths in Mexico elevates the nation to the number 10 spot globally. Despite widespread allegations of under-counting cases and mislabeling causes of death, the country managed to bump Canada and the Netherlands in a matter of days. Some of the alarming figures come from Mexico’s daily news conference where Undersecretary of Health Hugo Lopez Gatell revealed a total of 6,510 fatalities and 59,567 confirmed cases nationwide since the pandemic started. Since Monday, Mexico added 1,333 new deaths. Al 21 de mayo de 2020 hay 59,567 casos confirmados, 12,905 confirmados activos y 33,291 sospechosos por #COVID19. Se han registrado 108,980 negativos, 6,510 defunciones confirmadas, 769 defunciones sospechosas y fueron estudiadas 201,838 personas. 1/3 pic.twitter.com/VSEKxifhr1 — Hugo López-Gatell Ramírez (@HLGatell) May 22, 2020  The number 9 global spot in fatalities is held by Iran with 7,300 deaths. Just like China, the Middle Eastern nation stands accused of suppressing true totals. The climbing death toll in Mexico comes as Lopez Gatell and staff are widely accused of downplaying the pandemic. A recent study by a Mexican NGO revealed that in Mexico City alone, officials only documented one-third of the Coronavirus-related fatalities. Lopez Gatell also admitted that some of his figures only accounted for cases in government hospitals. The discrepancy in counts pushed some states to release their own.

Hundreds of American physicians have signed onto a letter addressed to Vice President Mike Pence and the Coronavirus Task Force that urges the total reopening of the nation’s businesses and schools. The letter states that, while they value every life that has indeed been lost due to the infection caused by the Chinese coronavirus, the physicians assert the evidence that now exists indicates the lockdowns have “not been necessary to save lives but instead inflicted devastating harm on 10s of millions of people.” “We CAN treat the sick and protect the vulnerable without social and economic lockdown,” reads the letter, led by healthcare providers from the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS). The doctors bring several points to light. “This virus is survivable by greater than 99% of those infected,” they observe. “For those under 60, the estimated infection fatality rate is 0.05%. On average, the infection fatality rate is 0.2%.” In addition, about 80 percent of those infected with COVID-19 “have no symptoms or mild symptoms at most,” they continue. “We now know that a well-defined subset of the population is vulnerable to severe illness or death by COVID-19,” the doctors say, specifically noting nursing home patients, who suffer psychologically as well because they are isolated from family members. The physicians take to task the media which they accuse of “terrifying people, creating crippling fear that has drained the life out of our society.” They add that “public health officials and administrators” have also been “interfering with medical decision-making,” and specifically cite some elected officials and state boards that have “prevented the use of safe and FDA approved medications” that treat the COVID-19 infection. “Physicians are also pressured to count deaths in a way that inflates the true infection fatality rate,” the signers assert. The doctors note that “natural widespread immunity can be achieved safely without waiting for a vaccine” when otherwise healthy individuals contract the virus and immunity builds over time. The physicians stress, however, that those who are especially vulnerable to serious illness or death should be identified and protected whenever possible. Finally, they urge the task force and elected officials to avoid mass testing of citizens as a means to “create policy that restricts an individual’s livelihood and freedom to participate in society.” “[A]nd absolutely,” they add, testing “should not be used to threaten businesses and counties with repeated closure.” “We cannot accept the current dysfunction in society as the ‘new normal,’” the doctors conclude. “Our goal is to lead with hope and courage instead of fear and confusion … Our medical professionals are ready to serve this nation according to the time-honored Hippocratic Oath that calls us to serve with respect and compassion and, above all, to do no harm.” Physicians who wish to sign onto the letter may do so here at the AAPS website.

The NHL Players’ Association’s executive board is voting on a 24-team playoff proposal as the return to play format, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Thursday night because the vote was still ongoing. Results of the vote could be in as soon as Friday night. Even if the executive board votes to approve the format, it doesn’t yet seal the deal for the NHL season resuming. The league and players union still need to negotiate other details, including health and safety protocols. But the format is a substantial piece of the return to play puzzle. Under the plan proposed by the joint NHL/NHLPA Return To Play Committee, the top four teams in each of the Eastern and Western Conferences would play each other for seeding while the remaining 16 teams face off in a best-of-five series play-in round to set the final 16 to compete for the Stanley Cup. That would mean byes for Boston, Tampa Bay, Washington and Philadelphia in the East and defending champion St. Louis, Colorado, Vegas and Dallas in West. Pittsburgh, Carolina the New York Islanders and Rangers, Toronto, Columbus, Florida and Montreal would also make it in the East and Edmonton, Nashville, Vancouver, Calgary, Winnipeg, Minnesota, Arizona and Chicago in the West. “I feel like if you’re doing the 24-team thing, it basically gives a team a chance that had no chance of making it, which if you play 82 there’s maybe 6, 8% chance that the team in 12th place (in the conference) makes it,” Carolina player representative Jordan Martinook said Wednesday, more than 24 hours before the executive board meeting. “Nobody’s ever seen this before, but at the end of the day, the Stanley Cup Playoffs are 16 teams, seven games a series.” This format would lead to the traditional four rounds of seven-game series. “I don’t think there’s going to be a perfect scenario where everyone’s super excited about,” Nashville’s Ryan Johansen said earlier Thursday. “As long as everybody can agree and be happy with the decision that will be made, that’s really all that matters.” If the NHLPA’s executive board and the league’s board of governors approve the plan, the who of returning would be set. The where, when and how must still be determined, including how many cities will host games, quarantine regulations and testing. “Nothing’s really certain until it’s certain, so things can change so quickly and they have on different things,” Return to Play committee member James van Riemsdyk of the Flyers said Wednesday. “We’re trying to keep as many options open and navigate through different things and hopefully come up with a vision that obviously first and foremost is the health and safety of everyone.” Commissioner Gary Bettman this week said the league was looking at eight or nine locations to serve as hub cities for the resumption of the season. It’s unclear when the league and players will agree to begin the second phase of preparations for return, which would be the reopening of team practice facilities and voluntary workouts. The following step would then likely be a three-week training camp before games resume. “Obviously it’s an important thing to navigate through all the different issues that there are so that ultimately we can try to find a safe way to get things going here,” van Riemsdyk said. “There’s been some different talks and things like that and talking about a bunch of different things and trying to sort through some different issues.”

TEL AVIV – The Palestinian Authority has refused to accept a shipment of aid against coronavirus sent by the United Arab Emirates because the PA “doesn’t want to serve as a bridge for the normalization of ties between the UAE and Israel,” the Palestinian news agency Maan reported on Thursday. “We refused the aid from the UAE because it wasn’t coordinated through us or any of our systems,” Health Minister Mai Alkaila said at a press briefing in Bethlehem on Thursday. “We are an authority and have our sovereignty and we can’t have our sovereignty and we can’t accept such aid without coordinating with us.” A history-making flight carrying the medical supplies became the first commercial flight between Israel and the UAE. The rare Etihad airways flight was carrying 14 tons of PPE, including “10 ventilators that are acutely needed,” according to a joint statement from the UAE  and the United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process. How awful. The Palestinian Authority has rejected the UAE  shipment of #Covid_19 supplies “because the authority doesn’t want to serve as a bridge for the normalization of ties between the UAE and Israel.” https://t.co/vMeWtELCm0 pic.twitter.com/6j3fxgNiPy — Avi Kaner (@AviKaner) May 21, 2020  Palestinian media, as well as Russia Today Arabic, cited a Palestinian official as saying the PA declined to receive the aid because it was refusing to be used as a “tool for normalization” between Israel and the UAE. The two countries do not have diplomatic relations but there have been several instances of warming relations in recent years. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei described the act as a betrayal of the Palestinians. “Today, some Persian Gulf states have committed the biggest treachery against their own history and the history of the Arab world,” Khamenei tweeted. “They have betrayed #Palestine by supporting Israel. Will the nations of these states tolerate their leaders’ betrayal?” Today, some Persian Gulf states have committed the biggest treachery against their own history and the history of the Arab world.

CLAIM: Joe Biden called on Trump to shut down the country’s economy “one week earlier” to deal with coronavirus. VERDICT: FALSE. Biden did not call for an early shutdown, though he did criticize Trump’s policies on the pandemic. Former Vice President Joe Biden appeared Friday morning on The Breakfast Club, the popular radio show hosted by “Charlemagne tha God.” (Charlemagne had been ripping Biden for months for not appearing yet on his broadcast.) While much of the ensuring controversy focused on Biden’s comments on race — “If you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black” — he also made some rather outlandish claims on coronavirus. Biden cited a recent study, which was written up in the New York Times, claiming fewer people would have died from coronavirus if the country shut down one week earlier. He then claimed he had been calling for such action to be taken. “If he had listened to me, and others, and acted one week earlier to deal with this virus, there’d be 36,000 fewer people dead. Dead! Dead! And you guys are wondering, what’s he doing? Come on, man! Get a life! Get a life!” Biden said. But Biden never called for the country to be shut down. Trump delivered his Oval Office address on March 11. One week earlier, on March 4, Biden was still traveling around the country and holding campaign rallies with supporters. For example, he held a campaign rally in Detroit, Michigan, on March 9 (above) with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer — now hailed by Democrats and the media for her tough coronavirus restrictions. He campaigned in a Detroit auto plant the next day, cursing at a worker who criticized his stance on gun control. He only began canceling rallies on March 10. Biden did write an article criticizing Trump’s coronavirus policies on January 27 — one of the few times a Democratic candidate said anything about the issue before late February. He also attacked Trump’s travel ban on China on Jan. 31 as “hysterical xenophobia” — though that ban proved successful in slowing the spread of the virus to the United States. The first time any Democratic debate discussed the coronavirus was at the Feb. 25 debate in South Carolina. Biden did not call for shutting down the economy; rather, he said he would restore funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which had already been restored; and he said he would demand that China allow American experts into the country, which had also already happened. He never urged Trump to shut down the U.S. economy. Joel B.

Noise complaints by annoyed neighbors are on the rise in Japan as people forced to stay home for weeks during the country’s coronavirus lockdown grow increasingly hostile. In an extreme case, a man in Tokyo was stabbed to death by his neighbor following a noise complaint, the Japan Times reported on Wednesday. On May 4, a 38-year-old construction worker was stabbed to death by a neighbor over a noise complaint in Tokyo’s Adachi Ward. The man was killed at his parent’s apartment, which he had been visiting with his family before he was murdered. The culprit, Shizuharu Hiruta, 60, lived in the same apartment building as the victim’s parents. He was immediately arrested following the deadly attack and readily confessed to the crime, telling police he “could not stand the loud footsteps and voices.” The next day, on May 5, 80-year-old Senji Takahashi “slashed” his 62-year-old neighbor with a knife in Tokyo’s Edogawa Ward. Senji told investigators he was “annoyed” by the noise his neighbor made. On April 16, Japan’s prime minister, Abe Shinzo, declared a nationwide state of emergency, including stay-at-home orders and school closures, in an effort to curb the spread of the Chinese coronavirus. In Tokyo, the nation’s capital and most populous prefecture, the order will remain in place until May 31. On the island of Japan, limited space coupled with a high population density has long been an issue. Most people are forced to live in close quarters with one another in small apartments. In Tokyo especially, micro-living spaces are infamous. Now, confined to their often cramped homes due to the lockdown, Tokyo residents have grown increasingly sensitive to noise from neighbors. In March and April, Tokyo police received 24,245 phone calls reporting excessive noise, an increase of 28.5 percent from the previous year, the Japan Times reported. According to the report, the Japanese were already sensitive to noise prior to the pandemic, likely due in part to their living in densely packed apartments. In 2018, 15,665 noise complaints were filed, according to Japan’s Environmental Dispute Coordination Commission. This amounted to 32.9 percent of total reported disputes for the year. Between neighbors, noise complaints have been the number one source of official disputes for the past five consecutive years. In April, “corona divorce” trended across Japanese social media as couples vented their frustrations online at being forced to stay at home for extended periods with their partners, with some spouses contemplating or filing for divorce.

Researchers at Australian National University (ANU) have called for ‘climate change’ to be recorded as a cause of death on death certificates. They claim that in Australia, the rate of people dying as a result of global warming may be 50 times higher than is officially acknowledged. In a letter to The Lancet Planetary Health, researchers Arnagretta Hunter and Simon Quilty claim the impact of climate change is currently understated. National mortality records in Australia suggest substantial under-reporting of heat-related mortality. Less than 0·1% of 1·7 million deaths between 2006 and 2017 were attributed directly or indirectly to excessive natural heat. However, recent research indicates that official records underestimate the association at least 50-fold. According to the Sydney Morning Herald: Over the past 11 years in Australia, just 340 deaths have been recorded as being caused by excessive heat, but statistical analysis by two doctors with the Australian National University shows that 36,765 could have been attributed to heat. “Climate change is a killer, but we don’t acknowledge it on death certificates,” co-author Arnagretta Hunter, from the ANU Medical School, said. And: “Climate change is the single greatest health threat that we face globally even after we recover from coronavirus. “We are successfully tracking deaths from coronavirus, but we also need healthcare workers and systems to acknowledge the relationship between our health and our environment.” Dr Hunter and her co-author Dr Simon Quilty, call for death certificates to include more information about factors contributing to deaths. Climate activists around the world see the coronavirus pandemic as a crisis which they must not allow to go to waste. The timing of this letter suggests that they are learning their lessons well. They may have noted that in many countries, the medical authorities have adopted extraordinarily lax policies towards the inclusion of “Covid-19” on death certificates. In the UK, for example, as Ronan Maher has reported here and here, the Coronavirus Act (2020) includes clauses which makes it possible for doctors to put Covid-19 as a cause of death on certificates without even having seen the patient before their death — and with little independent oversight. This makes it quite possible that significant numbers of Coronavirus victims either did not have the disease – or did have the disease but only as a minor adjunct to much more serious conditions which killed them. As the authors of the letter to Lancet Planetary Health must surely be aware, including ‘climate change’ as a cause of death on death certificates is fraught with similar difficulties. As well as being easily abused by activists with an agenda, it is impossible to attribute with any certainty even extreme weather events to climate change.

The UK is set to introduce a mandatory 14-day self-quarantine for all arrivals into the country from overseas, including British citizens, with those breaking the rules facing up to £1,000 in fines. Secretary of State for the Home Department Priti Patel is expected to make the announcement during Friday’s press briefing, with the measures set to come into effect in June. Any travellers arriving into the UK — at airports, ports, or train stations — must provide Border Force with the details of where they are staying, with officials able to conduct checks on those on quarantine orders to make sure they are complying. Exemptions will include those arriving from the Republic of Ireland, as well as medics and hauliers, according to the BBC, and contrary to earlier reports, it is believed those travelling from France will also be subject to self-isolation orders. ‘We Are Guided by the Science’: British Govt Shrugs Off Responsibility For Open Borders, No Arrival Testing https://t.co/W0VUGwAHRv — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 13, 2020  The government is expected to say that the plans are to be put in place to prevent a second wave of Chinese coronavirus. However, critics of the government’s strategy have said that the UK should have locked down the country’s external borders months ago. In April, the month after lockdown restrictions were put in place, reports revealed that 100,000 travellers were still landing at British airports every week. In the three months before the lockdown, the Home Office had quarantined only 273 people out of the 18.1 million arrivals into the country. Since the outbreak, around 130 countries introduced lockdowns on their external borders as well as quarantines and screenings, with the UK being an “outlier” by imposing none. Professor Gabriel Scally, the president of epidemiology and public health at the Royal Society of Medicine, had said last month that he found it “very hard to understand why it persists in having this open borders policy. It is most peculiar.” Farage Says ‘Boris Needs to Get a Grip’ on Coronavirus and Fire Health Secretary https://t.co/HhODW0QCtX — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 22, 2020  Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage criticised the government as far back as March for forcing Britons to stay under lockdown and observe extreme social distancing while the country continued to allow international open borders to legal migration. On March 23rd, Mr Farage had said: “So we are to be locked down — and a new testing regime will begin. Will the planes keep coming from Milan, Tehran and Beijing? I expect not. It’s all too late.” “On the very same day that Lombardy was closed down, 17 flights came into the United Kingdom from Milan’s Malpensa airport…. [with] not a single person being temperature checked,” he revealed, referencing Italy, which at the time was a hotspot of contagion. Just earlier this month, Mr Farage had criticised the government for being “all over the place” on its lockdown policy after considering allowing “air bridges” for travel from countries that had got their outbreak under control. The government had previously argued that locking down airports was effectively pointless because the virus was already so widely spread around the country. To date, the UK still has the second-highest number of coronavirus fatalities in the whole world, with more than 36,000 dead. In April, Farage warned that with the government’s dithering over the screening of entrants that “in the subsequent enquiry, the word will’ be ‘negligence’.” Mr Farage has also been highly critical of government’s failure to tackle illegal migration, with the number of English Channel boat migrants surging during the lockdown, many reportedly coming from migrant camps rife with coronavirus. Farage’s reporting on the issue came to a head this week when he filmed the French navy escort a boat full of migrants into British waters to hand off to UK authorities.

Norway’s airline Norwegian Air has calmed fears of bankruptcy with new major investments, including one from a corporation linked to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Chinese company BOC Aviation bought a 12.7 per cent stake in Norwegian Airlines after converting its bond loans into 390 million shares of the company. “This could be very important. China is a special owner, the Chinese state is special and drives Chinese interests very strongly,” economic journalist Kristina Lagerström told Swedish broadcaster SVT on Wednesday. “This entire settlement that Norwegian made when trying to save the company from bankruptcy was based on the fact that those who lease the aircraft take over the company; that is the consequence of this,” she added. Other firms have also bought significant stakes in the airline including Irish aircraft leasing company Aercap which bought 15.9 per cent of the company. On Tuesday it was also announced that the airline would be receiving a loan guarantee of three billion kroner (£237 million/$290 million) from the Norwegian government with CEO Jacob Schram stating that “virtually all of the revenue stream has stopped”. Farage Warns Chinese Interests Lining up for ‘Fire Sale’ of UK Businesses https://t.co/WMCcyM7R5W — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 10, 2020  “Our goal has not only been for Norwegian to survive, but for us to come back stronger with a sustainable operation and a structure that will benefit shareholders, customers and colleagues alike,” he added. Norwegian, like many other airlines, has faced extreme financial difficulty due to travel bans enacted by many countries to stop the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus. Scandinavian airline SAS has also received a bailout from the Swedish state after the government allotted nearly half a billion euros in loans for airlines operating in Sweden’s airspace last month. In mid-March, before the height of the coronavirus outbreak in Europe, Joakim Bornold, analyst and economist at Söderberg & Partners, warned that SAS would face an existential crisis as a result of the pandemic. Air France has also looked towards a government bailout but has been told by the Macron government that it would have to cancel all domestic flights and engage in other moves to make the airline “green”.

Thursday on Fox News Channel’s “The Story,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) rejected congressional Democrats’ calls for passage of the HEROES Act, the latest measure promoted by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) to respond to the coronavirus pandemic. “Well, we know these are desperate times as a result of the pandemic,” he said. “The CARES Act, which we passed a few — a month or so ago, on a bipartisan basis, only about half of that money has gone out yet. I think there’s a high likelihood we will do another rescue package. But we need to be able to measure the impact of what we have already done, what we did right, what we did wrong, correct that. And we’re not quite ready to intelligently lay down the next step, but it’s not too far off. Let me tell you what it won’t be. It won’t be a $3 trillion left-wing wish list that passed the House that they almost — couldn’t get all the Democrats to vote for, that Senator Schumer is in favor of. That’s not going to pass the Senate. It’s not going to become law.” “We need to work smart here, help the people who are desperately in need, try to save as many jobs as possible, and begin to open up the states, which are decisions by the governors that are going on all over America now, and get this economy growing again,” McConnell added. Widely panned by Republicans as a “messaging bill,” McConnell said another drawback of that effort was it incentivized unemployment. “The problem was, by paying people more not to work than to work, it’s making it difficult to get people back to work,” he explained. “You can understand that. We do need to continue unemployment insurance. It’s extremely important at a time like this. But to pay people more not to work than to work doesn’t encourage resuming your job. And that will end in July. And we think that, in order to create jobs, we need to incentivize people to go back to work, not encourage them to stay home.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor

Thursday, during her weekly briefing, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said because voting in the United States was “under assault” from the coronavirus, it must be protected with nationwide vote-by-mail so no one is “forced” to go to a polling place and risk their health. Pelosi said, “Voting is under assault both from a systemic nationwide campaign of voter suppression and from the coronavirus. The fear of getting sick and not to go to the polls. People should not have to choose between voting and preserving their good health and that of their families. Because no matter what you do when you go out, you bring it home. Again, no one should be forced to vote for their health or their vote.” She continued, “In the HEROES Act, we added the balance of what we think we need to have voting at home and to protect the ballot. That would be $3.6 billion. A small price to pay for our democracy and the good health of Americans going to the polls. We will be there to expand vote at home, vote by mail some call it, including no-excuse absentee ballots, same-day registration, and again, having polling places available for those who want to participate in person for whatever reason.” She added, “This is about the livelihood and life of our democracy. Essential to the life of our democracy is removing obstacles of participation to voting. And now, even more so now, when voting can be a risk to your health, as we saw demonstrated in Wisconsin.” She concluded, “We don’t want anything to stand in the way of the right to vote.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

During an interview with the Hill on Thursday, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said that “there is a strong likelihood” that another coronavirus relief bill will be needed, but the administration will “step back for a few weeks” to see if more money needs to be spent, and, if so, how to spend it. Mnuchin said that the current relief package, the CARES Act, does have provisions in it to help workers, but the unemployment insurance provision needs to be fixed so that people aren’t being paid more by unemployment insurance than they were making working. He added, “We’re going to carefully review, the next few weeks. I think there is a strong likelihood we will need another bill. But we just have $3 trillion we’re pumping into the economy, and we’re going to step back for a few weeks and think very clearly how we need to spend more money and if we need to do that.” Mnuchin also stated that he hopes the next bill will be a bipartisan bill. He also said that because the House’s bill, the HEROES Act, “is a partisan bill,” it isn’t being focused on by the administration. Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

Wilson Roosevelt Jerman’s family announced his death after contracting coronavirus at the age of 91 last Saturday. Jerman was one of the longest-serving White House employees in history, having begun his tenure as a cleaner in 1957. Jerman worked with every president from Eisenhower to Obama. By the time he retired at age 83 in 2012, he had ascended to the position of White House butler. His granddaughter, Jamila Garrett, remembered him in an interview on Washington, DC, station WTTG. “My grandfather was a family-loving, genuine man,” Garrett told WTTG reporter Shawn Yancy. “He was always about service. Service to others. It didn’t matter who you were or what you did or what you needed, whatever he could provide he did.” Jerman was known to go well beyond the call of duty during his 55 years in the White House. “George Bush Jr. has a little trouble adapting to a new environment, some trouble sleeping,” she recalled. “Well, my grandfather would actually sit with him in his bedroom until he fell asleep.” Garrett also thanked former First Lady Michelle Obama for including her grandfather in her book. “You know, just considering that we aren’t able to grieve normally, physically together, that is one way that we are able to still feel connected to his success and connected to so much that he promoted around authenticity and building relationships,” she said. “He always taught us that there will always be obstacles in your life. Always. They won’t disappear. It doesn’t matter your status, it does not matter your role or what you do, there will always be obstacles. But you keep pushing forward,” she said.

The majority of Americans do not support providing taxpayer-funded federal relief to illegal aliens during the Chinese coronavirus crisis, a new survey reveals. While President Trump’s administration deposited $1,200 stimulus checks to most Americans as coronavirus relief, House Democrats passed a plan providing 11 to 22 million illegal aliens with $1,200 stimulus checks, jobs, and amnesty to remain in the U.S. The latest Pew Research Center survey finds that Americans, by a majority, do not support giving taxpayer-funded coronavirus relief to illegal aliens. In total, only about 37 percent of Americans, or less than 3-in-8, support providing illegal aliens with stimulus checks. The survey showed that no age group, by a majority, supports coronavirus relief for illegal aliens. Likewise, only 33 percent of men and 41 percent of women support such a policy. (Pew Research Center)   A wide margin of support for coronavirus relief for illegal aliens differs on whether an American was born in the U.S. or in a foreign country. For instance, about 55 percent of native-born Americans said they support stimulus checks for illegal aliens. Foreign-born, naturalized Americans supported the policy by 68 percent, a 13-point margin. Even among Democrat voters, stimulus checks for illegal aliens is not broadly popular. For example, a slim majority of about 56 percent of registered Democrats said they support coronavirus relief for illegal aliens, as well as only 14 percent of Republicans. This week, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) introduced legislation that defunds states using taxpayer money to give illegal aliens coronavirus stimulus checks, as California has done. Recent surveys find overwhelming support for a pause to all immigration. The latest Washington Post/University of Maryland poll revealed that about 65 percent of all Americans said they support suspending all immigration at the moment. An Ipsos Poll conducted last month found that nearly 8-in-10 Americans said they supported a full immigration moratorium. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Latin America, driven in large part by the situation in Brazil, has reportedly surpassed the United States and Europe in new daily novel coronavirus cases reported over the past week. On Wednesday, Reuters reported: Latin America accounted for around a third of the 91,000 cases reported earlier this week. Europe and the United States each accounted for just over 20%. A large number of those new cases came from Brazil, which recently surpassed Germany, France, and the United Kingdom to become the third-largest outbreak in the world, behind the United States and Russia. Cases in Brazil are now rising at a daily pace second only to the United States. Brazil is now reportedly the fastest growing coronavirus hotspot in the world. Despite the increase in cases, many Latin American countries, particularly the ones with the largest economies in the region (Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia), have either already begun to loosen their lockdown restrictions or will soon do so after shutting down to stem the spread of the virus. COVID-19 will likely devastate Latin America’s economy as it has the rest of the world. Coronavirus landed in Latin America on February 26 when Brazil confirmed its first case. Governments in the region have since taken an array of measures to protect their citizens and contain the spread of the virus. As of Monday, virus fatalities in Latin America had exceeded 30,000, accounting for about ten percent of all recorded deaths, Reuters noted. Meanwhile, Europe accounts for over half of the more than 329,000 COVID-19 deaths worldwide. The coronavirus deaths in the United States amount to about 30 percent of the world’s total. Many countries are only reporting COVID-19 deaths that take place inside hospitals. Reuters noted that the substantial increase in the number of cases in Latin America represents “a new phase in the virus’ spread, which initially peaked in China in February before large-scale outbreaks followed in Europe and the United States.” As of Thursday, there were over five million confirmed cases across the world.

One of Wuhan’s top virologists – known as “Bat Woman” by colleagues for her expertise on coronaviruses in bats – has kept out of the public eye amid reports this month that she had defected from China and fled to the U.S. Embassy in Paris with 1,000 pages of confidential research in hand, Japan’s Nikkei reported on Thursday. Shi Zhengli, director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology’s Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases, is an expert researcher on coronaviruses in bats and has studied the subject at her Wuhan lab for years. News of her disappearance comes amid increasing reports that the Wuhan coronavirus, which has caused a global pandemic responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths, may have originated in the Wuhan laboratory she directed. Reports surfaced in early May that Shi may have defected from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)’s regime, fleeing Wuhan for the U.S. Embassy in Paris along with her family and hundreds of pages of intelligence files. According to a May 2 article by the CCP newspaper Global Times, Shi denied the reports that she had defected. The CCP alleged that Shi issued a statement via social media saying she would never betray her country. “No matter how difficult things are, it [defecting] shall never happen,” the statement appearing on her WeChat account reportedly read. The Nikkei’s report describes Shi as “one of the people most likely to know the truth about [the Wuhan coronavirus’s] origin.” As the report points out, Shi herself has remained largely silent so far on the origin of the Wuhan coronavirus. Any statements allegedly made by Shi, such as her CCP-approved social media statement on May 2, have yet to be proven as having come directly from her. The CCP’s promotion of the social media post, in the absence of Shi offering public comments, does not necessarily mean the statement came from her, given the Communist party stands accused of silencing and punishing several Wuhan doctors who tried to share information about the novel coronavirus this year in the early months of its initial outbreak. What Shi is reported to have said upon being notified of the first cases of the novel coronavirus by Wuhan authorities in December seems most revealing. In an article about Shi and the Wuhan coronavirus originally published on March 11 by the Scientific American, Shi told the magazine she immediately suspected that the novel coronavirus cases may have emerged from her Wuhan lab and asked herself, “Could they have come from our lab?” Shi continued: I wondered if [the Wuhan municipal health authority] got it wrong,” she says. “I had never expected this kind of thing to happen in Wuhan, in central China.” Her studies had shown that the southern, subtropical provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan have the greatest risk of coronaviruses jumping to humans from animals—particularly bats, a known reservoir. If coronaviruses were the culprit, she remembers thinking, “Could they have come from our lab?” According to an editor’s note, the Scientific American article was updated since its original March publication for inclusion in the magazine’s June 2020 issue and “to address rumors that SARS-CoV-2 [Wuhan coronavirus] emerged from Shi Zhengli’s lab in China.” In the updated version, the author says she interviewed Shi after the initial lockdown of Wuhan was lifted in April. Although the stated purpose of the additional interview in April was to “address rumors” that the Wuhan coronavirus emerged from Shi’s lab, Shi still refused the opportunity to deny the reports. Instead, she is described as “distressed” at the allegations. Perhaps tellingly, Shi did say of the matter, “What we have uncovered is just the tip of an iceberg.”

Police arrested the mayor of a small town in Peru on Wednesday after he violated lockdown measures in order to go out drinking with friends, before hiding from police in a coffin reserved for victims of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. According to local police, the mayor of Tantarà, Jaime Rolando Urbina Torres, hid in a coffin and pretended to be a corpse when officers arrived to arrest him. A bizarre picture released by authorities shows him lying in an open casket with a face mask on, while his drinking buddies are said to have hidden in drawers. Torres was already facing widespread criticism from locals for being absent during the crisis and violating the rules as he pleased. Earlier this month, he was summoned to attend a public meeting where people accused him of failing to take the pandemic seriously. Warning, not graphics. This is Peruvian mayor of city of Tantarà, the moment he was found by police:alive and kicking, but pretending to be dead in a coffin he suddenly jumped into, in the attempt, to escape arrest for violating quarantine to get drunk with friends pic.twitter.com/fs7LJ73ART — Tancredi Palmeri (@tancredipalmeri) May 21, 2020  After Brazil with its population of close to 200 million, Peru has been the Latin American country most severely affected by the coronavirus, confirming a hefty 108,769 cases and 3,148 deaths, the twelfth highest number worldwide. Neighboring Ecuador has the highest number of relative cases, recording approximately 169 deaths per one million people. “There will not be a day in which the restrictions are lifted and everything is as before,” Peruvian President Martín Vizcarra asserted at a press conference yesterday. “We have to make adjustments responsibly and we will do this with the assistance of professionals and experts.” The incident in Tantará is one of the various embarrassments faced by the Peruvian government since the outbreak began. Last month, police in Cusco doused a group of American tourists with bleach as they tried to leave the country amid the beginning of a nationwide quarantine. The incident led to victims contacting their members of Congress, who forced the U.S. State Department to contact local authorities and “ensure that “health care practices comply with international standards.” Last month, nine people died in a Peruvian prison riot where inmates were demanding better sanitary conditions as protection from the pandemic. As part of the process of retaking control of the prison, authorities deployed over 200 policemen in a nearly three-hour operation. At least two prisoners, five policemen, and 60 prison guards also sustained injuries. Follow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com

President Donald Trump on Thursday announced that he would order flags to fly at half-staff to memorialize Americans lost to the coronavirus. “I will be lowering the flags on all Federal Buildings and National Monuments to half-staff over the next three days in memory of the Americans we have lost to the CoronaVirus,” Trump wrote on Twitter. The president announced his decision after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) asked Trump to mark the day when America reached the milestone of 100,000 deaths from the virus. Pelosi and Schumer wrote in a letter to President Trump: We will always carry their memory in our hearts. As we pay our respects to them, sadly, our country mourns the deaths of nearly 100,000 Americans from COVID-19. Our hearts are broken over this great loss and our prayers are with their families. Currently the number of coronavirus deaths in the United States stands at 94,591 according to data tracked by Johns Hopkins University. The president said that the flags would fly at half-staff on Memorial Day to honor Americans who died serving in the U.S. military. “On Monday, the flags will be at half-staff in honor of the men and women in our Military who have made the Ultimate Sacrifice for our Nation,” he wrote. ….On Monday, the flags will be at half-staff in honor of the men and women in our Military who have made the Ultimate Sacrifice for our Nation. — Donald J.

Just hours after Tulare County supervisors voted to open up for business despite Gov. Gavin Newsom’s lockdown orders, officials received a letter threatening to withhold some of the $47 million in federal CARES Act relief funds it had been awarded. “It is my understanding Tulare County has taken steps that are inconsistent with the Governor’s Executive Orders and the State Public Health Officer’s directives,” the letter from the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services said. “These problematic and concerning actions jeopardize public health and safety, not only within the county, but beyond, through community contact and spread,” the letter said. It went on: If Tulare County believes there is no emergency, such that it can ignore the Governor’s Executive Orders or the State Public Health Officer’s directives, the county would not be able to demonstrate that it was extraordinarily and disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. This could jeopardize its disaster fundin. The San Francisco Chronicle reported on how local officials were responding to the suffering of local businesses when they voted to reopen: “It’s become an issue of needing to get people back on their feet, back to work,” said Supervisor Dennis Townsend, who authored the county’s measure that permits virtually all businesses to reopen and halts local enforcement of the California stay-at-home directive. “By trying to protect people, we were taking away the livelihood of people.” The Visalia Times Delta reported on the rift between state and local governments: The supervisors’ 3-2 decision allows nearly all businesses to reopen that fall under Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the state’s plan. That includes dine-in restaurants, churches, barbers, gyms, movie theaters and shopping malls. As for the disaster funding, Townsend said the county has spent about $1.4 million on its COVID-19 response so far. By comparison, the CAO estimates the county will lose between $18-25 million in tax revenues with the economy shut down. On Monday, Newsom singled out Tulare and neighboring Kings counties as two of five that will remain closed under newly relaxed criteria for restarting California’s economy. He pointed to severe outbreaks at nursing homes and meatpacking plants as obstacles the bi-county region would need to overcome before its economy could progress. The Times Delta reported that Chairman Pete Vander Poel said “holding Tulare County hostage” because of nursing homes and the “corporate bad actors” who operate them for a profit is unfair because it is, after all, the state regulates those facilities. But some businesses are nervous since state officials have bullied them. The California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) closed a Corcoran bar over the weekend following a similar reopening resolution passed by Kings County supervisors Friday, the Times Delta reported. Another establishment, Downtown Rookies Visalia,  announced it would reopen with dine-in service at 50 percent capacity but reversed it decision. The bar wrote on its Facebook page: However, after speaking with ABC this morning, we must follow governor Newsom’s restrictions and ABC will not permit any sit-down dining for restaurants that have a liquor license. So, unfortunately, we are back to take out only, until this governor of ours decides to release us for business as usual. The California Board of Barbering and Cosmetology also spoke out against businesses opening. “If businesses continue to put public health and safety at risk by not following the guidance provided, and if circumstances warrant it, the Board may pursue disciplinary action against their license,” the board said in a statement. “This will not be taken lightly.” But others who live in this rural part of California agree with the plan to reopen the local economy. “I’m happy with the board’s decision; it’s a step in the right direction,” Keith Korsgaden, who partially opened up his Visalia Crawdaddy’s dining room on Wednesday, said in the Times Delta report. “A lot of people would like a big part of their social life back, gathering for lunch and dinner with each other.” Customer Asha Pratt said she was glad to finally sit down for lunch with her two daughters. “I’m happy Crawdaddy’s is open,” she said. “It’s time to open the economy.” The Chronicle reported that county leaders have no intention of changing course. “We will not be doing any type of enforcement,” Supervisor Kuyler Crocker said.

Lakers star LeBron James is not letting the coronavirus stand in the way of practice. Instead, James is holding small, private, one-on-one sessions with his teammates. The Lakers did open their facilities for the players, but it is still a no-no for the whole team to pound the boards at once. So, James is sponsoring small sessions on a closed-off, private court with one or two other teammates at a time to keep their skills sharp, according to TMZ Sports. According to The Athletic’s Shams Charania, James is enforcing safety protocols for each session, testing players for coronavirus, and is making sure social distancing rules are being enforced. “All the safety measures have been taken,” Shams says. “In these private workouts, everyone has been tested, everyone involved has practiced social distancing.” LeBron James has held safe, private on-court workouts with some Lakers teammates at a secure location, our NBA @ShamsCharania reports. More details: pic.twitter.com/P4TamkL6li — Stadium (@Stadium) May 21, 2020  Charania did not elaborate on what this “testing” entails. Meanwhile, Lakers small forward Danny Green added that the team has put in place a number of policies for players returning to the facilities. During a visit with the Load Management podcast, Green laid out what it is like to enter the facilities. “I got tested before [entering], they do the swab. They stick a Q-tip in your damn brain. Scramble it around,” Green explained. “[After you test negative] you come in the facility, you have to wear your workout gear as you come in. The shoes that you have on, you have to take off at the door. They give you flip-flops at the front. You have to sanitize your hands, sanitize your phone, keys, etc.” Green continued: “[Once you’re done in the training room] you have your time in the weight room, on the court, however it is, vice-versa. “But when you’re working with the trainer you’re not supposed to be touching. You’re supposed to be 12 feet apart. So they instruct you what to do, how to do it. You do your weights “For the players, you’re allowed to take your mask off if you can’t workout with your mask because, obviously, you can’t breathe. But the training staff, everybody, has masks on. When you get to the court they have a seat for you, where your shoes are. “You change into your basketball shoes. They you have your time that they put on the clock, like 45 minutes or so. And then, once that time is up, you have five minutes to get out.” “You don’t use the locker room,” Green concluded. “You can’t shower there.” Follow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston.

Former Democrat presidential hopeful Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) is set to introduce a bill on Thursday that would create a new federal organization to assist with elections. According to released statements, the legislation would create a “DemocracyCorps” of people who would help individuals register to vote, serve as poll workers, and assist with voter education campaigns. Booker said in a statement: The right to vote is sacred and we should make exercising that fundamental right as easy as possible.  Unfortunately, the global pandemic has placed that right in peril, and unless decisive measures are taken to provide safe voting options, many Americans may face a terrible choice this fall between protecting their health and participating in our democracy. My bill would help solve this problem. DemocracyCorps aims to cultivate and inspire a new generation of young people to strengthen our democracy by helping Americans safely exercise the franchise, just as the Freedom Summer volunteers before them. The newly founded organization would include 35,000 people who would serve two-year terms. Those individuals would be assigned to certain states based on population size, amount of elected officials, and population on Native American lands. Booker’s proposed legislation, the DemocracyCorps Act, comes amid the coronavirus pandemic that has swept the world and left Americans unsure of how to safely carry out elections. Many prominent Democrats, including former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), have called for a vote-by-mail process, which they claim would be a safer alternative to standing in lines at polls. Booker’s bill would also include broader election reforms and includes ideas from other pieces of legislation from Sens. Kamala Harris (D-CA), Ron Wyden (D-OR), and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN). The ideas derived from other pieces of legislation include expanding early voting to 20 days before a federal election, online voter registration, and allowing vote-by-mail. Several Republicans have warned that a vote-by-mail system could lead to election fraud, including President Donald Trump. Follow Kyle on Twitter @RealKyleMorris and Facebook.

Around 10,000 Iranian health workers have tested positive for the Chinese coronavirus, the regime-aligned Iranian Labour News Agency quoted the country’s deputy health minister as saying on Thursday. With health services stretched to the limit, Iran is the worst affected country in the Middle East by the worldwide pandemic, reporting around 130,000 cases and 7,250 deaths. Approximately 7.7 percent of the infected are health workers, at least 100 of whom died in the month of April. No further details of infections among health workers were provided. On Thursday, Health Minister Saeed Namaki appealed to his countrymen to refrain from traveling during the Eid al-Fitr Islamic holiday later this month to avoid another spike in the number of infections. The rules will be particularly difficult to maintain given that so many Iranians, especially the most devout, have long held the tradition of traveling to different cities to mark the end of Ramadan. “I am urging you not to travel during the Eid. Definitely, such trips mean new cases of infection. People should not travel to and from those high-risk red areas,” Namaki said. “Some 90% of the population in many areas has not yet contracted the disease. In the case of a new outbreak, it will be very difficult for me and my colleagues to control it.” A study from the Iranian parliament’s research center suggested that the real number of infections and deaths could be double the official tally, making it one of the hardest-hit countries worldwide. The National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) announced last week that by their estimates, more than 41,000 people have died, close to four times the official figure. Since late April, the Iranian regime has started relaxing some lockdown restrictions in order to prevent excessive damage to the country’s economy, which has already suffered a major contraction in recent years after President Donald Trump reimposed economic sanctions after pulling out of the Comprehensive Joint Plan of Action, otherwise known as the Iran Nuclear Deal. As well as the reopening of certain economic sectors, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has also allowed for the reopening of mosques since the beginning of May to mark the holy month of Ramadan. Children also began returning to school this week. Yet as a result of these measures, Iranian authorities recently admitted that the country is already seeing a resurgence in the number of cases. However, Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour appeared to blame the rise on a “change of attitude” among certain parts of the population. “We are witnessing a rising trend in the past three or four days, which is significant,” Kianoush Jahanpour told a televised news conference earlier this month. “[This rise] is based on our behavior, especially in the past two weeks, considering that a part of society has apparently had a change of attitude.” Follow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.

President Donald Trump said Thursday in Michigan that he would not close the country if it was hit by a second wave of the coronavirus. “We are going to put out the fires. We’re not going to close the country,” Trump said. “We can put out the fires. Whether it is an ember or a flame, we are going to put it out. But we are not closing our country.” The president spoke during a tour of a Ford factory that was manufacturing ventilators, as he continues pushing for the country to reopen after the coronavirus-fueled shutdowns. “We did the right thing, but now it is time to open it up,” he said. “A never-ending lockdown would invite a public health calamity. To protect the health of our people, we must have a functioning economy.” Earlier in the day, Trump said that some Democrat governors were not reopening their states fast enough. “You have a lot of, unfortunately in this case, Democrat governors, I think they think it’s great politics to keep it closed, but what are they doing, they’re hurting themselves, I don’t think it is good politics … they’re hurting themselves, they’re hurting their state, and it’s not good,” Trump said, and added, “You’ll break the country if you don’t.”

Actress and apparent environmental expert Rosanna Arquette claims that President Donald Trump’s administration will cause “insurmountable” destruction to human beings and wildlife. “During this pandemic the trump administration has signed off to drill for oil in the Arctic sacred refuge,” Arquette said on Thursday in a tweet that accompanied a photo of polar bear. “The evil and the destruction this will cause human beings and wildlife is insurmountable.” During this pandemic the trump administration has signed off to drill for oil in the Arctic sacred refuge  .the evil and the destruction this will cause human beings and wildlife is insurmountable pic.twitter.com/PLhfAJeqoY — Rosanna Arquette🌎✌🏼 (@RoArquette) May 21, 2020  What prompted the Pulp Fiction actor’s rant? Well, it may have been the Interior Department’s recent decision to move forward with the ConocoPhillips’ Willow project which the Trump administration says could produce some 590 million barrels of oil over the next 30 years. But Thursday was not the first time Arquette has fired off an unhinged rant about mass death and despair. In March, the Deceiver actress proclaimed that deaths in the United States from the Chinese coronavirus could have been avoided if the nation had a “real leader who cared about the American people.” Arquette also said the “deaths of innocent people” will be the legacy of the Republican Party. Hell, Rosanna Arquette says she’s disgusted with her own skin color. Last year, the Born Guilty actress apologized for being born white and said that she’s ashamed of the “privilege” that she believes her skin color brings her. “I’m sorry I was born white and privileged. It disgusts me. And I feel so much shame,” said the Poison actress in 2019. And when Arquette is not focusing on her own skin color, she is busy accusing other people of focusing on skin color. In 2019, after two separate mass shootings, the actress declared that President Trump “incites racist violence.” “The president of the United States of America incites racist violence. The end,” the White Lies actress said. You can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo, and on Instagram.

The image is striking: Fans watching a college football game in the midst of a pandemic, wearing masks with a smidge of social distance between them on row after row of bleacher seats. The photo is 102 years old. The Georgia Tech alumni Twitter feed posted a black-and-white photo of the scene at Grant Field in 1918. Decades before tailgates, prime-time kickoffs and billions in program-supporting TV money, the ethos of the die-hard college football fan was not much different than today: Risks be damned, we’re going to the game. And once fans are allowed back in stadiums, history has shown that football could come back strong. “That’s really what started the big boom of college football in the 1920s,” said Jeremy Swick, historian at the College Football Hall of Fame. “People were ready. They were back from war. They wanted to play football again. There weren’t as many restrictions about going out. You could enroll back in school pretty easily. You see a great level of talent come back into the atmosphere. There’s new money. It started to get to the roar of the Roaring ’20s and that’s when you see the stadiums arm race. Who can build the biggest and baddest stadium?”
A comeback seems a long away off even as some schools try to prepare for what many hope will be a full season this fall. For now, headlines are still dominated by discussions about what can be done safely. “I think a lot of people will hesitate to attend sporting events as spectators until there is a proven vaccine,” Georgia Tech professor of sports history Johnny Smith said. “I think there are parallels in what we can learn from 1918 in terms of how we respond to a pandemic,” Smith added. “The cities that were hesitant and didn’t impose closure orders as quickly had far more fatalities. I think the lesson we can draw in general from 1918 about how to respond to a pandemic is that closure orders and social distancing is effective.” College football back then was already trying to field teams amid the lingering effects of World War I. There were restrictions on travel, practice and number of games played. The storied Army-Navy game was canceled in 1918 and the lone postseason game was the 1919 Tournament East-West game in Pasadena, California, a game better known today as the Rose Bowl. The pandemic sickened players and coaches, shortened seasons and even forced some universities to scrap their seasons. On Oct. 13, 1918, The Washington Post carried a story that declared the epidemic “sweeping the country has dealt the death blow to necessary preparations, and with the stage still undetermined, the outlook is anything but bright.” Penn coach Bob Folwell, better known as the first coach of the New York Giants, was hospitalized with Spanish flu and missed six weeks during the 1918 season. West Virginia failed to field a team and at least one player died when he ignored a cold that morphed into the virus. The Missouri Valley Conference, which included Kansas, Kansas State and Missouri, shut down for the season. Pittsburgh and Michigan shared the national championship, though neither team played more than five games and all but one was held in November. In September 1918, the second and by far deadliest wave hit in the U.S., the final blow for teams trying to schedule a full season. The headlines that followed included “Masks for Michigan Men” (Daily Pennsylvanian, Oct. 23) and “Rough Year For Football, But Game Shows Its Mettle” (Chicago Daily Tribune, Oct. 21). “A lot of them closed up camp, especially once the second wave hit,” Swick said.
The pandemic killed more than 50 million people worldwide, including 675,000 in the United States. Even with lower numbers in 2020, Smith said, fans will still be cautious. “I think generally people are going to be more hesitant to return to stadiums today,” Smith said. “I think there will be a certain segment of the population that is more concerned about a second wave. That’s another lesson to keep in mind from 1918.” And if fans are allowed, what rules will be in place? The bleak question looms large should campuses open to students in the fall: Is it safe to pack fans inside The Swamp or The ’Shoe if the pandemic is still on?
“I think when we look back on this idea of people wearing masks to attend a football game and raise the question today, would people do that? I’m not sure that people would,” Smith said. College football commissioners in mid-April insisted sports cannot be played this fall if campuses are not open, a stance echoed by NCAA President Mark Emmert. Still, schools are working hard to find ways to play, and there are encouraging signs even if campuses are not fully open in the traditional sense. Much more is at stake from a century ago: TV money, bowl games, conference championships, cross-country travel all need to be sorted out. In 1918, there were no more than 90 college football teams. There are 130 major college football teams alone in 2020, spread across 41 states and competing in 10 conferences, save for a handful of independents. To play or not to play is still the essential dilemma a century later but football — and sports — will return at some point, as it did in 1919. The Ogden Standard noted after the sport’s yearlong break in the state it was “anxiously awaiting the rustle of the cleated shoes, the line plunges of victory and the return of the greatest of all college sports.” “People really wanted to get back to their lives,” Smith said. “Sports is all about the human experience, human connection. We’re not meant to isolated. That’s a frustration a lot of people have in 1918 and today. I think people not being able to attend sporting events is symbolic of a larger sense of loss in America.”

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a document only dated “May:” new guidelines for reopening the American economy in the wake of the coronavirus. CNBC reported that the federal agency has not held a coronavirus briefing for more than two months.  The CDC guidance suggests using a three-phase re-opening strategy. “This document briefly summarizes CDC’s initiatives, activities, and tools in support of the Whole-of-Government response to COVID-19,” the 60-page document stated: The plan for reopening America outlines a three-phased approach for reducing community mitigation measures while protecting vulnerable populations. The phased approach can be implemented statewide or community-by-community at governors’ discretion. The guidelines propose the use of six “gating” indicator to assess when to move through from one mitigation phase to another. Those “gating” indicators include decreases in new coronavirus cases, decreases in emergency department visits for coronavirus or COVID-like illnesses, decreases in emergency room influenza-like illnesses; decrease in percentage of SARs-CoV-2 positive tests, “treat all patients without crisis care,” and a “robust testing program.” Under the “Guidance on Infection Control and Contact” heading the CDC names “focus areas” as long-term care facilities, assisted living facilities, dialysis facilities, dental facilities, ambulatory care facilities, pharmacies, emergency medical services, food processing facilities, and correctional facilities and businesses, including links to the specific guidance for each. It also provides links to CDC guidance on protecting “critical infrastructure workers.” The guidance includes specific instructions for reopening day care centers, schools, and day camps, “employers with workers at high risk,” restaurants and bars, and mass transit administrators. Here is a sampling of the CDC guidance: President Donald Trump released a 18-page “Opening Up America Again” document last month. Follow Penny Starr on Twitter

Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) warned of Democrats’ political exploitation of the coronavirus outbreak as a pretext to nationally implement all-mail voting and ballot harvesting, offering his remarks on Thursday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow. Marlow recalled Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez’s claim that President Donald Trump’s opposition to nationwide vote-by-mail proposals is is an attempt to “steal the election.” Perez’s statement amounts to “Democratic hysterics over at the DNC,” replied Cotton. Cotton said, “There have been lots of false predictions about this virus, and especially about the policy responses to it now for two months. Do you remember in early April there was demand that Wisconsin cancel its primary or go to all-mail voting? That didn’t happen. Their predictions that tens of thousands of people were going to die from standing in line at voting places. That obviously hasn’t happened. To my knowledge, there’s been no evidence linking that primary election in Wisconsin to any surge in cases.” Cotton continued, “States ought to be able to conduct the elections as they see fit. We ought not allow the Democratic Party to use this pandemic at the time to fulfill their wish list of same-day registration, of all-mail voting, [and] of ballot harvesting that creates the kind of fraud that we’ve seen in places like California and North Carolina. We have to protect the integrity of our elections, especially in the middle of a pandemic.” LISTEN:  Democrats regularly call for vote-by-mail and ballot-harvesting as necessary measures above and beyond social distancing and the wearing of masks to ensure safe elections during the coronavirus outbreak.

A man in Singapore has been sentenced to death via a Zoom call, as the country remains on lockdown because of the coronavirus. The judge sentenced Punithan Genasan, 37, on Friday for his role in spearheading a 2011 drug deal that involved a heroin transaction. Its the second known case where a death sentence was delivered remotely because of the coronavirus pandemic. “For the safety of all involved in the proceedings, the hearing for Public Prosecutor v. Punithan A/L Genasan was conducted by video-conferencing,” a spokesperson for Singapore’s Supreme Court told Reuters. The vast majority of court hearings in Singapore, however, have been postponed until at least June 1 because of government shutdowns due to the coronavirus. Genasan’s lawyer, Peter Fernando, said his client is thinking about appealing the ruling. Singapore has a strict policy on the use of illicit drugs and uses capital punishment to deal with drug-related offenses. In 2013, 18 people were executed — the highest amount in two decades, according to Amnesty International. Of those executed, 11 were charged with drug-related offenses, BBC News reported. Singapore imposed a partial lockdown in early April after a second wave of coronavirus cases caused by foreign workers living in crowded conditions. The government plans to reopen beginning next month gradually. The city-state recorded 29,812 confirmed cases of the virus, with 24 deaths as of Thursday.

Karl Manke, a 77-year-old barber in Owosso, Michigan, has defeated Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Attorney General Dana Nessel in court for the second time in about a week. The Argus-Press reported: Judge Matthew Stewart ruled that Karl Manke will not have to close his shop after the state again failed to prove he was an imminent danger to public health. Stewart said the state did not arrest Manke when he was cited, so he didn’t represent “an imminent health danger.” “(The attorney general) has not presented any studies underlying the doctor’s conclusion. (The attorney general) has not shown any nexus between the cutting of hair and an increased risk of transmission,” Stewart wrote, the Detroit Free Press reported. “(The attorney general’s) filings rest more on general facts about COVID-19 than specific practices or conditions at (Manke’s) business.” Nessel’s office said she would appeal the ruling. The Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs suspended Manke’s license without a hearing. “It’s an unbelievable abuse of power,” attorney David Kallman told radio host Steve Gruber, stating there is no legal basis for the action. “This is pure retribution by the governor’s office and by the AG. This is so petty and vindictive, it’s beyond the pale,” Kallman said. After her defeat, Nessel attacked Manke publicly. We want him to discontinue his conduct, which we think is aiding and abetting the spread of the virus,” Nessel claimed. “Mr. Manke,” she sighed, “He’s not a hero, he’s not a patriot. A patriot is a person that fights all enemies, foreign and domestic, and does everything possible to protect his fellow countrymen and countrywomen.” “To me, Mr. Manke is doing just the opposite of that and he’s being selfish in his behavior,” the attorney general declared.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-NY) on Wednesday attempted to shift blame for his state’s nursing home coronavirus deaths on to President Trump, saying he was merely following guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Cuomo has received harsh criticism for a now-reversed March 25 directive regarding nursing homes, which reads: “No resident [of a nursing home] shall be denied re-admission or admission to the NH [nursing home] solely based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19. NHs are prohibited from requiring a hospitalized resident who is determined medically stable to be tested for COVID-19 prior to admission or readmission.” This week, Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) called for a federal investigation into Cuomo and his administration over the handling of this nursing home policy. As of Tuesday, over 5,800 nursing home and adult care facility residents have died from the illness.  A partial transcript is as follows:  REPORTER #1: There is a call for a federal probe into how the state handled the nursing home situation, specifically the March executive order allowing COVID-positive patients back into the nursing homes. In reflecting on those comments, I was wondering why was that executive order made at the time? GOV. ANDREW CUOMO: Look, this is a political season, I get it. I have refrained from politics. I’m not going to get into the political back and forth, but anyone who wants to ask why did the state do that with COVID patients and nursing home, it’s because the state followed President Trump’s CDC guidance. So they should ask President Trump. I think that will stop the conversation. QUESTION: Are you fudging the numbers? Because that’s the accusation that you’re facing, that you are changing the numbers to make— GOV. CUOMO: —Let’s do one at a time. Your first point, why did the state do that? Because the state followed president Trump’s CDC guidance, okay? That’s that answer. No numbers were changed. REPORTER #2: But governor, you’ve shown a willingness to thwart president Trump at other times. Why on that March 25th memo did you not thwart him? Why did you follow CDC guidance? And do you regret that? GOV. CUOMO: No, not at all. REPORTER #2: I mean, considering the death toll? GOV. CUOMO: Well, you have to remember the facts. I know you’re the New York Times, but facts are still facts, right? Even at the Times, okay? Here are the facts. The CDC guidance said a nursing home cannot discriminate against the COVID patient because, at that time, the issue was hospital capacity, right? Remember the hospital capacity? And we were dramatically increasing hospital capacity. If a person doesn’t need an urgent care bed in a hospital because they are not urgently ill and they have—it can take two weeks to test negative when you’re no longer urgently ill, is the best use of a hospital bed to have somebody sit there for two weeks in a hospital bed when they don’t need the hospital bed because they are not urgently ill, they’re just waiting to test negative on the antibody test, which can take two weeks, and you need that hospital bed for somebody, who may die without it. The second fact, a nursing home cannot accept a patient who they are not qualified to handle. For a COVID patient, a nursing home must say “I can quarantine, I can isolate, I have the right staff, I have the right PPE,” or else that nursing home should not take that patient and, the third point, we always had alternative beds. Any nursing home that says “I can’t take that COVID patient,” for whatever reason, I don’t even care what the reason is, “I don’t have the staff, I don’t have the time, I’m overstressed, I don’t have the PPE,” we always have alternative beds. We have had alternative beds all throughout this. We never got to a place where we were bumping up against the capacity. So any nursing home could just say, “I can’t handle a COVID person in my facility.”

The nation’s capital may begin a phased reopening on May 29, more than a week earlier than anticipated, after shutting down to get a handle on the novel coronavirus pandemic, Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) announced on Thursday, citing a low transmission rate and a decline in community spread. On May 13, Bowser extended the district’s stay-at-home measure to June 8, noting that she could “revise this order at any time.” However, the outbreak of COVID-19, the coronavirus illness, appears to be on a downward trajectory in D.C., allowing officials to consider beginning a phased reopening on May 29, “barring any new peaks” in community spread and the transmission rate, Bowser said during a press conference. Thank you to all who contributed their time and recommendations to the ReOpen DC Advisory Committee. ReOpen DC brings us all together to reopen with a plan based on science and tailored to the needs of our community. To read the full presentation visit https://t.co/Jmt2AtJ6Cm. https://t.co/akwkYaqpGy — Mayor Muriel Bowser #StayHomeDC (@MayorBowser) May 21, 2020  “It is not an on and off switch. We will not be able to go back to life as we enjoyed it in February,” she noted. “But we are incrementally adding activities back in our lives, which we all miss and are all eager to get back to. Staying open and being able to manage this virus means we all have to do our part.” She urged D.C. residents to continue taking measures to prevent the spread of the virus, such as wearing masks, social distancing, practicing good hygiene, and getting tested if necessary. “Reopening means that more people will be mixing, more activities will be opening, and there will be more infections in the city,” Bowser warned. The mayor reported “11 days of a sustained decline in community spread,” adding that the transmission rate is now at “nine days below one.” According to the D.C. reopening guidelines, there must be a 14-day decrease in community spread, and the transmission rate must be below one for three days to reopen. “We’re also very focused on our testing capacity, and presently we have the ability to test all of our four priority groups,” Bowser said, later adding, “We are close to where we need to be with contact tracing to be able to meet the goals laid out by the [D.C.] Department of Health.” Health experts consider the number of hospitalizations to be an essential measure of the severity of the ongoing outbreak. According to the district’s data, the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations has declined in recent weeks. D.C. has hundreds of available beds to deal with the ongoing pandemic and a possible increase in cases. As of Thursday afternoon, data compiled by the Harvard Global Health Institute placed the hospital bed occupancy rate at 0.72 and the Intensive Care Unit occupancy rate at 0.6. The nation’s capital continues to see an increase in the cumulative number of cases and deaths. Over 41,750 people have tested positive for COVID-19, and 412 others have reportedly perished from the virus in D.C.

Victoria’s Secret will permanently close around 250 stores in the U.S. and Canada in 2020, parent company L Brands announced Wednesday. The company made the announcement Wednesday in their first-quarter fiscal report. The parent company L Brands has said it plans to spin-off Bath & Body Works and operate Victoria’s Secret as a standalone business. L Brands was founded in 1963 by Leslie H. Wexner in Columbus, Ohio. Wexner was the only known client of disgraced money manager Jeffrey Epstein, who was found dead in a New York jail cell in 2019. The company has been hard hit by the economic turmoil of the coronavirus. Nearly all of its stores in the U.S. closed in March and those that will reopen are not expected to open until July. L Brands said its overall sales for the three months ended May 2 fell 37 percent compared with a year ago. Gross profit fell 59 percent. The company lost $275.2 million in the quarter, compared with net income of $40.3 a year ago. Profits per share were down 807 percent for a loss of 99 cents per share.

President Donald Trump expressed his interest at the White House on Thursday in getting more churches reopened despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. He blamed Democrat governors for keeping churches closed. “The churches are not being treated with respect by a lot of the Democrat governors,” Trump commented to reporters as he left the White House for a trip to Michigan on Thursday afternoon. “I want to get our churches open, and we’re going to take a very strong position on that very soon,” he added. When reporters asked him if he would include mosques in his effort, he said he would. Recent reports revealed that the White House disputed proposed Centers for Disease Control guidelines prepared for the reopening of churches, delaying their release. A Trump administration official told CNBC that the White House wanted a more federal approach to the guidelines. The White House reaffirmed the president’s interest in getting churches reopened. “Not only is it good for the community; it’s their right under the Constitution to worship freely without government intrusion,” White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere said to CNBC. “The Trump Administration will always protect that right and continue to partner with states to ensure congregations are properly protected as restrictions are responsibly eased.”

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) on Wednesday opted to withdraw the harsh emergency rule his administration filed last Friday, which criminalized business owners violating his stay-at-home order. The emergency rule had noncompliant businesses facing a Class A misdemeanor for reopening against the governor’s orders — an action that could have carried jail time or a fine of up to $2,500. A Pritzker spokesperson, at the time, described the rule as an “additional enforcement tool for businesses that refuse to comply with the most critical aspects of the stay-at-home order.” The governor faced a slew of backlash and, while he has continued to defend the sentiment of the rule — praising it for giving “more flexibility” in the enforcement of his orders —  he is urging the legislature to come up with a measure “with the same intended mechanism in a phased manner in line with the Restore Illinois plan.” “Enacting this measure through legislation will allow us to have these tools throughout the Restore Illinois plan versus an emergency rule that would be withdrawn and rewritten at the start of phase three and then phase four,” Pritzker explained. It quickly became clear that Pritzker’s emergency rule lacked teeth, as his administration’s general counsel, Ann Spillane, admitted that “nobody’s getting arrested or handcuffed.” “But they are getting a citation where they would have to go to court,” Spillane stated. Additionally, the Illinois State Police released a statement, clarifying that the department would not “issue any criminal misdemeanors to individuals for violations of temporary emergency rules or executive orders.” “The Illinois State Police will only apply those emergency rules to entities such as corporations, LLPs or other business entities consistent with state and constitutional law,” the department stated, stressing that officers would not arrest an individual for violating the governor’s executive orders or emergency rules. “We encourage all citizens to continue to do their part to maintain public health as we move forward in the days ahead with Reopening Illinois,” the department added. Republican state Rep. Steven Reick, who serves on the Joint Commission on Administrative Rules (JCAR), said his office received a surge of feedback from residents, expressing resistance to Pritzker’s rule. “He’s got executive authority to issue his orders, but the fact is that if he really wants the public support he needs to bring the General Assembly into this process so that we can exercise our right to represent our constituents,” Reick said, according to the Center Square. Another Republican lawmaker, state Sen. Dave Syverson, described the withdrawal of the rule as a “big win.” “The idea of criminally charging small business owners for trying to stay open to support their families was something the Senate Republicans strongly opposed,” he said. “This was a big win on our first day back in Springfield,” he continued. “I am glad that, with the help of a large public outcry, we were able to defeat this rule change.” Other Democrat governors have struggled in enforcing their severe lockdown measures, losing the battles in the courts — like in Wisconsin — and among local authorities. A handful of district attorneys in Pennsylvania, for instance, have stated that they will not prosecute businesses reopening against Gov. Tom Wolf’s (D) orders — a decision that even Wolf admitted he would not challenge.

Thursday on Fox Business Network’s “Cavuto,” Job Creators Network CEO Alfredo Ortiz discussed his organization’s full-page ad in The Wall Street Journal that calls for a “second opinion” to Dr. Anthony Fauci’s on the coronavirus shutdown. Ortiz said, “At the end of the day, it is not about the economy versus life but life versus life. Some of the folks insisting continuing shutdown would be on some phone calls I’m getting directly from small business owners across the country, friends of mine who have been in business for decades who are strong supporters of the community in tears because overnight, effectively they have seen their entire life savings and life dreams just up in smoke because of something the government drove, which is a government shutdown. This is not about economy versus life. It is about life versus life. This is real-life people being impacted on a grand scale. We saw jobless claims today, Neil. Look at numbers. We’re talking almost 30 million jobless claims right now, 15% unemployment.” He continued, “That’s why we took the full-page ad out in The Wall Street Journal about today asking Dr. Fauci for a second opinion because this is real. He brought up some good points, but we do need the second opinion because we needed indicated decisions to be able to make these really, what I’m calling massive decisions whether to open, whether to close.” He added, “That is all I think we’re saying being respectful here. Dr. Fauci is it great American. He’s done fantastic things for our country. All we are asking for is a second opinion, so we make educated decisions as Americans.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Thursday on MSNBC’s “Andrea Mitchell Reports,” Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said to be a model for the American people President Donald Trump should be wearing a face mask amid the coronavirus pandemic because “real men wear face masks.” Mitchell asked, “The president is now leaving for Michigan. He’s going into a state that requires wearing a face covering. He hasn’t said yet, as far as I know, whether he is going to wear a mask. He has not been seen wearing one, and he’s also, as you know, done things that go against CDC guidelines and against FDA warnings in taking a risky medication. Mayor Garcetti, what should the president do in terms of the way he models behavior for the rest of the country?” Garcetti said, “Simply put, he’s our commander-in-chief. I say real men wear face masks when they’re going to be with other people in public. It’s our gateway to increasing freedom and more economic activity and greater opening up. I think modeling that is something so important for all of our leaders, and any men who don’t want to wear face masks got to get over ourselves and just do it.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Demand for drive-in movie theaters is surging in several states, as more people seek out entertainment from the comfort of their vehicles in the wake of the deadly Chinese coronavirus. What may be a mixture of coronavirus concerns and an appetite for nostalgia has caused pop-up drive-in movie theaters to appear in several states, including, Texas, New Jersey, Wisconsin, Georgia, New York and more. “It’s been like when you have a big summer movie like Avengers or something like that come out, except that right now we’re playing movies that you can see at home,” said Andrew Thomas, the owner of Showboat drive-in theater in Houston, Texas, of his businesses’ recent “off the charts” popularity, according to a report by Houston Chronicle.

(Stephanie Keith/Getty Images) The report added that Showboat was the Houston area’s only drive-in movie theater — until recently. A similar situation is unfolding in New Jersey, as drive-in movie theaters are popping up across the state, according to a report by NJ.com. New Jersey’s Berkeley Township, Brick Township, Jackson Township, Hillsdale, Northvale, Sayreville, and Vineland all have new pop-up drive-ins available, following the state’s governor Phil Murphy approving the initiative. Even Nantucket residents will have the nostalgic opportunity available to them, as the Dreamland Film & Cultural Center is the final steps of securing a location for a drive-in theater on the island in Massachusetts, according to a report by the Inquirer and Mirror.

(KARIM SAHIB/AFP via Getty Images) In Franklin, Wisconsin — just outside of Milwaukee — a new drive-in theater called Milky Way Drive-In is set to open on Friday, according to a report by Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Meanwhile, in Madison, Wisconsin, The Mallards celebrated opening night of the new drive-in theater at Warner Park with 100 cars parked in the outfield, reports 15 WMTV. And in Atlanta, Georgia, residents are also enjoying the drive-in theater experience after the city’s Plaza Theater — Atlanta’s oldest operating cinema — has reopened as a temporarily transformed drive-in theater, according to Eater Atlanta. The report added that the new drive-in movie theater includes food delivered from local Atlanta restaurants. Moreover, two new drive-in movie theaters are coming to Miami, Florida, this week. The first of the two drive-ins will be on May 22 at the Dezerland theme park in North Miami, with the second set to open up on May 24 in Miami Beach at the parking lot on Collins Avenue and 46th Street.

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is giving $5 million to Andrew Yang’s universal basic income group called Humanity Forward. The donation to Humanity Forward comes as the CEO is looking to give away $1 billion of his wealth from his other company, Square, to his fund called Start Small, as a way to combat the coronavirus. Dorsey announced the donation on Yang’s podcast Yang Speaks. On the podcast, Dorsey told Yang that a universal basic income (UBI) was “long overdue,” and “the only way we can change policy is by experimenting and showing case studies of why this works.” Yang says Humanity Forward plans to distribute Dorsey’s gift in the form of cash grants totaling $250 a piece to nearly 20,000 people who have lost their jobs or have suffered economically as a result of the coronavirus. Humanity Forward has already given away $2 million in direct cash assistance to help people suffering from the coronavirus crisis. “Not only will Jack’s donation directly impact tens of thousands of people in need during the current economic downturn, it will help Humanity Forward and our movement continue to make a case for universal basic income in the United States,” Yang said in a statement. “We know UBI for every American is possible, and this $5 million from Start Small is going to help demonstrate what is possible for families across the country,” the statement continued. As a presidential candidate, Yang made having a universal basic income the centerpiece of his campaign platform, claiming it would improve everything from health care to graduation rates. Yang’s message helped him gain a following among Dorsey, Tesla founder Elon Musk, and other tech entrepreneurs, but he exited the race after some disappointing results in Iowa and New Hampshire.

Appearing Thursday on CNN’s New Day, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel (D) urged President Donald Trump to wear a face mask during his tour of a Ford manufacturing plant, suggesting that he could be banned from unclosed facilities in the state if he opts against wearing one. I joined @CNN this morning to discuss President Trump's visit to the Ypsilanti Ford plant today and my letter that asks he adheres to safety guidelines and wear a mask during his visit.pic.twitter.com/A8rWGgeLnE — Dana Nessel (@dananessel) May 21, 2020  A partial transcript is as follows:  ALISYN CAMEROTA: You felt so strongly about this that you wrote a letter to the White House asking the president to wear a mask. Why did you think that was necessary? DANA NESSEL: Obviously, here in Michigan, we’ve been particularly hard hit by the COVID-19 crisis. We’ve lost over 5,000 of our state residents and we have well over 50,000 infections. Our auto manufacturing facilities just went back online on Monday, but there was a carefully negotiated agreement that became law between the auto manufacturers and the UAW. There are a number of requirements in place — one, that there not be any visits by outsiders to the plants anyway, but we’re waiving that — but also that there be six-foot distancing between people in the plant, people be properly screened before they enter, and lately, that they wear a facial covering in order to protect themselves and in order to protect the workers. We are just asking that President Trump comply with the law of our state — just like we would make the same request of anyone else in those plants. CAMEROTA: You also point out that President Trump has been exposed. His personal valet tested positive, so you write in your letter: “Anyone who has potentially been exposed, including the President of the United States, has not only a legal responsibility, but also a social and moral to take reasonable precautions to prevent further spread of the virus.” In terms of the legal responsibility, you’re the chief law enforcement officer for your state, so what if he doesn’t wear a mask? NESSEL: Obviously, we’re asking that he do that. For most people, of course, legally they can be held accountable… if he fails to wear a mask, he’s going to be asked not to return to any unclosed facilities inside our state. I know that Ford has asked him to do the same thing. But if we know that he’s coming to our state and we know he’s not going to follow the law, I think we’re gonna have to take action against any company or any facility that allows him inside those facilities and puts our workers at risk. We just simply can’t afford it here in our state… If President Trump doesn’t care about his own health, doesn’t care about the health and the safety of people who work in those facilities, at least care about the economic situation of costing these facilities so much money by having to close down and having to disinfect the plant after he leaves.

Pennsylvania cannot fully return to normal until a “foolproof” vaccine is available, Gov. Tom Wolf (D) said on Wednesday. When asked if the return of large events are contingent on a vaccination, Wolf said Pennsylvanians need to be confident that the novel coronavirus is under control and treatable. He said he believes it will take a vaccine or “some assurance that they’re not going to get sick” to attend big events, go shopping, and return to school. “Ultimately I think what it’s going to take for everybody to feel safe going to a Penn State game or a basketball game is that they have some confidence that they’re not going to get sick by being in close contact with somebody else,” Wolf said, noting that the state is focusing on testing and contact tracing. “I think that’s what it’s going to take to really get our economy back to normal, and I really think that can’t happen fully, 100 percent until we have a vaccine that is foolproof,” Wolf said. “That’s my own stance.” Two other Democrat governors have also hinged their hopes of future normalcy on the development and availability of a vaccine. “Until a proven vaccine is widely available, we cannot firmly enter the ‘new normal,’ when life will once again return to all our workplaces, downtowns, and main streets,” New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D) stated bluntly on Monday: Until a proven vaccine is widely available, we cannot firmly enter the “new normal,” when life will once again return to all our workplaces, downtowns, and main streets. Posted by Governor Phil Murphy on Monday, May 18, 2020 California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) also said the Golden State would not be “going back to normal” until a vaccine is available. “We’re not going back to normal,” the governor said at a press briefing this month. “It’s a new normal with adaptations and modifications, until we get to immunity and a vaccine.” While their dependence on the development of a vaccine remains prevalent, there is no guarantee that one will come — at least in a timely manner. No other vaccine for other coronavirus forms has ever been approved. President Trump has remained positive about the development of a vaccination, noting the “staggeringly good” test results of the coronavirus vaccine from Moderna. Trump also said this month that he is already involved in the process of mobilizing the military to distribute the vaccine as soon as it is developed, adding that “at the end of the year, we’re going to be able to give it to a lot of people very, very rapidly.” “Unless you’re mobilized and ready, you’re not going to be able to do it for a long time. So we’re starting now,” he added. Regardless, though, President Trump said the country is moving forward. “I just want to make something clear,” the president said during a press conference in the Rose Garden last week. “It’s very important, vaccine or no vaccine, we’re back.”

A recent report from researchers at Carnegie Mellon University claims that nearly half of the Twitter accounts tweeting about the Chinese virus are likely bots. NPR reports that a recent study by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University claims that it is likely that half of the Twitter accounts discussing the Wuhan coronavirus are bots, the common name for automated accounts that interact with and attempt to mimic normal human users. Researchers examined more than 200 million tweets discussing the virus since January and found that about 45 percent were sent by accounts that act more like an automated program than humans. The researchers stated that it is too early to determine who is controlling the bot accounts but that tweets from the accounts appeared to be aiming to sow division amongst Americans. Kathleen Carley, a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University who is one of the authors of a study analyzing bot-generated coronavirus activity on Twitter, stated: “We do know that it looks like it’s a propaganda machine, and it definitely matches the Russian and Chinese playbooks, but it would take a tremendous amount of resources to substantiate that.” Researchers identified over 100 false narratives about the virus being pushed by bots across Twitter, including theories that hospitals were filled with mannequins or that 5G cell signal towers were the source of the virus. “We’re seeing up to two times as much bot activity as we’d predicted based on previous natural disasters, crises and elections,” Carley said. Researchers flagged accounts that tweet more than is humanly possible or claim to be in multiple countries within a few hours period as possible bots. “When we see a whole bunch of tweets at the same time or back to back, it’s like they’re timed,” Carley said. “We also look for use of the same exact hashtag, or messaging that appears to be copied and pasted from one bot to the next.” Breitbart News reported this week that the Chinese government has launched a massive Twitter information campaign, more than doubling the number of official government tweets since January and in recent days attempting to spread a conspiracy theory that the Wuhan coronavirus came from a U.S. government lab. On May 8, the spokesperson for China’s Foreign Affairs Ministry posted a sweet that has been liked more than 4,000 times which reads: “The #US keeps calling for transparency & investigation. Why not open up Fort Detrick & other bio-labs for international review? Why not invite #WHO & int’l experts to the US to look into #COVI19 source & response?” Chinese accounts have published more than 90,000 tweets since the beginning of April from 200 diplomatic and state-run media accounts in a massive Wuhan coronavirus information war according to a study of data collected by the Hamilton 2.0 dashboard of the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a tool aggregating accounts connected to the Chinese government. Analysis by Bret Schafer, the digital disinformation fellow at the alliance, based in Washington, D.C., found that Twitter output from China’s official sites has almost doubled since January and the number of diplomatic Twitter accounts has tripled to 135 from 40 accounts at this time las year. Schafer stated that the Chinese accounts “have become more aggressive, more conspiratorial, and the ones who have done that are their most popular accounts and have by far the most engagement.” Schafer said that the Twitter account for the Chinese Embassy in France “has significantly more followers than the embassy in Poland, for example, because the embassy in France has been a driver of the most aggressive content.” Read more at Breitbart News here.

Alec Baldwin made clear what he thinks about America, launching a fake news filled rant attacking Americans who’ve spent years praising the country’s greatness. The Left-wing actor also blamed President Donald Trump for those killed by the Chinese coronavirus. Baldwin called Trump a “maniac” responsible for overseeing “one of the worst [coronavirus] responses in the world.” “Americans have spent decades telling the world how great we [are],” the Boss Baby star said. “Actually, we don’t shut up about it. And yet we have more deaths from this crisis than anywhere. We have had [one] of the worst responses in the world. Trump didn’t cause the virus, but he spread it. Trump is a maniac.” Americans have spent decades telling the world how great we r. Actually, we don’t shut up about it.And yet we have more deaths from this crisis than anywhere. We have had 1 of the worst responses in the world. Trump didn’t cause the virus, but he spread it.Trump is a maniac. — HABFoundation (@ABFalecbaldwin) May 21, 2020  America has recorded the highest number of coronavirus cases worldwide but Sweden holds the highest death rate par capita. Furthermore, experts are still trying to understand the Chinese coronavirus. There is a level of unpredictability over the aggressiveness of contagion. Some of the world’s worst-hit countries have also been the most-developed, such as the United Kingdom, Belgium, Spain, and Italy, all of whom have a far higher per capita death rate than the United States. Baldwin’s unhinged rant didn’t mention China, which hid the truth about the deadly decease from the world, allowing it to spread and eventually throw economies across the globe into economic depression. In the U.S., Democratic governors like Andrew Cuomo in New York, pushed through rules that sent sick nursing home patients back into their respective facilities, killing thousands of people. Baldwin didn’t mention that mess. Meanwhile, extremely poor or even conflict-stricken states such as Venezuela, Yemen, and Ethiopia have all reported less than 1,000 cases, although in reality these numbers are likely higher due to lack of testing. Baldwin, however, has always shown little regard for the finer details of political debate. Earlier this month, the Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol star said Trump suffers from a “degenerative mental illness that is costing 1000’s of lives.” Baldwin also attacked Trump supporters, labeling them as “mentally ill” and declaring them responsible for the “near moral collapse” of the United States.

Pennsylvania congressional Democrats remain silent on Gov. Tom Wolf’s (D) decision to put coronavirus-infected patients in nursing homes, while Pennsylvania Republicans chastised the governor for endangering the state’s elderly in exclusive statements to Breitbart News. Wolf, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), and New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D) have all received intense backlash for forcing nursing homes to accept coronavirus-infected patients. At least partly due to the order, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania have three of the four highest deaths in long-term care facilities, or nursing homes. Wolf came under such controversy that he said on Monday that he would be open to a federal investigation into this administration’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak in nursing homes. Breitbart News wrote about how New York and New Jersey congressional Democrats have remained silent on their governors’ decision to mandate that long-term care facilities host coronavirus patients. Breitbart News sent comment requests to Pennsylvania’s congressional delegation, House and Senate, and Democrats have ignored the request for comment. The Pennsylvania Democrats that ignored the comment request include: Several Pennsylvania Republicans chided Wolf for endangering some of the state’s most vulnerable citizens. Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA) told Breitbart News, “It is clear that aggressive measures should have been taken in Pennsylvania to protect nursing home residents and prevent outbreaks in long-term care facilities, particularly in those the PA Department of Health knew were ill-equipped to control the spread of the virus.” Rep. Scott Perry (R-PA) called for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to investigate the governor’s handling of the coronavirus last week. Perry wrote in an op-ed last week: When the Congressional Delegation and the leadership of the State Legislature inquired to Gov. Wolf about the inordinate amount of COVID-19 fatalities in elder care, assisted living and nursing facilities, we received a familiar response: silence. Nearly 70% of all COVID-19 deaths in Pennsylvania have occurred in nursing and long-term care facilities. Governor Wolf has failed to protect our most vulnerable populations, and he’s shown little desire to modify his decisions that continue to have devastating effects on our most at-risk population. The Pennsylvania Republican delegation slammed Wolf for failing to protect the elderly Pennsylvanians and chastised Levine for pulling a family member out of the nursing home while preventing small businesses from operating. Rep. Fred Keller (R-PA) told Breitbart News, “From failing to protect older Pennsylvanians from the spread of COVID-19 in nursing homes while allowing a top cabinet official to pull a family member out of a similar facility, to refusing to allow small businesses to safely resume work despite the fact that we’ve successfully flattened the curve, Gov. Wolf’s coronavirus response has been nothing short of an unmitigated mess. It is clear that the governor lacks a coherent plan to deal with this pandemic, and the public health and economic impacts have been devastating as a result.” Rep. John Joyce (R-PA) told Breitbart News, “Since the onset of the coronavirus crisis, I have called on Gov. Wolf to be transparent and forthcoming with the people of Pennsylvania. It is deeply concerning that the Wolf administration continues to move the goal posts as we seek to recover from the health and economic ramifications of this outbreak. We should be focused on protecting the lives and livelihoods of Pennsylvanians – including our seniors and residents of long-term care facilities. As I have said before, the Wolf administration must consider the comprehensive health needs of our communities and take action to serve Pennsylvanians across the Commonwealth.” Other conservative lawmakers have noted that Wolf’s administration has especially harmed elderly Pennsylvanians, noting that nursing home deaths account for roughly 70 percent of total coronavirus deaths. “Secretary Levine’s decision to place COVID-19 positive patients back into nursing homes was misguided and dangerous. Elected officials managing this crisis must rely on the data to make informed decisions. Seniors are particularly vulnerable to this disease and should be treated with the utmost caution,” Rep. Dan Meuser (R-PA) said in a statement to Breitbart News. “Secretary Levine’s intent may have been to protect hospital capacity, but placing seniors with COVID-19 back into nursing homes where they could expose other high-risk individuals was short-sighted. As a result, these facilities have accounted for nearly 70 percent of fatalities across the Commonwealth.” “COVID-19 patients should never have been readmitted to long-term care facilities where the congregate settings and at-risk populations were needlessly endangered,” Rep. Lloyd Smucker (R-PA) told Breitbart News. “Congressman Smucker has stated that Gov. Tom Wolf has failed the people of Pennsylvania in his administration’s handling of nursing home issues. The public has since learned that the state Department of Health abandoned early intervention plans for nursing homes while simultaneously requiring them to admit patients who tested positive for COVID-19, allowing it to spread quickly in our most vulnerable communities.” Smucker said that he is “thankful that President Trump’s administration has been so supportive of the Commonwealth’s nursing home and long-term care facilities, by providing direct personal protective equipment shipments and dispatching teams of experts from the CDC to provide assistance to these hotspots.” One conservative said that Wolf and Levine have acted as “petty tyrants” while harming Pennsylvania small businesses and the state’s senior citizens. Rep. Guy Reschenthaler (R-PA) told Breitbart News, “Gov. Wolf, along with unelected bureaucrats in the Pennsylvania Department of Health, acted like petty tyrants by prioritizing shutting down small businesses rather than focusing on protecting our most vulnerable senior citizens. By forcing nursing homes to accept COVID-19 patients, Gov. Wolf put thousands of seniors in harm’s way, with nearly 70 percent of COVID-19 deaths in the state coming from these facilities. Gov. Wolf’s one-size-fits-all approach to fighting this pandemic has upended our economy and rendered one in four workers jobless, all while putting our seniors in care homes at greater risk.”

Thursday on ABC’s “The View,” Minority Leader Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY) said President Donald Trump is promoting an “already discredited conspiracy” theory with his Obamagate tweets instead of focusing on the coronavirus pandemic. Co-host Meghan McCain asked, “So Senator, President Trump has been nonstop tweeting about Obamagate, which stems from allegations Obama and senior officials used government power to spy on Trump’s campaign. Can you say with 100% certainty that this did not happen,, and it’s all a big Trump conspiracy theory to distract us?” Schumer said, “Well, I didn’t say it, 17 intelligence agencies—these are nonpartisan, these are people who have risked their lives for us, CIA, NSA— they said it. This came from the Russians who wanted to divert attention for what they did. He continued, “For the Senate and President Trump to spend time on this when we have a COVID crisis is just absolutely absurd. We should be focusing on helping people through this crisis, not pursuing already discredited conspiracy theories.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

A Texas dad recently drove more than 1,000 miles to surprise his daughter with a Chick-fil-A meal on her birthday. Julio Cesar Segura, 53, began his eight-and-a-half-hour journey from El Paso, Texas, to Austin, Texas, at 4:15 a.m on May 8 to visit his daughter, Diana Segura Lerma, on her 19th birthday. The dedicated dad and realtor spent 17 hours in the car and drove 1,152 miles only to spend 30 minutes with his daughter and to drop off her favorite Chick-fil-A sandwich — a chicken sandwich with pepper jack cheese, mayonnaise, and buffalo sauce. Julio and Diana each share a sandwich together for lunch as a tradition for her birthday. But this year was extra special for Diana since she did not expect her dad to show up at her residence. “He told me that since he couldn’t do much, he wanted to know what I’d like for lunch and he would send an Uber Eats order,” Diana told SWNS. “He brings me that sandwich for lunch on my birthday every year — so far he hasn’t missed a year.” But instead of a delivery driver, Diana opened her door to see her dad holding balloons, a Chick-fil-A bag, and posters wishing her a “Happy Birthday.” “I decided to go the day before. I love her and I wanted to make sure she had a good birthday,” Julio said. Diana felt shocked when she saw her father show up at her apartment. “I was so excited. I haven’t seen him in months, since winter break. I didn’t think that I would see him again until August,” she said. “He has always been someone who loves gestures, but I never imagined he would do this in a pandemic.” Although she was excited, she was a little upset she could not hug him. “When you see a loved one and they come so far to see you, it’s your instinct to hug them,” she said. Because they were concerned about the coronavirus, each of them ate their meals six feet apart on a terrace outside Diana’s apartment. Julio was happy with how his surprise turned out. “I was the driving the whole day, but I was so happy on the way back,” he said. “She deserved a good birthday.”

Shows like the hit CBS police procedural drama Blue Bloods are reportedly looking to employ robots, that use ultraviolet light to kill germs, to clean film sets when production restarts amid the Chinese coronavirus outbreak. The robots, priced at $125,000 each, are already used in many hospitals to kill off viruses on walls, counters, floors, and the like. They automatically roam a fixed area using ultraviolet (UV) light to kill germs, including the virus that causes COVID-19, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Donnie Wahlberg and Tom Selleck in Blue Bloods. Craig Blankenhorn/CBS Television Network The machines are made by Xenex Disinfection Services of San Antonio, Texas, under the trademarked name “Xenex Germ-Zapping Robot.” According to the Hollywood Reporter, the machine is being sought by the TV police drama starring Tom Selleck under the auspices of a brand new company offering disinfecting services for the film industry. The company, Production Safe Zone, is headed by Dr. Mark Stibich, who noted that the way we address pathogens lags far behind our scientific knowledge of the matter. “The way we like to think of it is that our pathogens, like coronavirus, have evolved — but our tools that clean the environment haven’t,” Dr. Stibich told the outlet. “We’re still basically using buckets and mops and wipes, and what we need is a new tool to reduce the risks that the environment may cause an infection.” A major obstacle to the venture is the Hollywood film crew unions that require union members to be in charge of every aspect of filmmaking. But Dr. Stibich says he is perfectly willing to sit down with the unions to create protocols. “We work hand in hand with the union, as we did in the hospitals, and train their people up so that we’re not bringing in some automated service that reduces the workforce,” Stibich said. Thus far, the unions have refused to comment on the idea. The technology is a proven issue. Hospitals all across the nation use similar machines to sanitize their facilities.

Tech giants Apple and Google have reportedly released the technology to automatically notify people if they have been exposed to individuals that have tested positive for the Wuhan coronavirus. The technology was produced by the two tech giants to allow iPhones and Android smartphones to communicate. AP News reports that tech giants Apple and Google released smartphone technology on Wednesday to notify users that they may have been in contact with individuals who have been exposed to the Wuhan coronavirus. 22 countries and several states in the United States are planning to build voluntary phone apps using their software. The contact tracing system relies on Bluetooth wireless technology to detect when someone who downloaded the app has spent time near another app user who has tested positive for the virus. Multiple governments have attempted to roll out their own phone apps since the beginning of the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic. Many of the apps have faced technical issues and have failed to be widely adopted, they also often use GPS track user’s price locations which Apple and Google have banned from their new tools for privacy and security reasons. Health agencies in Germany as well as in the U.S. states of Alabama and South Carolina have been waiting to use Apple and Google’s new system while other governments claim that the tech giant’s privacy restrictions make the system harder for public health workers to use. The tech firms claim that app users will be protected by encryption and anonymous identifier beacons that regularly change. The companies said in a joint statement: “User adoption is key to success and we believe that these strong privacy protections are also the best way to encourage use of these apps.” The statement from the firms also included comments from state officials in North Dakota, Alabama and South Carolina which appear to signal plans to use the new tech. North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a Republican, commented: “We invite other states to join us in leveraging smartphone technologies to strengthen existing contact tracing efforts, which are critical to getting communities and economies back up and running.” Breitbart News reported in April that privacy experts are warning that this tracing tech could be an invasion of user privacy.  Klon Kitchen, a technology analyst at the Heritage Foundation, told MarketWatch: “All of this could be abused. But information that could be used is already being collected.” But he added, “They have a vested interest in getting the economy up and running, and getting their engineers back in the building, and the government lacks the ability to do this.” Josephine Wolff, a cybersecurity policy professor at The Fletcher School at Tufts University, commented on the tech stating: “The bigger concern is: What if other entities can access?” But Wolff seems reassured that the firms will keep any identifiable information out o the hands of third parties due to the 15 minute refresh time on the identifier on Apple and Google devices. “You might worry about someone creating a map of where you have been, but with an identifier that changes every 15 minutes it would be so much harder to trace to an individual person,” said Wolff. Wolff added: “The truth about Google and Apple is they have so much information about us already.” Even New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat who has praised Apple and Google’s efforts, noted that there are privacy concerns relating to the tech. “Apple and other companies are working on using technology to do tracking. How do we do that and how do we do it fast?” Cuomo said before acknowledging the privacy issue stating: “Do you really want that cell phone in your pocket to be a tracking device?” A survey at the end of April found that three out of five Americans are unwilling or unable to use the smartphone contact tracing technology developed by the Masters of the Universe in Silicon Valley.

The Lehigh Valley Health Network (LVHN) is reporting a “steep decline” in patients hospitalized with the Chinese coronavirus — a significant development, as the hospital system spans across several Pennsylvania counties remaining under Gov. Tom Wolf’s (D) severe lockdown order. “Look at that steep decline in the number of COVID-19 patients in LVHN hospitals!” the health network exclaimed on its Facebook page, providing a chart with the predicted trend. “It’s even better than predicted. Proof that social distancing, hand washing and wearing a mask helps keep people safe and protected,” the hospital network added, encouraging people to be “COVID SMART”: Look at that steep decline in the number of COVID-19 patients in LVHN hospitals! It’s even better than predicted. Proof… Posted by Lehigh Valley Health Network on Wednesday, May 20, 2020 A closer look at the chart shows that they are now under 150 coronavirus-related hospitalizations in LVHN hospitals — a mark they did not expect to hit until the end of the month. LVHN also noted that it ordered more tests than any others in the region — 27,658 — and has seen 5,781 positive cases as a result. The hospital system breaks down the LVHN positive cases county by county, almost all of which remain under Wolf’s restrictive lockdown order. Warren County and Carbon County stand as exceptions, as Warren moved to the yellow phase on May 8, and Carbon will move to the yellow phase on Friday. Penn State Health CEO Steve Massini reported similar results during last week’s virtual roundtable discussion with Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA) and Rep. Lloyd Smucker (R-PA), explaining that Penn State Health facilities have experienced a “continued decrease” in coronavirus hospitalizations since its peak last month. “As of this morning, we have successfully treated and released more than 175 confirmed COVID-19 patients from our hospitals in Hershey and Reading,” Massini told the lawmakers at the time. “The interesting point to make is, at the level of 23 patients in our hospital today, that is a 50 percent decrease from our high point of 51 patients in mid-April,” he continued. “Again, we’ve had a continued decrease.” He concluded that “Penn State Health’s experience with COVID-19 has been less severe” than initially anticipated. Nearly 70 percent of coronavirus fatalities in the Keystone State has been linked to nursing homes.

Michigan’s universities are facing significant losses as a result of the Chinese virus pandemic. One estimate suggests that public universities in Michigan will lose a total of $1 billion as a result of the pandemic. According to a report by the College Fix, public universities and colleges in the state of Michigan will lose approximately $1 billion as a result of the Chinese virus pandemic. “There are no simply no revenues coming in at this point,” Dan Hurley, the president of the Michigan Association of State Universities, said in a comment. Many universities and colleges furloughed employees in April to compensate for losses incurred during the spring semester. Western Michigan University President Edward Montgomery announced on May 11 that a “substantial number” of employees would be laid off as a result of budgetary issues. “We have to do the process sooner rather than later,” Montgomery said last week. “You need to aim high rather than aim low, so we don’t have to repeat the process. If we wait and don’t plan, we won’t have the time to make the necessary adjustments for the fall.” University of Michigan-Flint Professor Mark J. Perry, who may be best known for his war against university policies that discriminate against male students, claims that his university has suffered a substantial drop in enrollment as a result of the pandemic. “The Flint campus is right now reporting an expected decline of 19.5% for Fall 2020 credit hours compared to the same time a year ago, according to the most recent enrollment report from the UM-Flint Registrar’s Office yesterday,” Perry wrote in an email. “A year ago the expected credit hours for Fall 2019 were 42,491 and this year it’s down to 34,210. And the report from the previous week on 5/11 showed an expected 17.5% decline in Fall 2020 credit hours, so the expected outlook worsened slightly in the last week.” Several universities in Michigan that have been affected by the pandemic have already announced plans to reopen their campuses for the fall. Michigan State and the University of Michigan, two of the largest public universities in the state, are currently developing their own plans for a fall reopening. Stay tuned to Breitbart News for more campus updates.

Trial lawyers are licking their chops as the United States reopens more than two months after locking down due to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. John Houghtaling, one such trial lawyer representing part of a group of celebrity chefs suing insurance giants over the pandemic, described the forthcoming fight in a quote to the Washington Post as what he said is “going to be the most expensive legal battle in history.” He then predicted: The insurance companies are going to win some of those, and they’re going to lose some of those. But in the meantime, the businesses are going to fail. People are going to be out of work. Houghtaling is a managing partner at Gauthier Murphy & Houghtaling LLC, a firm in the New Orleans suburb Metairie, Louisiana. Houghtaling is testifying before the Democrat-led House Small Business Committee on Thursday afternoon, where lawmakers will discuss the liability issues as Congress considers potentially granting a liability shield to companies nationwide upon reopening—something many Republicans consider imperative to successfully return to normal as a society. An outsized battle looms in Washington, as trade associations for trial lawyers push their own vision of open-ended lawsuits while groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce come down on the side of restricting litigation over coronavirus. The brewing fight in Congress, too, could become a hinge-point on whether there is a fourth major coronavirus relief package that could pass and be signed into law in the coming weeks and if there is one what it looks like. A source familiar with the fight told Breitbart News this will be a “billion dollar fight,” as powerful forces on each side—trial lawyers versus businesses—move in on lawmakers from every direction. The issue that confronts lawmakers is how to limit the scope of litigation over coronavirus while also not giving away too much to the business community. President Donald Trump said at a roundtable with restaurant executives earlier this week he hopes to strike the right balance, to “protect workers and businesses alike with curbs on frivolous litigation—frivolous litigation—a thing I know something about.” He added: There’s a lot of frivolous litigation. So we don’t want someone going and sitting in your restaurant Tilman [Fertitta] and then suing you for $10 million because something happened. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said a liability shield for businesses from the kind of endless litigation that trial lawyers enrich themselves on is a must-have in any fourth phase coronavirus relief package. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has indicated that she is seeking to help out struggling state and local governments, and McConnell could pin a liability shield to that—forcing this issue to be addressed. McConnell has deputized Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) with addressing the matter, and sources with knowledge of the matter told Breitbart News the fight will surely intensify as the calendar changes from May to June. Houghtaling is representing Thomas Keller, the celebrity chef who the Washington Post’s Tim Carman described as “the mastermind behind the three-star Michelin restaurants Per Se in New York and the French Laundry in California.” Keller is one of many restauranteurs nationwide suing their insurance companies because the insurance companies are not paying them for the shutdowns caused by COVID-19. “The owners are pressing carriers to honor business-interruption policies during an outbreak that has wreaked so much financial havoc that it could bankrupt insurance companies and put at risk claims not related to covid-19,” Carman wrote in the Post. In these particular kinds of cases, what these trial lawyers like Houghtaling and the others representing these various restaurants are looking for is for insurance companies to honor business interruption policies or to cover their clients like they would in a natural disaster even if the policies do not explicitly cover pandemics. But this is just the tip of the iceberg for trial lawyers as the reopening battle moves forward coast to coast—cases that could be forthcoming include against states for various policies they implemented like New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s decision to force COVID-19 patients into nursing homes or against companies in the case of a worker who returns to the workplace contracting the virus. That’s not to mention consumer-led suits against any business where people think they may have gotten the virus, and so much more. According to Politico, the American Association for Justice—a national collective of trial lawyers—released polling on the issue that forecast many potential lines of litigation that the attorneys may see coming. “The trial lawyers hired Hart Research Associates, a Democratic polling firm, which surveyed more than 1,200 voters online last week,” Politico’s Theodoric Meyer wrote earlier in May. “The pollsters told voters that companies want to prevent workers and consumers who contract coronavirus from suing them ‘even if they could demonstrate that the company engaged in unsafe practices.’ Sixty-four percent of respondents said they opposed giving companies such immunity, while 36 percent supported it.” The Chamber of Commerce, which is squarely on the other side of the fight, released its own polling according to Politico showing the exact opposite. “A poll conducted days earlier by the Republican firm Public Opinion Strategies for the Chamber’s Institute for Legal Reform found the opposite among 800 voters surveyed by phone,” Politico’s Meyer wrote. “Asked whether ‘Congress should protect many businesses and types of companies from lawsuits related to the coronavirus,’ 61 percent of voters agreed and 27 percent said no.” But no matter who is paying out and who is receiving payments as a result of litigation, and no matter who wins and who loses lawsuits, the one group that always comes out on top is the trial lawyers. That “most expensive legal battle in history” that Houghtaling describes has but one absolute winner: the trial lawyers who bring the cases. Houghtaling is a curious choice for Democrats in the House as a witness to push this line protecting endless litigation, as his political donation history aligns closely with top Democrats in Congress. Federal Election Commission (FEC) reports show that Houghtaling donated $10,000 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC)—the formal Democrat Party arm charged with electing Democrats to the House—in 2014. Those FEC records show that he also made a $5,128 in-kind contribution to the DCCC for hosting the fundraising event at which he gave the $10,000. For instance, in 2000 he donated $1,000 to Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton’s U.S. Senate campaign in New York. Later, in 2016, he gave $2,700—the maximum allowable by law—to Clinton’s presidential campaign. In fact, from 1998 until 2015, Houghtaling gave almost exclusively to Democrats. But in 2014, Houghtaling founded an energy company called American Ethane Company, LLC. The company, which has ties to Russia and according to filings with the Louisiana Secretary of State even has a mailing address in Moscow, seems to have altered Houghtaling’s donation history. He started giving to Republicans, including former U.S. Rep. Charles Boustany—a GOP House member who ran for U.S. Senate—and other Republicans throughout the South in particular in Louisiana like Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC), and House GOP whip Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA). The establishment media has actually ripped Houghtaling’s energy company in its efforts to paint President Trump as close with Russia. In July 2018, the Guardian for instance ran this headline: “Former Putin adviser has secret investment in US energy firm praised by Trump.” In the piece, the Guardian’s Luke Harding details how Vladimir Putin’s former chief of staff has a stake in Houghtaling’s company: Vladimir Putin’s former chief of staff has a secret investment in an American energy company hailed by Donald Trump as creating jobs for American workers. Alexander Voloshin – who served as Boris Yeltsin’s chief of staff before working for Putin between 2000 and 2003 – has an undisclosed stake in American Ethane, a Houston-based firm that recently signed a multibillion dollar export deal with China. Voloshin is part of a consortium of Russian investors in American Ethane that at one point included the oligarch and billionaire Roman Abramovich. There are plenty of other ties between American Ethane and Russia, but the company also has ties to the Chinese. According to the firm’s own website, it has made a number of deals with Chinese companies and has a Shanghai office. But all of that aside, why the Democrats would brush all of these previous concerns about Russia aside to hype a trial lawyer like this amid the coronavirus pandemic and as the country seeks to reopen are curious—and could foreshadow that bigger battle many are talking about behind the scenes that’s about to burst out into the open.

If you’ve been wondering why some of college football’s premier programs have been pushing so hard to play football this year despite a global pandemic, we have your answer. According to a Washington University study commissioned by ESPN, if college football isn’t played in 2020, it would cost the Power 5 conferences (ACC, Big 12, Big 10, Pac 10, SEC) in the sport would lose $4 billion. According to ESPN: [Patrick] Rishe estimates that the 65 Power 5 schools would collectively lose more than $4 billion in football revenues, with at least $1.2 billion of that due to lost ticket revenue. Each Power 5 school would see at least an average loss of $62 million in football revenue, including at least $18.6 million in football ticket sales, he said. Rishe’s analysis for ESPN used publicly available data from the 2017 season from the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics and the 2018 Equity in Athletics Database from the U.S. Department of Education, along with conservative projections of increases in revenue over the past two years to arrive at 2020 estimates if the U.S. were not in the midst of a pandemic. Rishe’s projected losses are actually conservative; they don’t include potential losses in media revenue, conference distributions, donations and revenues from corporate partnerships. With 65 member schools, the Power 5 conferences comprise roughly half of the total number of teams that compete at the Division I level. As Nick Bromberg of Yahoo! points out, it’s not just the schools who would take a financial hit if football were to not be played. ESPN would take a significant hit if there was no college football season either. The network has a stake in the SEC and ACC Networks, along with the Big 12’s ESPN+ streaming service, and pays billions for college football rights. Its fall programming is largely centered around football games. The network has scrambled to fill programming voids over the last two months amid the coronavirus pandemic and would have to scramble even more if there were no college football games to show starting in September. The trickle down effect of Power 5 conferences taking a $4 billion hit would be felt across college athletics. Football programs, normally the only sports programs that generate revenue, pay the freight for the swim teams, soccer teams, and other programs at the school. Without that income, many of those other sports would have to shut down. Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn

Thursday on “CBS This Morning,” Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI) called President Donald Trump’s threat to withhold federal funding from Michigan for sending absentee ballot applications to voters “unacceptable.” Discussing Trump’s threat while she is dealing with two dams that broke and 10,000 residents being evacuated, Whitmer said, You know, we are in the midst of this global pandemic. We lost 5,000 people in the state of Michigan. It’s been devastating. We are at a point where we think it’s safe to start re-engaging sectors of our economy, but then this flood hits. We’ve got to evacuate tens of thousands of people who are worried and scared. On top of this global pandemic. And to have this kind of distraction is just ridiculous, to be honest.” She continued, “Threatening to take money away from a state that is hurting as bad as we are right now is just scary, and I think something that is unacceptable. My hope is that today he will be in Michigan. He’ll see we are hard-working, good Americans. We need the support of our federal government as much of as anybody else, if not more right now, because of this added challenge. And I’m hopeful that he comes away knowing that that’s what’s most important. No petty political stuff that he had going with the secretary of state yesterday. We’ve got to be focused on doing the right thing right now on behalf of the people.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Mexican health officials revealed the highest daily spike in fatalities related to the Coronavirus (COVID-19). The new record comes as authorities are broadly accused of doctoring statistics to downplay the true scope of the pandemic. During the daily news conference, Mexico’s Epidemiology Director Jose Luis Alomia said the nation has seen a total of 6,090 fatalities and 56,594 confirmed cases. The number of fatalities rose by 424 in a single day.

Mexico has only performed 193,589 tests, which led politicians to claim this helps keep the number of cases artificially low. Undersecretary of Health Hugo Lopez Gatell previously admitted his figures do not include cases from private hospitals. An NGO called Mexicanos Contra la Corrupcion e Impunidad MCCI says that in Mexico City alone, officials only acknowledge one-third of Coronavirus fatalities.

Britain’s National Health Service (NHS) has revealed that it is following U.S. President Donald Trump’s lead on experimenting with hydroxychloroquine as a coronavirus preventative. The state-run, socialised healthcare provider will be giving hydroxychloroquine to as many as 10,000 health workers at at least 20 hospitals as part of a clinical trial led by the Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit (Moru), to confirm anecdotal evidence that it can prevent people from catching the Chinese virus. The announcement may give satisfaction to President Trump, who was slammed by left-liberal politicians and commentators when he revealed that he was taking hydroxychloroquine as a possible preventative. The American leader told reporters on Monday that they would “be surprised at how many people are taking [hydroxychloroquine], especially the frontline workers, before you catch it,” before revealing that he is taking the drug himself. Chuck Schumer, who leads the Democrats in the U.S. Senate, branded the President “reckless” and claimed that “All the experts say at best it doesn’t help” following the revelation. “I would rather he not be taking something that has not been approved by the scientists, especially in his age group,” added Nancy Pelosi, Schumer’s 80-year-old counterpart in the House of Representatives — before going on to suggest the President should be extra cautious because he is “morbidly obese”. President Donald Trump on Monday confirmed at the White House that he was taking hydroxychloroquine and zinc as preventatives against the coronavirus. https://t.co/xNYf9vC0HQ — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) May 18, 2020  “Based on the known pharmacology of hydroxychloroquine, coupled with the emerging knowledge surrounding SARS-CoV-2 viral replication and Covid-19 pathophysiology, we were very keen to test the effectiveness of this molecule in a preventative rather than late-stage treatment setting,” said Dr Anthony Grosso of Accord Europe, a British pharmaceuticals manufacturer which has donated more than two million tablets for the NHS study. “If drugs as well tolerated as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine could reduce the chances of catching Covid-19, this would be incredibly valuable,” explained Professor Martin Llewelyn, the study’s British lead. “If these drugs offer even a degree of protection, it would be a very big deal. We know from previous studies that these drugs have anti-viral activity, but as a treatment it seems to be relatively modest,” he said . “It seems the best chance of these drugs having a role could be in prevention,” he concluded — exactly the reason President Trump has been using the drug. Why is the Establishment Media so determined to attack hydroxychloroquine? "As soon as [Trump] said something positive about it, the media has been on a jihad to discredit the drug. It’s quite strange.” https://t.co/32Y7RNdWxH — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) April 9, 2020 

A New Jersey gym that opened in defiance of the state’s stay-at-home order has been shut down by the state’s health department. State and local health officials plastered signs on the doors of Atilis Gym in Bellmawr on Thursday morning, CBS Philadelphia reported. The owners say they will not reopen again immediately and violate the health department order. The gym owners were cited for the past three days for reopening their gym to protest the shutdown orders. Atilis Gym first reopened its doors on Monday, drawing crowds of protesters and police. Officers quickly cited the gym for defying Gov. Phil Murphy’s stay-at-home order before the health department shut it down Thursday. Ian Smith, the gym’s co-owner, told NBC 10 Philadelphia the closure was a “dirty tactic” by the governor and a “coordinated attack” on his business. “It’s a gross abuse of power,” Smith said, adding that though the gym would not reopen Thursday to violate the health order, it planned on opening by Friday. Smith said the health department had not inspected the gym to take a look at safety measures to protect customers and vowed to file a lawsuit. The New Jersey Department of Health did not immediately respond for comment. When Smith was asked if he regretted opening his business in the first place, he replied, “Absolutely not. We’re gonna defend our rights.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) have asked President Donald Trump to lower flags to half staff at all public buildings on the day when the United States reaches 100,000 deaths due to Chinese coronavirus. “We will always carry their memory in our hearts,” Pelosi and Schumer wrote. “As we pay our respects to them, sadly, our country mourns the deaths of nearly 100,000 Americans from COVID-19. Our hearts are broken over this great loss and our prayers are with their families.” PELOSI and SCHUMER write TRUMP asking him to order flags flown at half staff on the day America reaches 100k COVID deaths. pic.twitter.com/rErBkhFzJh — Jake Sherman (@JakeSherman) May 21, 2020  “Respectful of them and the loss to our country, we are writing to request that you order flags to be flown at half-staff on all public buildings in our country on the sad day of reckoning when we reach 100,000 deaths,” they added. “It would serve as a national expression of grief so needed by everyone in our country.” The Democrat leaders’ letter comes as the U.S. death toll has surpassed 94,000, according to data tracked by Johns Hopkins University. To fly the flags at half staff, President Trump would be required to make a presidential proclamation.

Burundi successfully held its first competitive national election since its civil war in 1993 on Wednesday, despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, which has hindered elections in other countries, Reuters reported. Burundi’s last national election in 2015 was the subject of international criticism after current president Pierre Nkurunziza won a controversial third term. Nkurunziza has agreed to step down after this year’s election following 15 years in office. His ruling party, CNDD-FDD, chose a retired general and fellow member, Evariste Ndayishimiye, to run against the opposition party leader Agathon Rwasa and five others this year. The full results of the election’s outcome are expected by May 27. The winner must secure at least 50 percent of the vote in the first round. Otherwise, a run-off election must be held within the next two weeks, according to the report. “We call on Burundians to vote in massive numbers and vote peacefully. We need good elections,” Pierre Claver Kazihise, chairman of Burundi’s election commission, said during a state TV broadcast in the lead up to the vote. Wednesday’s election met both criteria, with “long” lines at polling stations where operations ran “smoothly,” according to voters interviewed by Reuters. “The voting is really taking place smoothly and I voted for change but I am pessimistic about the counting of votes,” said one citizen who asked to be quoted anonymously. According to some voters, certain social media platforms and messaging apps, such as Twitter and Whatsapp, seemed to have been shut down around the time of the election. Some speculated that the government may have orchestrated the move to prevent the spread of information during the crucial polling period, according to the report. Burundi’s last national election in 2015, which saw Nkurunziza elected to his third term, was the subject of widespread international criticism. Citizens protested the election results in demonstrations that turned violent. The U.N. criticized Nkurunziza and his ruling party of human rights violations in the aftermath, which the government denied. This eventually led the government to shut down the U.N.’s human rights office in Burundi in 2019. Last week, the government ousted another U.N. official when it ordered the head of Burundi’s World Health Organization mission, a U.N. health body, to leave the country after the health authority objected to the government holding crowded political rallies in the lead up to Wednesday’s election. The gatherings, attended by thousands of people, were allowed despite the ongoing Chinese coronavirus pandemic.

Russia’s coronavirus information chief implied on Tuesday that victims of the coronavirus had met their destiny, assuring Russians that the nation’s coronavirus outbreak should not worry them because death is inevitable, the Moscow Times reported. The government official’s remarks preceded Russia reporting on Wednesday the second-highest number of Chinese coronavirus cases in the world. Alexander Myasnikov, previously a celebrity doctor, made the controversial comments during an interview with pro-Putin pundit Vladimir Solovyov, broadcast on Tuesday: The infection will still take its toll, and we’ll all get it. Those meant to die will die. Everyone dies. Even if it’s coronavirus, so what? Of course, you need to get a test to avoid infecting others, but you do understand it’s an illusion. We’ll run out of tests if everyone runs out to check after every sneeze. After his interview aired, Russian media shared Myasnikov’s statement. He has since faced criticism from the Russian public for his seemingly callous remarks. On Tuesday night, the TV doctor defended his views via social media, accusing the Russian press of taking his words out of the context of the interview. Myasnikov said his statement was intended to impart confidence to his audience, as many Russians may be experiencing “uncertainty and fear of tomorrow.” “There’s no need to waste energy and destroy your psyche with panic. We’re all mortal by dint of our existence,” the doctor wrote in a statement posted to his Telegram account late Tuesday. “The fact that a person is mortal shouldn’t darken the days of our, alas, fleeting life. We should just live and enjoy this life.” In mid-April, the Kremlin appointed Myasnikov as the head of Russia’s Coronavirus Information Center, a position that Myasnikov had reportedly already assumed unofficially prior to the announcement, BBC Russia reported. As Information Chief, Myasnikov’s responsibilities include informing the public about treatment and prevention methods for the Chinese coronavirus as well as combating “fake news” surrounding the virus. Additionally, the cardiologist leads the Health, Demography, and Social Policy Commission of the Moscow Public Chamber. According to BBC Russia, Myasnikov works closely with Moscow leadership. He assisted Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin as an adviser during the city’s 2018 mayoral election and also served as an adviser to President Vladimir Putin during Russia’s 2018 presidential election. The radio and TV personality has previously been known for his positive spin on Russia’s coronavirus outbreak. In early February, he said that the emergence of the coronavirus might be beneficial for Russians because it encouraged people to increase hygienic practices such as hand washing and to start wearing sanitary masks in public, according to the report. He then said he believed there was a “zero percent” chance of the coronavirus spreading in Russia. He deemed the country’s coronavirus death rate at the time a “Russian miracle” for being remarkably low. Russian officials have been accused of drastically undercounting and underreporting the nation’s true number of the coronavirus infections and deaths. “The coronavirus epidemic will come to naught, I think, by mid-April,” Myasnikov erroneously predicted in March, when he described the coronavirus pandemic as a “seasonal phenomenon.” Two weeks later, Myasnikov backtracked on this statement, encouraging Russians to patiently wait for “herd immunity” to pervade the population and protect people from the virus, according to BBC Russia’s report. In mid-April, the American-trained medical doctor said that Russia’s healthcare system was better prepared to take on the coronavirus pandemic than Western healthcare systems, a claim that has been disproven in recent weeks as Russia’s hospitals have been overwhelmed by the national outbreak. The Russian government has failed to provide its healthcare workers with basic personal protective equipment (PPE), causing doctors and nurses to quit in protest. In late April, President Putin admitted Russia had a “deficit of all sorts” of medical equipment as it prepared for a surge in coronavirus cases in recent weeks. At press time on Wednesday, Russia had officially recorded 308,705 coronavirus infections and 2,972 deaths from the Chinese coronavirus.

The deep blue state of Illinois is beginning to revolt against the nation’s strictest coronavirus lockdowns even as those in charge seek to strengthen their power. Some of the more outrageous examples of overreach are seen in the City of Chicago, where Mayor Lori Lightfoot has fenced in the city’s extensive lakeshore areas and even created newly designated no parking zones around churches to prevent worshipers from attending services. Last Sunday, the city’s first gay mayor sent the Chicago Police Department (CPD) out to erect new signs around the neighborhood of Philadelphia Romanian Church to suddenly create long stretches of new “No parking/tow warning” zones around the building. Lightfoot also sent the CPD to prowl around outside several of the city’s churches to hand out parking violations, Chicago’s CBS affiliate reported. The mayor’s campaign against churches comes on the heels of statements by several church officials across the city saying they had no intention of submitting to the mayor’s orders to shut down their houses of worship.

Huh) The Windy City is not the only Illinois jurisdiction instituting the draconian lockdowns that are riling citizens. The state’s novice Governor, J.B. Pritzker, has also dabbled in harsh lockdowns that have stifled the state. Indeed, a recent review of lockdown policies by the personal finance site WalletHub found Illinois has the harshest lockdown policies in the country. As a result, the Windy City citizens are not the only Illinoisans who have revolted against the Democrat-enforced lockdowns. A growing number of county and municipal officials are coming out in opposition to Gov. Pritzker’s seemingly arbitrary orders. Pritzker ruled businesses that violated his orders could be handed a prison sentence of up to a year for refusing to obey him. But many balked at the order. Sheriff James Mendrick of DuPage County, Illinois, for instance, told his constituents he had no intention of enforcing Pritzker’s order to fine and arrest violators of the gov’s lockdown orders. “I just can’t do this anymore. I stand with our citizens and businesses of DuPage County who have offered no trouble or no resistance to any rule we put upon them, no matter how strange.,” Sheriff Mendrick wrote in a Facebook post. “I will not victimize lawful residents of DuPage County trying to put food on their children’s table. I’m so proud of our DuPage citizens who have done everything right from the beginning. All I can say is thank you,” he added. Kendall County Sheriff Dwight Baird joined Mendrick and let his county know that he had no intention of sending police to break up gatherings, take out weddings, or shut down businesses because in his opinion, “the Governor’s Executive Order is not a law.” Gibson City, a town in central Illinois, also announced they would not be enforcing Pritker’s orders. “After careful consideration, the Gibson City Police Department will not be making any criminal misdemeanor arrests of individuals or business owners for violations of temporary rules of Executive Orders, the town said in a statement on Wednesday. In addition, downstate Madison County reopened its businesses despite the orders. In reply to these officials, Gov. Pritzker warned he would send the state police in to enforce his rules. “Counties that try to reopen in defiance, may not be reimbursed by FEMA for damages they cause because they ignored the law,” Pritzker said adding, “Local law enforcement and the Illinois State Police can and will take action.” Individual business owners have also defied the governor’s threats. A gym owner in Moline, a city on the border with Iowa, straight west of Chicago, reopened his business on Monday in direct defiance of Pritzker’s orders. Madison County Board Chairman Kurt Prenzler helped usher through a resolution that “basically declared all businesses and churches essential.” “I did the Zoom classes for a while. Rented out all my equipment and, you know, you reach a point where enough is enough, and somebody’s got to say something,” said Chris Ninotta, owner of Omni Strength. “I can’t do it any longer. I’m a single father, and that’s where my loyalty lies, and there’s no man or government on earth that’s gonna tell me I gotta, you know, do this.” In another case, Kevin Promenschenkel, owner of Poopy’s biker bar in Savanna, Illinois, filed a lawsuit after his state liquor license was threatened because people used his picnic tables – spaced more than 10 feet apart – to eat their takeout orders. The above actions by business owners and government officials noted above are only a handful of the examples of residents and officials revolting against the Illinois governor’s autocratic orders.

Residents of Saudi Arabia who violate the country’s coronavirus ban on large gatherings will be permanently banished from the Kingdom, the nation’s interior ministry announced Tuesday, Saudi news site al-Arabiya reported. On Saturday, the Ministry of Interior’s (MOI) security spokesman, Talal al-Shalhoub, urged the public to adhere to Saudi Arabia’s physical distancing mandates, been implemented to curb transmission of the Chinese coronavirus. “If a violator is a resident of Saudi Arabia, he will be deported from the Kingdom, and will be forever forbidden from re-entering it after his punishment is carried out,” al-Shalhoub said Tuesday. Saudi Arabia, with a population of 30 million people, currently has the highest number of coronavirus cases out of all six Persian Gulf states with 62,545 infections, in addition to 339 deaths. The Kingdom has banned large gatherings, defined as a grouping of “more than five people,” in an effort to contain its outbreak, al-Arabiya reported. To comply with this mandate “shoppers and staff members” are “not allowed to gather in malls or shops beyond the specified capacity limit which ensures two meters of separation between people,” al-Shalhoub said. Shops will be fined for each person found gathering in and outside of their establishments above the set capacity. For example, for a first-time offender, “an establishment will be fined 5,000 riyals ($1,331) for every extra person present in the facility above the set capacity limit.” The fine per person above capacity doubles for second and third-time offenders: “The maximum fine is 100,000 riyals ($26,619).” Third-time offenders “will be referred to the public prosecution,” according to the report. Private sector establishments defying the set capacity limits can be shut down by the government for three to six months. “Anyone who attends a gathering, or calls for it, or causes it will be considered a violator of the government’s measures and will face fines and penalties,” al-Shalhoub reminded the public on Saturday. On April 25, King Salman bin Abdulaziz ordered a partial easing of coronavirus restrictions already in place to coincide with the beginning of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. The order allowed retail stores and shopping malls to re-open as long as they maintained coronavirus prevention measures such as physical distancing and a limit on visitors. On May 14, Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Commerce said shopping centers could remain open until May 22. Kuwait and Qatar, who both share a border with Saudi Arabia, announced over the weekend they would imprison people for up to three years for failing to wear a sanitary face mask in public in accordance with their coronavirus prevention measures.

New claims for unemployment benefits fell to 2.438 million last week, data from the Department of Labor showed Thursday. That brings new unemployment claims, a proxy for layoffs, since the coronavirus pandemic began to claim jobs nine weeks ago to around 38.6 million. Economists had been expecting around 2.4 million for weekly claims. The prior week was initially reported at just below 3 million and was revised down to 2.69 down. The largest increases in initial claims for the week ending May 9 were in Florida’s 48,222 and Georgia’s 14,420. The largest decrease in claims was in California, where claims dropped by 103,590. This was followed by Texas’ 102,382, Oklahoma’s 54,806, North Carolina’s 28,602, and Missouri’s 21,382. Claims hit a record 6.87 million for the week of March 28. Each subsequent week has seen claims decline. Continuing claims, those made after an initial application, rose for the week ended May 9 to just over 25 million, a new record high. Those are reported with a one-week lag. The week prior was 22.548. The jump is an indication that most of those who lost jobs in recent weeks have remained out of work. The federal government has been shipping in an extra $600 a week to state unemployment benefits, making the program much more generous. Many workers can now earn more on unemployment than they did when they had a job. These super-sized benefits, however, are set to run out in July. The government said the U.S. unemployment rate soared to 14.7 percent in April, the highest since the Great Depression. The new claims numbers may be undercounting the toll the coronavirus and lockdowns have exacted on the U.S. labor market. Many states have ha problems processing the large amount of claims.  

The far-left Washington Post was forced to report Monday that in states with plenty of available coronavirus tests there are “too few people lining up to get tested.” Wait, whuh? You mean there are a buttload of coronavirus tests out there and hardly anyone wants to take them…? Oh, no, no, no, no… The question is a much bigger one than that… Let’s try that again: You mean the corporate media have spent three months and billions of dollars investing in fear porn — much of that porn invested on this ridiculous concept of “massive testing,” and hardly anyone wants to take the available tests? The answer to both questions is a hearty “yes.” In a sane world, the answer to both questions would be a hearty “duh.” Come on, did you expect anything different? We’re Americans after all, which means that at the end of the day we know bullshit when we hear it, and this media demand for a massive testing regime is bullshit. And how well do the American people know this? This well: A Washington Post survey of governors’ offices and state health departments found at least a dozen states where testing capacity outstrips the supply of patients. Many have scrambled to make testing more convenient, especially for vulnerable communities, by setting up pop-up sites and developing apps that help assess symptoms, find free test sites and deliver quick results. But the numbers, while rising, are well short of capacity — and far short of targets set by independent experts. Utah, for example, is conducting about 3,500 tests a day, a little more than a third of its 9,000-test maximum capacity, and health officials have erected highway billboards begging drivers to “GET TESTED FOR COVID-19.” Let’s go to the experts! Why aren’t more people showing up? “Well, that’s the million-dollar question,” said Utah Health Department spokesman Tom Hudachko. “It could be simply that people don’t want to be tested. It could be that people feel like they don’t need to be tested. It could be that people are so mildly symptomatic that they’re just not concerned that having a positive lab result would actually change their course in any meaningful way.” That’s actually a very good answer. I know the other day, while doing business with a local health care provider, my wife and I were offered a coronavirus test. “No thank you,” we said. Why would we get tested if we are feeling okay? What’s the point? Anyway, WaPo also found a whole lot of bad reasons to explain why people aren’t wasting their time on these stupid tests, reasons that can be blamed on — wait for it, wait for it– America!: Experts say several factors may be preventing more people from seeking tests, including a lingering sense of scarcity, a lack of access in rural and underserved communities, concerns about cost, and skepticism about testing operations. Let’s take these one by one… “A lingering sense of scarcity.” BWHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! There is no actual scarcity, but there’s a “lingering sense of scarcity.” Okay. Yeah. Listen, if I know one thing about Americans, it’s that if we really want something, no “lingering sense of scarcity” will stop us from getting it. Ever heard of a Cabbage Patch Doll? An iPhone? Are you freakin’ kidding me? This is America. This is Consumer Nation. We shop till we drop, baby. We seek till we find. And if a “lingering sense of scarcity” defeats us, that means we never really wanted it in the first place. “…a lack of access in rural and underserved communities[.]” BWHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! See all of the above. “…concerns about cost[.]” BWHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! First off, these tests are free. Secondly, did I mention these tests are free? Thanks to the efforts of the White House, most insurers have agreed to waive the co-pay, and the uninsured will also pay nothing for anything COVID-19 related. “…and skepticism about testing operations.” Ding! Ding! Ding! Skepticism is good. Skepticism is healthy. More skepticism, please. Why should I bother to get tested if 1) I feel just fine and 2) I’ve not been in contact with someone infected with the coronavirus? Submitting to a test under those conditions makes perfect sense. You want to be sure not to infect anyone else — in other words, don’t be a Chris Cuomo. And if there is a flare-up of infections in a certain area, the CDC needs to know it. We don’t want the health care system to crash. So I get that. But to get tested just for the hell of it? Why? Especially when you can exit the test all proud of the fact you are not sick and enter a cloud of coronavirus left by a guy who just sneezed before the elevator door opened. Secondly, there’s some evidence of false negatives, meaning people are testing negative for the virus who actually have it. So of course skepticism is warranted. The whole idea behind this unbelievably stupid massive testing regime is a media creation, an anti-science way to continue to move the goalposts on President Trump so that he can never achieve success. The goalpost moving is now to the point where the media are literally — literally! — demanding America conduct a billion tests a week. This is absurd, but it is deliberately absurd, a deliberate set-up by a partisan news media who will never allow Trump to claim a win. What’s more, we all know the real reason behind the media’s desire to increase testing: More testing means we find more people who are infected, and that allows the media juice up the fear porn with fake news, like this one at CNNLOL about Texas. But, gee, what if you’re all dolled up to offer a billion tests a week and hardly anyone wants to take them? Oh, wait — Utah can’t even find 3,501 people to take pointless coronavirus tests. Utah has the capacity to conduct 9,000 tests a day and only 3,500 are showing up. And do you want to know what that means…? Trump won. Trump more than achieved success when it comes to testing. If there are more tests than people who want to take them, that’s a total win. It also proves (yet again) that the bubbled, provincial media have absolutely no understanding of human nature. They actually believed they could terrify Americans into going through all the hassle and inconvenience of a medical procedure just because the fear porn media told them to. Sorry, that’s not how human nature works. During the 80s, at the height of the AIDS epidemic, when AIDS meant not only certain death, but a cruel, long, and agonizing death, countless people could not be convinced to refrain from loveless or sex, countless people could not even be convinced to wear a condom. We glorious Americans are not wired that way. The whole point of being an American is to live our lives in whatever way we choose. The heroism of the gay community during that time, their refusal to be rewired, to conform, to “social distance,” to stop being who they were while at the same time demanding the government do its one and only job, which is to protect our God-given right to live our chosen lives… that’s what this country is all about. And that’s exactly what you are seeing during these lockdown protests: Americans refusing to stop being who they are… Entrepreneurs, consumers, social animals, sun bathers… And why should we stop? First off, we’re not stupid. Secondly, we have great bullshit detectors. Finally, since the entire premise of our country is to live our lives in the way we wish, this makes us immediately skeptical of do-gooders who try to undermine our lifestyle, which makes us willing to accept the risks to fight for and go on living that lifestyle. Good grief, disease was one of the reasons nearly half the Mayflower passengers were wiped out that first year. So it is in the American DNA to live free, and despite the evil wishes of our media and too many Democrat governors, it always will be. That doesn’t mean we should be dumb about it. If I was in close contact with someone who had the China virus, if I had the symptoms, I’d get tested — of course I would. But any other reason is absurd and a waste of resources.  Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.

Hollywood actors Julia Roberts, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Hugh Jackman are among the long list of A-list celebrities lending health experts — starting with Dr. Anthony Fauci — their social media platforms as part of the #PassTheMic, an initiative organized by global nonprofit ONE Campaign aimed at promoting “health and economic experts … discussing a global response to” the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. Roberts will be the first to relinquish her social media accounts — Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter — to Dr. Fauci. Hollywood stars Hugh Jackman, Sarah Jessica Parker, David Oyelowo, Busy Philipps, Rita Wilson, Robin Wright, Connie Britton, Millie Bobby Brown, Danai Gurira, and others have giving health experts their social media accounts for 24-hours to various health experts. A video has been released to announce the campaign. Watch below: <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> Dr. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of President Donald Trump’s White House task force, has become a household name, from joining late-night TV shows to celebrity podcast programs to promote the administration’s message about it’s response to how people should best take care of their health in response to the Chinese coronavirus.  Dr. Fauci even once said he’d like to be played by Brad Pitt in any future movie portrayal of the coronavirus crisis. Saturday Night Live was happy to oblige with Pitt, who played Dr. Fauci in a skit last month. Watch below: <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> Just the same, Dr. Fauci has often publicly contradicted the president, for instance on when and how quickly to reopen schools and America’s economy.  Roberts held a Q&A with Dr. Fauci discussing how the developing world can best respond to the deadly virus that originated in China. “This gets to a fundamental problem that we have to deal with and that is the extraordinary health disparities in the developing world. Right now, in, if you take southern Africa sub saharan Africa, parts of Asia, South America, and even parts of the Caribbean, as areas that don’t have the healthcare system to be able to respond the way one can respond in New York or LA or New Orleans or Chicago. We have really a moral responsibility for people throughout the world. I mean if you’re in the developed world, you know and we did that when we developed a PEPFAR program, we felt that we had a responsibility to the developing world that they should not suffer more or more easily just because where they happen to have been born.” Watch below:  The #PassTheMic campaign, announced Wednesday, is part of the ONE World Campaign and calls “for a global response to COVID-19 that protects the most vulnerable, supports people worst hit economically, strengthens health systems and creates a more just and equal world.” The “PassTheMIC” social media takeovers will last throughout May and into June. The launch of the campaign comes on the heels of President Trump’s message to the World Health Organization, warning that it will permanently lose U.S. funding unless it commits to “major substantive improvements within the next 30 days.” Trump suspended U.S. funding to the United Nations subsidiary last month, as Breitbart News reported, noting then the W.H.O. played a key role in “mismanaging and covering up” the global spread of the deadly Chinese coronavirus.

Casualties at the hands of jihadis during the first three weeks of Ramadan hit a grim milestone, exceeding 1,000 with 584 fatalities and 587 injuries, data compiled by Breitbart News shows. This report covers April 24, the first full day of the holy month, through May 14. On average, Islamic terrorists killed about 28 people and injured an estimated 28 others during that three-week period. There were an estimated 56 casualties, which include fatalities and injuries, each day. Islamic terrorist attacks have continued seemingly undeterred during Ramadan despite the ongoing Chinese coronavirus pandemic and the associated lockdowns. Jihadis from the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL), the second deadliest-group during the holiest month for Muslims, have reportedly dubbed their efforts the “Battle of Ramadan.” This year, the number of casualties, which includes deaths and injuries, is on pace to exceed those from 2019. The 1,171 casualties (584 fatalities, 587 injuries) during the first three weeks of the holy month have already surpassed the 1,087 (531 fatalities, 556 injuries) during the same period last year by about ten percent. The Afghan Taliban remains the bloodiest and most prolific group, with 76 attacks (264 deaths, 278 injuries). Taliban narco-jihadis are responsible for about half all the attacks and casualties, respectively. During Ramadan’s ongoing month, there have been 164 attacks in 18 countries, the vast majority in Afghanistan. Despite the fall of its so-called caliphate early last year, ISIS continues to wreak havoc in what some monitor groups and news outlets have described as a potential resurgence, mainly in Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan. ISIS is the second-deadliest terrorist group during Ramadan, responsible for the most bloody single-day attack (32 fatalities, 133 injuries), which took place at a funeral in Afghanistan on May 12. In the last few weeks, the group has carried out some of the deadliest attacks in months in Iraq and Afghanistan. This week’s count covers the heinous attack on a maternity ward in the Afghan capital of Kabul that left at least 24 people dead, including mothers and newborns, and 16 people injured. While the U.S. blames ISIS’s wing in Afghanistan for the attack, Kabul blames the Taliban. Breitbart News’ Ramadan count did not assign the responsibility for the attack to either group, but as both potential culprits subscribe to jihadist ideology, the attack is almost certainly jihadist in nature. Early this year, the United States and the Taliban signed a preliminary agreement to pave the way for intra-Afghan negotiations and the withdrawal of U.S.-led foreign forces. The vast majority of the victims of the Ramadan attacks are Muslims. Breitbart News recorded some attacks by militants from unknown groups using Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) in areas within the Sahel region of Africa, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Syria, known to be jihadi hotbeds. IED is a preferred weapon of jihadis, known to urge their members and supporters to engage in jihad on Ramadan, believing that martyrs will get extra rewards in paradise. Despite these attempts, violence is entirely dissonant with Ramadan for most Muslims. Most of them follow the tradition of abstaining from eating, drinking, smoking, having sex, and other physical needs each day, starting from before the break of dawn until sunset during Ramadan. Breitbart News primarily gleans its tally from the Religion of Peace website and the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) in coordination with news and government reports. This report only includes incidents where Breitbart News has corroborated those reports and online entities that monitor jihadi activity. It also omits attacks where the jihadist nature of the perpetrators is not clear, including attacks where no group has taken responsibility in an area where terrorists of non-jihadist ideologies are also present. The overall number of attacks and the associated casualties could be higher, given that Breitbart News is not able to confirm all incidents. Moreover, monitor groups do not document all terror events online. Death and injury figures may change as some victims succumb to their wounds. For the most part, the tally excludes casualties suffered by jihadis. Some of the documented incidents in Syria may inadvertently include deaths and injuries sustained by rebel groups with Islamic terrorist ties. All the terrorist attacks so far during Ramadan 2020, as documented by Breitbart News, include: April 24 — Badghis, Afghanistan — Taliban kills 13 local policemen and takes eight other prisoners in the village of Laman in Qala-e-Naw City.

The Catholic Bishops of Minnesota have written an open letter announcing the resumption of public Masses as of May 26, in defiance of lockdown restrictions set by the state’s Democrat governor Tim Walz. Many people of faith “were disappointed in Governor Walz’s May 13 announcement that he would end the Stay-at-Home order to allow more commerce but prohibit religious gatherings of more than ten people,” an order that “defies reason,” declares the May 20 letter, signed by Minnesota’s six Catholic bishops as well as the diocesan administrator of the Diocese of Duluth. Insisting that the life of faith is “essential,” the bishops declare that they have given Catholic parishes “permission for the resumption of the public celebration of Mass on Tuesday, May 26, which will give us time to be ready for the celebration of Pentecost on May 31.” “Parishes will be required to follow the strict protocols we have published for sanitation and social distancing and will have to limit attendance to one-third of the seating capacity of the church,” they state. “No one will be obliged to attend, as the bishops of Minnesota will continue to dispense from the obligation to attend Sunday Mass.” The bishops take pains to point out their ongoing efforts to work collaboratively with the Walz Administration as well as their overarching concern for the spiritual and physical well-being of their flock, while also noting the injustice of the governor’s arbitrary targeting of religious practice for especially strict regulation. The letter notes that both the Catholic hierarchy and “some Lutheran colleagues” submitted a joint plan to the Governor on May 8 detailing their sanitation measures and proposing a cap on church attendance limited to 33 percent of building capacity, a plan that the governor rejected. “Given our willingness to coordinate with the Governor, we are especially disappointed that his most recent order (20-56) does not address both the vital importance that faith plays in the lives of Americans, especially in this time of pandemic, and the fundamental religious freedom possessed by houses of worship that allows our country to thrive,” the bishops declare. “The Governor’s remarks today further underscored a failure to appreciate the role of our Church and other faith groups in serving the community,” they said. “The human cost to this pandemic has been extraordinary, not just in terms of lives lost to the virus but the rapidly growing problems of job loss, depression, crime and violence, and substance abuse.” The bishops affirm their unanimous “conviction” that they can safely resume public Masses in accordance with both our religious duties and with accepted public health and safety standards. The letter further notes that while Catholic parishes in Minnesota have permission to reopen for worship on May 26, none is obliged to do so. It also states that the bishops have encouraged those most at risk to stay home. The bishops conclude their letter with a section on the respective rights and responsibilities of civil government and Church leaders, noting that the decision to suspend parish activities, Catholic schools, and the public celebration of Mass was made by the bishops themselves prior to any executive orders by the governor. “Our decision to suspend the public celebration of Mass was painful,” they add. “We made that decision not because we were compelled to do so, but because we judged that the circumstances required it. We believe that those circumstances have changed, as confirmed by the Governor’s decision to end the Stay-at-Home order and allow more commerce.” With the reopening of shopping malls and other establishments, “how can reason require us any longer to keep our faithful from the Eucharist?” they ask. “We are blessed to live in a nation that guarantees the free exercise of religion,” they state. “This right can only be abridged for a compelling governmental interest, and only in a way that is narrowly tailored to be the least restrictive means of achieving the desired end.” “We think that the executive order issued last Wednesday fails this test. An order that sweeps so broadly that it prohibits, for example, a gathering of 11 people in a Cathedral with a seating capacity of several thousand defies reason,” they add. “Therefore, we have chosen to move forward in the absence of any specific timeline laid out by Governor Walz and his Administration,” they state. “We cannot allow an indefinite suspension of the public celebration of the Mass.” Follow @tdwilliamsrome

China’s increasingly strident propaganda attacks on the U.S. and Europe are a disgrace, President Donald Trump said late Wednesday, adding the campaign “comes from the top.” “[China’s Foreign Ministry] Spokesman [Zhao Lijian] speaks stupidly on behalf of China, trying desperately to deflect the pain and carnage that their country spread throughout the world. Its disinformation and propaganda attack on the United States and Europe is a disgrace,” Trump said on Twitter. He then pointed to the very top of the Chinese Communist Party in general and dictator Xi Jinping in particular, saying the anti-Western rhetoric “all comes from the top. They could have easily stopped the plague, but they didn’t!” “China is on a massive disinformation campaign because they are desperate to have Sleepy Joe Biden win the presidential race so they can continue to rip-off the United States, as they have done for decades, until I came along!,” he added. ….It all comes from the top. They could have easily stopped the plague, but they didn’t! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 21, 2020  China is on a massive disinformation campaign because they are desperate to have Sleepy Joe Biden win the presidential race so they can continue to rip-off the United States, as they have done for decades, until I came along! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 21, 2020  Trump has never backed away from challenging Chinese officials for trying to shift blame for the coronavirus pandemic that started in the southern China city of Wuhan late last year. Beijing’s response is to plead it did nothing wrong in handling the virus which has now spread to become a deadly global problem. Earlier in the day, the president blasted an unnamed official from the Communist government for comments on the pandemic. “Some wacko in China just released a statement blaming everybody other than China for the Virus which has now killed hundreds of thousands of people,” Trump wrote on Twitter on Wednesday morning, as Breitbart News reported. “Please explain to this dope that it was the ‘incompetence of China,’ and nothing else, that did this mass Worldwide killing!” Trump wrote. Some wacko in China just released a statement blaming everybody other than China for the Virus which has now killed hundreds of thousands of people. Please explain to this dope that it was the “incompetence of China”, and nothing else, that did this mass Worldwide killing! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 20, 2020  As Breitbart News reported, Beijing systematically prevented awareness of contagious disease control in the early days of the Wuhan outbreak, but is now promising to invest $2 billion in Chinese coronavirus response in the next two years and offer the world free access to a Chinese-made anti-coronavirus vaccine once it is developed.

Seven-in-ten Americans believe that wearing a mask in public is a “sign of respectfulness,” according to a YouGov poll released on Wednesday. The YouGov/HuffPost poll also found that 62 percent of Americans believe that wearing a mask is “more of a matter of public health than a matter of public choice” while nearly two-thirds of those surveyed said “they always or mostly wear a face mask or other covering when they’re in public and near other people (while grocery shopping, for instance).” The survey also found that 83 percent of Americans do not believe wearing a mask is a “sign of weakness” while just 8 percent believe it is “a sign of weakness to wear a face mask when in public and near other people.” A majority of Americans (63 percent) also believe that President Donald Trump and other government officials should wear masks in public and near others. These results are consistent with previous polling on masks. A Washington Post-University of Maryland poll released last week found that nearly 80 percent of Americans believe masks are “necessary” to wear outside the home, and a Morning Consult/Politico poll found that 70 percent of Americans believe Trump and Vice President Mike Pence should wear masks in public. The YouGov/HuffPost poll was conducted May 14-16 and has a margin of error of +/-4.1 percentage points.

On Wednesday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “The Last Word,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) stated that coronavirus tests, tracing, and treatment, funding for state, local, tribal, and territorial governments, direct payments and unemployment insurance, OSHA standards, funding for the Postal Service, vote by mail, and SNAP benefits are the “seven hills of Rome,” that House Democrats are “there to make sure prevail when we go to the table for negotiation” on the next coronavirus aide package. Pelosi began by saying that coronavirus “testing, tracing, and treatment” along with funding for state, local, tribal, and territorial governments and “injecting funds into our — the pockets of the American people with what we have with direct payments, unemployment insurance, etc.” are the “three pillars of the HEROES Act.” Which are built on provisions that were included in previous coronavirus legislation. She continued that OSHA standards, funding for the U.S. Postal Service, “voting at home,” and SNAP benefits are the additional four planks of the legislation. Pelosi concluded, “And so, those are what I call the seven hills of Rome, the three original pillars, the four issues that I just mentioned, that we’re there to make sure prevail when we go to the table for negotiation.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

Wednesday on Fox News Channel’s “The Story,” Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) dismissed complaints from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) about President Donald Trump’s focus on China for its part in the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Hawley scoffed at Pelosi’s characterization of Trump’s rhetoric on the communist Chinese as a “diversion.” “I would say if you think China is a diversion from the challenges that the United States faces, then you’re not living in reality,” Hawley said. “You need to come back to planet Earth. China is the single-greatest national security threat to this country. More than that, Martha — they’re the single-greatest economic threat. We’ve been losing jobs to China for years. We’ve been losing manufacturing to China for years. Now they’re building up their military, even as they unleash this pandemic on the world. We’ve got to change our relationship with China and the time to do it is right now.” The Missouri Republican signaled things would be different regarding the United States’ relationship with China from this point forward. “We’re just getting started in terms of standing up to them as a nation,” he added. “I can tell you — Beijing needs to understand that the free ride is over. The United States is back. We are going to protect ourselves and rebuild a better world for the 21st century.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor

On Wednesday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “The Last Word,” host Lawrence O’Donnell said that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is “two sneezes away from the presidency, with the fact that the president and vice president are not taking the necessary precautions.” During his opening monologue, O’Donnell said that the president “does have a plan to protect himself from the coronavirus pandemic. He requires everyone who works for him to be tested every day. He requires anyone who’s coming to see him to be tested before they’re allowed to be in a room with him.” Later, while introducing Pelosi, O’Donnell stated that she “is second in the line of succession for the presidency.” He explained, “[T]he reason I mention tonight, the line of succession for the presidency is that Mike Pence was in Florida today, very proudly having a hamburger with the governor of Florida, wearing no mask, not taking the recommended precautions. Donald Trump, obviously, doesn’t wear a mask. He’s going to go to a Ford factory tomorrow, where he surely will not be wearing a mask, not be taking all the precautions. And so, there’s that old saying that the vice president is a heartbeat away from the presidency, but it seems tonight, you are two sneezes away from the presidency, with the fact that the president and vice president are not taking the necessary precautions.” O’Donnell then asked Pelosi if she is “concerned about that situation with the president and the vice president, their lack of precautions?” Pelosi responded that she prays for both Trump’s and Pence’s safety, but her concern is that they are setting a bad example. She further noted that both Trump and Pence are surrounded by doctors, but people who follow their example aren’t. Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

Anti-government “extremists” seeking to terrorize Americans have infiltrated the anti-coronavirus lockdown movement and are baselessly accusing governors of trampling on civil rights, panelists argued during a virtual forum Wednesday held by Democrats on the House Homeland Security Committee. Reps. Max Rose (D-NY) and Emanuel Cleaver (D-MO) hosted the event on extremism during the coronavirus outbreak. Jonathan Greenblatt, the head of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) declared: Extremists are taking their hate to the streets marching alongside other angry Americans. We see anti-government extremists and militia members accusing governors across the country of trampling on their civil rights even as those governors desperately try to manage one of the most confounding health crises in our country’s 240 some odd year history. Outside the state capitol in Michigan, protesters angry over the restrictive anti-virus lockdown, including some carrying guns, have demanded that Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) end the shutdown. Similar protests have broken out across the country in response to coronavirus shutdowns that have devastated the American economy with the worst unemployment rates since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Panelist Ali Soufan, a former FBI counterterrorism agent who now heads the Soufan Group, a security consulting firm, grouped so-called “extremists” within the anti-lockdown movement with white supremacists, saying: Extremists are quick to make use of conspiracies and polarizing narratives in order to radicalize, recruit, and call for acts to violence, which poses a direct threat to the safety of the American people. Specifically, White supremacists blame Jews, immigrants, foreigners, and other minorities, like Asian Americans, for the pandemic. Anti-government extremists use the stay-at-home orders and other policies perceived as infringing on individual freedoms as an excuse to stockpile weapons. Soufan indicated that all those “extremists” have joined forces and are feeding off each other during the ongoing pandemic, pushing coronavirus disinformation. “All these anti-government people, the hate people, anti-semitic people, they are getting together, and now we are starting seeing them capitalizing on each other’s conspiracies and piggybacking off them,” he said. “All these movements are in a way celebrating together COVID-19 [coronavirus illness] because they feel that this is their opportunity to destroy the system that they don’t believe in,” Soufan added. Soufan and Greenblatt acknowledged that Islamic terrorists, like the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) and al-Qaeda, are also exploiting the coronavirus pandemic plaguing the world.

Wednesday on MSNBC, Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez accused President Donald Trump of attempting to “steal the election” by opposing vote-by-mail during the coronavirus pandemic. Host Chris Hayes said, “For more on the president’s efforts to subvert the democratic process, I’m joined by the chair of the Democratic National Committee. I’m always conflicted about, you know, stories of the variety the president tweeted. He tweets a lot of things and most of it is nonsense or lies or liable or slander or whatever. But the way he attacked absentee voting today struck me as genuinely dangerous and genuinely sort of threatening to democracy. How high on the priority list is it for you to do what you can to the safeguard administration of free and fair elections this fall?” Perez said, “It’s the highest priority, Chris because we know that you’re going to see voter suppression on steroids in the months ahead. We had a conversation I know about the election in Wisconsin recently where they tried to weaponize the pandemic to suppress the vote and steal the state supreme court race. It failed miserably. That’s what you’re going to see.” Hayes said, “I want to play for you something the president just said about voting, which struck me as deeply pernicious, this sort of voting is an honor and going off about how he doesn’t want people mail-in voting. Take a listen.” In a clip, Trump said, “Common sense would tell you it’s massive manipulation can take place, massive. They — and you do —you have cases of fraudulent ballots where they actually print them and give them to people to sign, maybe the same person signs them with different writing, different pens. I don’t know. A lot of things can happen. If you can, you should go and vote. Voting is an honor. It shouldn’t be something where they send you a pile of stuff, and you send it back.” Perez said, “Voting isn’t simply an honor, Chris, voting is a fundamental right. People pay the ultimate price to exercise the right to vote. And in a pandemic, the notion that you have a president going after Republican and Democratic secretaries of state in the middle of a pandemic, Secretary Benson is trying to make it easier for eligible people to exercise their right to vote. She’s trying to allow them to exercise the choice that the Michigan Constitution provides them.” He added, “What we have to do between now and November is make sure that every single voter in every single state has a choice. The choice to vote on election day. So the choice to early vote, the more days of early voting, the more social distancing you do and the right to vote absentee with no excuse, the right to vote by mail. Republicans and Democrats agree on that. This president, in a desperate effort to steal an election, is going to stop at nothing.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

On Wednesday’s broadcast of CNN’s “Situation Room,” Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms (D) stated that Georgia seems to be “doing better as a state,” and that while there are lags in infections, under the state’s reopening, “things are not as bad as I thought that they would be, yet.” Bottoms began by expressing concern about the worldwide spike in cases and by noting that “we’ve had so many questions about the data in our state and whether or not it’s accurate data, and I think really the telltale sign for so many of us will be what will be the impact on our hospitals.” She continued, “I know in Georgia, we are dismantling the expansion that we had in our World Congress Center. I hope it’s not too soon. But, right now, based on our analysis of the data that we have from the state, we are about on a ten-day decline. We need four more days, of course, to be in that 14-day decline that we have been awaiting.” Bottoms added, “Well, again, we are about ten days in. So, if we had followed the CDC guidelines, we would be four more days, and then we could begin to relieve some of those restrictions that were in place, but that being said, things are not as bad as I thought that they would be, yet. And I am very hopeful that they continue that way. But, as we know, with COVID-19, there’s often a lag in infections and when people begin to actually show symptoms and get sick. And so, right now, it appears that we’re doing better as a state, and I’ll keep watching and waiting.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

While President Trump takes steps to bring vital industries back to the United States, the Chamber of Commerce is already warning that the U.S. must continue to be reliant on foreign countries for goods, products, and supplies. This week, Trump announced a multi-million contract with Phlow Corporation, based in Richmond, Virginia, to begin returning pharmaceutical production to the U.S. “This is a great day for America,” White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said of the move. “This has all of the elements of the Trump strategy. It’s made in the USA. It’s innovation that will allow American workers to compete with the pollution havens, sweatshops, and tax havens of the world.” In an online conference, reported by Reuters, Chamber of Commerce CEO Tom Donohue said the U.S. must not reshore all of its production back to America and must stay reliant on foreign supply chains. “Protecting the resiliency of our supply chain doesn’t have to mean reshoring all production in the United States,” Donohue said. Donohue said there will “continue to be a huge place in the U.S. economy for a global supply chain.” As Breitbart News has chronicled, the U.S. has suffered from a shortage of vital drugs, rubber gloves, and plastic bottles due to decades-long free trade policies. The plurality of these basic necessities are made in China. Research by the Coalition for a Prosperous America (CPA) has revealed that reshoring all pharmaceutical production to the U.S. would create more than 800,000 American jobs. Likewise, reshoring all medical supplies to the U.S. has the potential to create more than 300,000 American jobs. For years, economic nationalists have urged the Trump administration to make permanent its 25 percent tariffs on billions of Chinese imports. CPA economists have said that a permanent 25 percent tariff on all Chinese imports would bring a million jobs back to the U.S. by 2024. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

A Tula, Russia, nurse is facing penalties for wearing nothing but a “swimming suit” beneath a clear protective suit along with gloves and goggles in the COVID-19 ward. First reported by local Russian newspaper Tula Pressa, the unidentified nurse was originally accused of wearing nothing but “lingerie” under her translucent personal protective equipment (PPE). Later, hospital administration admitted that the outfit was, in fact, merely a two-piece bathing suit. The unnamed nurse claimed that she was not aware that her (lack of) outfit was visible through the gear and that it was simply too hot on the coronavirus treatment ward to wear anything more. The hospital cited her for “non-compliance with the requirements for medical clothing,” and told The Sun that “a disciplinary sanction was applied to the nurse of the infectious diseases department who violated [uniform] requirements.” Despite the uproar, the hospital reported receiving “no complaints” from patients under her care, although one admitted feeling “some embarrassment.” In fact, many Russians responded to the viral story by applauding the stunt: “At least someone has a sense of humor in this gloomy, gloomy reality,” said Sergey Ratnikov. “Well done, she raised the mood of the patients,” another said. “Why punish the nurse?” someone asked. “You need to reward her. Seeing this outfit, no one wants to die.”

In a troubling sign for the exhibition industry, a new survey has found that the majority of consumers now prefer to watch new movies at home as fears about the Chinese coronavirus continue to outweigh the urge to go out. The study — which polled 1,000 consumers — asked if they would prefer to watch a new movie as a digital rental at home or in a traditional cinema. An overwhelming 70 percent of respondents said they are more likely to watch it at home while just 13 percent said they are more likely to venture out to the cinema. The remaining 17 percent of those polled said they were unsure. The study was performed by the analytics firm Performance Research, in partnership with Full Circle Research Co. The results were published Wednesday in Variety. John David Washington and Robert Pattinson in Tenet (Warner Bros. Pictures, 2020) Patrons watch a 3D IMAX movie at a theater of Wanda cinema run by Dalian Wanda Group Co. in Beijing, China, Monday, May 21, 2012. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan) “Just as the country begins to open up there has been a swing toward increasing caution, with a majority of Americans clearly saying ‘not yet’ when it comes to attending large public events,”  Jed Pearsall, president of Performance Research, told the Hollywood trade publication. Movie theaters around the country shut down in late March as the Chinese virus surged through the U.S. Except for a small number of cinemas, the vast majority of theaters remain closed. The indefinite hiatus has put the future of major chains including AMC Theatres and Regal Cinemas in jeopardy. Justin Timberlake and Anna Kendrick in Trolls World Tour (DreamWorks Animation, 2020) The major Hollywood studios are using the forced shutdown to experiment with releasing some of their titles directly to digital home video. Universal’s animated musical Trolls World Tour was the first major studio title to skip cinemas during the outbreak, followed recently by Warner Bros.’ animated Scoob! NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell recently said that more titles will skip movie theaters going forward. “I would expect that consumers will return to the theaters and we will be part of that. And I also expect that PVOD [premium video on demand] is going to be a part of that in some way. It’s not a replacement, it’s going to be a complementary element,” he said during an earnings call in April. His statements — as well as the digital success of Trolls World Tour — prompted AMC Theatres to say that its cinemas won’t show Universal movies in the future. The U.S. box office has been in decline in recent years as Netflix and other streaming options have kept more Americans at home. Last year’s domestic office dropped nearly 4 percent, its largest decline in five years. Follow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg. Have a tip? Contact me at dng@breitbart.com

It would cost nearly $440 million to test every nursing home resident and staff member in the United States once for COVID-19, according to data collected by the American Health Care Association (AHCA) and the National Center for Assisted Living (NCAL). The AHCA has also warned that regular testing of nursing home residents and staff members would be almost impossible without support from federal and state funding. Due to the differing amounts of residents and staff members in each state, some states would see a multi-million dollar bill for testing. States with numerous residents where it would cost the most to test nursing home residents and staff members include California ($36,381,000), New York ($33,955,950), Florida ($25,305,300), Ohio ($24,950,250), and Illinois ($21,441,150). Areas with fewer residents and staff members where testing would be cheaper include the District of Columbia ($755,850), Hawaii ($1,229,550), Deleware ($1,340,250), Montana ($1,383,750), and Idaho ($1,415,700). “For months now, we have been advocating for expanded and priority testing in nursing homes to protect our residents and caregivers, but this is a significant undertaking and cost for nursing homes to shoulder on their own,” said Mark Parkinson, President, and CEO of American Health Care Association and National Center of Assisted Living. “That’s why we have asked HHS to grant our request for a $10 billion emergency relief to help fund expedited testing and the additional staffing needed to respond to this unprecedented health crisis,” Parkinson added. The AHCA has also insisted that initial payments be made to each facility based on the number of residents and its size. In its recommendation, the association concluded that if a facility has 50 and under licensed beds, it should receive $50,000. Facilities with between 51 and 100 beds should receive $100,000, facilities with between 101 and 200 beds should receive $150,000, and facilities with more than 200 beds should receive $200,000. The AHCA and the NCAL also issued a joint statement to The U.S. Department of Health & Human Services and Federal Emergency Management Agency: A facility with COVID-19 positive residents would also receive an additional payment in the same amount as reflected above, to target buildings with an outbreak of any size. With all nursing homes now required to submit this data to CDC on a weekly basis, it allows for identification of these facilities more readily. Of the 15,000 Skilled Nursing Facilities in the U.S., the average initial payment would be around $120,000 for a total of $1.8 billion. Of those, roughly 5,000 have COVID-19 positive residents today, so the cost of the additional payment would be $600 million. A $10 billion fund would allow these payments to continue for three to four months. While there is likely a more targeted way to distribute funds, we need help immediately. We encourage HHS to use this formula, or another simple one, and then perhaps, consider a more targeted approach after the first month. We respectfully request that HHS and FEMA provide this urgent request for funding and additional supplies to help the long term care profession during this unprecedented public health crisis to protect our beloved residents and heroic caregivers. What we need now is to rally around nursing homes and assisted living communities the same way the public health sector has around hospitals. The data collected by the AHCA and the NCAL does not include the cost to test residents and staff at assisted living facilities and other long term care locations across the country.

Drugs can be manufactured in America more quickly, efficiently, and with better quality control than in China, said Rosemary Gibson, senior adviser at the Hastings Center and author of China Rx: Exposing the Risks of America’s Dependence on China for Medicine, offering her comments in an interview on Tuesday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with host Rebecca Mansour and special guest host John Hayward. Gibson explained processes allowing for competitive domestic production of medicines relative to foreign competitors. “We will have brilliant minds that will be using, for the first time, advanced manufacturing technology to make our basic medicines — these generic drugs — and they’ll make them faster, cheaper, with a smaller environmental footprint, and have real-time quality control,” Gibson said. “We’ll be doing all of that right here in the U.S.A.” Gibson added, “There’s been a traditional way of making drugs. It’s like making it in batches, like you might make spaghetti sauce in batches, but this is a sort of continuous process that’s been used in the chemical industry for a hundred years.” LISTEN:
 Gibson remarked, “In the pharma sector, there hasn’t been the innovation in how medicines are made, and with more of a continuous process, they can be made much faster, and you don’t need such a huge physical infrastructure. You still need large facilities, but you have a smaller facility footprint because the process is so much more efficient.” Gibson went on, “I’ll give you an example of how this works on a small scale. There’s technology now where — and it’s my lay term — it’s in a washing machine-sized box that these incredible engineers and chemists are making a thousand doses of an antibiotic in a lab in 24 hours, and we have the opportunity, eventually, to take this to scale.” “This is bringing new advanced manufacturing to a sector that has not invested in it but, with support of public and private sectors, that’s exactly what’s going to happen,” added Gibson. Gibson estimated, “This is starting a revolution in our country, and I’m hoping that more companies here in the United States will want to step up to the plate. Even better, [Phlow] is a company that is now a public benefit corporation, and it started the process to be a B corporation and that means [the company must] have a social mission [and] make a contribution to society.” Gibson shared, “I was asked to be an independent unpaid director to ensure that the company fulfills this mission for society. This is not something where we want taxpayers to be gouged on their drugs — this has happened too much in our country — and so it’s great to see people that want to do things for the right reasons.” On Tuesday, the White House announced its awarding of a $354 million contract with Phlow, a pharmaceutical manufacturer located in Richmond, VA, to manufacture medicines in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The federal government’s contract with Phlow includes a partnership with Virginia Commonwealth University and Civica Rx, noted Gibson. Gibson said, “[Civica Rx] is a non-profit group that is a consortium of about 1,300 hospitals, started by the Mayo Clinic and others. These private hospitals want to buy medicines that aren’t made in China, and so they could be a customer of the products that would be produced in this plant.” Gibson continued, “So we have the federal government that’s going to be asking these folks to make drugs for the Strategic National Stockpile, and they’ll also be making products for private hospitals in the United States. It’s a great public-private partnership, and I hope more federal agencies will come on board, and I hope that more hospitals and other private sector purchasers of medicines will eventually see the wisdom of buying medicines made in America.” Gibson explained how China’s mercantilist policies had destroyed much of America’s domestic pharmaceutical production. “We opened up free trade with China in 2000,” stated Gibson, “and within a couple of years of that free trade agreement with China being signed, that’s when the last penicillin plant in the U.S. closed. That’s when the last aspirin plant closed. We can’t make it anymore. The last vitamin C plant closed.” Gibson went on, “Bad trade deals, and China came in and cheated. They dumped [drugs] at below-market prices. They kept them low for several years, and they drove out American business as you can’t compete. If you and I want to set up a business tomorrow to make medicines, China could come in the next day and undercut us and drive us out of business.” Contracts between domestic drug manufacturers and large institutional purchasers of medicines are the ideal strategy to restore U.S. pharmaceutical production and counter China’s predatory pricing, determined Gibson. U.S.-based drug companies need “contracts with the government [and] with hospitals that lock in a fair price,” concluded Gibson, “not too low so we can’t keep our machines running properly, but not too high to gouge taxpayers and the public. Those long-term contracts [provide] an agreement that we’re going to work together to supply quality medicine. Once you have those, China can’t undercut those.” A restoration of domestic generic drug manufacturing would create “hundreds of thousands of good-paying STEM jobs,” added Gibson.

President Trump’s border controls have greatly reduced the strain that illegal immigration once put on American hospitals near the United States-Mexico border. Since March 21, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Title 42 order went into effect, U.S. Border Patrol agents have only taken about 230 border crossers to nearby American hospitals for treatment. Before the CDC order, Border Patrol agents told Breitbart News they were admitting about 75 border crossers every day to American hospitals, or more than 2,200 border crossers a month. In February, Border Patrol took more than 2,000 border crossers to American hospitals. The CDC order, which has cut illegal immigration by 84 percent and given Border Patrol agents the ability to swiftly deport border crossers, has helped drop that strain on American hospitals by 94 percent in just two months. In recent months, American citizens living in northern Mexico have started traveling to southern California for health care, inundating local hospitals. Border Patrol agents said there is no federal statute that prevents American citizens from traveling back to the U.S. to receive better medical treatment. As Breitbart News reported, Trump is readying a broader public health regulation to extend Border Patrol’s ability to have control over the southern border with quick apprehension and deportation rates.

President Donald Trump and his administration are currently considering a travel ban on Brazil after the South American country’s confirmed number of infections hit 275,000, the third-highest number of nationwide cases worldwide. Brazil surpassed the United Kingdom on Monday to become the country with the third-highest number of confirmed cases, behind Russia and the United States. Tuesday saw the number of cases rise by a record 17,408 people, with over 275,000 now having tested positive for the virus. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Trump admitted the country was “having some trouble” with coronavirus and a travel ban was under consideration. “We are considering it,” he said. “We hope that we’re not going to have a problem. The governor of Florida is doing very, very well testing – in particular Florida, because a big majority come into Florida. Brazil has gone more or less ‘herd’ [immunity, an attempt to maximize exposure to the virus], and they’re having problems.”  “I don’t want people coming over here and infecting our people,” he added. “I don’t want people over there sick either.” After nearly two months of quarantine, the United States is in the process of gradually reopening its economy after recording the highest number of cases worldwide. All 50 states have now begun easing lockdown measures in a bid to kickstart the American economy, which has shrunk at its fastest rate since the 2008 financial crisis. The most severely affected region of Brazil is the city of São Paulo, where Mayor Bruno Covas warned this weekend that the healthcare system could soon be overwhelmed if people refuse to abide by social distancing guidelines. “The city is coming to the limit of options,” Bruno Covas told journalists Sunday, warning that nine in ten intensive care beds were full. “We need to decide if we want to test the limits, or if we will be prudent and firmly maintain social isolation for the time needed so that the health system doesn’t collapse. We are closer than we would like.” Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro did not respond to Trump’s remarks when speaking to reporters on Wednesday, but he did confirm that Brazil’s Health Ministry would issue guidelines on the use of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for the coronavirus. Bolsonaro has sharply divided public opinion with his response to the outbreak, having repeatedly downplayed its significance and warned of the potentially devastating economic impact of lockdown measures. He has sharply antagonized regional governors who have chosen to implement lockdown measures, inspiring crowds to take the streets and protest.  Bolsonaro’s resistance to coronavirus safety measures resulted in the expulsion last month of then-Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta on the grounds that Mandetta did not appreciate the importance of ending lockdown measures as soon as possible.

Rebekah Jones, the woman inaccurately described as an “architect” and “scientist” behind Florida’s COVID-19 dashboard, sparked a political firestorm after claiming she was fired for refusing to manipulate data to “drum up support for the plan to reopen.” However, her accounts, including her claim of starting the dashboard “from scratch,” are falling apart as her patterns of questionable behavior — from getting booked for battery on a police officer in 2016 to facing active criminal charges of cyber stalking and cyber sexual harassment — emerge to the spotlight. Critics have long scrutinized Gov. Ron DeSantis’s (R) handling of the Chinese coronavirus in Florida. He initially exercised a tailored approach, laying a general groundwork and allowing localities to impose more drastic measures depending on the situations in their specific areas. DeSantis eventually issued a stay-at-home order for the state, but his success has been widely attributed to other decisions, including screening individuals hailing from coronavirus hotspots — installing checkpoints along the Florida-Alabama, Florida-Georgia border, and major Florida airports — and taking swift action to protect residents of nursing homes. Unlike his blue state counterparts, which directed such facilities to accept coronavirus patients, DeSantis’s administration virtually locked down nursing homes, imposing strict restrictions on those entering the facilities. As a result, Florida has seen far less cases and fatalities related to the virus despite the Sunshine State’s older, more vulnerable population. Although the current data speaks to the success of DeSantis’s approach, critics saw another opening for criticism after Rebekah Jones, who was widely and inaccurately described as an “architect” of the highly esteemed COVID-19 dashboard, claimed she was removed from her post for refusing to “manually change data to drum up support for the plan to reopen.” The Tampa Bay Times reported that officials “had directed her to remove data from public view that showed Floridians reported symptoms of the disease before cases were officially announced” — something Jones apparently viewed as “the wrong call.” “I understand, appreciate, and even share your concern about all the dramatic changes that have occurred and those that are yet to come,” Jones said in a letter regarding her departure. “As a word of caution, I would not expect the new team to continue the same level of accessibility and transparency that I made central to the process during the first two months. After all, my commitment to both is largely (arguably entirely) the reason I am no longer managing it,” she added. Despite her past claims and implications, Jones did not create the dashboard, nor did she analyze the data. The dashboard was created by Esri, a company providing geographic information system software. Additionally, Jones was part of an eight-person team tasked with visualizing the data reported by the 67 Florida counties. Furthermore, Jones has been inaccurately described as a scientist heading the project — another assertion that is false. She holds a PhD in geography, is not an epidemiologist, and was ultimately tasked with mapping the data. A source with knowledge of her removal told Breitbart News that Jones was simply asked to change the way that she was visualizing the data — not manipulate results. The Tampa Bay Times also alluded to that fact, explaining that the disagreement involved the temporary disappearance of the “EventDate” column, which “showed when people first reported coronavirus symptoms or positive test results”: For much of the next day, May 5, the column was either missing or empty, with every row listing “None.” Finally, it returned shortly before 8:02 p.m. Times reporters asked Health Department spokesman Alberto Moscoso that day why the data disappeared. Two days later, he said, “This field continues to be represented on the Department’s COVID-19 Dashboard.” In other words, public health experts asked Jones to disable the automatic exportation of data so experts could verify the results, according to an email from Department of Health I.T. Director Craig Curry, who cited Dr. Carina Blackmore, director for the Division of Disease Control and Health Protection, in his request to Jones. “Per Dr. Blackmore, disable the ability to export the data to files from the dashboard immediately. We need to ensure that dates (date fields) in all objects match their counterpart on the PDF line list published,” Curry wrote. DeSantis spokeswoman Helen Aguirre Ferré released a statement on Jones’s removal, noting that she was fired for “insubordination” and explaining that, despite the plentiful mischaracterizations and assumptions, Jones was not tasked with analyzing the data. Her duties “were to display data obtained by the Department’s epidemiological staff.” “The team that created the graphics on the dashboard, which was made up by multiple people, received data that was provided by subject matter experts, including Senior Epidemiologists, Surveillance Epidemiologists, and a Senior Database Analyst,” Ferré stated. She continued: Jones exhibited a repeated course of insubordination during her time with the Department, including her unilateral decisions to modify the Department’s COVID-19 dashboard without input or approval from the epidemiological team or her supervisors. The blatant disrespect for the professionals who were working around the clock to provide the important information for the COVID-19 website was harmful to the team. Accuracy and transparency are always indispensable, especially during an unprecedented public health emergency such as COVID-19. Having someone disruptive cannot be tolerated during this public pandemic, which led the Department to determine that it was best to terminate her employment. Jones’s past adds credence to DeSantis’s office claims of insubordination. During her time as a Louisiana State University (LSU) staff member in 2016, she was booked on “one count of battery on a police officer, one count of remaining after forbidden and two counts of resisting arrest,” according to LSU Police Department spokesperson Lt. Kevin Scott: Scott said officers arrived at the Sea Grant building when Jones refused to leave at the request of LSU Human Resources. Scott said Jones initiated physical contact against two LSUPD officers while resisting arrest and officers were forced to subdue her. She also has quite the rap sheet in Florida’s Leon County. “This woman also has a history, a pretty long track record of some pretty disturbing allegations against her in her personal life,” Real Talk 93.3’s Bobby Mac said on Wednesday’s Real Morning’s show, noting her altercation with a police officer, as well as “multiple restraining orders that have been filed by a former individual in a relationship with her that have been granted.” He also highlighted a “libel lawsuit that has gone against her as well,” adding, “This is a pattern of, I think, nefarious actions on the behalf of this individual.” Jones has also faced accusations of stalking, dating violence, and has been “arrested and charged with three felonies including robbery,” court documents indicate. “She’s not a data scientist. She’s somebody that’s got a degree in journalism, communication, and geography. She is not involved in collating any data,” DeSantis told reporters on Wednesday. “She does not have the expertise to do that. She is not an epidemiologist. She is not the chief architect of our web portal. That is another false statement,” he continued. “And what she was doing was she was putting data on the portal, which the scientists didn’t believe was valid data. So she didn’t listen to the people who were her superiors. She had many people above her in the chain of command,” the governor said, drawing attention to the active criminal charges against Jones in the state of Florida: Come to find out she’s also under active criminal charges in the state of Florida. She’s being charged with cyber stalking and cyber sexual harassment. So I’ve asked the Department of Health to explain to me how someone would be allowed to be charged with that and continue on, because this was many months ago. WATCH: Gov. DeSantis, with VP Pence at his side in Orlando, talks about the criminal charges against Rebekah Jones, sexual cyber harassment and cyberstaking. https://t.co/08X1RNxG1J pic.twitter.com/3fa2qCSFfo — WPEC CBS12 News (@CBS12) May 20, 2020  The governor added that he has a “zero tolerance policy for sexual harassment” and added that Jones should have been dismissed “long before.”

The South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported on Wednesday that, despite copious promises by the Chinese government to crack down on scammers and con artists, they are still preying upon foreign governments and private citizens desperate to buy masks and other protective equipment to combat the Wuhan coronavirus. China has long been the world’s largest producer of such equipment. The current state of the Chinese marketplace was described by knowledgeable observers as sheer chaos: Desperate buyers, many with little experience of doing business in China, have scrambled to secure medical protective equipment at astronomical prices. Export restrictions that appear to change with the wind have confounded customs workers and scuttled shipments. And con artists in China have fed off the frenzy with promises to source medical goods they cannot or will not deliver. To lure overseas buyers into making a purchase, they often make seductive sales pitches, claim false connections with legitimate medical manufacturers, flaunt authentic-looking paperwork and guarantee a speedy passage through customs. Michael Crotty, whose Shanghai-based firm Golden Pacific Fashion & Design is making face masks for export, said the “chaos and dysfunction is hard to describe”. The SCMP investigated the situation by sending reporters to pose as buyers of protective masks, hazmat suits, coronavirus test kits, and other supplies. They found shady characters lurking at every level of the Chinese market pushing dubious products and brandishing fraudulent certifications.  One outfit investigated by the SCMP appeared to have borrowed an unrelated person’s home address in Australia as the nominal location of its “temporary warehouse,” to the great consternation of the woman who lived there. Confronted with this and other sketchy details of his operation, the suspected con man – who claimed he could deliver an improbably large number of ventilators for coronavirus patients – spouted some slogans popularized by Chinese dictator Xi Jinping and then stopped communicating with the reporters. The SCMP said most legitimate sources of hot coronavirus equipment have backorders stretching into the winter, so desperate buyers are taking more chances on dodgy operations pushing low-quality products. Phony paperwork, false claims of ties to legitimate manufacturers, and special deals involving large sums of cash upfront have become common. The reporters said eight of the nine suppliers they investigated “provided documentation made out to different companies” when asked for their bona fides. The general sense conveyed by market experts who spoke with the SCMP is that buyers are so desperate to get their hands on coronavirus supplies that they are taking gambles on sources they know are dicey and allowing themselves to be shaken down for exorbitant prices. The Chinese Communist government is perpetually promising to crack down on scam operations, but Beijing’s efforts to date fall short of those promises and have made the market worse in some ways: After European buyers complained about defective products, China in April tightened export controls on a range of PPE goods. This further roiled medical-goods supply chains, creating confusion at customs and delaying shipments of much-needed cargo. Buyers, freight forwarders and legal professionals have been “befuddled” by vague wording and contradictory information in new export rules, [U.S.-based lawyer Steve] Dickinson said. “[They] put a range of legitimate steps on parties who were exporting, instead of just having it as a free-for-all,” said Nigel Blair, the head of Nihao Global, which has launched a vetted online marketplace for Chinese medical supplies. The market, however, was still rife with “bootleggers” trying to take advantage of the crisis, he added. China’s “gold rush” in mask production as the Wuhan coronavirus spread across the globe inspired over 38,000 companies to register as suppliers, overwhelming the ability of overseas buyers and regulatory agencies to tell good companies from bad. Some of the quality issues appear to stem from factory equipment that was hastily repurposed to create masks instead of other goods, using lower-grade material that was acquired for other purposes. Faulty medical equipment from Chinese suppliers has caused huge problems for buyers in Canada, Spain, the Czech Republic, the United Kingdom, Turkey, and the Netherlands, among others. The Chinese Communist Party has dismissed complaints about low-quality masks by blaming the victims for dealing with unlicensed suppliers, or in one notorious case, accusing the customers of using the defective equipment improperly.

While the major Hollywood studios continue to hammer out safety guidelines for when TV and movie production eventually returns, Tyler Perry is moving full steam ahead with his intention to re-start production at his Atlanta, Georgia, studio in early July, issuing a 30-page document outlining his plan to keep cast and crew members safe. Titled “Camp Quarantine,” the document enumerates the steps that Tyler Perry is taking to perform COVID-19 tests and to ensure that the “quarantine bubble” remains secure. “I want it to be abundantly clear that there was no way I could or would consider putting people back to work without a plan that takes extreme measures to try and mitigate as much risk as possible in our productions, and I think we’ve managed to do just that,” Perry wrote in an introduction to the internal document, which was obtained by The Hollywood Reporter. Perry is set to resume production on two BET series — The Oval and Sistas — on July 7. The shoots are expected to last just two weeks. He has previously stated that all cast and crew will remain on studio property — which is a former military base — for the duration of the shoots in order to minimize exposure.

They will then take private flights to Atlanta arranged by Perry. Cast and crew will be tested multiple times for COVID-19 upon arriving at the studio. “Once inside the quarantine bubble, participants are not permitted to leave for the entire 14-day period,” the document states. “All cast and crew are required to wear face masks at all times. Cast exceptions are during ﬁlming only and/or during make-up application and hair styling as determined necessary.”  Catering services will require people to wash their hands and wear masks before approaching the food area. There will be no self-service and all beverages and condiments will come in closed containers.
 Tyler Perry paid tribute to Charles Gregory Ross, a hair stylist  who came down with COVID-19 shortly after working at the studio and who later died.  “As my crew and I had been working with him on and off for over 15 years, it affects us all deeply as you could imagine. It’s still hard to believe,” Perry wrote.  Perry said that he has been in touch with the various Hollywood trade unions about a collective guild plan that is expected soon. “My team and I will gladly be sure to implement these updates into our existing plan when available.” Follow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg.

With highly competitive college entrance exams scheduled in December to prepare for, the government prioritized high school seniors’ return to school first. They are the first public school students to resume in-person classes in South Korea, and some of the first in Asia, Japan’s Nikkei reported. Younger students in South Korea will follow suit by June 8 as part of a phased reopening of schools. “We cannot let the 11 years of preparation by our students be in vain due to the COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] outbreak,” said Vice Minister of Education Park Baeg-beom. The university entrance exams have been rescheduled to December 3, two weeks later than usual, to accommodate the late start to the school year, which traditionally begins in early March. Prior to the reopening, the start of South Korea’s academic year had been delayed five times, according to the report. On Wednesday, students returning to the classroom had their temperatures checked upon entry. Some schools have installed thermal imaging cameras to detect those with a fever. Desks in some schools are equipped with clear plastic partitions, shielding pupils from their neighbors. Students are asked to wear masks and disinfect their desks every day, according to the report. The careful restart witnessed in educational institutions on Wednesday comes amid a general easing of coronavirus lockdown measures across South Korea which began on May 6. Government officials call the return to normal routines “everyday life quarantine,” according to the report. The relaxed social distancing measures follow an overall consensus by the government that it has successfully contained South Korea’s coronavirus outbreak, which was once one of the worst in the world, second only to outbreak epicenter China. This sense of a slowdown in the number of new coronavirus cases has been periodically contradicted by outbreaks of new virus clusters throughout the country. Most recently, on May 11, an outbreak of new cases was traced to a nightclub district in Seoul called Itaewon, where one man infected a host of other clubgoers. The incident caused a resurgence in the number of new coronavirus cases across the country, with 187 new infections linked to the Itaewon cluster documented as of Tuesday, the Nikkei reports. At least one private school teacher who visited Itaewon at the time of the outbreak tested positive for coronavirus. The instructor reportedly infected at least ten of his students, according to the report. Some private schools in South Korea resumed classes earlier than Wednesday’s public school reopening. So far, at least 41 public school staff, including teachers, have admitted to visiting the Itaewon clubs involved in the outbreak, according to data from South Korea’s Ministry of Education. Some underage students have also admitted to going clubbing in the district around the time of the outbreak, according to the report. “Concerns over small infection clusters still remain and no one can predict what kind of situation will arise at schools,” Education Minister Yoo Eun-hae said Wednesday, according to Agence France-Presse (AFP). Responding to concerns from parents about the recent cluster infections, Yoo said the education ministry had set up a “24-hour emergency situation room” this week. He assured parents of students that any schools reporting new coronavirus cases through the hotline will be immediately closed. In the city of Incheon, bordering Seoul, 66 schools were forced to delay the restart of classes by one day after two students tested positive for coronavirus on Wednesday. Hours after reopening, 66 schools told their students to go home and come back the next day while authorities clarified the situation, the Incheon Metropolitan City Office of Education said Wednesday. At press time on Wednesday, South Korea had recorded 11,110 infections and 263 deaths from the Chinese coronavirus.

The People’s Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), published a story Wednesday highlighting calls from Moscow to investigate American biological laboratories and linking them to the ongoing Chinese coronavirus pandemic. The Communist Party has repeatedly claimed that evidence exists that the true origin of the virus lies in the United States. During a recent briefing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying claimed that questions surround the safety protocols around a now-closed U.S. Army laboratory in Maryland and that e-cigarette, or vaping, related respiratory illnesses documented in America last year could have been early Chinese coronavirus cases. None of those diagnosed with vaping illnesses were contagious, a fact Hua has not addressed. The People’s Daily, actually reprinting an article by the state-run CGTN media outlet, noted that Russian Foreign Ministry Sergey Lavrov last week accused Washington of not being transparent in running biological laboratories, particularly in post-Soviet states. America’s “behavior has raised international concerns about what is really going on in the labs,” CGTN claimed Lavrov had suggested. As the Russian outlet TASS reproduced Lavrov’s comments last week, they were not directly linked to any discussion on the Chinese coronavirus. “For almost 20 years, Russia and most other countries, including China, have been calling for a protocol to the convention that would establish a mechanism to verify and check states parties’ compliance with their commitment not to create biological weapons,” Lavrov claimed. “The United States stands almost alone against this initiative. Tensions around the issue have escalated and Washington’s unwillingness to ensure the transparency of its military biological activities in various parts of the world raises questions about what is really going on there and what the actual goals are.” Lavrov did discuss the potential origin of the Chinese coronavirus, but in a way that appeared more defensive on China’s behalf than accusatory towards America. “When we say that reasons behind emergence of the coronavirus infection must be determined, I believe that it is an absolutely justified wording. However, this must be approached from the standpoint of sense, of substance,” he said. “We are against […] politicizing this scientific, humanistic approach in dirty competition.” The location where the virus first infected human beings is not a matter of significant debate outside of complaints from the Chinese government and its allies. The first known cases of Chinese coronavirus infection occurred in Wuhan, China; leaked Chinese government documents time the first diagnosis in mid-November 2019. Some Chinese state media outlets have tried to disseminate the conspiracy theory that American soldiers brought the virus to Wuhan in October 2019, when the city hosted the Military World Games, but no evidence of any infections tied to that event exists. Challenging the lack of evidence of any coronavirus cases outside of Wuhan before this time, as Lavrov appeared to do, allows for a defense of the Communist Party’s moves to silence anyone aware of an infectious disease outbreak and destroy early samples of the virus in January 2020. The CGTN report implied that Lavrov’s comments opened the door for an investigation into Beijing’s allegation that the virus may have originated in America, citing the Fort Detrick, Maryland, U.S. Army lab as “the center of the U.S. government’s darkest experiments.” The lab ceased functioning in July. “What’s even more worrisome was that a vaping-related lung disease, the symptoms of which resemble those of COVID-19 pneumonia, broke out in a community just one hour’s drive away from the lab shortly after the lab was shut down,” the article alleged. “The timing and the location of the outbreak appear dubious, especially since e-cigarettes have been sold in the country since 2007.” The report echoed Hua Chunying’s comments in the beginning of the month. “There are also reports that soon after the closure [of the Fort Detrick laboratory], ‘E-cigarette disease’ broke out in the surroundings,” Hua told reporters. “According to data released by the US CDC in late February, the flu season that begins in the winter of 2019 has infected at least 32 million people in the United States, including 18,000 deaths from flu-related illnesses.” Maryland did not document a significantly elevated number of vaping related illnesses compared to other states. Hua did not offer any explanation for how Maryland could be the birthplace of the outbreak if other states hundreds of miles away experienced vaping illnesses prior to Maryland, nor did she address the fact that none of those patients were isolated and there is no evidence of their illnesses infecting health workers or others near them. The Chinese coronavirus, considered a close relative to the SARS virus which also originated in China, is considered highly contagious through fluid droplets in the air. In the article the People’s Daily published on Wednesday, Chinese media found the American government’s lack of comment on the bizarre conspiracy suspicious. “Unsurprisingly, U.S. authorities and politicians have remained silent on the issue,” the report claimed. “The unusual silence from Washington has raised international concerns as to what kind of risks the U.S. biolabs, which are found in former Soviet Union member countries, Southeast Asian nations and African countries, may pose to global public health security.” The report appears to be an effort to galvanize global support for an international probe into American biological research, ostensibly to find the “true” origin of the virus. Last week, the Global Times, another Communist Party publication, suggested that China and its allies should use venues like the U.N. Security Council to force an international investigation into the labs in question. China could potentially find in Russia an ally for such an investigation. For years, the Russian Defense Ministry has accused the United States of creating biological weapons in laboratories throughout Eastern Europe. In 2018, the ministry explicitly claimed that the Richard G. Lugar Center for Public Health Research in Tbilisi, Georgia, was a secret weapons development center. Russian officials spread alleged Georgian documents claiming that American researchers were using “volunteers” as experimental victims in creating biological toxins. The Pentagon responded by calling the claims “an invention of the imaginative and false Russian disinformation campaign against the West” and “obvious attempts to divert attention from Russia’s bad behavior on many fronts.” Russian conspiracy media revived the Lugar Center rumors in relation to the Chinese coronavirus outbreak, claiming that it may have been the origin location of the pandemic. These reports did not acknowledge that the center has long cooperated with the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) and conducted its research openly, accepting international visits.

Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) blasted the establishment media over its stream of criticisms and dismissal of Florida’s hopeful coronavirus trends, stating bluntly that far too many reporters “waxed poetically for weeks and weeks about how Florida was going to be just like New York” — something that never happened. “Our data is available. Our data is transparent. In fact, Dr. Birks has talked multiple times about how Florida has the absolute best data,” DeSantis, who stood alongside Vice President Mike Pence, told reporters on Wednesday. “So any insinuation otherwise is just typical partisan narrative trying to be spun. And part of the reason is that you’ve got a lot of people in your profession who waxed poetically for weeks and weeks about how Florida was going to be just like New York,” he continued, repeating their previous claims. “‘Wait two weeks. Florida’s going to be next. Just like Italy. Wait two weeks,'” DeSantis said. “Well hell, we’re eight weeks away from that, and it hasn’t happened.” DeSantis added that Florida has a lower death rate compared to areas around the country, including New York, D.C., Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio. “But even in our region — Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia — Florida has the lower death rate, and I was the number one landing spot from tens of thousands of people leaving the number one hot zone in the world to come to my state,” he explained. “So we’ve succeeded, and I think that people just don’t want to recognize it, because it challenges their narrative. It challenges their assumptions,” he added: DeSantis says any insinuation Florida doesn't have best data is typical partisan narrative. "You've got a lot of people in your profession who waxed poetically for weeks and weeks about how Florida was going to be just like NY."https://t.co/jTzJmKk8X0 pic.twitter.com/1sGw3Z1P3V — WFLA NEWS (@WFLA) May 20, 2020  Establishment media outlets and Democrat politicians blasted DeSantis’s approach to addressing the pandemic in his state from the onset, warning that his refusal to immediately impose far-reaching lockdown orders would lead Florida, which has a large elderly population, to become the next U.S. hotspot, or worse, the next Italy. DeSantis, however, quickly focused on protecting vulnerable individuals in nursing homes, almost immediately limiting those who could enter the facilities as blue states, like Pennsylvania, directed facilities to accept patients who tested positive for the virus. Since then, nearly 70 percent of coronavirus deaths in the Keystone State have been connected to nursing homes. While DeSantis eventually issued a stay-at-home order, he largely laid the groundwork, relying on localities to enforce orders tailored specifically to their areas. He also focused on screening individuals hailing from coronavirus hotspots, installing checkpoints on major roads and implementing screenings at several Florida airports. Florida, with a population of over 21 million, reported 47,471 positive cases of the virus and 2,096 related fatalities, as of Wednesday afternoon. Florida hospitals, DeSantis has noted, never reached capacity, nor did they experience a shortage of ventilators. The Sunshine State is currently in the first phase of the reopening process, with retailers, restaurants, and gyms operating at limited capacities.

Construction workers at the University of Alabama’s Bryant-Denny Stadium have reportedly been hit with a “significant” coronavirus outbreak, a report says. The university implemented a $106 million renovation of the 91-year-old stadium last November, and officials were counting on construction to be done by the November kickoff of the 2020 college football season. But now there is some doubt that the stadium will be ready in time, al.com reports. “More than 10 people have tested positive for COVID-19, according to people familiar with the outbreak, but the number could be much higher,” al.com reported on Wednesday. “With so many exposures and a lack of transparency about the outbreak, there is a fear that more positive cases linked to the job site are inevitable. “The large number of positive tests means, essentially, everyone at the job site could have been exposed,” the report added. School officials, though, say that they have insisted that contractors working on the stadium follow coronavirus protocols. In a statement, the University of Alabama said: From the start of the pandemic, UA has continuously mandated that our campus contractors take all necessary steps to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. The contractors immediately adapted operations and processes, engaged in heightened cleaning, and took other protective measures for the health and safety of their employees. The University directly provided sanitation supplies, thermometers, and signage at all construction sites, and made personal protective equipment available to all contractors. Those processes, which have been in place since early March, are continuously refined based on the latest guidance from state, federal and industry leaders in order to protect the health and safety of the campus community. Additional signs reminding workers to stay six feet apart have been posted on the job site. Work continues on the stadium, though, despite the number of those who have tested positive for the virus.

President Trump is edging out Joe Biden, the Democrat Party’s presumptive nominee, in key battleground states and is also leading in support among independent voters in those states, a CNBC/Change Research poll released Wednesday revealed. The survey, taken among 5,408 likely voters in the battleground states Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin from May 15 to May 17, showed the president holding an edge over Biden, 48 percent to 46 percent — a lead just outside the 1.9 percent margin of error. The survey also shows Trump holding an even greater advantage among independent voters in those battleground states, besting the former vice president 41 percent to 32 percent. While voters remain split on who would handle the coronavirus pandemic better, voters believe Trump would do a better job on handling the economy moving forward, 51 percent to 40 percent. Republicans, overall, have a more positive outlook when it comes to the coronavirus. Seventy-one percent of Republicans believe things are improving, but Democrats and independents tend to disagree. Only 35 percent of independents believe things are on the mend, with the percentage shrinking even further among Democrats, with 12 percent. The survey also found that Democrats and independents are more likely to believe that the U.S. will see a second wave of the virus by the end of the year. CNBC reported: 99% of Democrats say that there is at least a 50-50 chance of a second wave in U.S. infections before the end of the year, with 94% telling pollsters that it will probably or definitely happen. On the other hand, 38% of Republicans said a second wave will probably or definitely not appear, with 41% saying there’s a 50-50 chance. More than 8 in 10 independents see at least a 50-50 chance of a second wave this year, with 37% saying there will definitely be one and 19% saying it is probable. If there is a second wave, swing-state voters are divided over who should be blamed. Democrats overwhelmingly said the two people or groups most responsible would be Trump and states that reopened their economies too soon, while Republicans said it would be the fault of China and Democrats. Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in all of the battleground states featured in the CNBC/Change Research poll in 2016.

All states in America had begun a phased reopening of their economies as of Wednesday after shutting down non-essential businesses to stem the spread of COVID-19, the illness associated with the novel coronavirus. Although lockdown orders remain in effect in a handful of states as well as the nation’s capital and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, some non-essential businesses in those regions have reopened, data compiled by the New York Times revealed as of Wednesday afternoon, echoing other analyses. Still, Democrat-allied mainstream media outlets like the Times argue that it is premature for states to reopen at this juncture, despite some metrics, like hospitalizations, showing improvements in the coronavirus situation across the United States. While some health experts have acknowledged that deaths and cases may increase with the reopening of the country as more people go outside their homes, others warn about the potentially lethal costs of keeping the shutdown in place. Testing has also improved in recent weeks, which will lead to health officials detecting more cases. Several states (8) did not impose a shutdown. The vast majority of the remaining ones have allowed their shelter-in-place order to expire, either already or by next week (35). Puerto Rico’s stay-at-home order will expire next week on May 25. Meanwhile, the District of Columbia has extended its quarantine order to June 8. Some states may choose to extend their quarantine orders after they expire or cut them short if conditions improve. On Tuesday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin warned a Senate panel about the devastation long-term shutdown measures can have on the American economy. “There is [a] risk of permanent damage,” he told the Senate Banking Committee. Echoing other health experts, Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), cautioned in April that there is a clear and present danger that lockdown measures may fuel mental health issues like suicides. “Particularly with suicide, one worries about the people who already are struggling with depression, and then are put in a circumstance of being isolated from others,” Dr. Collins told the medical news site STAT. “That’s exactly the wrong thing.” “So that’s one more reason why we need to figure out [the health consequences of the lockdowns] in a safe way, and an evidence-based way how we can get ourselves back out there again because people are suffering with this,” he added. President Donald Trump has acknowledged there is a real health cost to keeping people cooped up in their homes for long periods. The Trump administration has provided guidelines for states to reopen. President Trump, however, has left it up to the states to decide when and how.

CVS Health announced it is giving back the $43 million it received in coronavirus relief funds from the government. CVS Chief Executive Larry Merlo wrote in a letter Tuesday to Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar that his company automatically received the money through the CARES Act Provider Relief Fund, which according to the HHS gave $175 billion to hospitals and health care organizations involved in the coronavirus response, and that his company did not request the money. “We have made the decision to return the funds and forgo participation in subsequent disbursements,” Merlo said. “In doing so, we hope to help HHS provide additional support to other providers who are facing significant financial challenges as a result of the pandemic.” CVS Health has continued to operate during the pandemic and has even indicated it would be hiring additional people. In March, the company said it would hire 50,000 people across the U.S. The following month, the company announced that it would expand its coronavirus testing capabilities. But the pandemic has affected the company’s stock, as shares of CVS have gone down more than 14 percent since the beginning of the year.

An Indiana man who served during World War II as an air force mechanic and survived the attacks on Pearl Harbor has recovered from the coronavirus at age 98. Robert Bates was only one out of three men in his group to survive when Japan bombed Pearl Harbor, WZZM reported. After World War II, he returned home to work for the U.S. postal service. He has been a long-term care resident at American Senior Communities since 2015. After he tested positive for the coronavirus, Bates spent weeks in the Indianapolis VA Hospital battling double pneumonia. Once he defeated coronavirus and its complications, he returned to his nursing home. Bates, also known as Paw Paw, lost weight and strength during his illness, but according to the nursing home, he is making “wonderful progress.” “God and the love of my family keep me going every day. Life is a blessing and I still have some living to do,” Bates said. Bates is among many veterans around his age who have beat the coronavirus. In one case, an Oregon World War II veteran beat the coronavirus at age 95 while another World War II veteran defeated the virus at age 104. A 91-year-old two-time veteran also from Indiana defeated the coronavirus as well.

Washington Redskins rookie receiver Antonio Gandy-Golden said Wednesday he tested positive for the new coronavirus in March and has fully recovered. Gandy-Golden said in a statement that he tested positive during NFL draft training on March 24, had mild symptoms and was cleared on April 7. “I self-quarantined for two weeks and followed all guidelines from health experts,” he said. “I feel 100% now and can’t wait to get on the field with the Redskins.” Gandy-Golden played the past two seasons at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia, which reopened in March despite the COVID-19 pandemic. Jerry Falwell Jr., president of the evangelical school, appeared to reference Gandy-Golden during a Fox News appearance on Wednesday. “Even the one student who was an online student who never was on campus who tested positive, it turns out he quit school to go into the NFL draft back early in March even though he was online, but somehow that got press,” Falwell said. “That was crazy.” Liberty spokesman Scott Lamb responded to an email inquiry about Gandy-Golden’s diagnosis and Falwell’s comments with a paragraph from the school’s website that does not specifically mention the former football player. The site makes reference to a graduated student who tested positive for the coronavirus on March 24 but was not on campus during the two weeks prior. “Prior information that the graduated student came to an on campus clinic was incorrect,” it said. “While the student lives in Lynchburg with family, the location of infection cannot be pinpointed, in part, because the graduated student traveled to Florida on business in the two-week period before the test.”
A Redskins spokesman said the team was unable to comment on Gandy-Golden’s medical situation.
Washington selected Gandy-Golden in the fourth round of the draft last month, 142nd overall. He was not asked about his health during a conference call with reporters on April 25.

President Donald Trump on Wednesday urged Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to lift the draconian coronavirus lockdowns in her state after two dams burst due to flooding. “Governor must now ‘set you free’ to help,” Trump wrote to Michigan residents on Twitter. “Will be with you soon!” Whitmer has closed nonessential businesses through May 28th due to the coronavirus, making Michigan one of the most strict states on mandatory lockdowns. Floodwaters breached two dams in Midland County as officials are currently evacuating up to 10,000 people in the area. The president said that the “best” military and FEMA teams were responding to the tragedy. “My team is closely monitoring the flooding in Central Michigan – Stay SAFE and listen to local officials,” he said. “Our brave First Responders are once again stepping up to serve their fellow citizens, THANK YOU!” We have sent our best Military & @FEMA Teams, already there. Governor must now “set you free” to help. Will be with you soon! https://t.co/cuG1YacPdx — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 20, 2020 

Ford has slammed the brakes on assembly lines at two key factories as the U.S. automaker struggles to get back on its feet following a two-month long coronavirus shutdown. Ford stopped the assembly lines at its Dearborn Truck Plant on Wednesday afternoon after a worker there tested positive for coronavirus.  The Dearborn plant makes the Ford F-150 pickup, the companies biggest money-maker. The Dearborn closing follows the closing of a Ford plant in Chicago on Wednesday morning after one of that factory’s workers tested positive. The Chicago plant makes the popular Ford Explorer and the Lincoln Aviator SUV. The company began to relaunch assembly plants on Monday, promising to keep workers safe and to closely monitor for signs of infection and quickly test workers. The company said that it believes the workers were not infected at the plants but arrived at work with the virus having contracted it during the shutdown. 


SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — A South Korean soccer club is facing penalties, including expulsion from its own stadium, for putting sex dolls in empty seats during a match last weekend. The K-League is one of the few soccer leagues operating during the coronavirus pandemic, with games being played in empty stadiums. FC Seoul’s attempts to increase the atmosphere at Seoul World Cup Stadium backfired despite its 1-0 win over Gwangju on Sunday. The club expressed its “sincere remorse” as public backlash intensified, but said it was assured by a supplier that it was using mannequins — not sex dolls — to mimic a home crowd. About 25 mannequins were supplied by a local company and dressed in FC Seoul colors and wearing masks. The Yonhap news agency reported that fans posted suspicions about the life-size dolls on social media during the match and one banner showed the names of an adult toy manufacturer and of models who had inspired those dolls.
Such advertising is in breach of the competition’s rules, and K-League officials have referred the matter to a disciplinary committee. If found guilty, FC Seoul could be fined about $4,000 or have points deducted. The club could also be punished for damaging the prestige of the league at a time when it had been basking in unprecedented international attention. On May 8, the K-League became the first major soccer league to start playing after the coronavirus pandemic shuttered sports around the world. The opening game attracted 19 million viewers worldwide. There could be worse to follow for FC Seoul, the 2016 league champion. According to reports, Seoul Facilities Corporation, which operates the stadium, is investigating a potential breach. As part of its lease agreement, the club is required to obtain permission in advance for advertising. By not doing so, it could be expelled from the stadium where it has been based since 2004. FC Seoul issued another apology on Wednesday as the case continued to dominate sports news. Yonhap said the club had asked the police to investigate.
“We apologize deeply to all those concerned about the unfortunate situation that occurred,” the club said. “We will review our internal procedures to ensure this does not happen again.”

As the restrictions put in place by the federal and state government to prevent the spread of the coronavirus morph from weeks to months, physicians said on a conference call with reporters on Tuesday that the real threat to Americans is the lack of access to health care.  Screen grab/A Doctor A Day website It’s fear, not the virus, that is leading to dangerous and deadly health outcomes, from children falling behind on routine vaccines to people with serious conditions like heart disease and depression staying at home instead of seeking help. “I just feel that’s there’s a very big disconnect between what the average American thinks is going on and what’s actually going on,” Dr. Simone Gold, an emergency room physician, said on the call. Gold told reporters about a middle-aged woman she met in the emergency room who had fallen while attempting to color her own hair because she couldn’t go to a salon. The woman had a broken hip and shoulder and required surgery. Dr. Mark McDonald, a psychiatrist who specializes in child and adolescent psychiatry, said on the call that for the first time in his ten years of praticing, he lost a patient. The woman, who suffered from depression and had struggled with drug addiction, died at home alone of an opioid overdose. “I am certain that the cause of her death was due to a withdrawal of support in the community, and the withdrawal of her ability to be in school, her inability to [deal with] the added stress,” McDonald said. MEDIA SPREADS FEAR And fear of dying from the virus is being fomented by the media, the physicians said. “All you have to do is watch the six o’clock news here in L.A. to know why they are avoiding the health care system,” Dr. Steven Giannotta, the chairman of neurosurgery at the University of Southern Californian, said on the call. “Because we’ve allowed the media … to stigmatize COVID positivity.” He went on to say: They give two statistics every time — they open their newscast with the number of people who have tested positive for COVID and immediately adjacent to that, the number of people who have died with COVID making, unfortunately, in the viewer’s mind, a nexus between COVID positivity and death. It’s stigmatized our health care system and people are afraid to access the health care system for fear of becoming COVID positive, as if that is the worst possible outcome. But, in fact, it is far more dangerous to stay at home if you have a serious health condition that needs regular treatment, Giannotta said. Dr. Robert Hamilton, a pediatrician in California, said on the call that the lockdown is also hurting young people who are missing out on social time with friends and classroom structure as schools continue to be shuttered. Hamilton said that the Los Angeles Times reported that online learning is not replacing either experiences and that 15,000 students have disappeared as it related to being in touch with teachers online and some 40,000 students have failed to check in daily. Hamilton warned about “the emotional and social toll that this is taking on children being in lockdown for this period of time.” “Issues of depression, suicide, stress, that sense of futility, despair, fear, and paranoia really, are taking hold in our young people,” Hamilton said. LOCKDOWN DANGERS Moreover, the doctors agree that while the initial lockdown for a couple weeks or so to make sure that hospitals and the health care infrastructure was prepared for a surge of the coronavirus was wise, the ongoing restrictions are not only not helping stop the spread of the disease but are delaying the inevitable course of this and many other viruses.  “The reality of herd immunity is obviously we don’t know until we know,” Dr. Jeffrey Barke, co-founder of the Person Care Physicians in Newport Beach, California, said. “But we have examples of past respiratory viral infections where we’ve been able to reach a level of herd immunity to protect the most vulnerable.” “For every child and for every young adult that is locked indoors and is not allowed to be exposed to the virus when they overwhelming do well, especially if you are under the age of 40 or even 50, that’s one person less to achieve that level of herd immunity,” Barke said. He continued: Even if we don’t get up to the recommended 60, 70 or 80 percent of immunity within the population – even it we only reach 30 or 40 percent – that’s 30 or 40 percent of Americans that are exposed, that are immune and that are no longer able to spread the virus and are able, in some regard, to protect the most vulnerable.  So the reality is that we are way past the time where being locked down makes any scientific or medical sense. We are taking the healthiest folks – the youngest, the strongest, our children – and we are in effect protecting the healthiest herd from being exposed and allowing them to get herd immunity. So this idea that somehow we have to wait for a vaccination or a cure to this virus in order to open up schools just makes no scientific sense whatever. “in my view, this is a pandemic of hysteria and emotional overload,” McDonald said. “Beyond a medical pandemic.” “And the downstream consequences medically are very, very severe,” McDonald said. EDUCATE PUBLIC AND LEADERS The conference call, which was hosted by the Tea Party Patriots Action, was also held to announce the launch of a website to educate the public and also to announce that more than 500 doctors have signed a letter delivered to President Donald Trump to share their concerns. “There are more than one miliion licensed physicians in this country,” the website states. “Do you really believe there is only one opinion? Thousands of physicians have something to tell you.” “America needs a second opinion,” the website states. The A Doctor A Day website will feature daily stories from doctors across the country. The letter to Trump, after thanking the president for his leadership during the health crisis, was crafted to “express our alarm over the exponentially growing negative health consequences of the national shutdown.” ADAD Letter – Signed by Breitbart News on Scribd  The letter also said, in part: We are alarmed at what appears to be the lack of consideration for the future health of our patients. The downstream health effects of deteriorating a level are being massively under-estimated and under-reported. This is an order of magnitude error.  It is impossible to overstate the short, medium, and long-term harm to people’s health with a continued shutdown. Losing a job is one of life’s most stressful events, and the effect on a person’s health is not lessened because it also has happened to 30 million other people. Keeping schools and universities closed is incalculably detrimental for children, teenagers, and young adults for decades to come.  The millions of casualties of a continued shutdown will be hiding in plain sight, but they will be called alcoholism, homelessness, suicide, heart attack, stroke, or kidney failure. In youths it will be called financial instability, unemployment, despair, drug addiction, unplanned pregnancies, poverty, and abuse.  Because the harm is diffuse, there are those who hold that it does not exist. We, the undersigned, know otherwise.  HURTING FRONTLINE WORKERS And the lockdown has also hurt many workers, including staff that work for physicians, including nurses and technicians, who are so often now regularly celebrated for being on the “frontlines” of fighting the virus. Gold said when people thank her for her work and express worry that she and other in the health care sector are “overwhelmed” she responds otherwise. “I cannot say strongly enough that the health care system not only is not overwhelmed, it is underwhelmed,” Gold said. “I can give you scores of nurses who have been laid off and scores of technicians that have been laid off.” “Emergency physicians have cut their hours by 35 percent,” Gold said. She said her hospital laid off 50 percent of its technicians. “I’ve never seen anything like this in my career,” Gold said. Moreover, the doctors said that reopening the country is not as difficult as some would say if “commonsense” protocols are followed. And that does not include mandatory mask-wearing or social distancing. “This concept of social distancing, I think, has sort of gotten away from us,” Dr. Scott Barbour, an orthopedic surgeon in Atlanta, said on the call. “There’s no scientific data to back up social distancing.” And, Barbour said, his practice, which employs about 130 people, has mostly remained in operation over the course of the shutdown, with the exception of treating certain high-risk patients. “I think what this shows is that we can reopen the country with commonsense precautions, like washing hands, avoiding shaking hands and cleaning surfaces like doorknobs and countertops that are likely to be contaminated,” Barbour said. The physicians told a reporter who suggested on the call that this coalition is political because it partnered with the Tea Party for the call said they chose Jenny Beth Martin’s organization because they fight for health care freedom and the importance of the patient/doctor relationship. “We are basically sick and tired of the politicization of our health care field,” Barke said. “We just want to take care of patients.” “Thousands and thousands of doctors across this country that want nothing more than to get back to work to care of their patients and provide the best health care that they possible can,” Barker said. “We want to take politics out of health care and get back to the art of taking care of patients once again.” Follow Penny Starr on Twitter

Ohio State Athletic Director Gene Smith expressed optimism on Tuesday, that there will be a way for the Buckeyes home stadium to be at least partially full this year. According to Kyle Rowland of the Toledo Blade, Smith said he’s “confident” that as many 20-30k fans may be able to attend games at Ohio Stadium: Ohio State AD Gene Smith says he’s confident that a plan can be implemented where 20,000 to 30,000 fans can attend football games in Ohio Stadium. — Kyle Rowland (@KyleRowland) May 20, 2020  Though, the clock is certainly ticking if the Buckeyes are to play a full season this year. Gene Smith says scheduling has to be completed in early July for a fall football season to take place. — Kyle Rowland (@KyleRowland) May 20, 2020  Ohio Stadium has a 102,000 seat capacity, but can and has gone as high as 110,000 for big games such as Michigan or Michigan State. Smith hastened to add that he is still not entirely comfortable with the idea of football being played. Gene Smith says he’s not 100 percent comfortable yet with football being played. — Kyle Rowland (@KyleRowland) May 20, 2020  Still, much of what determines whether fans will be in the stadiums this year, is the reopening process dictated by state governments. Given Ohio’s current status, it’s entirely possible that fans could be allowed in the games with social distancing restrictions in place. That would essentially give put the number of fans in roughly the 20-30k proximity that Smith talked about. While teams in the Midwest and the South might be able to hold games with some fan attendance, the outlook appears to be more bleak in states like California and New York where reopening is taking place at a slower rate. However, on the upside, the governors of California and New York have recently voiced support for getting their sports teams back on the field. Though, at this point, without fans.

New York City’s oldest gun store, the John Jovino Gun Shop, is closing down after its owner admitted he can no longer pay rent without customers. NY1 reports store owner Charles Hu saying he hoped to stay open one more year, so he could retire at age 75, but it was simply not feasible financially. Jeremiah’s Vanishing New York spoke to Hu about his store’s closure. He noted problems paying rent, the coronavirus “shutting down business,” and the crippling degree of regulations that had to be met in order to operate the business. News Break reports that the John Jovino Gun Shop is located on Grand Street in Little Italy. It opened “in 1911 in the shadow of the former police headquarters on Centre Street.” AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

NYU has announced its plans to reopen campus for the fall semester. The university claims that it will adopt a variety of precautionary measures to mitigate the spread of the Chinese virus on campus. According to a press release published on Tuesday, New York University will reopen its campuses for the fall semester. The university announced that the upcoming academic year will be structurally modified to mitigate the spread of the virus. For example, some courses will operate in a “mixed mode” under which some sessions will still take place online. In the press release, NYU Provost Katherine Fleming said that the university intends to reopen its campuses around the world. NYU currently operates campuses in New York City, Abu Dhabi, and Shanghai. NYU additionally operates “academic centers” in cities including Berlin, Germany, Florence, Italy, and Sydney, Australia. We’re planning to reconvene in person, with great care, in the fall (subject to government health directives), both in New York and at our Global sites. I can’t pretend that 2020-21 will be a typical academic year. We’ll be living with safety measures and will have to be highly flexible so we can respond to a changing landscape. I can promise you, however, that our goal is to enable you to stay on track academically in a way that works best for you in the current context and that maximizes flexibility. We’re committed to ensuring that all of our students receive the high-quality education that drew them to NYU, even though some students will likely be unable to make it to New York. NYU also announced that it will provide masks for all members of the community. Additionally, the use of masks will be mandatory for the fall semester. The university also claimed that it will restructure classrooms to make it practical for students to follow social distancing guidelines. Breitbart News reported this week that the University of Notre Dame will begin its fall semester on campus on August 10. The modified fall semester will skip the university’s traditional fall break and conclude before Thanksgiving. Stay tuned to Breitbart News for more campus updates.

A new poll from CNBC of 5,408 likely voters in Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin—key swing states in the 2020 election—found a shocking level of fear on the part of Democrats that the U.S. is headed for a second wave of infections before the end of the year. Ninety-nine percent of Democrats say there is at least a 50-50 chance of a second wave. Ninety-four percent say that a second wave will probably or definitely happen. Seventy-one percent of Democrats say the second wave will definitely happen. Just 31 percent of independent voters think the second wave will definitely happen. Another 19 percent fall into the “probably camp,” for a combined 50 percent. Another 28 percent of independents give it a fifty-fifty chance. Only 7 percent of Republicans said a second wave will definitely occur, 14 percent say it probably will occur, and 41 percent saying there’s a 50-50 chance. Thirty-eight percent said a second wave definitely or probably will not happen. The stark partisan divide likely helps explain both Republican support for reopening the economy and Democratic resistance. But the high level of Democratic conviction that another outbreak will happen could become a drag on the economy if Democrats hold back on spending, investing, or prove reluctant to return to work. 

Veteran actor James Woods on Wednesday dubbed New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo “Killer Cuomo” amid intense criticism over the governor’s directive for nursing homes to accept Chinese coronavirus patients discharged from hospitals. Woods began by tweeting a photo of aged school lockers with one of them tagged with the name, “Killer.” “Andrew Cuomo finds his old locker!” Woods quipped. Andrew Cuomo finds his old locker! pic.twitter.com/GzznNShS8L — James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) May 20, 2020  Next, the Casino star shared a New York Post article in which New York Health Commissioner Howard Zucker is revealed to have failed to track nursing home deaths for an entire month after the state reported its first virus death. #KillerCuomo numbers likely to be much higher?  https://t.co/zTwXdRjzTT — James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) May 20, 2020  Woods then shared a photo of a tarp hung off an overpass that reads in large, red letters: “Cuomo killed my mom.” Woods captioned the photo, which has yet to be confirmed as authentic, with the hashtag, “Killer Cuomo.” #KillerCuomo pic.twitter.com/PYvzcoRMNH — James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) May 20, 2020  Cuomo has received blowback for a now-reversed March 25 order on nursing homes, which reads: “No resident [of a nursing home] shall be denied re-admission or admission to the NH [nursing home] solely based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19. NHs are prohibited from requiring a hospitalized resident who is determined medically stable to be tested for COVID-19 prior to admission or readmission.” Over 4,800 people have died in New York nursing homes between March 1 and May 1, per New York state officials. Cuomo faced criticism at a recent briefing for saying that providing masks and gowns to nursing homes is “not our job” because the homes are privately owned. “It was such an insensitive thing to say,” said state Assemblyman Ron Kim, a Queens Democrat who noted that it wasn’t until just this past week that New York and neighboring states announced a plan to combine forces to buy protective gear and medical supplies for nursing homes. “If we had focused on that early on,” he said, “we could have saved a lot of lives.” Cuomo’s administration defended its response to the crisis, saying it has provided more than 10 million pieces of protective equipment to nursing homes and created a database of 95,000 workers who have helped out in hundreds of New York homes. “This was an overwhelming situation for everyone,” said Jim Malatras, who serves on the governor’s COVID-19 task force. “There were deaths and it’s unfortunate. But it doesn’t mean we weren’t aggressive.” One key criticism is that New York took weeks after the first known home care outbreaks to begin publicly reporting the number of deaths in individual homes — and still doesn’t report the number of cases. By the time New York began disclosing the deaths in the middle of last month, the state had several major outbreaks with at least 40 deaths each, most of which were a surprise to the surrounding communities and even some family members.

An NFL player, who is remaining anonymous, has filed a lawsuit alleging that United Airlines allowed him to be sexually assaulted on a flight. The suit, filed by “John Doe 1,” alleges that on Feb. 10 of this year, a woman “sexually harassed, assaulted, abused, and violated” him and the flight attendants did nothing to stop it, TMZ Sports reported. The suit further alleges that the unnamed player was subjected to the behavior through the entire flight from LAX to New Jersey. The woman initially accosted the player over the medical mask he was wearing. Since it was early in the coronavirus scare, she didn’t know why he was wearing the mask on the plane. However, the player also alleges that the woman, who was sitting in a window seat, repeatedly prodded, elbowed, and pushed the him; apparently upset that he was not giving her enough room as he sat in the middle seat. The suit alleges that another player — identified as “John Doe 2” — witnessed the woman’s behavior and even saw her taking pills. The woman, who the two players say appeared under the influence of something, began running her hands across the player’s legs and private areas. When the two alerted the crew, the players say nothing was done about the woman’s behavior for a long period of time. The filing adds that the woman began “grabbing and groping his quads and then stroking her hand across his lap towards the inside of his leg near his genitals.” The players added that they switched seats, and then the woman began inappropriately touching the second player, as well. The flight attendants finally moved the woman to a row by herself, and the players were each given a $150 voucher. Though, now they are suing over the incident alleging that the woman exposed them to possible transmission of the coronavirus, inflicted emotional distress, and caused them concern for other reasons. The attorney involved in the filing insisted, “Those who report assaults should not be ignored, but believed, their claims investigated, and appropriate action taken where warranted.” Follow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston.

Two new drive-in movie theaters are coming to Miami, Florida, this week, as the concept of drive-in theaters has exploded in popularity across the state as more people seek entertainment from the comfort of their vehicles in the wake of the deadly Chinese coronavirus. The first of the two drive-ins in the south Florida city will be on May 22 at the Dezerland theme park in North Miami. The second is set to open up on May 24 in Miami Beach at the parking lot on Collins Avenue and 46th Street, according to a report by Time Out. The drive-in at Dezerland will feature weekly showings of films from Jurassic Park to Sonic the Hedgehog through July 3 with showtimes set for Fridays at 5:00 p.m. Food and beverages will also be available for guests to purchase. Tickets are available online for $30 per vehicle. The drive-in at the Miami Beach parking lot will feature the film Playing With Fire, which will promptly start at 8:00 p.m. on Sunday. Guest are being asked to remain in their vehicles, which includes trips to the restroom. Moreover, the showing is sponsored by the city and is only open to residents. Patrons will have to show proof of residence. There are roughly 300 drive-in theaters operating across the United States today, many of them scattered across Florida. In fact, the Ocala Drive-In was among a handful full of drive-in theaters in the country last month to show newly released major studio films. Aside from independent films, the Ocala Drive-In showed Trolls: World Tour, which made more money for DreamWorks Animation — $100 million in three weeks via video on demand — than the first film made in its entire theatrical run. Pop-up movie theaters are not the only drive-in attraction taking off in Florida. The concept of drive-ins has expanded beyond movie showings. Florida is also set to host what is likely to be the nation’s first-ever drive-in music festival. The festival, called, “The Road Rave” promises “a ​full festival main stage production” headlined by DJ Carnage, who is calling the event “North America’s first-ever drive-in festival of the COVID era.” You can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo, and on Instagram.

China has reportedly launched a Wuhan coronavirus information war across Twitter, more than doubling the number of official government tweets since January including 90,000 posts since April, and recently pushing the conspiracy theory that the virus came from a U.S. government lab. NBC News reports that the Chinese government has launched a massive Twitter information campaign, more than doubling the number of official government tweets since January and in recent days attempting to spread a conspiracy theory that the Wuhan coronavirus came from a U.S. government lab. On May 8, the spokesperson for China’s Foreign Affairs Ministry posted a sweet that has been liked more than 4,000 times which reads: “The #US keeps calling for transparency & investigation. Why not open up Fort Detrick & other bio-labs for international review? Why not invite #WHO & int’l experts to the US to look into #COVI19 source & response?” The military houses and studies infectious diseases at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick, Maryland. The #US keeps calling for transparency & investigation. Why not open up Fort Detrick & other bio-labs for international review? Why not invite #WHO & int'l experts to the US to look into #COVID19 source & response? — Hua Chunying 华春莹 (@SpokespersonCHN) May 8, 2020  Chinese accounts have published more than 90,000 tweets since the beginning of April from 200 diplomatic and state-run media accounts in a massive Wuhan coronavirus information war according to a study of data collected by the Hamilton 2.0 dashboard of the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a tool aggregating accounts connected to the Chinese government. Analysis by Bret Schafer, the digital disinformation fellow at the alliance, based in Washington, D.C., found that Twitter output from China’s official sites has almost doubled since January and the number of diplomatic Twitter accounts has tripled to 135 from 40 accounts at this time las year. Schafer stated that the Chinese accounts “have become more aggressive, more conspiratorial, and the ones who have done that are their most popular accounts and have by far the most engagement.” Schafer said that the Twitter account for the Chinese Embassy in France “has significantly more followers than the embassy in Poland, for example, because the embassy in France has been a driver of the most aggressive content.” The Fort Detrick conspiracy theory has been tweeted more than 30 times from official Chinese diplomatic and state-run media accounts over the past two months according to the Alliance for Securing Democracy. On March 12, Zhao Lijian, the spokesman and deputy director of the Foreign Ministry’s Information Department, who has been one of China’s most prolific officials on Twitter, tweeted: “It might be the US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan.” 2/2 CDC was caught on the spot. When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation! pic.twitter.com/vYNZRFPWo3 — Lijian Zhao 赵立坚 (@zlj517) March 12, 2020  One day later he tweeted that there was “Further evidence that the virus originated in the US,” linking to a post on Global Research, a Canadian blog which argued that the virus could have originated from the U.S. and leaked from Fort Detrick. The blog post has since been taken down but a cached version can be found online. Robert Daly, director of the Kissinger Institute on China and the United States at the Wilson Center, a Washington think tank, commented on China’s conspiracy about Fort Detrick stating: “Obnoxious and childish as this is, it should be noted that such Chinese statements have generally mirrored earlier American statements. Rhetorically, China is counterpunching — not throwing the first blow.” He added: “The primary goal of this rhetoric is to demonstrate to Chinese domestic constituencies that the Communist Party is not lying prostrate before American accusations.” Read more at NBC News here.

Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) told Breitbart News during a press conference on Wednesday that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) wants carveouts for millionaires to “shore up” support for Democrats. Ernst, one of the Senate’s leading government waste hawks, unveiled legislation on Wednesday that would end a carveout for millionaires to obtain a taxpayer-funded unemployment benefit during the coronavirus outbreak. Ernst’s bill, the Returning Inappropriate Cash Handouts (RICH) Act, would block Americans who lost their job but are still earning $1 million or more this year from receiving the $600 weekly unemployment bonus for the newly expanded unemployment coverage under the CARES Act. Ernst’s office noted that the legislation could save the bill as much as $2 million every week. Ernst said during the press conference that millionaires continue to benefit while essential workers put their lives at risk. “Folks, think about it. We have essential workers, many of them working long hours on the frontlines of the pandemic and putting their lives at risk, having their tax dollars taken out of their wallets and put into the pockets of millionaires who aren’t working,” Ernst said. “The question of the day: isn’t that just rich?” “With our nation facing a record-breaking budget deficit of 4 trillion dollars, we cannot afford to be subsidizing the lifestyles of coastal elite millionaires,” she added. Breitbart News asked Ernst why she thought Pelosi would create this carveout for millionaires. Pelosi also eliminated the limitations on the federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT), which Republicans lowered through the Trump Tax and Jobs Act. The SALT deduction primarily benefits wealthy, mostly Democrat, and coastal states such as New York, New Jersey, and California. Ernst said that these carveouts primarily benefit the Democrat donor class. She told Breitbart News, “I mean, where is Nancy Pelosi from? She is one of those wealthy, coastal elites. To shore up their support for Democrats certainly, they want to include these carveouts, and allowing millionaires to take the extra $600 a week that is coming from people, from hardworking Americans and Iowans, is absolutely ludicrous. That’s not something that they paid into through payroll taxes; it’s just government funds that are going to these out-of-work millionaires.”  “They also did do away with the SALT provision that has been enacted through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which gives those coastal elites greater advantage as well,” Ernst added. “So you would have to ask Nancy Pelosi why she and the other Democrats are providing these special breaks for wealthy millionaires when they claim to be for the hardworking middle class.” Sean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) is pressing a resolution “condemning all forms of anti-Asian sentiment as related to COVID–19,” including the phrase “Wuhan Virus.” The former presidential candidate recently introduced S.Res. 580, a resolution calling on public officials to “condemn and denounce anti-Asian sentiment, racism, discrimination, and religious intolerance related to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019), and to call on federal law enforcement officials, working with state and local officials, to take specified steps.” According to the resolution’s summary, federal officials should “expeditiously investigate and document all credible reports of hate crimes and incidents and threats against the Asian-American and Pacific Islander community, and investigate and prosecute perpetrators.” The measure also “recommits” the U.S. to its role in building inclusive, tolerant societies by “prioritizing language access and inclusivity in communication practices.” The resolution particularly takes aim at the descriptors like the “Chinese Virus,” “Wuhan Virus,” and “Kung-flu,” contending that they constitute “anti-Asian terminology.” Harris, along with Sens. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), and Mazie Hirono (D-HI) last month detailed their intention to introduce the resolution, with Duckworth accusing President Trump of conducting “inappropriate and racist efforts to ‘rebrand’ this disease.” “Inflammatory and racist rhetoric from officials at the highest level of our government has contributed to a disturbing rise in hate-crimes targeting Asian Americans,” Hirono claimed, failing to mention that the descriptors have been used several times by establishment media outlets. “Calling COVID-19 the ‘Wuhan virus’, ‘Kung flu’, or ‘Chinese virus’ isn’t clever or funny, it’s wrong and deeply harmful,” she added. Despite their concerns, the virus did, indeed, originate in Wuhan, China, and U.S. officials say that China hid the severity of the virus. The U.S. subsequently halted funding to the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) last month for “mismanaging and covering up” the severity of the threat alongside China. “They’re a puppet of China, they’re China-centric to put it nicer,” Trump said on Tuesday. “They gave us a lot of bad advice.” Trump has since sent a letter to W.H.O. Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, warning that he will reconsider the U.S. membership unless the organization takes drastic steps and “actually demonstrate independence from China”: This is the letter sent to Dr. Tedros of the World Health Organization. It is self-explanatory! pic.twitter.com/pF2kzPUpDv — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 19, 2020  While Harris focuses on condemning phrases like the “Wuhan Virus,” GOP lawmakers are moving to hold China accountable. Sens. Martha McSally (R-AZ) and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) are promoting the Stop China-Originated Viral Infectious Diseases Act (Stop COVID Act) “to ensure the Chinese Communist Party faces consequences for its role in spreading the coronavirus.” “The Stop COVID Act will empower Americans to sue China in U.S. court and seek compensation for the devastating harm the deadly virus has caused to the economy and human life,” a release states. Rep. Lance Gooden (TX-R) is leading the companion legislation in the House. “Right now, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is a shield for the Chinese Communist Party to hide behind. We need to change that,” Gooden said in a statement. “The leadership of Senators Blackburn and McSally will be invaluable in our effort to do just that.”

Colorado State has offered $1,500 Chinese virus aid checks to hundreds of illegal alien students that are currently enrolled at the university. The university claims that it elected to help its illegal student population during the ongoing Wuhan coronavirus pandemic because they are not eligible for federal aid. According to a report by the College Fix, Colorado State University is giving out $1,500 coronavirus aid checks to hundreds of undocumented students. The university created an aid program for illegal students in May after realizing that they would not be eligible for relief under the CARES Act, a coronavirus aid program passed by Congress in March. Colorado State University spokesman Mike Hooker said that the $1,500 checks were awarded based on individual student needs. The recipients included both illegal alien and international students. “These populations include our international and undocumented students, as well as students who, for a variety of reasons, no longer qualify for federal student aid,” Hooker said in an email. “As part of that overall support, the university has provided varying levels of aid outside of CARES funds to about 400 such students, including 218 undocumented Coloradans who qualify for in-state tuition via the ASSET bill who each received $1,500. The university awarded those grants in the same manner that we awarded CARES Act funding, based on an assessment of student need.” Colorado State University is not the only institution in Colorado that is raising money for illegal alien students. The Metropolitan State University of Denver is raising $300,000 to benefit its “Dreamer” student population. Illegal students will receive $80,000 in total grants from the university at the conclusion of the fundraising campaign. Breitbart News reported in May 2019 that the University of Minnesota was offering a scholarship specifically for illegal alien students. The scholarship program runs parallel to the state government’s Minnesota Dream Act, which was designed to help undocumented students get into college. Stay tuned to Breitbart News for more updates on this story.

The iconic Yankee Stadium in the Bronx borough of New York is being turned into a drive-in concert venue and movie theater this summer, in the wake of the deadly Chinese coronavirus pandemic. Time Out reports that Uptown Drive-In — a festival that features movies, music, and car side dinner service — will host events in the parking lot of Yankee Stadium on weekends throughout the summer. Local New York City musicians are expected to entertain revelers. Food from local vendors and games are also expected. The festival is being run by MASC Hospitality Group, which hosts the Bronx Night Market and the Bronx Beer Festival. “Since we were planning on having the Bronx Night Market, the Bronx Beer Festival and Uptown Epicure Festival running this summer, which was supposed to start in May, we already had a lot of great options available,” said MASC Hospitality Group’s Marco Shalma to Time Out. “Everyone is so excited about the possibility of connecting sooner [at this new experience] than initially planned.” Events will be live, with the audio broadcasted to attendees’s cars. There will also be brunch events on Saturdays and Sundays. No dates are available yet as New York state is in the process of slowly reopening businesses, parks, and other venues forced shut by lockdown orders. Those looking to attend the festival events can visit the Uptown Drive-In website to get on its waiting list. Drive-in events are becoming more popular during the era of the coronavirus pandemic, as people seek out entertainment that they can safely enjoy from the comfort of their own vehicles. And if there’s a market, there’s a way.

A woman in Malaysia born without arms has been using her feet to sew personal protective equipment (PPE) to help frontline workers battling the coronavirus pandemic.  “Many people have been asking to see how I use a sewing machine, so I’ll show you my own method when sewing with my feet,” Norfarrah Syahirah Shaari wrote in a video posted to her Facebook page. Shaari uses her toes to fold the fabric and hold the sewing machine so it stitches together the pieces of fabric. She makes the material as part of a volunteer program being held at Teluk Intan Community College, the Malay Mail reported. Shaari said she felt “really motivated” to help support our frontliners. According to data collected by Johns Hopkins University, there are more than 7,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Malaysia and 114 deaths as of Wednesday.

The new coronavirus outbreak in northeastern China, originally dismissed as a minor spate of mostly foreign infections that should not distract from China’s total victory over the Wuhan virus, has grown until 108 million people are under lockdown in the region, according to Bloomberg. The Hill noted that draconian measures have been imposed and heads have rolled, even though the affected province, Jilin, supposedly only has about three dozen coronavirus cases and one death: Government officials throughout the province have stopped buses and trains from going in and out of the region, and schools have been shut down. Tens of thousands of people are also being quarantined, according to Bloomberg News.  On Monday, government officials from Shulan, a city in the province, said it would impose its strictest restrictions yet to try to contain the outbreak, including closing off residential compounds with confirmed and suspected cases. Officials would also allow only one person from each family to leave to buy essential supplies for two hours every two days, according to Bloomberg.  The highest-ranking Communist Party official in Shulan was removed along with five other government officials as a result of the new outbreak.  The Epoch Times quoted Jilin residents who said the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is once again undercounting coronavirus victims to make itself look better and the true number of cases includes an alarming number of doctors and medical staffers.  Several of these correspondents said they personally knew coronavirus patients who have not been counted in official government reports. One spoke of seeing “a fleet of more than ten vehicles” rolling through his neighborhood and dropping off “dozens of people dressed in protective suits” who herded crowds of residents into quarantine centers. Qiu Haibo, a doctor who belongs to China’s National Health Commission team of coronavirus experts, said on Tuesday that the epidemic in Jilin and neighboring Heilongjiang provinces is behaving differently than the Wuhan strain of the coronavirus did. Qiu said the virus has a longer incubation period in the new outbreak, which “causes a problem, as they don’t have any symptoms, so when they gather with their families they don’t care about this issue and we see family cluster infections.” According to Qiu, the northeastern patients also remain infected for longer, take longer to recover, and are less likely to run a fever, which has long been seen as one of the most obvious signs of infection. He saw these differences as evidence the new outbreak was imported from beyond China’s borders, and while he did not speculate on its origin, other Chinese officials have pointed to Russia, which has a huge coronavirus outbreak and borders on Jilin and Heilongjiang.

On Wednesday’s broadcast of SiriusXM’s “Dean Obeidallah Show,” Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) said Republicans and President Donald Trump’s opposition to mail-in voting was an attempt to stop “people of color from participating in the upcoming 2020 general election. Obeidallah asked, “Mail-in ballots — you use this in Oregon. You have people on the right saying, ‘Oh, it is wrought with fraud.’ Tell us how has it been in your state?” Merkley said, “It is incredible we have been doing it since the year 2000.” He continued, “We have had essentially no scandals.” He added, “It stops so many forms of voter suppression and voter intimidation. The Republicans are trying to stop poor people from voting, they’re trying to stop college students from voting, people of color from voting, Indian tribes from voting. So many different ways you can attempt to make it hard. Well, this says you know what, you can’t use all those tricks. You can’t understaff it. You can’t create a four-hour wait in line. You can’t move the polling place at the last second and get with away that. That’s why I’m really pushing for a guaranteed mail-in ballot, no excuses this November across the country.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

The latest polling shows by a wide margin of 58 to 35 percent that people are fine with the reopening of their particular state. Oh, and this particular poll comes from a Democrat pollster, the Global Strategy Group. When asked if their particular state is “moving too quickly to reopen,” “getting the timing about right,” or “not moving quickly enough,” only 35 percent said their state is moving too quickly, while 41 percent said about right, and 17 percent said too slow — which means a total of 58 percent want things reopened. In states where the respondents said their state is “more open than closed,” 47 percent said the reopening is happening too quickly, but a plurality of 49 percent side with opening. They said the timing is either about right (37 percent) or too slow (12 percent). In states that are “more closed than open,” 65 percent take the side of reopening, with 45 percent saying the reopening timing is about right and 21 percent saying it’s too slow. Only 28 percent said things are happening too quickly. This a quite a failure for a fake news media that’s been relentlessly peddling fear porn and lies, especially about Texas, Florida, and Georgia — three states with Republican governors who pretty much did the exact opposite of what media darling Gov. Andrew (D-NY) did and ended up with staggeringly better results as far as coronavirus infections, death rates, and hospitalizations (see here). This is not an outlier poll that’s skewed in some way. By a margin of 40 to 56 percent, those polled said they disapprove of the job Trump’s doing handling the coronavirus pandemic, and that by a margin of 58 to 27 percent, Dr. Anthony Fauci is trusted more than Trump on the issue of reopening. So this is not an oversample of Trump supporters, by any stretch. In fact, the poll seems biased against Trump and still we have these margins in favor of reopening. In other words, to have only 35 percent of a survey sample like this one say their state is reopening too quickly when the entire Democrat Party and their billion-dollar media complex are dedicated almost exclusively to using lies and propaganda to terrify and bully people into staying under lockdown… Well, that’s pretty amazing. Also of note… By a margin of 74 to 28 percent, those polled strongly (31 percent) or somewhat (41 percent) agree with what the pollster describes as a right-wing talking point: When this began, the so-called experts said we needed to ‘flatten the curve,’ but now that we are there, these same people are saying we need to keep the country closed until we find a cure. But that could be years away and we can’t keep the country closed forever or it will ruin people’s lives and the economy. By a margin of 63 to 38 percent, those polled strongly (38 percent) or somewhat (35 percent) agree that: America has always been a country defined by individual liberty and freedom and that can never change. We cannot ask people across the country to be on lockdown forever and sacrifice their basic freedoms and our way of life. We need to reopen our communities and trust that people will act responsibly to protect themselves. Some Democrat talking points about safety over the economy and expanded testing, polled better. But no one disagrees with that. The disagreement is over the necessity of lockdowns when there is no vaccine for the coronavirus, when there is no longer any risk of crashing the health care system — which means there is no reason to remain locked down. Simply put, it will be no safer to open up in a day, a week, or a month than it would be to open today. Continued lockdowns make no scientific sense whatsoever. But they surely make political sense if you’re a Democrat governor (or fake journalist) who wants to trash Trump’s economy and re-election chances. Nevertheless, according to this Democrat pollster, a sizable majority of the country agree with Trump that it’s time to reopen. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.

If the National Football League plays an entire season without fans in the stands, it would cost the league a staggering amount of money. According to Mike Ozanian of Forbes, a season without spectators would cost the league $5.5 billion. That figure comes from compiling the league’s projected losses in ticket sales, concessions, parking, and merchandise. Ozanian does a team-by-team breakdown of how the loss of fans would impact each organization. Squads like the Cowboys and Patriots, who have higher attendance and do better with merchandising, would take a greater hit. While teams like the Bills and Bengals would see a smaller impact. The merchandising, concessions, merchandising, and parking, factors represent 38% of the league’s total revenue according to 2018 figures. As Pro Football Talk reports: It’s unclear whether and to what extent games will be played without fans. It’s possible that some states will allow stadiums to be open, and that others won’t. It’s also possible that medical advances in the coming weeks and months (such as a greater understanding of what it means to test positive for coronavirus antibodies) will make it easier to open stadiums and invite fans at low or no risk for developing COVID-19. Any money lost in 2020 will potentially affect the 2021 salary cap. As recently explained, however, the league and the union set the annual spending limit via negotiation, and it’s possible that the two sides will agree to, for example, borrow against future salary caps in order to keep the 2021 cap at or near where it otherwise would have been. Falcons Owner Arthur Blank has recently speculated that the league season could begin without fans. While Panthers Owner Dave Tepper has held open the possibility of limited fan attendance with social distancing protocols enforced. However, in the final analysis, September is still a long way away and a lot will happen with the virus between now and then. Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn

Mexican officials revealed that more than 11,300 health care staffers across the nation contracted Coronavirus (COVID-19) since the pandemic arrived. The country has more than 54,000 cases, suggesting a discrepancy in official totals or that 1 in 5 are health care professionals. During the daily news conference, Mexico’s Epidemiology Director Jose Luis Alomia revealed the total number of health care workers who contracted the disease is 11,394. Alomia also said there are another 8,275 undergoing testing.

Chinese Communist Party (CCP) media celebrated this week’s World Health Assembly (WHA) meeting as a big win for China, projecting confidence the CCP has stymied the global movement to investigate the origins of the Wuhan coronavirus and retains commanding influence in the World Health Organization (W.H.O.).  State media claimed China’s nemeses – including the United States, Australia, and Taiwan – were the “largest losers” at the WHA. The CCP’s Global Times trumpeted that the “three losers” of the U.S., Australia, and Taiwan “failed to besiege” China at the WHA with a “malicious political attempt” to investigate how China handled the coronavirus.  The Global Times claimed the Chinese political narrative of the coronavirus is now utterly dominant at the W.H.O., while China’s critics have been “isolated or abandoned by the global community for continuing to politicize the pandemic.”  The editorial repeated this talking point with manic frenzy and celebrated China’s loathsome achievement in blocking the return of Taiwan, the world’s best coronavirus fighters, to the W.H.O. as a supreme political power play by Beijing: Besides furious attacks, the US government has been trying to bring the matter of Taiwan into the WHA to provoke the Chinese mainland, which, however, was doomed to fail no matter how hard some US lawmakers and officials like US State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus tried to support the island and challenge the universally accepted one-China principle. Compared to previous years, Ms Keva Bain from the Bahamas, president of this year’s WHA, was more “decisive and clear” about not discussing Taiwan-related proposals, experts said.  An insider familiar with this year’s WHA said that so far, more than 160 countries have reiterated their support to the one-China principle and more than 50 countries sent letters to WHO General-Director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to oppose the Taiwan-related proposal. Chinese mainland analysts said that the separatist DPP in Taiwan thought that it has found the “big brother” – the Trump administration – and it has paid a huge amount of money to flatter the US. But the “big brother” is not as reliable as they have thought, since all efforts they paid to challenge the one-China principle in the WHA failed, as always. The Global Times also thought Australia suffered a huge defeat at the WHA because China hijacked its push for a coronavirus investigation, gleefully repeating a racist smear of Australians that has become very popular among the Communist elite: “This is a totally different thing from the so-called independent inquiry pushed by the Australian side,” Zhao Lijian, spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, told a routine press conference on Tuesday on the resolution approved by the international community. Along with other countries, China has been actively taking part in the negotiations on this resolution, which clearly recognizes and supports the leadership of the WHO amid the pandemic, he noted. Some Chinese netizens also mocked Australia’s attempts as it has been trying to become a “martyr” for defending so-called independence and transparency while its ideas were denounced by the global community. By following the steps of some US hawks who harshly attack China over coronavirus, “it seems that Australia, this giant kangaroo that serves as a dog of the US, will hit a deadlock with China on trade disputes in sectors like coal and beef. Hopefully, the US will compensate it!” one netizen said in a Weibo post on Tuesday.   Another Global Times editorial portrayed the WHA as a “slap” against American “hooliganism”: The COVID-19 death toll in the US had exceeded 90,000 by Tuesday morning (Beijing time). The Trump administration does not have even a little bit of self-reflection. Passing the buck to China and the WHO has been their only strategy. Most of the American people who died of COVID-19 were poor people who did not have a say. The US administration’s only purpose is to continue in power. To this end, they adopted dirty tricks, including misleading public opinion. They do not care how many more people will die. But manipulating the international community is not as easy as Washington thought. Washington wants to bring Taiwan into the WHA, but this issue was not even included in the agenda. Under the US’ instigation, Australia promoted an independent inquiry of China’s handling of COVID-19. But when the assembly started, the draft resolution was about the WHO-led tracing of the origin of the virus, and did not specifically target any country. The final resolution will certainly be far from what the US expects. It is obvious to the world that the US has one of the worst performances in the COVID-19 fight, and it has the worst attitude. The WHO so far is only an advisory organization on global public health, and every sovereign country should be responsible for its own public health security. The US blames its own failure in the COVID-19 fight on another country and on the WHO, and the world had never seen such a scene. This is pure international hooliganism. The bad example set by the US, the only superpower in the world, has seriously threatened the global established practices in the 21st century, and has shadowed justice. It is remarkable that the CCP expects media organizations around the world to continue accepting its transparently false data about the epidemic and pretending that America had a worse coronavirus outbreak than China, even as the Chinese threw another hundred million people under lockdown this week, over a month after they claimed the virus had been all but eradicated. It is even more remarkable that their expectation is not unrealistic, given the media’s political tendencies. The Global Times also claimed the outcome of the WHA proved that U.S. President Donald Trump’s “latest threat to permanently pull funding for the W.H.O. and withdraw U.S. membership” have “failed”: Trump tweeted a letter to the WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Monday, in which he harshly criticized the organization’s “dependence” on China in its decision-making process and COVID-19 response. Trump also wrote in the letter that if the WHO “does not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days,” he will make the temporary freeze of US funding to the WHO permanent and reconsider its membership of the organization. On Monday, the WHA kicked off with leaders of WHO members delivering speeches and calling for a joint effort in fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the US-led campaign to push for a political agenda, including seeking Taiwan’s entry to the WHA as an observer and starting an inquiry targeting China, cast a shadow over the WHO’s annual meeting.  After leaders from member countries addressed the ongoing WHA meeting and agreed on joint efforts in fighting the coronavirus pandemic, Chinese President made five proposals including providing $2 billion over two years to help with the COVID-19 response, make a COVID-19 vaccine available to the world, working with G20 members to support the most severely stricken areas and helping regions like Africa, showing that China, the world’s second largest economy, is shouldering its responsibilities in global affairs amid the unprecedented crisis.  In contrast, the lack of US participation in the global fight further indicated the failure of the Trump administration, not only in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic in his own country, but also in working with other countries due to significant flaws in its governance, analysts said.  These squeals of editorial glee from Chinese state media are likely to strengthen President Trump’s resolve to withdraw from the W.H.O., and are so exuberant that they might even convince a few of Trump’s critics that he was correct to halt funding. Beijing certainly seems to think the W.H.O. is precisely the Communist-corrupted, unreformable organization that its critics fear it has become.  Not all of those critics are in the Trump administration. The Australians, for example, are probably getting tired of Chinese Communists insulting them as lap-kangaroo lackeys of the United States, and they will not think well of WHA states that do not object to Beijing’s portrayal of the assembly as a stunning rebuke to Canberra. Other nations will have to decide when they have had enough of Beijing’s political narrative that all criticism of how the CCP handled the Wuhan outbreak is merely a desperate attempt to distract from their own failures. Knowing that the CCP constantly lies about how many infections and deaths the Chinese people suffered should make it especially difficult to swallow constant taunting that everyone else’s pandemic response has been so much worse than China’s.  It is possible that China’s loud declarations of victory at the WHA are a propaganda campaign to spin a defeat or a means of broadcasting to allied and vassal states what Beijing expects them to do when the great coronavirus investigation begins. If WHA member states have any objection to China’s spin on the assembly, and if they have any hope of persuading American taxpayers to continue providing an oversized share of W.H.O. funding, the time to speak out against the CCP is now.

Sen. Mike Braun (R-IN) told Breitbart News during a press conference on Wednesday that Michigan Democrat Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is slowing the reopening of the state for political purposes. Breitbart News asked Braun if he thought any Democrat governors were stalling the reopening of the state for political purposes, to which Braun said that Whitmer, one of former Vice President Joe Biden’s potential running mates, could be keeping the state under lockdown to benefit her party. Braun said, “Good question. I think that one of them might have been a neighbor of ours to the north. And, I think that you’ll have that full accountability once we get this in the rearview mirror for what the right approach was. I’m guessing the UP didn’t like the one-size-fits-all. I think that will be the biggest takeaway when we can dispassionately look at it, that that was a flawed approach from the get-go.” Braun said that one-size-fits-all may have not been the best approach and that the reopening strategy should be focused on the region. He also said that many businesses could have been open by practicing social distancing. “Even in New York, Upstate New York would have been different from New York City and every county … probably should have had an approach tailored to what the experts said needed to be done to make sure you respect the disease,” Braun explained. “Don’t give it any leeway and we could have done two things at once. I cite downtown Jasper. My wife has had a business there for 42 years this September. That idea of essential and nonessential was kind of a bad way to look at it in the first place. It should have been which businesses could have done the main guidelines of six feet of distancing, don’t put any vulnerable individuals in peril, hygiene, and those are still the things we’re working with. You either pay attention to the rules or you’re going to pay the consequences for not doing it because it’s a tricky disease.” He continued, “When we debrief, this one-size-fits-all … that happens often when you have bureaucrats and folks that don’t think more out of the box. I’m just glad we’re getting more to the transitioning to where the economies are opening.” “I can tell you for certain, the federal government is not in any way a replacement for the real-world economy,” Braun added.

Wednesday on MSNBC, network political commentator former Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO) said former President Barack Obama’s administration did not have even “a hint of corruption during eight years.” McCaskill said, “I think what would be the tale of this election will be what is going on in September and October. I think there are going to be three metrics that this president is definitely afraid of, to use an unfortunate phrase. He’s going to be afraid of the unemployment numbers in September and October, and so far, the complicated and byzantine stimulus that’s been put forward has not eased unemployment. And that’s the measure here. Not the stock market. How many people are in bread lines, and how many people don’t have jobs, and how many people have lost health care? That’s the measure. And then how many—what is the daily body count in September and October? How many people are dying every day from this virus in September and October? And how many new cases are showing up every day? There’s no way there will be a vaccine before September or October.” She continued, “So what is the president’s playbook? Looking down that tunnel, his playbook is to go to what worked for him in 2016 and is to lie about his opponent. And what that thing was with the senators —I’ve got to get this in —what that thing was with the senators yesterday, he went to that lunch to tell them to lie for him. You’ve got to lie about Barack Obama and Joe Biden. You’ve got to turn them into something they are not. You got to make them criminals. He wants to get to the point where they’re chanting lock them up at his rallies about Obama and Biden, who have done nothing illegal. Nothing, nothing, not even close! Not a hint of corruption during eight years of Barack Obama. No wholesale firing of inspector generals. So I really think it’s startling that he’s so panicked that he felt the need to go down there to shore up the Republicans, you guys got to get tougher and lie better because that’s essentially what his message was yesterday.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Amazon already ranks as the country’s No. 1 apparel retailer and owns the Whole Foods Market grocery chain. Now the e-commerce empire is reportedly looking to grow even bigger with a possible acquisition of JC Penney — the venerable department store chain that recently declared bankruptcy in the wake of the Chinese virus pandemic. The news comes amid rumors that Amazon is also looking to acquire AMC Theatres, the largest cinema chain in the U.S., to complement its growing studio business. The Chinese-owned AMC has also suffered during the viral outbreak due to the forced closure of all movie theaters around the country. Amazon has sent a team to Plano, Texas, which is where JC Penney is headquartered, according to a report this week from Women’s Wear Daily. An anonymous source told the fashion publication that the two companies are engaging in a dialogue, but no official announcement has been made. “There is an Amazon team in Plano as we speak,” the publication reported. “There is a dialogue and I’m told it has a lot to do with Amazon eager to expand its apparel business.” A possible deal might include some of JC Penney’s physical stores, which could be used by Amazon as distribution outlets. Amazon has expanded its apparel business with such initiatives as Prime Wardrobe which offers free returns on many items. JC Penney filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Friday, saying that the coronavirus pandemic had battered its business. But the department store chain has been struggling for years and was planning to shutter 200 stores in 2020. The company has 846 stores and employs about 85,000 people. Amazon has been steadily growing its empire through key acquisitions. The Seattle-based company acquired Whole Foods in 2017 for $13.7 billion. It snapped up the smart-home tech company Ring for in 2018 for an estimated $1 billion. Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post in 2013 for $250 million.

Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) on Wednesday raged over President Trump’s opposition to states, like Michigan, moving toward vote-by-mail for the general election, accusing him of wanting to “oppress people and suppress the vote” while “endangering people’s lives.” “Nah, President Incompetent. Michigan promotes democracy without jeopardizing people’s health. You would rather oppress people and suppress the vote (per usual),” Tlaib said in reaction to Trump’s Wednesday morning tweet, threatening to punish Michigan for mailing absentee ballot applications to all state voters. “Oh, and endangering people’s lives seems to be your approach to a pandemic. We won’t be following that method,” she added: Nah, President Incompetent.  Michigan promotes democracy without jeopardizing people's health.

We won't be following that method. https://t.co/lFAWhX5uG5 — Rashida Tlaib (@RashidaTlaib) May 20, 2020  Michigan’s Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson announced on Tuesday the state would send ballot applications, specifically, to voters in the state — a decision that prompted reaction from the president: Breaking: Michigan sends absentee ballots to 7.7 million people ahead of Primaries and the General Election. This was done illegally and without authorization by a rogue Secretary of State. I will ask to hold up funding to Michigan if they want to go down this Voter Fraud path!.. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 20, 2020  Benson claimed the move would ensure “that no Michigander has to choose between their health and their right to vote,” praising vote-by-mail as “easy, convenient, safe, and secure.” The news comes as blue states move to implement vote-by-mail for their respective primaries, and ultimately the general election, citing coronavirus related concerns. California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) essentially led the charge, authorizing vote-by-mail for November’s election — a move failed Trump challenger Hillary Clinton praised heavily: I hope other governors around the country follow @GavinNewsom’s lead. No voter should be forced to choose between their safety and exercising their civic duty this fall. https://t.co/kNkSQ5quw8 — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) May 8, 2020  Democrats have been attempting to use the fears surrounding the Chinese coronavirus to implement policy agenda items, like ballot harvesting and vote by mail. Many of them have been pointing to Wisconsin as a point of reference, which charged ahead with holding its in-person April 7 primary during the pandemic. However, the example does not provide compelling evidence to institute vote-by-mail. Out of 413,000 individuals who showed up to the polls April 7, only a few dozen later tested positive for the virus, and some of them indicated other ways that they may have contracted the illness. Even so, the data indicates an infection rate below two-hundredths of one percent.

BRUSSELS (AP) – The European Union signaled Wednesday that it will not punish member countries for breaking the bloc´s deficit rules to tackle the coronavirus but that it could condition their access to sorely-needed recovery funds on them following its advice on how to manage their budgets. The 27-nation bloc is forecast to enter “a recession of historic proportions this year” as the coronavirus ravages its economies, with an average drop in output of 7.5%. Virtually every country has broken the deficit limit of 3% of GDP as they´ve spent to keep health care systems, businesses and jobs alive. “In all cases, apart (from) Bulgaria, we concluded that the deficit criteria of the treaty is not complied with. In normal times, this would lead to the opening of an excessive deficit procedure. But these are exceptional times,” European Commission Executive Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis said. Dombrovskis´ remarks came as he unveiled advice from the EU´s executive arm, the European Commission, on how countries could weather the economic storm while continuing to promote growth and invest in policies that fight climate change and ease the transition to computer-based economies. While the euro single currency rule book may be allowed to gather dust for now, Dombrovskis warned that it “is not suspended” and that countries will have to return to some budgetary rectitude in the medium term. The commission´s “country-specific recommendations” released Wednesday are part of a system under which the executive arm monitors national budgetary plans and gives policy advice. Countries give the advice lip-service but are routinely slow to respond to it. EU President: ‘The Final Word on EU Law is Always Spoken in Luxembourg’ as Coronavirus Cracks Show https://t.co/ovnrcQXB4J — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 11, 2020  This time, however, Dombrovskis said that the recommendations will be “linked” to a massive recovery fund the commission is due to unveil on May 27, and which is expected to be part of the EU´s new long-term budget, totalling well over a trillion euros. He did not provide details about how the recommendations would be linked to the recovery funds. The pandemic has hurt consumer spending, industrial output, investment, trade, capital flows and supply chains. It has also hit jobs. The unemployment rate across the 27-nation EU is forecast to rise from 6.7% in 2019 to 9% in 2020 but then fall to around 8% in 2021. While the virus has hit every member country, the extent of the damage it ultimately inflicts will depend on the evolution of the disease in each of them, the resilience of their economies and what policies they put in place to respond. Hard-hit countries like Italy and Spain will probably be banking on the recovery fund to survive.

The European Union has pledged its support for the World Health Organization (WHO), following President Donald Trump’s threats to permanently defund the United Nations agency over its mishandling of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. A spokeswoman for the European Commission, Virginie Battu-Henriksson, said that global cooperation is “the only effective and viable option to win this battle” against the Wuhan virus. “This is the time for solidarity. It is not the time for finger-pointing or undermining multilateral cooperation,” the EU spokeswoman added in comments reported by AP. The pledge of support for the WHO from the bloc followed a proclamation from German Chancellor Angela Merkel that “the EU must act together, the nation-state has no chance if it acts on its own”. The European Union urged all other nations to back the embattled UN agency after President Trump announced that he would be permanently cutting of American funding for the WHO unless the organisation makes “major substantive improvements within the next 30 days”. In a letter addressed to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, President Trump wrote: “It is clear the repeated missteps by you and your organization in responding to the pandemic have been extremely costly for the world.” “The only way forward for the World Health Organization is if it can actually demonstrate independence from China,” Trump concluded. Nice try, Communist. But Americans aren't dumb enough to fall for your attempts at cheap PR and propaganda. We the People demand a deep-dive investigation into what the Communist Chinese regime knew and when it knew it–followed by full accountability. https://t.co/kG1UYQk2JF — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) May 18, 2020  The World Health Organization has consistently been accused of spouting Chinese communist propaganda since the outset of the pandemic, initially repeating China’s claims that there was no human transmission of the virus in January. The WHO has also kowtowed to the communist regime in Beijing by refusing the entry of Taiwan into the organisation. The move has effectively cut off the independent nation from sharing information about the virus, despite it being believed to have conducted one of the most effective responses to the outbreak. The European Union has been accused of bending the knee to the Chinese Communist Party during the pandemic, as well. A report from last month indicated that the bloc had rewritten a report on disinformation campaigns carried out by state actors during the pandemic, softening it after pressure from communist officials. “The Chinese are already threatening with reactions if the report comes out,” wrote EU diplomat Lutz Güllner in a leaked email. In its final version of the report, the EU removed any reference to the “global disinformation campaign” carried out by the CCP. The European Union denied the accusation that it had altered its report as a result of Chinese pressure. However, one analyst wrote that EU diplomats were “self-censoring to appease the Chinese Communist Party” and that “appeasement will set a terrible precedent and encourage similar coercion in the future”.

The French Council of State has ordered that a ban on public worship be lifted, ruling that it constitutes a “serious and manifestly unlawful attack” on freedom of worship. On May 18, the State Council ruled that the general and absolute ban on all gatherings in churches, temples, synagogues, and mosques, while perhaps acceptable in the first phase of the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, is “disproportionate” during the period of reopening. The government now has a week to relax the ban on public religious ceremonies in places of worship, which has been in force since March 15. In the eyes of France’s highest administrative court, this prohibition interfered unlawfully with religious freedom, one of whose components is the right to participate collectively in religious ceremonies. The Council of State enjoined Prime Minister Edouard Philippe to replace the outright ban with “measures strictly proportionate to health risks” in alignment with those regulated other similar activities. Subject to certain conditions, therefore, religious worship should be able to resume shortly, at least in certain parts of the territory. The French bishops’ conference (CEF) has been pushing unsuccessfully for a relaxation of the ban since May 11, making specific proposals as to how to resume worship while adhering to safety measures common to all. The prime minister rejected these proposals, originally setting the resumption of worship for June 2, then moving it to May 29. In its ruling, therefore, the Council of State has resolved tensions between the French bishops and the government, coming down on the side of the representatives of the Catholic Church. The decision underscored the arbitrariness of the prime minister’s targeted ban on worship, since gatherings of fewer than 10 people have been permitted in other circumstances.

Former Atlanta Braves star Tom Glavine is warning pro baseball players that they could take the blame if there’s no baseball in 2020. Glavine is also speaking from experience because he was a players’ union representative during the baseball strike of 1994-95, so he has some familiarity on the topic, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “If it were to come down to an economic issue and that’s the reason baseball didn’t come back, you’re looking at a situation similar to the strike of ’94 and ’95 as far as fans are concerned,” Glavine told the paper. “Even if players were 100% justified in what they were complaining about, they’re still going to look bad.” Negotiations on plans for a shorted 2020 baseball season are ongoing between the players and the league. But players are already looking askance at the pay cut suggestions. The league has proposed a plan whereby players receive a 50-50 split of the revenues that the league gets during the regular-season and postseason. But some players immediately balked at the proposal. Tampa Bay Rays star pitcher Blake Snell, for instance, said that he was not interested in putting his health at risk to play baseball during the coronavirus era, and take a pay cut to do it. Glavine did note that, like Snell, he understands that players are worried about their health in this coronavirus era. “I understand that a big part for all of us in getting back to our normal is to have sports back,” he exclaimed. “But you can’t dismiss a player’s concern for his health or his family’s health any more than you would dismiss your own concerns.” “If I was playing today, I wouldn’t say, ‘Hell no, I’m not playing.’ But, of course, I’d have a concern that once you step out that door and you go back into that world, there’s a chance you’re bringing something home to your family. It’s 100% fair for players, coaches, everybody to be concerned about that,” Glavine added. For his part, Glavine said he realized that the revenue split was a “scary proposition” to the players union, but these are unusual times. He also felt that players should avoid talking about their pay in the media. “The accessibility thing was a miscalculation on my part,” Glavine told the Journal. “I just felt like if I did an interview on the radio or TV, if I had five or 10 minutes, I could make somebody understand what was going on and come to our side. That just wasn’t going to happen.” Glavine noted that he’s glad he is retired and does not have to go make these decisions. Though, he also said he misses sports. “It’s nice to do what you do all day, eat dinner and then sit down and watch some kind of game. Not having games to watch has been hard. But you know, we’ll get through it,” he lamented. Follow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston.

President Donald Trump on Wednesday proposed hosting the G7 summit of world leaders in the United States in 2020, despite previously canceling the gathering due to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. “Now that our Country is “Transitioning back to Greatness”, I am considering rescheduling the G-7, on the same or similar date, in Washington, D.C., at the legendary Camp David,” Trump wrote on Twitter. The in-person summit scheduled for June at Camp David was canceled in March because of the pandemic. At the time, the White House said the summit would be held by video conference. But Trump is open to revisiting that decision, arguing it would be a great sign of progress in fighting the coronavirus. “The other members are also beginning their COMEBACK,” he wrote. “It would be a great sign to all – normalization!” The G7 membership includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.

Fans who had been starving for live sporting events had their appetites somewhat sated last weekend. Network executives knew the first weekend with multiple live events would draw good numbers but for the most part they exceeded expectations. The Bundesliga’s return drew record numbers on Fox Sports 1, Saturday night’s UFC card on ESPN was one of the top shows on cable television and Sunday’s NASCAR race on Fox was the most-viewed non-Daytona race in three years. “It was fun being able to watch everything and not knowing what was going to happen. The good thing is people can see a little bit of the pieces of the sports world being able to restart,” said NBC’s Mike Tirico, who called Sunday’s TaylorMade Driving Relief exhibition match. ESPN dominated the weekend. According to Nielsen, the network won Sunday night’s cable ratings with the final two episodes of “The Last Dance,” while Saturday’s UFC Fight Night card was the third-most viewed program on cable, averaging 1.20 million. Saturday’s card was the eighth-most viewed UFC telecast on an ESPN network since the network started airing bouts last January. It was also the second-most viewed ESPN Fight Night. The record remains 1.5 million for the first card aired last February. Bundesliga games on Fox Sports 1 posted their best numbers on the network since it began airing the German professional soccer league in 2015. The Bundesliga is the first of Europe’s first-division soccer leagues to resume play. Saturday’s matches averaged 365,000 viewers while Sunday’s games, which featured seven-time champion Bayern Munich, averaged 361,000. Fox Sports Senior Vice President Michael Mulvihill said that is a 725% increase over the last Bundesliga match on FS1 prior to the shutdown. It is also only the second weekend this season that Bundesliga matches were viewed by over 100,000 fans on Fox Sports 1. “What we’ve seen over the last six weeks is that any time a fan has been given the opportunity to show how much they miss live sports, they have. The appetite is extremely strong,” Mulvihill said. Fox’s strong weekend continued with the NASCAR race at Darlington, South Carolina, averaging 6.32 million. It was the most-watched race outside of the Daytona 500 since the March 2017 race in Atlanta.
Having a late afternoon East Coast window and shelter-in-place measures still in place led to audience increases over 100% in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and Philadelphia. NASCAR could continue to see big audiences over the next two weeks. The race Wednesday night at Darlington will be on FS1 and Sunday’s race at Charlotte will be the first big sporting event to take place on its regularly scheduled date in over two months. “We’re optimistic to see what the numbers will be over the next couple weeks. It might be six or more weeks where NASCAR has the stage to itself,” Mulvihill said. What encourages Mulvihill even more is that Fox’s NASCAR ratings are down only 2% from last year. NBC Sports Group said TaylorMade Driving Relief on Sunday averaged 2.35 million viewers across all platforms, which included NBC, Golf Channel and NBCSN as well as the network and PGA Tour’s streaming apps. The network said the broadcast was on par with final-round events on CBS (2.32M) and NBC (2.35M) aired last spring. Tirico said the highlight for him was seeing the golfers in shorts and carrying their own clubs as the team of Rory McIlroy and Dustin Johnson defeated Rickie Fowler and Matthew Wolff. The golf and NASCAR broadcasts also showed what challenges could lie ahead for network crews over the next couple of months. Tirico anchored the golf coverage from his home in Michigan, while Mike Joy and Jeff Gordon called the NASCAR race from Charlotte. NBC had a pair of on-course reporters while Fox had only one pit reporter at Darlington. With announcers spread out over the country, the first hour of broadcasts can be challenging.
“The TV viewer is going to understand delays and glitches. We learned a lot, though, which should help over the next couple months,” Tirico said.

ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — The Los Angeles Angels will implement furloughs across their organization starting June 1, becoming the latest team to take steps against the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Angels spokesperson Marie Garvey issued a statement on the decision Tuesday. “We, like businesses throughout the United States, are making difficult decisions to protect our long-term stability,” Garvey said. “We are assisting all staff by paying health care through the end of the year. We are also contributing $1 Million to an Angels Employee Assistance Fund to provide grants for those in need.” The Angels’ furloughs will impact employees across the front office, scouting department, player development department and minor league system. They had already pledged to pay their employees through May. The $1 million employee assistance fund is separate from the $1.2 million already put up by the team to pay Angel Stadium’s roughly 1,800 workers. The furloughed employees will keep their medical benefits for the rest of the year or until Oct. 31, depending on their contracts. The Tampa Bay Rays have already implemented furloughs, while the Miami Marlins and the Cincinnati Reds also plan furloughs, including some baseball operations employees. Other teams have cut employees’ salaries, and more announcements of furloughs are expected as the lack of game revenue widely impacts the sport.

The NHL is still more than a week away from determining a return-to-play format, a person familiar with discussions told The Associated Press on Tuesday. And what that plan resembles could be complicated further should the U.S. and Canada extend border restrictions to non-essential travel into July, the person said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the discussions are private. The person spoke after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced border restrictions will stay in effect through June 21. This marks the second time the restrictions have been extended since first being put into place March 18 because of the new coronavirus pandemic. “I am hopeful that today’s announcement will not have a material impact on our return to play discussions and timeline,” NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly wrote in an email. Though the NHL has left open the possibility of having training camps open as late as early August, it was unclear what effect further border restrictions will have on a league with seven of its 31 teams based in Canada. There’s also a question of how travel restrictions will affect players, many of whom have returned to their offseason homes — including about 17% of players currently self-isolating overseas. In a separate development, the NHLPA’s executive board voted to defer the final payment of players’ regular season salaries through the end of May. Players were owed their final checks on April 15, before voting to defer those payments for a month. The decision provides temporary relief to the NHL’s bottom line, opening the possibility of players foregoing some or the entire remainder of their final checks. The players stand to lose all or a portion of what they are owed under the collective bargaining agreement. Players and owners split hockey-related revenue on a 50-50 basis, with a percentage of players’ salaries placed in an escrow fund. Owners can draw from the fund should their share fall below 50%, which is projected to happen this season. Owners considered the players previous decision to defer payment as a sign of good faith. Daly declined to comment on the latest deferment, saying it’s a decision left entirely to players. The NHL paused its season on March 12, with Commissioner Gary Bettman adamant the league intends to award the Stanley Cup, even it means extending the playoffs into September. The decision on when and how to resume the season is being left with a committee made up of representatives of the NHL and NHL Players’ Association. The topics of discussion include whether it’s feasible to conclude all or a portion of the regular season or go directly into the playoffs. The season was postponed with 189 games remaining and teams having played an uneven number of games. Among the options discussed are an expanded playoff format, featuring as many as 24 teams, and the likelihood of having groups of teams gather and play games in a select number of hub cities around the continent and without fans present. There is no set deadline as to when play must resume before the NHL considers canceling the season. Games could feasibly be played into October with the 2020-21 season potential opening in December or January. New Jersey Devils defenseman Connor Carrick said both sides are attempting to make the best of a difficult situation. “It’s going to be an interesting solution, and I think you embrace the novelty with it,” Carrick said. One concern is how a potential nine-month layoff would affect players on non-playoff teams. On Monday, veteran Devils goaltender Cory Schneider said a growing number of players are concerned the NHL will announce a “drop-dead” deadline for returning to play. “I think that’s everyone’s concern right now,” said Schneider, the team’s union representative. “It’s a lot of guys asking is there a drop-dead date? What’s the date that it’s just too late, that you can get a semblance of a season or a playoff.”

President Donald Trump on Wednesday blasted an unnamed official from the Communist government in China for comments on the coronavirus pandemic. “Some wacko in China just released a statement blaming everybody other than China for the Virus which has now killed hundreds of thousands of people,” Trump wrote on Twitter on Wednesday morning. It is unclear who the president was referring to, but he has repeatedly challenged Chinese Communist Party officials for trying to shift blame for the pandemic that started in Wuhan to other countries. The Chinese government continues arguing they did nothing wrong in handling the virus, which spread worldwide. “Please explain to this dope that it was the ‘incompetence of China,’ and nothing else, that did this mass Worldwide killing!” Trump wrote. Some wacko in China just released a statement blaming everybody other than China for the Virus which has now killed hundreds of thousands of people. Please explain to this dope that it was the “incompetence of China”, and nothing else, that did this mass Worldwide killing! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 20, 2020  The president on Tuesday repeated his question about why China failed to stop the virus from spreading to the world. “Now, with all of that being said, to lose lives over this that could’ve been stopped by China, it should’ve been stopped by China,” Trump said after meeting with Senate Republicans. “It’s terrible that a thing like this could’ve happened to the world.”

Chinese Communist Party (CCP) police in Shanghai arrested Zhang Zhan, a citizen journalist and former lawyer, after criticizing the regime’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported on Monday. The arrest occurred last week and resulted in charges of “picking quarrels and provoking trouble,” a “crime” the CCP regularly uses to jail political dissidents. Authorities notified Zhang’s family of her arrest on May 15, who then shared the news with her friends. Before then, Zhang’s friends said they had been unable to contact her since May 14. She is currently still in police custody. Though from Shanghai, Zhang had been reporting on the coronavirus outbreak in the city of Wuhan – where the Wuhan coronavirus was first documented late last year – since February 1, according to the SCMP. Until May 13, the citizen journalist had been regularly posting commentary videos to social media, including platforms officially banned in China like Twitter and YouTube. In some of her commentary, Zhang has been critical of CCP authorities’ response to the coronavirus outbreak.  On February 16, Zhang scrutinized the government’s handling of the ongoing Wuhan coronavirus pandemic in a letter posted online. Her analysis was critical, accusing the CCP of sacrificing citizens’ human rights in its extreme efforts to contain the Wuhan coronavirus or, in her opinion, to appear to: The government isolates individuals from the outside world in the name of treatment. In the name of maintaining stability, the number of infections and deaths is covered up. The media is kept under control in the name of ‘positive energy.’ [The authorities] are coercively and violently ordering and depriving people of their basic human and property rights. According to the report, Zhang was previously arrested by authorities in September 2019 after participating in a Shanghai demonstration supporting the ongoing pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong. The CCP authorities charged her with “disturbing the public order” after she marched through Shanghai’s Peoples Square while brandishing an umbrella that read, “End socialism, Communist Party down.” Zhang was jailed for over 60 days. On May 11, another Shanghai political dissident was released by authorities following his arrest on May 10. Zhang Xuezhong was “taken away” by Shanghai police last Sunday after he posted a letter that also criticized CCP authorities’ response to the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic. His letter was framed in the context of a need for free speech, inherently stifled by the CCP’s political system, he argued. Zhang Xuezhong, like Zhang Zhan, was also a lawyer. He has defended human rights activists in China and also teaches constitutional law as a professor. “I saw so many friends expressing concern for my current situation. Thank you very much. I am now at home and all is well. Good night everyone. I need to get some sleep first, apologies for not being able to reply to your messages,” Zhang wrote on social media Monday.

Pakistan’s Supreme Court ordered the government to lift remaining coronavirus lockdown restrictions on Monday so businesses could fully reopen. The top court, whose decision is binding, argued Pakistan was “swallowing so much money” with a shuttered economy and claimed it was no longer worth staying locked down when there “apparently is not a pandemic in Pakistan,” Reuters reports. Government authorities cited economic strain as the main reason for reopening larger businesses, such as shopping malls, this week. The decision comes amid a surge in Chinese coronavirus cases across the country, despite the court’s declaration that there was “not a pandemic in Pakistan.” The court ordered shopping malls to reopen at the discretion of national health authorities. The decision also calls for restrictions on businesses “opening on the weekends” to be lifted, a mandate which coincides with the end of Ramadan, a month-long Islamic holiday, this weekend. Traditionally, the end of dawn-to-dusk fasting and prayer, known as Eid al-Fitr, sees crowds flooding shopping malls to gather and shop in celebration. Pakistan’s railway announced it will resume train services at limited capacity starting May 20. The announcement, which came on the same day as the court order to reopen malls, seems to have been made to accommodate increased travel during the holiday weekend, which is also typical. According to the report, both the “transport and retail shopping” sectors in Pakistan expect to draw “massive crowds” this holiday weekend. Last week, Pakistan announced an easing of lockdown restrictions, allowing some retail markets to reopen. Upon last week’s partial reopening, shopping markets were “packed” with customers, most of whom ignored physical distancing and face mask mandates still in place to curb coronavirus transmission, according to the report. The court cited the reopening of small retail markets last week as part of its reasoning for opening larger shopping malls this week, arguing that if markets were open there was no longer any “justifiable rational or reasonable” basis for keeping malls shut. “We find no reason why so much money is being spent on this [Chinese] coronavirus, for that, Pakistan is not the country which is seriously affected by it,” the court order said, according to the report. On Tuesday, mosques across Pakistan reopened for “five-time [a day] congregational prayers” in an unofficial move orchestrated by Pakistan’s top Imams, or Islamic religious authorities, who wield an excessive amount of power in Pakistan. “We hope for cooperation from the government. The government should also announce lifting the ban on congregational prayers,” Mufti Usmani, the representative for Pakistan’s Islamic clerics, said in a statement released Tuesday. Previously, Pakistan’s prime minister, Imran Khan, had allowed the Imams to pressure him into easing some restrictions on gatherings at mosques while the country was still under stricter lockdown. At press time, Pakistan had reported 43,966 infections and 939 deaths from the Chinese coronavirus, although the number of cases and deaths is believed to be much higher. Pakistani health authorities cite the nation’s deficient testing practices, due to a lack of medical supplies and a reluctance on the part of the government, as the main reasons for the underreported coronavirus cases.

Things we could never have predicted last year: that in 2020 basket case economies where diarrhoea is a way of life would provide a better example of governance than many Western nations. Consider the latest news from Pakistan. Pakistan’s Supreme Court has ordered the government to lift what is left of the country’s lockdown. The court has ordered shopping malls to reopen and questioned why a virus which ‘apparently is not a pandemic in Pakistan’ should be ‘swallowing so much money.’ According to Reuters: “We find no reason why so much money is being spent on this Coronavirus (COVID-19), for that, Pakistan is not the country which is seriously affected by it,” the court order said. Even before the Supreme Court ruling, Pakistan had already decided to relax its lockdown. “We’re deciding that we are ending this lockdown now,” Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan said in a national TV address. “We know that we’re doing it at a time when our [coronavirus] curve is going up … but it is not edging up as we were expecting.” Note that key detail:  ‘it is not edging up as we were expecting.’ Like UK  Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Pakistani’s Prime Minister Imran Khan was educated at Oxford University (Keble; PPE). Unlike Boris Johnson, however, Khan is clearly agile enough to be able to adjust government policy as the evidence changes. Because Pakistan’s coronavirus experience has not been nearly as bad as doom-mongers predicted — 42,125 COVID-19 cases and 903 deaths in a country with a population of 212 million — Khan has taken a calculated risk. The lockdown, he has decided, is more dangerous than the coronavirus. As he said earlier this month: “Since we started this lockdown, we had this fear that these people who are daily wagers, who feed their kids on daily earnings, what will happen to them?” Khan asked, implying that Pakistan’s poor need the lockdown lifted to survive. From Britain, on the other hand, there is no evidence of such agile thinking from Boris Johnson’s timid, incompetent government. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has warned that Britain is facing a ‘severe recession the likes of which we haven’t seen.’ Again: no shit Sunak! Given that this impending recession is largely the result not of coronavirus but rather of the extended lockdown (and absurdly overgenerous furlough payments), you’d think it might occur to Sunak and his fellow members of the quadrumvirate now governing Britain (Boris, Gove, Raab, Sunak) that there was an easy solution just staring them in the face. End the lockdown now! But apparently it has been lost on all four of those Oxbridge brains — with lockdown restrictions set to continue well into the summer and a bizarre decision to trash what’s left of Britain’s tourist, travel and hospitality industry by insisting that people arriving in Britain from abroad must undergo a two-week quarantine. They say Islamabad is lovely at this time of year. It offers a lot more freedom than you’d get in London, at any rate.

Decorated cloth face coverings inspired by the coronavirus pandemic could become an “essential” fashion accessory, with major British online retailers already selling animal and skeleton print masks. Britain’s adaptation to life under lockdown has taken a runway turn for the weird, with clothing retailers seeking to corner the market in fashionable face coverings. While scientists continue to debate the efficacy of home-made cotton masks in reducing the spread of coronavirus, and whether their introduction could speed up the end of lockdown, UK clothing outlet Boohoo is selling fashionable face coverings for men and women.  Boohoo reminds shoppers that “this mask is for accessory purposes only and should not be used as personal protection equipment”, but adds in the product description that you can “add attitude with accessories for those fashion-forward finishing touches. It’s all about accessories for injecting individuality into your look.”  Asos is also selling lavender bandana masks and tiger and leopard print face coverings for women.  Dana Thomas, author of Fashionopolis: The Price of Fast Fashion and the Future of Clothes, said that masks are “going to become fashion items”, adding: “We’ll wear them like sunglasses, or T-shirts, or even handbags, and we’ll choose them to make statements.” Speaking to the i newspaper on Tuesday, retail influencer Andrew Busby said that even if the item becomes a fashion accessory “essential”, consumers should be under no illusion that these face coverings are “useless” at stopping the spread of the Chinese coronavirus. “Many, if not most, fashion masks are next to useless as they don’t prevent the spread of droplets when we cough because of the nature of the material,” Mr Busby said. Italian designer Tiziana Scaramuzzo created the ‘trikini’, a bikini with a matching mask, as a joke, but then after posting images of the outfit on social media found herself inundated with orders, according to the BBC.     Elexia  A post shared by  Elexia Beachwear (@elexia_beachwear) on May 17, 2020 at 1:07pm PDT Fashion masks useless at preventing the spread of the Chinese virus is just the latest unusual expression of Europe trying to come to terms with the lockdown.

A string of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) took aim at the United Nations on Wednesday, asking why it has been missing in action as the Chinese coronavirus disaster unfolded. They pointed to universally ignored U.N. Security Council calls for a global ceasefire as evidence of the globalist body’s spectacular irrelevance during the biggest public health crisis in three generations. The criticism came as the U.N. bureaucracy claimed success in publishing a list of the “correct” words to use if someone’s gender isn’t known. It suggests using humankind instead of mankind, swapping chairman for chair and replacing husband or wife with spouse as ways to soothe international discourse and promote peaceful harmony among nations. What you say matters. Help create a more equal world by using gender-neutral language if you're unsure about someone's gender or are referring to a group. https://t.co/QQRFPY4VRn #GenerationEquality via@UN_Women pic.twitter.com/koxoAZZuxq — United Nations (@UN) May 18, 2020  “The paralysis of the Security Council in the face of Covid is shameful. To millions of people, it is also incomprehensible,” said David Miliband, CEO of the International Rescue Committee. Rob Malley, president and CEO of the International Crisis Group, blames Washington and Beijing for the U.N.’s inability to get member states to agree on anything. He said the two countries “have treated these negotiations as an opportunity for a blame-game over the origins of Covid-19 rather than an opening to make a straightforward call for a reduction in violence during the pandemic.” Neither country “seems able or willing to show leadership at the U.N. during a global crisis,” Malley claimed. Wednesday’s pointed criticisms are not the first time the U.N.’s failure to be anything but a spectacularly funded debating society during the Chinese coronavirus pandemic has been highlighted. As Breitbart News reported, Oxfam International branded U.N. ceasefire calls “a catastrophic failure”, releasing a report saying the U.N. has been totally ignored in its efforts to be a peacebroker. It outlined that fighting continues unabated across war-torn countries, undermining global efforts to combat the viral epidemic which has infected more than 4.1 million people and caused more than 300,000 deaths worldwide. Unlike the Security Council, the U.N. General Assembly has managed to at least adopt two slim pandemic-related resolutions, one on April 3 aimed at strengthening international cooperation and the other on April 20 to call for equal access to any future vaccines. All this is being played out as the U.N. agency specifically charged with handling the world’s response to the epidemic, the World Health Organization (W.H.O.), has drawn trenchant criticism for its bungled actions and inability to take any course of action without first seeking the approval of the Chinese Communist Party. The U.N. has roused itself however when it comes to a matter it is exceptionally good at: asking the world for more money, something U.S. President Donald Trump has not let pass without comment: So make all Member Countries pay, not just the United States! https://t.co/IVbE4MqBVl — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 9, 2019  In March it sought $2 billion to be transferred from wealthy countries to the poor via the globalist body as an aid in tackling the global viral pandemic. The slim financial response that followed prompted another call for funds earlier this month, lifting the target to $6.7 billion to accommodate the U.N.’s all new, specially updated global plan to counter the viral epidemic. Last December the U.N. General Assembly adopted a stand-alone budget of $3 billion for operations to cover the year 2020, after claiming throughout 2019 it was underfunded and in need of an urgent financial bailout via increased global taxpayer contributions. Barely two months before that, a series of cutbacks began at the U.N.’s New York headquarters, starting with the heating being turned down, the diplomats’ bar shuttering early at 5pm and meetings canceled along with diminished first class global travel budgets. Now bars are open again as long as diplomats require and first-class travel resumed as well as expanded use of private jets.

Tuesday on Fox News Channel’s “Hannity,” Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) argued for his proposed bill that would restrict federal government money appropriated in the name of coronavirus relief from going to state or city government that give payouts to illegal immigrants. “[W]e shouldn’t be spending hard-earned taxpayer dollars on illegal immigrants at a time when 35 million Americans are out of work,” he said. “If we are going to be giving relief checks to those people who are out of work, we need to focus on American citizens, not illegal immigrants.” Cotton also emphasized other efforts to decouple the U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain from China and other foreign nations. While many pharmaceuticals are manufactured in the United States, the source material is often imported from abroad. “[I]t is a tragic irony that the country that unleashed this pandemic on the world also controls many of the most basic pharmaceutical ingredients for the United States,” Cotton said. “That does have to stop. I’ve got legislation that would give incentives to build more manufacturing capacity right here in the United States and ultimately ban the import of pharmaceuticals from China, many of which are adulterated, to begin with.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor

Planned Parenthood affiliates received $80 million in loans from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) in violation of the rules of the relief program revealed Fox News’s Tucker Carlson Tonight Tuesday night. According to the Fox News host, 37 affiliates of the abortion industry giant applied for and received the coronavirus funds. Now, officials of the Small Business Administration (SBA) and some members of Congress want the money returned and say it is possible criminal prosecution may apply. SBA is reportedly contacting the affiliates that received the federal funds, informing each that, with over 600 employees, Planned Parenthood Federation of America is not eligible for the funds that are loaned to organizations with 500 employees or less. Fox News reported Planned Parenthood Metropolitan Washington (PPMW), for example, “self-certified” that it was eligible for a loan of $1,328,000 but is being asked to return the funds. Planned Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino Counties in California received the largest loan of $7.5 million. Ironically, the abortion business voluntarily opted out of the federal family planning grant program (Title X) after the Trump administration enforced a rule that makes a clear distinction between abortion and birth control. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, told Fox News Planned Parenthood had violated the PPP rules: There is no ambiguity in the legislation that passed or public record around its passage that organizations such as Planned Parenthood, whose parent organization has close to half a billion dollars in assets, is not eligible for the Paycheck Protection Program. Those funds must be returned immediately. Furthermore, the SBA should open an investigation into how these loans were made in clear violation of the applicable affiliation rules and if Planned Parenthood, the banks, or staff at the SBA knowingly violated the law, all appropriate legal options should be pursued. Similarly, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) tweeted, “The money needs to be recovered and if anybody knowingly falsified applications, they need to be prosecuted”: The money needs to be recovered and if anybody knowingly falsified applications, they need to be prosecuted https://t.co/FKnrkHnE2P #FoxNews — Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) May 20, 2020  In its latest annual report for 2018-2019, Planned Parenthood revealed the organization performed a record-high number of abortions while it also received record-high taxpayer funding.

On Tuesday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “All In,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) said that states “need to start reopening,” but it is “a really dangerous moment.” And he is “incredibly nervous that we don’t have a president who seems to understand or care about what his role is, and what the federal government’s role is now to make sure that this doesn’t very quickly boomerang back in the wrong direction.” Murphy began by stating that reopenings pose the risk of “throwing lambs to the wolves.” Because people who couldn’t catch the virus during the lockdowns will now be able to. He continued, “What is so maddening is that this administration could have used this time to work with states to invest in the kind of systems that can jump on outbreaks when they start, and they are going to inevitably start to pop up all around the country. And we know exactly how to control them. But instead of helping us build those systems, these testing, tracing, and quarantine systems, the administration has sort of sat back and essentially prevented the CDC from working with us in any meaningful way and stood in the way of efforts to try to fund those systems. So, it’s a really dangerous moment. I think states need to start reopening, but it makes me incredibly nervous that we don’t have a president who seems to understand or care about what his role is, and what the federal government’s role is now to make sure that this doesn’t very quickly boomerang back in the wrong direction.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett  

A group of Maine legislators sent a letter Monday to U.S. Attorney General William Barr, requesting an investigation into Gov. Janet Mills (D) as a result of her numerous executive orders regarding the coronavirus crisis in which, they say, she “has exceeded her executive authority.” In the letter made available to Breitbart News, the lawmakers, all Republicans, led by Maine Rep. John DeVeau, expressed gratitude to Barr for his memorandum to the Department of Justice in April, in which he directed all U.S. attorneys to be watchful of coronavirus restrictions that could violate Americans’ constitutional rights. The legislators wrote: We fully recognize the many unknowns that existed just over a month ago and the need for reasonable executive action in the face of a potentially devastating public health emergency. However, we are deeply concerned that Governor Mills has exceeded her executive authority in violation of both the Maine and United States Constitutions and continues to implement similar policies without authority or justifiable cause. Among the specific concerns the lawmakers cite are Mills’ “arbitrary distinction between ‘essential’ and ‘non-essential’ businesses; denial of Maine citizens’ “right to assemble” in churches with gatherings of more than ten people; and her executive order “establishing quarantine restrictions on travelers arriving in Maine.” In a statement sent to Breitbart News, Maine Rep. Larry Lockman, one of the letter’s signers, said since Mills declared a state of emergency in March due to the coronavirus pandemic, “she has been ruthless in the exercise of her dictatorial powers to close down private businesses and place Mainers under house arrest.” “She ordered churches, restaurants, motels, state parks, and campgrounds to close their doors as ‘non-essential’ enterprises, while allowing abortion clinics and ice cream parlors to carry on business as usual,” Lockman continued. “Mom-and-pop retailers have been shut down, but the big box stores never missed a beat.” The lawmaker continued that many Mainers have suffered due to Mills’ order prohibiting “non-emergency” medical care, including “everything from cancer to cataracts to drug and alcohol addiction.” “Before it’s over, the lockdown will kill more Mainers than the virus, in addition to killing tens of thousands of jobs and small businesses,” Lockman said. “And for what?” he asked. “On a typical day, no more than three dozen COVID-19 patients are hospitalized statewide, in a state of 1.3 million people.” Lockman said it was time to “restore constitutional government in Maine.” “If that means Bill Barr will have to drag Jackboot Janet into federal court, let’s get on with it,” he asserted.

Thursday on MSNBC’s “All In,” Steve Schmidt, John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign manager, called President Donald Trump an “imbecile,” which he said was evidenced by the president announcing that he was taking hydroxychloroquine to prevent coronavirus. Schmidt said, “We’ve seen a president of the United States standing behind the podium emblazoned with the seal of the presidency, saying inject disinfectants, saying that I’m taking this malaria drug that could kill him. Over and over again, the American people have been subjected to wave after wave of idiocy, asininity of misinformation from the president of the United States. And what it all adds up to is the most inept and incompetent response to a crisis that is conceivable to imagine. This is the worst response by an American leader, certainly by a president, but by any American leader in a time of testing crisis in our nation’s history. It’s appallingly bad. And so as we talk right now, more Americans will be dead by the dawn. We’re approaching 100,000 dead Americans because of the abject in incompetence and mishandling of this by Donald Trump.” He added, “President Trump is many things. He’s dishonest. He’s lied to the American people more than 17,000 times. He completely is corrupt. He’s indecent. He’s vile. He’s divisive. But in this moment, the thing that matters the most, and I don’t say this to name call, but he’s an Imbecile. There is no other word for it. That’s the precise word we use in the English language to describe his comportment, to describe his behavior.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Canava’s new underwear features their “dream team” — Governors Andrew Cuomo and Gavin Newsom as well as Dr. Anthony Fauci. Los Angeles clothier Canava is plastering the names of three prominent pandemic personalities on women’s underwear. “NEWSOM, FAUCI, CUOMO = our version of a dream team and we heard you loud and clear,” the brand posted on Instagram Saturday. “After the launch of the NYC Limited Edition there was an outcry for MORE MORE MORE.”     NEWSOM, FAUCI, CUOMO = our version of a dream team and we heard you loud and clear, after the launch of the NYC Limited Edition there was an outcry for MORE MORE MORE.  Now there are Newsom & Fauci, limited edition briefs and bikinis. Run to your keyboard; there aren’t very many of these babies to be had. When you buy any of these limited edition products, we will be matching dollar for dollar your purchase with an equal product donation to healthcare workers in NYC (NYC, Cuomo & Fauci) or California (Newsom).

They also sweetened the deal with an offer to provide “an equal product donation to healthcare workers in [NYC and California],” so that medical personnel could have the opportunity to “rest, recharge, and relax” — in their branded apparel, of course. Canava calls themselves a “profit for purpose” company. And what could be a nobler purpose than turning healthcare workers into national mascots during a global pandemic? “We are living in unlikely times, and we heard you loud and clear that you wanted to show your ‘appreciation’ with more than a thank you,” Canava says in its product description for their Fauci bikini briefs. Cuomo underwear are lower cut for anyone “thirsty” for the New York governor, alongside hipster briefs for those “loving on” the governor of California. This is far from the only fashion idea spawned by the novel coronavirus, COVID-19. An Italian designer recently launched a “trikini” that includes a matching mask with its typical two-piece wear, and Salvatore’s Pizza is working with Donuts Delite to put Dr. Fauci’s face on their pastries.

States across the country are implementing their own plans for reopening in the wake of the coronavirus, with some allowing citizens to get back to their lives and livelihoods, while others continue to order people to remain at home and stay away from public places. The personal finance website conducted a survey to determine which states have the most and least freedom as Americans are posed to celebrate Memorial Day. WalletHub said about its survey: Americans experienced unprecedented restrictions on their everyday life in order to fight the coronavirus, but now most states have partially reopened. In order to determine the states with the fewest coronavirus restrictions, WalletHub compared the 50 states and the District of Columbia across 11 key metrics. Those metrics include whether masks were recommended or required; travel restrictions; large gathering restrictions; school closures; restaurants and bars status; reopening of “non-essential” businesses; child care; strictness of “shelter-in-place” orders; whether a state is part of a multi-state arrangement; suspension or postponement of legislative sessions; and medical services, including elective surgery. Breitbart News is adding to the list whether each state in the survey has a Republican or Democrat governor.  The state with the least restrictions is South Dakota (Republican Gov. Kristi Noem). Jill Gonzalez, WalletHub analyst, said of its report: Two major reasons why South Dakota ranks as the state with the fewest coronavirus restrictions are that it is one of only seven states that never had a mandate for all schools to close during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is the only state that never required a statewide closure of bars and restaurants. South Dakota has already lifted some of the restrictions it did implement, such as its ban on large gatherings, and it only recommends wearing a mask in public rather than requiring it like most states do. The state rated second in returning freedom to its residents is Wisconsin where Democrat Tony Evers is governor. The state’s restrictions have changed drastically since the first WalletHub survey on coronavirus restrictions: Wisconsin moved from 34 to 2, up 32 positions. This is due in part to the fact that the state has lifted all restrictions on large gatherings, had closed but fully re-opened restaurants and bars, has child care programs open and has fully reopened all non-essential businesses. The other eight states in the Top 10 with the least restrictions are, in order, Idaho (Republican Gov. Brad Little), Missouri (Republican Gov. Mike Parson), Utah (Republican Gov. Gary Herbert), Wyoming (Republican Gov. Mark Gordon), Montana (Democrat Gov. Steve Bullock) Arizona (Republican Gov. Doug Ducey), North Dakota (Republican Gov. Doug Burgum) and Iowa (Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds). “Arizona moved from 32 to 8, up 24 positions,” WalletHub reported. “This is due in part to the fact that the state has lifted all restrictions on large gatherings and has lifted all stay-at-home mandatory restrictions.” Georgia fell from 11th to 28th in this latest survey: Georgia moved from 11 to 28, down 17 positions. This is due in part to the fact that the state requires wearing a face mask in public and that the state still has its legislative sessions postponed. The most restrictive states, from 41 to 51 in order, are: Michigan (Democrat Gov. Gretchen Whitmer), New York (Democrat Gov. Andrew Cuomo), New Mexico (Democrat Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham), Washington (Democrat Gov. Jay Inslee), Hawaii (Democrat Gov. David Ige), Vermont (Republican Gov. Phil Scott) , Massachusetts (Republican Gov. Charlie Baker), District of Columbia (Democrat Mayor Muriel Bowser), Rhode Island (Democrat Gov. Gina Raimondo) and Illinois (Democrat Gov. J.B. Pritzker). “Each metric was graded on a 100-point scale, with a score of 100 representing the fewest restrictions,” WalletHub said of its survey methodology. Follow Penny Starr on Twitter

Hollywood depends on a steady flow of new content to keep people at home and glued to their screens. But the Chinese coronavirus pandemic has disrupted the once-reliable pipeline, jeopardizing the supply of new shows that streamers and broadcasters depend on to keep consumers hooked. A new study has found that the coronavirus pandemic will cause an estimated 60 percent of scripted TV shows to be delayed as Hollywood production remains in a state of limbo. The report also estimated that 10% of planned drama and comedy shows will likely be abandoned altogether as a result of the outbreak. Cote de Pablo as Ziva David, Mark Harmon as Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs in the 17th season premiere of NCIS. Erik Voake/CBS Television Network Kelly Clarkson, Gwen Stefani, John Legend, Blake Shelton of The Voice. Trae Patton/NBC Deadline reported that the new study from Ampere Analysis expects that broadcasters will release between 5 percent to 10 percent fewer new scripted titles on a monthly basis than previously predicted during the second half of 2020. The ripple effects of the shutdown are likely to be felt well into next year. Ampere found at least one bright spot amid the industry gloom — reality TV shows are likely to bounce back faster. Reality series are cheaper and faster to produce than scripted content, and often require fewer crew members. A limited number of reality titles have already resumed production, one industry source recently told Breitbart News. Rob Gronkowski and host Nick Cannon in The Masked Singer. Michael Becker / FOX Donnie Wahlberg and Tom Selleck in Blue Bloods. Craig Blankenhorn/CBS Television Network The study concluded that the Chinese coronavirus will result in fewer new shows being greenlit in the foreseeable future. “The knock-on effect of delayed releases is a likely depression of the number of new commissions for some time after the shutdown ends, as commissioners look to fill schedules with delayed projects they have already invested in before signing off new ones,” Fred Black, senior analyst at Ampere Analysis, said in the report, according to Deadline. The major Hollywood studios are currently working with state governments and industry trade unions to create safety protocols for when shooting resumes in the U.S. None of the major studios — as well as Netflix or Amazon — has said when they plan on re-starting domestic production. The indefinite hiatus has thrown tens of thousands of Hollywood union members out of work. Before the coronavirus, TV production was soaring thanks to a bottomless demand for new content fueled by the digital streaming revolution. Production has already started again in New Zealand, where Amazon has been shooting its highly anticipated Lord of the Rings series. A handful of European countries are also set to resume filming on a limited basis, including Poland, the Czech Republic, and France. Follow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg. Have a tip?

On Tuesday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “Your World,” White House Economic Adviser Kevin Hassett stated that if there is another round of coronavirus stimulus, President Trump will push for a payroll tax cut. Hassett said, [relevant remarks begin around 3:45] “I think that if we go to that next phase of negotiations, the president has a way of getting what he wants on these things. And, of course, you know, he’s got to make a deal. He wrote ‘The Art of the Deal.’ But he believes strongly, as I do, economically, that the payroll tax on the employee side is a really big, positive stimulus. The reason is twofold. One, is that people have more take-home pay. So, they go out and buy stuff. And then second, if you go back to work, you make more money. Because you’re not having to pull the payroll tax off on top of it.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

Bad Boys 2 and Transformers director Michael Bay is producing a coronavirus-themed thriller with production set to start in the next five weeks, according to Deadline, in what will be the first major Hollywood production to begin filming in Los Angeles in the Chinese coronavirus lockdown era. Adam Goodman, whose Invisible Narratives is also producing the film, promises that the plan for filming has passed the rigorous safety guidelines crafted by various trade unions and the city of Los Angeles. Mark Wahlberg and Michael Bay in Transformers: The Last Knight, 2017. Andrew Cooper/Paramount Pictures Deadline provided a brief synopsis of the “taut thriller” currently titled Songbird. The film is reportedly set in the year 2022 after the initial 2020 lockdowns caused by the Chinese coronavirus have ended. Despite the end of the first coronavirus lockdowns, though, the virus does not wane, and additional lockdowns are implemented. By 2022, the world is in full blown panic as the virus runs rampant across the globe, collapsing governments and causing chaos. Filmmakers have presented a production plan that will include crews setting up sets on location without any actors present. Actors will reportedly shoot scenes individually and without actors interacting with each other on screen. Deadline reported that there is a plan for remote training for the actors with approval from the trade unions. The film’s production should be welcome news for Hollywood, as Los Angeles County alone has seen roughly 14,000 entertainment-related workers put out of work, according to a new report from tech news outlet dot.LA. Adam Mason (Into The Dark) wrote the script with Simon Boyes (Misconduct). Mason is also set to direct the film. Casting is currently underway, producers said.

The government of Hong Kong announced on Tuesday a 14-day extension of bans on large public gatherings in the city, resulting in the prevention of any mass public events until June 5. June 4 is the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, an event Hong Kong typically marks with a candlelight vigil. Last year, the Tiananmen Square vigil attracted tens of thousands of people and preceded the evolution of isolated pro-democracy events into a sustained movement against Chinese colonization of the city. Hong Kong officially became an “autonomous” region of China in 1997, after the United Kingdom handed over sovereignty. The deal, known as “One Country, Two Systems,” was supposed to allow Hong Kong to retain its tradition of Western-style individual rights but, under dictator Xi Jinping, China has been increasingly imposing laws to erode civil rights safeguards. Protests against China’s impositions, most notably a proposed law that would have allowed Hong Kong to extradite anyone to China accused of violating repressive Communist Party laws, sustained themselves for months before dwindling in light of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. Hong Kong did not lock down completely like many parts of the world, but did ban mass gatherings for weeks. Those restrictions partially lifted at the beginning of the month in light of a diminishing number of new coronavirus cases, triggering a near-instant return of the protests. On Tuesday, Hong Kong Secretary for Food and Health Sophia Chan announced that her government needed to extend a ban on public gatherings of more than eight people in light of newly confirmed coronavirus infections believed to have occurred within Hong Kong. At press time, Hong Kong has documented 1,056 cases of Chinese coronavirus and four deaths. The current ban would have elapsed on Thursday. “As seen from the recent local confirmed cases, the transmission chain in the community has not been completely broken off yet,” she said, citing the three latest confirmed coronavirus cases in the city. Authorities announced on May 14 that a 62-year-old man had joined his wife and granddaughter in testing positive for the virus. The man’s wife tested positive after 23 days of Hong Kong not documenting any new local cases. Doctors typically wait for twice the believed incubation period of a virus to go by without new cases to declare that local community transmission chains have been broken, which in this case would have been 28 days. The new cases resulted in Hong Kong officials planning to test people in 860 households in the family’s neighborhood linked to exposure to those involved. Chan noted on Tuesday that the fact that the virus may still be infecting people freely within Hong Kong made it impossible to lift gathering restrictions or allow the opening of nightclubs and other inherently crowded businesses, but announced one concession: the restoration of religious gatherings at 50 percent capacity. Chan denied that the extension of the gathering ban was intended to ensure that it would be illegal to observe the June 4 anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. “There are no other considerations in terms of the social distancing measures,” she insisted, noting that all extensions of the coronavirus protection measures have been 14 days, so the timing that included June 4 was a coincidence. Police have used the ban on gatherings in past weeks to arrest peaceful protesters in several shopping centers throughout the region. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam is also pushing to criminalize another form of dissent, “disrespect” for the Chinese Communist Party anthem “March of the Volunteers,” as soon as possible. Lam called for lawmakers friendly to her administration to put a law that would result in up to three-year prison sentences for disrespecting the anthem at the top of the docket, making it possible to pass the ban before June 4. Pro-Beijing lawmakers retook the Legislative Council – not without a literal fight from pro-democracy counterparts – this week. The upcoming anniversary observes the killing of an untold number of people – recent estimates suggest around 10,000 protesters – in Beijing in 1989 for protesting against communism. Inspired by the impending fall of the Soviet Union and protests throughout the states behind the Iron Curtain, Chinese citizens flooded Beijing’s iconic Tiananmen Square for peaceful calls for reform. The Communist Party responded with tanks and ammunition. Hong Kong has observed the anniversary of the murders every year since, making it the only part of China to organize gatherings for the event when it joined the communist empire in 1997. Macau, China’s other “special administration region,” typically holds a small photo gallery event, but that, too, was canceled this year. In China, censors work around the clock to erase potential references to the massacre. As last year marked the 30th anniversary, censors not only blocked direct references to Tiananmen Square, but a set of over 260 words that may trigger related results, such as “today,” “candle,” and numbers like 6, 4, 1989, or any combination thereof. Last year, organizers said that 180,000 people filled Hong Kong’s Victoria Park, carrying candles and other lights to represent the people killed by the Communist Party. Police, which have been consistently accused of undercounting protest crowds in subsequent events, claimed only 40,000 people attended. The event did not prompt any altercations or violence.

Several blue state governors have refused to listen to the cries of residents begging them to reopen their respective states, instead issuing threats against localities and business owners who fail to comply with their draconian lockdown orders — threats that have, largely, failed to come to fruition. Residents across several states, under the leadership of Democrat governors, have been urging their respective governors to reopen the economy as the coronavirus curve flattens across the country and hospitals remain significantly under capacity. Some have acted in defiance, forging paths forward without approval from their governors, spurring threats of retaliation from the state officials. However, many of these blue state governors have demonstrated that their draconian lockdown orders cannot prevail against the American spirit, as Americans continue to fight for their right to operate their businesses, work, and earn a living. Perhaps no governor has demonstrated this more so than Pennsylvania’s Tom Wolf (D), who has earned a collection of nicknames — including “Commie Tommy Wolf” — over his refusal to lift the lockdown order on several counties. His lockdown order, which extends to red phase counties, bars non-life essential businesses from operating. Instead of listening to the concerns of residents, many of whom rallied at the state’s Capitol last week, Wolf issued a series of threats to counties and businesses moving to reopen without his explicit permission. “To those politicians who decide to cave in to this coronavirus, they need to understand the consequences of their cowardly act,” Wolf said last week following rumblings of a “mutiny” forming among counties stuck under his lockdown orders. He ultimately threatened to withhold federal stimulus discretionary funds from counties defying his order and also issued a threat to business owners directly, warning that they could lose their health department certificate, liquor license, and certificate of occupancy, at the hands of the state. His remarks came as a handful of district attorneys across the state affirmed that they would not prosecute businesses reopening against Wolf’s orders. Wolf quickly backtracked on his tough talk, admitting that he had not asked the state’s attorney general to take action. “No, I have not–nor do I intend to,” Wolf said. Wolf also waffled during Monday’s press conference, admitting that there would likely be no penalties for gym owners who opt to reopen outside of his instructions. “The real penalty is that the people risk getting sick,” he said. “I’m not sure how gyms are regulated at all, but if they depend on a license from the Department of State or Department of Community and Economic Development or the Department of Health, then that’s where the responsibility lies,” he continued. He added that the “primary responsibility” lies with the business and person making the decision there and the customer. Billionaire Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) has also been talking tough as part of his attempt to discourage potential dissenters. He filed an emergency rule Friday, described as an “additional enforcement tool for businesses that refuse to comply with the most critical aspects of the stay-at-home order.” As a result of Pritzker’s actions, businesses can face up to a $2,500 fine or jail time for violating his order. However, his spokesperson clarified that the threat would only be used against businesses that “pose a serious risk to public health and refuse to comply with health regulations.” “The rule gives law enforcement a tool that may be more appropriate and less severe than closing the business altogether,” Jordan Abudayyeh, a spokeswoman for the governor, said. Ann Spillane, general counsel to Pritzker’s administration, also admitted that “nobody’s getting arrested or handcuffed.” “But they are getting a citation where they would have to go to court,” she added. In the neighboring state of Wisconsin — which Pritzker’s wife has recently visited, despite his stay-at-home order discouraging nonessential travel — the state’s Supreme Court knocked down Gov. Tony Evers’(D) stay-at-home order, leading local health officials to rescind their stay-at-home directives as well. Even Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D), who attempted to imposed some of the most severe lockdown orders in the country — even barring neighbors from visiting each other — has been unable to stop the protests in her state and has faced severe backlash for attempting to enforce her lockdown orders, particularly after waging a war against a 77-year-old barber who reopened his business after being denied unemployment. All the while, she has been losing support from members of her own party. Democrat Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson, for instance, stated that he would not enforce her stay-at-home order, and Democrat County executive Mark Hackel criticized the governor, noting that he remains “unimpressed” by her plan to reopen the state. County sheriffs across the state also took a stand against Whitmer’s instructions. The sheriffs wrote in a letter last month: Each of us took an oath to uphold and defend the Michigan Constitution, as well as the US Constitution, and to ensure that your God given rights are not violated,” the sheriffs wrote in a letter last month. “We believe that we are the last line of defense in protecting your civil liberties.” Pennsylvania’s Cumberland County Sheriff’s Office issued a similar statement, clarifying that it “will not be enforcing any ‘order’ that violates our Constitutional Rights.” On the West Coast, California’s Central Valley took a stand against Gov. Gavin Newsom’s (D) stay-at-home orders, establishing itself as a “sanctuary city” for businesses and churches. City council members passed a resolution “affirming the city’s commitment to fundamental constitutional rights and declaring the city of Atwater a sanctuary city for all businesses,” as the San Francisco Chronicle reported. Americans across the country continue in their defiance of the lockdown orders as business owners — from restaurant owners to salon owners — charge ahead to earn their livelihoods in violation of orders issued by their state leaders. “It appears to be about us, but it’s not about us. It’s about all the people that reached out to me to tell me they’re losing everything — everything hard they ever worked for,” Jesse Probus, owner of Sick Ink Studios in Pennsylvania’s Lehigh County, said in a video statement last week, detailing his decision to begin reopening. “It’s something that I have to do to help other small business owners. Maybe they’ll stand up with me,” he said, adding that he felt as though his “civil liberties are threatened with all this that’s going on.” “Put the politics aside and let the people work, because the country is turning into more like a communist system here,” Themi Sacarellos, owner of Pennsylvania’s Round the Clock Diner, which recently reopened for dine-in services, told Breitbart News. “And I know better than a communist system. I lived in those days.” As Democrat governors fail to enforce their dramatic lockdown measures and slowly begin to heed to the mounting calls to reopen,  states like Florida and Georgia — under the leadership of Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) and Gov. Brian Kemp (R) — are loosening restrictions and yielding hopeful results, as coronavirus cases are not currently surging in either state. In fact, Kemp announced on Tuesday that the Peach State reached the lowest number of hospitalized coronavirus patients “since hospitals started reporting data to the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency (GEMA/HS) on April 8.” “Our hospitalization numbers continue to show encouraging signs in our fight against COVID-19, but we must remain vigilant in our efforts to combat this virus,” Kemp said in a statement. “I continue to ask Georgians to practice social distancing, follow the advice of public health officials, and protect the elderly and medically fragile,” he added: Today marks the lowest number of COVID-19 positive patients hospitalized in Georgia at 986. That’s down 34% since May 1st.  These numbers are encouraging, but we must remain vigilant in our efforts to fight this virus. https://t.co/7uFuMrEyFE https://t.co/f5JRHTfoIK — Governor Brian P. Kemp (@GovKemp) May 19, 2020  Florida has also fared better than blue states like New York, despite its larger, more vulnerable population. “But everyone in the media was saying Florida was going to be like New York or Italy, and that has not happened because we understood we have a big, diverse state,” DeSantis said of the early media criticisms. “We understood the outbreak was not uniform throughout the state, and we had a tailored and measured approach that not only helped our numbers be way below what anyone predicted, but also did less damage to our state going forward,” he added. While Democrat leaders, like Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), are scolding Americans gathering in protest, President Trump has defended citizens who have publicly expressed their disapproval of lockdown orders. “These are great people,” Trump said in April. “They want their life back; their life was taken away from them,” he added.

The radical New Black Panther Party launched a nationwide boycott of “Chinese merchants” on Tuesday — including restaurants, beauty salons, and other businesses — to protest China’s treatment of Africans, among other grievances. Attorney Malik Zulu Shabazz announced the boycott campaign, which he also described as part of a “Buy Black Offensive,” as a protest against discrimination in the People’s Republic of China, as well as the behavior of Chinese companies in Africa. The protests targeted over a dozen businesses across the country, none of which had any apparent affiliation with the Chinese government. For example, one group of protesters held a demonstration outside Yum’s in Washington, DC, a popular local eatery. (The founder came to the U.S. from Hong Kong in 1979.) Breitbart News live-streamed some of the protests in Washington, which included several Black Panther activists trampling a Chinese flag.  Breitbart News’ Matthew Perdie and Jack Knudsen captured the D.C. group in Washington’s Chinatown. Shabazz also staged a press conference outside the Chinese embassy, at which he called Chinese merchants the “bloodsucker of the black community.” Shabazz issued a press release listing the targeted businesses. At his press conference, he singled out the Red Star Restaurant in Harlem, New York City, vowing to “shut it down.” He live-streamed from the Red Star several hours later, apparently having made the trip, filming outside and inside the restaurant as organizers attempted to inform customers about the protest and hand a memorandum to the owner. Shabazz then live-streamed several times from the protest itself, including after police officers arrives on the scene. Shabazz’s press release blamed the Chinese government for “vicious human rights violations; anti-Black racism of Africans living in China; supplying the Black community with poor quality and substandard food; exploiting the local retail market; refusing to hire Blacks; rude and disrespectful treatment; and failure to assist community organizations.” The release further explained that the protests were aimed at “local Chinese business outlets that are open during the pandemic,” with the message that “Harm to Africans in China can bring Harm to Chinese in America.” The protests were timed to coincide with Malcolm X’s birthday.

A video of what appears to be a massive crowd congregating outside a Brooklyn building and twerking on top of cars went viral over the weekend, causing the police to investigate. The New York Police Department (NYPD) is now looking into the video, which went viral on Snapchat over the weekend. The video shows people dancing, twerking on top of cars, and playing loud music on sidewalks as they drink, while staying in close contact with each other. The party is believed to have taken place in the Brownsville neighborhood of Brooklyn, NBC 4 New York reported. A spokesperson for the mayor’s office told NBC 4 New York that police should disperse crowds like that, and anyone who refuses to disperse should be issued a summons. The video from Brooklyn emerged the same day the NYPD shut down a Jewish Orthodox school in Bedford-Stuyvesant that was operating against city and state orders. More than 100 children were inside Monday when the police arrived to shut down the school, officials said. There are more than 191,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in New York City, with 16,059 confirmed deaths as of Tuesday, according to data from the NYC Department of Health.

Muslims in Saudi Arabia will be allowed to perform their Eid al-Fitr prayers at home this year as a result of the closure of mosques in response to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, national news service Al Arabiya reported Monday. Saudi Arabia’s Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdulaziz al-Sheikh said on Sunday that either individually or in a group, Muslims should start praying 15 to 30 minutes after sunrise and carry on until the Duha prayer, the voluntary prayer between the obligatory sunrise and noon prayer. To observe Zakat al-Fitr, the donation Muslims must make to the poor before the beginning of Eid, the Grand Mufti advised that they instead make a contribution to reliable charitable organizations. The coronavirus pandemic has led to the closure of mosques around the world to contain the spread of the disease. However, many devout Muslims have been caught violating the lockdown measures to observe holy rituals in various Islamic countries, sometimes at the advice of religious leaders. The guidance provided by the Grand Mufti follows the decision made by Saudi authorities last week to extend the lockdown measures throughout the country a further five days until Wednesday, May 28. Khaled bin Ali Batarfi, a professor of social studies at Alfaisal University in Riyadh, told The Media Line the extension had been expected given that Eid al-Fitr generally involves people gathering in large groups to “visit markets, gardens, or to any other entertainment places, which usually are crowded with people, in contradiction to the precautionary measures taken during the COVID-19 crisis.” Batarfi added that unlike in other parts of the world, he expects Saudis to abide by the measures. “When there’s an official decision by the government, people feel obligated and commit to it. If such a thing were left without organization and planning, people would feel obligated to socialize. The decision saved face for people,” he explained. “People are still showing acceptance because they understand it is for their own safety.” With a relatively small population of around 34 million people, Saudi Arabia has recorded the 14th highest number of coronavirus cases worldwide. According to official figures, nearly 60,000 people have contracted the virus. Health authorities claim that 329 people have died as a result, a suspiciously low figure that places it massively out of line with global trends. In Belgium, for example, around 56,000 people have confirmed cases of the virus, causing the deaths of at least 9,100, an abnormally high mortality rate of around 16 percent. Other Islamic governments, including Iraq and the Palestinian Authority, have similarly decided to impose curfews to prevent the spread of the virus.

Republicans on the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis are asking Democrats to hold China accountable for causing the coronavirus pandemic, as well as the World Health Organization for its role in facilitating China’s actions. In a May 19, 2020, letter to committee chairman Rep. James Clyburn (D-SC) obtained by Breitbart News, a handful of Republican members on the committee, led by House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA), asked Democrats to join their efforts to investigate China. “We urge you to immediately join our investigation and hold hearings to determine why the Chinese government denied and downplayed the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak, and how China is now attempting to exploit the pandemic it caused,” they wrote. “As President Trump stated in his May 18, 2020, letter to the Director-General of the WHO, ‘We do not have time to waste.’ Congress must work to understand the origins of COVID-19 and reform the WHO,” they added. The letter was signed by Scalise, along with Reps. Jim Jordan (R-OH), Blaine Luetkemeyer (R-MO), Jackie Walorski (R-IN), and Mark E. Green (R-TN). They wrote: Specifically, the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis should investigate: (1) China’s obfuscation of the origin of COVID-19; (2) China’s manipulation of the WHO to cover up the severity of the outbreak; and (3) recent reports that the Chinese government is stealing American medical research and disrupting the medical supply chain, among other tactics intended to exploit the pandemic. Focusing the Subcommittee’s resources on these imperative questions will assist the U.S. government effort to limit ongoing and future harm from Chinese malfeasance. … The Chinese government’s efforts to undermine the American effort to combat COVID-19 and sabotage the global economic recovery are ongoing. We urge the Subcommittee to return to the Capitol and help us hold the Chinese government accountable for its cynical strategy to exploit a pandemic of its own making.

The economic downturn from the novel coronavirus pandemic is “without modern precedent” and “significantly worse than any recession” the U.S. has experienced since World War II, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told a Senate panel on Tuesday. Powell proclaimed in written testimony prepared for a hearing held by the Senate Banking Committee: Available economic data for the current quarter show a sharp drop in output and an equally sharp rise in unemployment. By these measures and many others, the scope and speed of this downturn are without modern precedent and are significantly worse than any recession since World War II. His comments came days after he predicted the coronavirus-linked decline in economic activity might last until 2021. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who testified alongside Powell, warned of potential long-term devastation to the American economy, the longer the shutdown measures imposed by states remain in place. “There is [a] risk of permanent damage,” he told the Senate panel. Mnuchin, however, noted that he expects the economic conditions to improve as some states begin to reopen in the third and fourth quarters of this year. Highlighting the worst unemployment rates since the Great Depression of the 1930s, currently driving the economic downturn, Mnuchin said it is essential to reopen the American economy. “It is so important to begin bringing people back to work in a safe way,” he told lawmakers in his written testimony, adding: As we listen to medical experts, we are optimistic about the progress being made on vaccines, antiviral therapies, and testing. Working closely with governors, we are beginning to open the economy in a way that minimizes risks to workers and customers. We expect economic conditions to improve in the third and fourth quarters. Last week, Dr. Anthony Fauci, a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force and the country’s top infectious disease expert, told lawmakers there could be a vaccine available by “late fall” or “early winter.” Early this year, states imposed what the secretary described as an “unprecedented” shut down of significant parts of the economy to stem the spread of the illness (COVID-19) associated with the new virus. Some have begun to reopen as, even the mainstream media admits, conditions improve in many states. “This precipitous drop in economic activity has caused a level of pain that is hard to capture in words, as lives are upended amid great uncertainty about the future,” Powell testified, citing the devastating unemployment rates. “In addition to the economic disruptions, the virus has created tremendous strains in some essential financial markets and impaired the flow of credit in the economy,” the Federal Reserve chairman also said. On Tuesday, Powell and Mnuchin provided their first assessment of the economic stimulus programs implemented as part of the $2.2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. During the hearing, the Trump administration officials sparred with Democrat senators over when and how to reopen the economy. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) accused the administration of being too eager to reopen. The senator asked, “How many workers should give their lives to increase the GDP or the Dow by 1,000 points?” “No workers should give their lives to do that, senator, and I think your characterization is unfair,” Mnuchin proclaimed. Mnuchin and Powell defended the Trump administration’s fiscal response to the ongoing pandemic.

Michigan is sending ballot applications to all 7.7 million registered voters with $4.5 million in funds granted by the CARES Act. “By mailing applications, we have ensured that no Michigander has to choose between their health and their right to vote,” Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said, NBC 25 reported. “Voting by mail is easy, convenient, safe, and secure, and every voter in Michigan has the right to do it.” Every voter will receive an application for the August and November elections in one mailing, the secretary of state’s office told Breitbart News. The effort will cost about $4.5 million “and federal CARES Act funds are being used,” Jake Rollow, director of Communications & External Affairs for Benson, said. The U.S. Congress provided $400 million to the Election Assistance Commission for “Election Security Grants” to “prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus, domestically or internationally, for the 2020 Federal election cycle” on pages 668–669 of the bill. The legislation didn’t specially mention vote-by-mail, but the Election Assistance Commission did in an April letter. Under a section titled “Purpose and Use of Funds,” the first bullet point read, “Printing of additional ballots and envelopes for potential higher levels of absentee or vote by mail processes.” Kyle Olson is a reporter for Breitbart News.

The Venetian Resort on the Las Vegas Strip announced Tuesday that it would start taking reservations for stays beginning on June 1, the day it plans to reopen to the public. The Venetian Tower will be the first to open while the Palazzo will open at a later date, according to a news release obtained by KVVU. “We continue to adhere to guidance provided by federal, state and local authorities including the Southern Nevada Health District, Centers For Disease Control and Prevention and the Nevada Gaming Control Board,” the property said in the release. Guests can expect a fully-operating casino, more than a dozen restaurants, a renovated pool deck, and retail outlets to be available to them. The Venetian says it also plans to test all its employees for the coronavirus over the next two weeks. The casino is also announcing a community initiative called the Share the Love program, which will donate thousands of free nights to frontline workers and first responders who have put their lives on the line to fight the coronavirus. For every suite that someone books through the program, the Venetian says it will donate a free night to thank a first responder or other frontline workers. The resort has pledged to donate up to 50,000 nights using this program. Nevada’s casinos have remained shuttered since March due to the coronavirus pandemic. The state’s gaming control board is in charge of overseeing all reopening plans, but there is currently no set date for when venues can start to welcome back guests, KSNV reported.

Tuesday on MSNBC’s “Deadline,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said she was surprised by President Donald Trump’s reaction to her calling him “morbidly obese.” Monday on CNN when asked about the news Trump is taking hydroxychloroquine, Pelosi said, “As far as the president is concerned, he’s our president and I would rather he not be taking something that has not been approved by the scientists, especially in his age group and in his, shall we say, weight group — morbidly obese they say. So I think it’s not a good idea.” Tuesday, when asked by reporters about Pelosi’s comments, Trump said she was a “waste of time” and has “mental problems.” Host Nicolle Wallace said, “Madam Speaker, what you said is actually something that can be corroborated in the White House’s release of the president’s last physical, which is his weight does qualify him as being morbidly obese. Is that what you were saying, or did you know it could elicit this kind of reaction from the president?” Pelosi said, “I didn’t know that he would be so sensitive. He’s always talking about other people’s avoir du poids, their weight, their pounds.” She added, “I don’t want to spend any more time on his distraction because, as you see in the last couple of days, so much of the time has been spent on what he said. Rather than that, I think he should recognize his words weigh a ton. Instead of telling people to put Lysol into their lungs or taking a medication that’s not been approved except under certain circumstances. He should be saying that your previous guest mentioned things that will help people.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Critics are switching gears in their criticisms of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) as metrics show that his tailored response has spared the Sunshine State from an overwhelming surge in coronavirus cases, and are now focusing on the state’s coronavirus dashboard following the news that the manager of the project no longer oversees it. Rebekah Jones, who Florida Today described as the “architect and manager” of  Florida’s COVID-19 dashboard, announced this month that she will no longer oversee and manage the dashboard. Her departure, she said, is involuntary, citing “reasons beyond my division’s control.” Per Florida Today: The dashboard has been a one-stop shop for researchers, the media and the public to access and download tables of COVID-19 cases, testing and death data to analyze freely. It had been widely hailed as a shining example of transparency and accessibility. But over the last few weeks it had “crashed” and gone offline; data has gone missing without explanation and access to the underlying data sheets has become increasingly difficult. Jones hinted at censorship as a primary reason for her removal from her role, telling CBS12 that she refused to “manually change data to drum up support for the plan to reopen.” The Tampa Bay Times reported that officials “had directed her to remove data from public view that showed Floridians reported symptoms of the disease before cases were officially announced.” “This is the wrong call,” Jones reportedly said. Questions over accurate coronavirus data have haunted other states throughout the pandemic, with skeptics accusing officials of inflating the numbers of coronavirus deaths, lumping in “probable” cases of the virus with confirmed cases and “probable” coronavirus deaths with confirmed coronavirus deaths. Pennsylvania experienced this issue last month, with the coronavirus death count fluctuating — two spikes and a decrease — over the course of a week. “I understand, appreciate, and even share your concern about all the dramatic changes that have occurred and those that are yet to come,” Jones said in a letter regarding her departure from the project, warning that the next team would likely not be as transparent as her office. “As a word of caution, I would not expect the new team to continue the same level of accessibility and transparency that I made central to the process during the first two months. After all, my commitment to both is largely (arguably entirely) the reason I am no longer managing it,” she added. Jones’s remarks were were enough for DeSantis’s critics to resume their outspoken disapprovals of the governor: White House #coronavirus Dr. Birx praised her work on national tv. Florida's COVID-19 response dashboard worked very well. It showed where cases were rising or falling by zip code. Now, the Republican Gov. fired its architect. Because she’s a success.https://t.co/405Xxa5Ipo — Grant Stern (@grantstern) May 19, 2020  This type of behavior would make the central governments of Russia and China blush: https://t.co/nOKXX9zDdm — Tom Winter (@Tom_Winter) May 19, 2020  This is outrageous! Rebekah Jones, the manager of Florida’s COVID-19 dashboard has been involuntarily removed from her position because she refused to censor some data to, in her own words, "drum up support for the plan to reopen." — Jim Kennedy (@JK4Florida) May 19, 2020  Florida Today admitted that “data access has not worsened further, yet, but researchers are sounding the alarm in response to Jones’ email.” The news follows months of criticisms lodged against DeSantis over his refusal to immediately implement draconian lockdown orders in the Sunshine State or threaten localities and businesses with harsh penalties in the event of noncompliance. Rather, DeSantis’s response largely focused on securing down nursing homes — something that did not initially occur in New York or Pennsylvania, which instructed personal care facilities to accept stable coronavirus patients. Officials in Florida, however, took swift action, banning entry to nursing homes with few exceptions. “Florida’s approach was to avoid introducing the disease into long-term care facilities,” he said last week. “We drew a firm red line.” Overall, Florida is faring better than its blue state counterparts despite early media criticism. “We understood the outbreak was not uniform throughout the state, and we had a tailored and measured approach that not only helped our numbers be way below what anyone predicted, but also did less damage to our state going forward,” DeSantis said during an April 28 meeting with President Trump. “I had construction going on, the road projects. We did it in a safe way, and we did it. I think, in a way that is probably more sustainable over the long term. So I think people can go back and look at all the criticism and then look now,” he added. Florida, with a population of over 21 million, is currently in the first phase of reopening, allowing salons, restaurants, and gyms to operate at a limited capacity. Florida had 45,684 confirmed cases of the virus and 2,052 related deaths, as of Monday. New York, which has a slightly smaller population of 19 million-plus, reported over 351,371 confirmed cases of the virus and 22,729 deaths as of Monday.

Progressive activists are using cellphone location data to track the movements of anti-lockdown protesters, and are passing on that data to left-wing journalists. A buried lede in a story in the left-wing British newspaper the Guardian reveals the ongoing practice (emphasis ours): Cellphone location data suggests that demonstrators at anti-lockdown protests – some of which have been connected with Covid-19 cases – are often traveling hundreds of miles to events, returning to all parts of their states, and even crossing into neighboring ones. The data, provided to the Guardian by the progressive campaign group the Committee to Protect Medicare, raises the prospect that the protests will play a role in spreading the coronavirus epidemic to areas which have, so far, experienced relatively few infections. What this means is that progressives groups are able to use so-called “anonymized” data to pinpoint the location of attendees of anti-lockdown protesters, many of whom are conservatives. According to the Guardian’s report, progressives were able to obtain the location data via third-party apps that allowed opt-in data collection. The anonymized location data was captured from opt-in cellphone apps, and data scientists at the firm VoteMap used it to determine the movements of devices present at protests in late April and early May in five states: Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Colorado and Florida. Virtually every app downloaded onto your smartphone will ask to collect location data, often without clearly disclosing where that data will be sent. For a list of apps that have access to your location data, as well as options to switch off data-sharing, go to Settings > Privacy > Location Services on Apple iPhones. On Android devices, you can turn off location data for all apps via Settings > Security & Location. To switch off location data for individual Android apps, go to Settings > Apps & Notifications, and then select the app whose location data access you wish to disable. To view the option to disable location data, tap the desired app and then select “permissions.” Allum Bokhari is the senior technology correspondent at Breitbart News.

After weeks of howling that calls for an international investigation of the Wuhan coronavirus were nothing but political dirty tricks intended to scapegoat China for the failure of other governments to manage the pandemic effectively – and effectively declaring economic war on Australia for daring to demand such an investigation – the Chinese delegation to the World Health Assembly (WHA) suddenly decided on Tuesday to co-sponsor a resolution calling for an independent review. The Sydney Morning Herald (SMH) noted that China went to great lengths to demonstrate that it was not giving in to pressure from Australia by co-sponsoring the WHA resolution, even though the resolution largely tracks with demands made by Australia, including language toughened at Australia’s request beyond what the European Union originally wanted: After weeks of high-stakes negotiations, accusations of a Washington-smear campaign and trade strikes on Australia, China’s decision to co-sponsor the resolution means it will pass with full consensus at the meeting of the assembly on Tuesday night. China had opposed Australia’s calls for an independent global inquiry, but has now insisted the motion it will co-sponsor is vastly different to Canberra’s position. The motion was originally put forward by the European Union, but after negotiations with a number of countries, including Australia, it was strengthened to explicitly state the review should be “impartial, independent and comprehensive”. Australia lobbied the United States and the United Kingdom to join the resolution last week. The final text of the key clause establishing an independent review is the same as a second draft published by the EU and backed by Australia on the weekend. The Chinese embassy to Australia sneered that Canberra’s claims to have pushed the WHA, governing body of the World Health Organization (W.H.O.), into investigating both the origins of the Wuhan virus and W.H.O.’s problematic response to the pandemic were a “joke.” “It is a totally different thing from the so-called independent inquiry pushed by the Australian side,” insisted Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, who still has his job after peddling a deranged conspiracy theory that the coronavirus is an American bio-weapon spread to Wuhan by the U.S. Army. The SMH noticed Chinese state media went even further and hailed Chinese support for an independent investigation a “slap in the face to countries like Australia – the most active player in pushing forward a so-called independent probe into China over the coronavirus outbreak, which was then rejected by the international community.” The editorial referenced by the SHM appeared on Tuesday in China’s Global Times, which insisted the inquiry supported by China is “entirely different from the so-called independent inquiry demanded by Australia, and is in fact a review of the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] response in order to draw lessons from it, instead of specially targeting any country based on a presumption of guilt.” The Global Times also cast China’s action at the WHA as a defeat for the United States, which it claims has “also been marginalized and isolated at the WHA.”  The editorial found some “Chinese netizens” with quotable insults directed at the Australians, including one who called them a “giant kangaroo that serves as a dog of the U.S.,” and tossed in some threats at Canberra that it can only end China’s trade war against it by agreeing to “completely abandon politicizing the pandemic.”  In fact, the SMH cited reports that Chinese officials are making lists of more Australian exports they can hit with punitive tariffs, trumped-up investigations, and state-coordinated “consumer boycotts” if the Aussies do not back away from their calls for a relentless probe of the coronavirus. This would suggest the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is confident it has completely hijacked the investigation and can use the W.H.O. once again to parrot its propaganda about noble China’s courageous leadership against the pandemic it bears absolutely no responsibility for spreading, while silencing skeptics like Australia by claiming it gave them the investigation they demanded. Chinese dictator Xi Jinping told the WHA on Monday that although his government has been fully “transparent” all along, he supports an independent investigation of the coronavirus – but not until some future date when the pandemic is completely under control, so China might be able to pull off claiming it supports an investigation while stalling it for months or years.

The number of coronavirus hospitalizations in Georgia is dropping, Gov. Brian Kemp (R) announced on Tuesday. The number of individuals with the coronavirus who are hospitalized in Georgia has dropped, hitting the lowest number since early April. There are currently 986 hospitalized coronavirus patients, which the governor noted is “down 34% since May 1st.” “These numbers are encouraging, but we must remain vigilant in our efforts to fight this virus,” he added: Today marks the lowest number of COVID-19 positive patients hospitalized in Georgia at 986. That’s down 34% since May 1st.  These numbers are encouraging, but we must remain vigilant in our efforts to fight this virus. https://t.co/7uFuMrEyFE https://t.co/f5JRHTfoIK — Governor Brian P. Kemp (@GovKemp) May 19, 2020  “At 986 COVID-19 positive patients currently hospitalized, Georgia has seen an approximate 12% decrease over the last week with 1,125 patients hospitalized on May 12, and a 34% decrease from 1,500 patients hospitalized on May 1,” a release from Kemp’s office titled, “Georgia Marks Lowest COVID-19 Positive Hospitalizations Since Early April” explained. “Our hospitalization numbers continue to show encouraging signs in our fight against COVID-19, but we must remain vigilant in our efforts to combat this virus,” Kemp said in a statement. “I continue to ask Georgians to practice social distancing, follow the advice of public health officials, and protect the elderly and medically fragile,” he stressed. Georgia had 38,721 confirmed cases of the virus and 1,664 deaths as of Tuesday, according to the Georgia Department of Public Health. The department also addressed inconsistencies in reporting, noting that an electronic processing error occurred on May 17 “which inadvertently included 231 serologic test results in the number of positive COVID19 cases.” “This error was corrected, but caused a decrease in positive cases between reporting periods on our dashboard,” the department clarified. “We are working diligently to provide the most accurate information, and we apologize for any confusion.” Kemp has faced heavy criticism for his aggressive approach to reopening the state, allowing many businesses, including gyms and hair and nail salons, to reopen in late-April with certain restrictions in place.

Bishop Gunn singer and guitarist Travis McCready performed in Fort Smith, Arkansas, Monday night in what is being reported as America’s first-ever “socially distance” concert in the era of the deadly Chinese coronavirus. Venue capacity at Temple Live, according to Consequence of Sound, was down from 1,000 people to 200. Concertgoers were kept six feet apart at all times for Monday’s show. Attendees also received temperatures checks upon arrival and patrons was required to wear a mask.    The concert was originally scheduled for May 15th but was cancelled by Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson (R), who said the performance would violate the state’s health guidelines. Governor Hutchinson called for a cease-and-desist order, which forced the concert to be moved to Monday.

President Trump’s administration is readying a public health regulation to more permanently stem the flow of illegal immigration at the United States-Mexico border, Breitbart News has learned. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials have credited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Title 42 with helping to plummet southern border crossings by 84 percent in April and giving Border Patrol agents the authority to return border crossers to their native countries within a matter of hours. A senior DHS official told Breitbart News that an expansion of the CDC’s Title 42 is on its way likely within the next week. The expansion will come in the form of a public health regulation that continues giving federal immigration officials broad power to swiftly detain, process, and return border crossers. The original order was implemented for 30 days and has already been extended for an additional 30 days. DHS officials said this is the first time in U.S. history that the CDC’s Title 42 has been applied to border crossers. In the past, the order has only applied to foreign imports. Last month, less than 16,000 border crossers were apprehended by Border Patrol agents — a 47 percent decrease from the more than 30,000 apprehended in March.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin unveiled a new government debit card at the White House on Tuesday to get coronavirus economic rescue funds to more Americans. “In an effort to expedite money to people even quicker in a very safe way, I’m pleased to show you what a debit card looks like with your name on it Mr. President,” Mnuchin said at a cabinet meeting with the president on Tuesday afternoon. Mnuchin handed the card to President Trump, noting that it did not have any money on it, but that he wanted to show him what it looked like. The debit cards are one more way to deliver funds to Americans, not an additional financial benefit. Mnuchin said that the Treasury Department had delivered over $239 billion in funds to $141 million Americans — through 114 million direct deposits, and 27 million checks. Trump thanked Mnuchin, recalling his long career in the financial business. “There’s nobody better with money and controlling money and handling money,” Trump said.

President Donald Trump ripped House Speaker Nancy Pelosi while visiting Congress on Tuesday after she described the president as “morbidly obese.” The president was asked by reporters to respond to the comment Pelosi made in an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, but he declined. “I don’t respond to her, I think she’s a waste of time,” he said. But he did have additional criticism for the Speaker and the Democrat members of Congress who pushed the Russia “hoax” investigation into his administration. “These people are sick. Pelosi is a sick woman, she’s got a lot of problems, a lot of mental problems,” he said. “We’re dealing with people that have to get their act together for the good of the country.” The president spoke to reporters on Tuesday afternoon after he met with Republican senators at a lunch on Capitol Hill. Trump also defended his decision to take hydroxychloroquine after announcing on Monday that he was taking the drug. “I think it gives you an additional level of safety,” Trump said, calling it “an individual decision to make.” Trump’s announcement drew criticism from Democrats and his critics in the corporate media, who repeatedly cite a lack of medical studies that prove its effectiveness at treating or preventing the virus. But the president has already made up his mind, based on anecdotal evidence. “It’s had a great reputation, and if it were somebody else other than me, people would say, ‘Gee isn’t that smart?'” Trump said.

The White House announced Tuesday a decision to award a $354 million contract to a Virginia pharmaceutical manufacturer to shift drug manufacturing to the United States. The contract was awarded by the federal government’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to Phlow Corp. of Richmond, who released the news Tuesday morning. The initial contract can also be extended after the first four years for up to $812 million. The company will use a continuous chemical process to develop coronavirus drugs in the United States, rather than use ingredients produced overseas. “For far too long, we’ve relied on foreign manufacturing and supply chains for our most important medicines and active pharmaceutical ingredients while placing America’s health, safety, and national security at grave risk,” Director of the White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy Peter Navarro said. Phlow will partner with Civica Rx, Virginia Commonwealth University’s Medicines for All Institute, and AMPAC Fine Chemicals to help develop and produce the medicines. “In the midst of this pandemic, America needs a reliable source of high quality, domestically manufactured, affordable pharmaceuticals and their key ingredients,” said Eric Edwards, MD, PhD, the co-founder, president, and CEO of Phlow. “This advanced manufacturing capability will significantly fortify our nation’s pharmaceutical supply chain for critical medicines, including many required to treat patients hospitalized with COVID-19.” The company will also build the country’s first national stockpile of pharmaceutical ingredients, according to the release, helping the United States survive a future global pandemic. “Years from now, historians will see this innovative project as a defining moment and inflection point for protecting American families — and our country—from current and future public health threats,” Navarro said.

Pennsylvania’s Democrat Governor took a slap at Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger for visiting a barbershop in violation of the state’s coronaviraus lockdown orders. Roethlisberger was seen getting a haircut and beard trim in a video on the Steelers Twitter feed on Monday. But Gov. Tom Wolf was furious that the beautification was done in Pennsylvania and against his lockdown orders. The beard is trimmed… …you know what that means ὄ@_BigBen7 | @TeamJuJu | @JamesConner_ | @Switz pic.twitter.com/YLTtCynK25 — Pittsburgh Steelers (@steelers) May 18, 2020  The barbershop is reportedly located in the Pittsburgh suburb of Sewickley, according to TMZ Sports. The governor pointed out that salons and barbershops in the area have not yet been allowed to re-open. “My concern is just a general concern,” Wolf said on Tuesday in response to the team’s video. “Anybody who puts himself or herself into harm’s way is something that I think we have to try to avoid. “When you go to something like a barbershop and you’re not protected, I don’t care who you are, the chances of that virus actually wreaking havoc on your life increases,” Wolfe fumed. “I don’t personally think any Pennsylvanian ought to take that chance. I certainly don’t want to take that chance myself,” the liberal gov. concluded. The Steelers didn’t expect their video to become controversial. With scenes of the QB tossing a football, it was supposed to highlight the fact that Roethlisberger’s elbow injury is on the mend.

Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) has introduced legislation that will defund states and localities providing American taxpayer-funded coronavirus relief money to illegal aliens. Cotton’s legislation, titled the No Bailouts for Illegal Aliens Act, would prohibit sending additional federal funds to states and localities that issue stimulus checks to illegal aliens. Cotton said in a statement: Congress passed the CARES Act to help workers impacted by the China virus pandemic, not to give a handout to those who broke our immigration laws. The federal government shouldn’t be subsidizing states’ efforts to send cash to illegal aliens. Cotton said the legislation would not affect any Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans provided to companies and nonprofits, nor would it impact unemployment provisions or stimulus checks given to American citizens. This week, thousands of illegal aliens inundated phone lines in California to secure $500 to $1,000 state stimulus checks. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) coronavirus relief package — passed by House Democrats — offers a bailout to businesses hiring illegal aliens over the more than 36 million jobless Americans. Pelosi’s plan bans federal officials from prosecuting businesses that knowingly hire illegal aliens. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter at @JxhnBinder.

A worldwide YouGov survey found that the American media ranks among the lowest in the world when it comes to trust about the coronavirus. Between May 5 and 13, YouGov surveyed 26 countries and asked their citizens, “How much do you trust what each of the following say on the COVID-19 situation?” They were asked about healthcare professionals, friends and family, government, and the media. What the pollster discovered about the American media was not at all surprising. “The media tends to be the least trusted group, and in no country does it rank first or second,” YouGov reports. “Trust in the media is lowest in France (26%) and Britain (31%). Aside from these two countries, fewer than half of people trust the press in Italy, Poland, Sweden, Mexico, and the US.” What’s more, of the 26 countries polled, the media in only five of those 26 countries polled worse than the American media, which landed at about 42 percent trust. The American government only did a little worse at around 41 percent. Friends and family did much better at 71 percent, while health care professionals did the best of all at about 83 percent. People in Mexico (45 percent) and Germany (54 percent), trust their media more than we Americans trust ours. LOL. People in the communist countries of Vietnam (80 percent) and China (62 percent) trust their media more than Americans trust ours. LMAO. Only Poland (38 percent), Sweden (41 percent), Italy (38 percent), the UK (31 percent), and France (26 percent), trust their media less when it comes to the coronavirus than we Americans trust ours. First off, let me congratulate the people of France and the UK, especially those in New Media (like my British colleague and BFF James Delingpole) for the excellent work they’re doing using truth and facts to expose their horrendous establishment media. A 26 percent and 31 percent trust rating is a job well done. Bravo. And while I won’t be satisfied until trust in the American mainstream media hits zero, which is where it belongs, the fact that our awful media is the sixth worse in the civilized world has at least put a little spring in my step, a little wind beneath my wings, a little hoodoo in my voodoo.  It’s good to be a soldier on the winning side of a righteous war. And if you don’t believe the war against the American media is righteous, turn on your TV today, and what you will find are a dozen media corporations spending millions of dollars on mindless propaganda to call our president fatty-fat-fat-fat because he dared to get a prescription from his licensed physician for a medication millions have been taking for decades. And when the media are not screaming fatty-fat-fat at Trump, they’re attempting to justify touching little girls because Joe Biden does. Actually, when you realize that, it’s amazing our media only ranked the 21st worst out of 26. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.

In an exclusive interview with FOX News Channel correspondent Kristin Fisher, Vice President Mike Pence said he was not taking hydroxychloroquine as a preventive measure against coronavirus like President Donald Trump is. When asked if he is taking hydroxychloroquine, Pence said, “I’m not but I would never begrudge any American taking the advice of their physician. hydroxychloroquine is a dug that has been around for more than 40 years for the treatment of malaria. Early in this process the FDA approved what’s called off label use, that physicians could prescribe hydroxychloroquine in terms that they deemed appropriate.” He added, “My physician hasn’t recommended that, but I wouldn’t hesitate to take the council of my doctor.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Lauren Witzke, a Republican candidate who is challenging Democrat Chris Coons for his Senate seat, joined Christians at the Glory City Fellowship Church in Delmar, Delaware, on Sunday in defiance of Democrat Gov. John Carney’s lockdown order that deemed places of worship as non-essential in the coronavirus era. “[Sunday’s] church service at Glory City Fellowship was a successful showing of civil disobedience in response to Delaware’s unconstitutional ban on religious worship,” Witzke told Breitbart News. “Authorities did not try to interfere or stop us from exercising our God-given rights.” “My campaign urges all Americans who want their freedom back to simply take it,” Witzke said.  During the service, Pastor Joy Hill said that Christians need to take a stand. “First and foremost this is a worship service and we have come to worship Jesus Christ, the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords,” Hill said to the about 50 people who attended the service. “It’s not a political service, however sometimes those two worlds come together.” “We have to decide in this time that we are living in, what are we going to do?” Hill said. “You’re here because, number one, you don’t like what is happening in the world around you and you’re here to show some support and to say, ‘I am a believer and I’m going to worship God in my country where I have the freedom to do it.’” “The Witzke campaign, unlike Senator Chris Coons, will not sit idly by while the government deprives Americans of their most basic rights, and we look forward to leading the charge in reopening places of worship and businesses in Delaware and across America,” Witzke told Breitbart News ahead of the service. Witzke’s campaign said that the church service was not disrupted by authorities and took place and concluded peacefully. “Many individuals in our communities rely on churches and ministries for economic help, for counseling, and personal interaction that cannot be achieved via live stream services,” Hill told Breitbart News ahead of the service. “I am not willing to continue to be deprived of my rights or allow the double standards that we are experiencing to continue.” Follow Penny Starr on Twitter

Chinese dictator Xi Jinping promised the world free Chinese coronavirus vaccines, paid for by Beijing, during Monday’s World Health Assembly session. Xi made this vow after years of scandals at home fueled by the corrupt and incompetent manufacturing of much simpler vaccines for diseases such as polio. China’s vaccines are so notorious that state-owned media outlets openly admit Chinese parents prefer foreign-made products. Xi’s regime claims to have cracked down on manufacturers intentionally developing watered-down vaccines that do not produce inoculation after one such company, Changsheng Biotechnology, produced close to one million substandard vaccines, distributed to hundreds of thousands of children in the country. The Changsheng scandal, which resulted in widespread protests, preceded a number of similar cases with other pharmaceutical companies in the country, and evidence suggests Xi directed more potent efforts towards silencing outraged parents than getting faulty vaccines out of Chinese clinics. China’s recent history producing watered-down, dangerous vaccines did not factor into any discussion of a future vaccine for the Chinese coronavirus during the World Health Assembly, conducted virtually this year as a result of the pandemic. The World Health Organization (W.H.O.) instead offered Xi Jinping one of the first available speaking positions on Monday to make his statement unchallenged. “In China, after making painstaking efforts and enormous sacrifice, we have turned the tide on the virus and protected the life and health of our people,” Xi told the W.H.O. audience, failing to mention mounting reports of surges in cases in multiple provinces of China, including Hubei, where the pandemic began. “All along, we have acted with openness, transparency, and responsibility. We have provided information to the W.H.O. and the relevant countries in the most timely fashion,” Xi continued – another statement that did not address the fact that Beijing admitted to destroying early samples of the virus and has launched a campaign to promote the conspiracy theory that the virus originated in America. Xi then announced a Chinese Communist Party healthcare giveaway. “COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] vaccine development and deployment in China, when available, will be made a global public good. This will be China’s contribution to ensuring vaccine accessibility and affordability in developing countries,” Xi said. “China will provide US$2 billion over two years to help with COVID-19 response and with economic and social development in affected countries, especially developing countries. The W.H.O. said on May 15 that 118 potential Chinese coronavirus vaccines exist around the world and eight have entered clinical trials. Half are in China, where at least one firm openly stated it preferred to experiment with its vaccine on foreigners rather than Chinese nationals. China has an advantage in developing the vaccine in that officials destroyed early samples of the vaccine, not offering the rest of the world a chance to study them and observe the natural evolution of the virus as it spread through humanity. Despite this advantage, reports indicate that Washington has found evidence indicating Chinese hackers are trying to steal key research on a vaccine from American scientists, a claim Beijing’s state media outlets have denied. Chinese state media outlets began immediately heralding the move as a sign of “China’s resolution and generosity in serving the international community.” American outlets like Politico, which is in a content partnership deal with the Alibaba-owned South China Morning Post, contrasted the “hope” Xi brought to the table with the allegation that his giveaway offers at the World Health Assembly left President Donald Trump “increasingly isolated.” Few have highlighted the poor development history of Chinese vaccines, and those who did identified the pandemic as a shot a “redemption.” Xi Jinping’s regime would be seeking redemption from multiple scandals, the largest beginning in 2018. That year, adverse effects in children revealed that Changsheng Biotechnology and the state-run Wuhan Institute of Biological Products had sold nearly a million doses of substandard vaccines throughout the country. The vaccines in question were several varieties typically used to inoculate infants and young children and almost all of them were administered to children, Chinese officials said. The vaccines prompted nationwide criticism and protests from infuriated parents, which triggered a censorship action much more formidable than the law enforcement response to the damaged vaccines. The most vocal activists began to disappear in late 2018 and police began shutting down social media groups for parents of affected children. Xi Jinping himself said little of the scandal, merely dismissing it as “vile and shocking” and vowing an “investigation.” Many of Changsheng’s senior officials were, indeed, imprisoned, and the company went bankrupt in November 2019. Long before then, however – in January 2019 – parents in Jiangsu province uncovered another set of faulty vaccines. Unlike the Changsheng scandal, where government officials confirmed that the vaccines were substandard, officials in Jiangsu said the polio vaccines in question were safe after parents of the affected children, who fell ill, independently discovered that the vaccines had expired. Anger at the government at a boiling point, a mob of hundreds of parents in Jiangsu convened at a government health facility and surrounded government officials, beating at least one of them. The incident was caught on video.  China’s reputation on vaccines in its geopolitical neighborhood has suffered tremendously. In 2018, amid the Changsheng scandal, reports began surfacing that North Koreans, stuck in a country with a barely functional healthcare system, were actively avoiding Chinese-made medications. Reporting sympathetically on a new series of vaccine laws in China in January 2020, Sixth Tone, a state-owned outlet, noted that the laws had sent parents scampering to semi-illicit clinics as the supply had reduced dramatically. Many of these parents went to the clinics looking for foreign vaccines. A month later, Chinese Communist Party officials admitted that 29 children in Shijiazhuang, northern China, had received watered-down vaccines at a local health center. The officials blamed not any manufacturer, but a local nurse accused of watering down the vaccines to make them cheaper and keep the difference in price between the functional vaccine and the diluted ones.

New Jersey Democrats remain silent on Gov. Phil Murphy’s (D) decision to put coronavirus patients in nursing homes. During the coronavirus pandemic, Murphy instituted a controversial order to require that New Jersey nursing homes take coronavirus patients. New Jersey Star-Ledger columnist Paul Munshine said that, as of last week, the coronavirus death toll for long-term-care facilities, or nursing homes, was 5,459. “That’s about 53 percent of the states’ total Covid-19 fatalities,” Munshine emphasized. According to recent Kaiser Family Foundation data, New Jersey has the second-highest rate of coronavirus-related deaths in the nation. The rising problem of coronavirus deaths prompted New Jersey state Senate Republicans to call for an investigation into the coronavirus outbreak at New Jersey nursing homes. Munshine asked Murphy if the state had required full screening for nursing home staff members, to which the governor said that it would be required by May 26. He wrote, “May 26? The first big CV-19 outbreak in America was way back in mid-February, at a nursing home in Washington State.” New Jersey Republicans pinned the nursing home death toll solely on Murphy. New Jersey state Sen. Joe Pennacchio said, “He owns it. We were forewarned by Washington State. We were forewarned by Italy when we were told that the disease was ravaging the elderly population with the average age of death being 81.” “I don’t know how this isn’t on Murphy. He’s the governor and he assumed dictatorial powers. He certainly didn’t ask the Legislature,” said New Jersey state Sen. Mike Doherty. “They should have protected the elderly and those who have health conditions instead of imposing a lockdown of the population,” he added. Breitbart News contacted New Jersey’s congressional delegation to see what it thought of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s (D) original decision to force nursing homes to host coronavirus patients. All Democrats, in the House and in the Senate, did not respond to Breitbart News’s request for comment. As congressional Democrats remain silent on the large loss of life in New Jersey nursing homes, state Republicans have called for action. Pennacchio, along with Republican state Sens. Steve Oroho, Declan O’Scanlon, and Kristin Corrado, called on the state Senate to prevent another “tragedy” in New Jersey nursing homes. Pennacchio said: Not only were New Jersey’s long-term care facilities prevented from testing patients for COVID-19 prior to admittance, they actually were ordered by the Murphy Administration to accept patients who were known to have tested positive. It’s shocking that the commissioner didn’t realize her order was tossing a match into dry grass. The wildfire of infection that burned through our long-term care facilities after her order was nothing less than devastating. “The souls of more than 5,400 victims of COVID-19 in our nursing and veteran homes are crying out and their families deserve to know what went wrong,” he added.

Appearing Tuesday on CNN, Dr. Jonathan Reiner, a longtime cardiologist to former Vice President Dick Cheney, speculated that President Donald Trump faces a “15 to 20 percent risk” of dying if he contracted the Chinese coronavirus.  A partial transcript is as follows:  ALISYN CAMEROTA: There are side effects to hydroxychloroquine. You don’t just take this on a lark. I have a friend who took hydroxychloroquine a few years ago because she was going on a trip and would be exposed possibly to malaria and she said it caused the craziest dreams, horrible sleep, and I read that some of the side effects are mood swings. How would that not be affecting the President of the United States’ judgment? There are also psychological consequences or emotional from this drug. DR. JONATHAN REINER: Right, I think the last thing we need is this president to have mood swings. The drug’s most consequential side effect is a malignant cardiac arrhythmia that can kill you. Now, the White House doesn’t really use the kinds of rules that we use out in the community. They have 24-hour access to their patient and they can do things that doctors in the community can’t do. So, they have ways of actually mitigating that risk. I agree with [CNN’s Dr. Sanjay Gupta] completely, this drug is unproven and the data we have suggests it doesn’t work or can be harmful. No one in this country should use it in the manner that the president is using it. The White House medical unit obviously made a calculated decision that they considered his risk of taking the drug lower than his risk of actually contracting the virus. My calculations, I think his risk, based on all the co-morbidities you mentioned in the lead-in, he probably has a 15 to 20 percent risk of dying of this virus should he contract it.

Hollywood star James Woods on Tuesday hit back at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), calling her “morbidly corrupt” after the California Democrat called President Donald Trump “morbidly obese” while criticizing the president’s usage of hydroxychloroquine against the Chinese coronavirus. Morbidly corrupt… pic.twitter.com/HNj6gB5XN3 — James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) May 19, 2020  On Monday, President Trump revealed that he has been taking one anti-malaria tablet for roughly a week. “The frontline workers, many, many of them are taking it. I happen to be taking it, I happen to be taking it. I’m taking it, Hydroxychloroquine. A few weeks ago I started taking it. I think it’s good, I’ve heard a lot of good stories,” the president told reporters at the White House. “I’m not going to get hurt by it. It’s been around for 40 years for malaria, for lupus, for other things. I take it, a lot of frontline workers take it, doctors take it.” Ask if she was concerned with President Trump taking hydroxychloroquine, Pelosi argued the president shouldn’t not be taking the drug because of his weight. “As far as the president is concerned, he’s our president and I would rather he not be taking something that has not been approved by the scientists, especially in his age group and in his, shall we say, weight group — morbidly obese they say,” the speaker told CNN host Anderson Cooper. “So I think it’s not a good idea,” she concluded. Adding zinc to hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin might help the drug combination resolve some COVID-19 symptoms, a study posted online this week said, though experts say the two-drug treatment’s benefit is questionable and carries health risks. The findings breathe new life into a treatment regimen that has been touted by political and business leaders even before the results of clinical trials were in, experts said Wednesday. Studies to date have indicated that the combination offers limited benefits at best, with potentially dangerous side effects. “There is currently no highly effective agent for COVID-19 that we are aware of,” Dr. Joseph O. Rahimian, an infectious disease specialist at New York University Langone Health and co-author of the zinc study, told UPI. “It may end up that optimal treatment will include multiple agents and that zinc may be a part of a treatment ‘cocktail,’” he said. Historically, hydroxychloroquine has been used to treat malaria, while azithromycin is a commonly used antibiotic. Both have been studied in numerous clinical trials since the start of the outbreak of the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. To date, research has yielded mixed results. Last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a warning about “life-threatening” side effects associated with hydroxychloroquine and advised that the drug only be used in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. The UPI contributed to this report. 

The Belmont Stakes will be run June 20 in New York without fans and serve as the opening leg of horse racing’s Triple Crown for the first time in the sport’s history. The New York Racing Association on Tuesday unveiled the rescheduled date for the Belmont, which will also be contested at a shorter distance than usual. The 2020 Belmont will be 1 1/8 miles instead of the 1 1/2-mile “test of the champion” that has been the race’s trademark for almost a century. “The Belmont Stakes is a New York institution that will provide world-class entertainment for sports fans during these challenging times,” NYRA president and CEO Dave O’Rourke said. “While this will certainly be a unique running of this historic race, we are grateful to be able to hold the Belmont Stakes in 2020.” This is the first time the Belmont will lead off the Triple Crown ahead of the Kentucky Derby and Preakness. The Kentucky Derby was moved from May 2 to Sept. 5 and the Preakness from May 16 to Oct. 3 amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Belmont was originally scheduled for June 6. But racing in New York halted in late March after a backstretch worker tested positive for COVID-19, and Gov. Andrew Cuomo didn’t give the green light to resume until Saturday.
Live racing is gradually ramping up operations across North America because tracks feel they can operate safely and still make money without fans on site because of online betting and TV revenue. More than $90 million was wagered off track last year on Belmont day, and NYRA gets a cut of that money along with revenue from NBC. Horse racing officials have grappled with the complexities of a shifted Triple Crown season that doesn’t require the same of 3-year-olds in contention as it has in years past. The Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont are usually run during a six-week span in the spring. “Everything’s going to be different this year, right?” trainer Mark Casse said. “If well-planned out, it can be just as exciting. Why not? I don’t know if it’s necessarily the time of year. It’s just the events, and you’re still going to have great events.” The Belmont is only being run two weeks after it was scheduled, but the shorter distance changes the complexion of the race and the Triple Crown. It has been run at 1 1/2 miles each year dating to 1926 and last ran at 1 1/8 miles in 1894. NYRA said the distance adjustment was made “to properly account for the schedule adjustments to the Triple Crown series and overall calendar for 3-year-olds in training.”
Just 13 horses have won the Triple Crown, most recently Justify in 2018 and American Pharoah in 2015.

Gov. Tom Wolf (D) advised Pennsylvanians against visiting the beach over Memorial Day weekend, warning, “you’re putting yourself at risk.” Wolf, who has faced a slew of criticism from frustrated residents over his slow-paced reopening efforts and refusal to lift the lockdown order on several counties, said during a Monday press conference that he would not engage in the outdoor activity, citing people who “aren’t wearing masks.” “I wouldn’t go to the beach. There are people there who aren’t wearing masks and you’re putting yourself at risk,” he stated. “I wouldn’t do that, I haven’t done that, and I’m not sure why the governors of Maryland and New Jersey have opened their beaches, but they have,” he added. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D) announced last week that he is allowing Jersey Shore beaches to open in time for Memorial Day weekend, with certain restrictions including social distancing and the prohibition contact sports and “organized events.” Similarly, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) has reopened state beaches with restrictions. Outdoor recreation is considered one of the safest activities in the era of the Chinese coronavirus, as many states move to reopen state parks, beaches, and other public places in the first phases of their reopening plans. Philadelphia Health Commissioner Dr. Thomas Farley on Monday also warned against flocking to the beach. “Don’t go to the beach. We’re not recommending people go to the beach this weekend,” he stated. “It is true that being outdoors is probably less risk than being close to people indoors, but if you go into crowds anywhere, there’s risks.”

Tuesday on ABC’s “The View,” co-host Joy Behar questioned if  Rep. Mike Kelly (R-PA) had a “brain” when he said his doctor prescribed him hydroxychloroquine for his bout with the COVID-19 coronavirus. “I thought at first I just had some strain of the flu,” Kelly said. “I didn’t really recognize it as something that I hadn’t had before. My wife though was very aware of it and said you know what, you’re sleeping with two blankets on, you’re still cold, you’re not eating, you have no sense of taste, and when you sleep you’re sleeping like 16 to 18 hours a day, and you’re still tired. Now, fortunately, I didn’t have the respiratory problem, but I got to my doctor in Butler here.” “He very quickly got me tested,” he continued. “I went into the Butler hospital drive-through, got tested. Within 24 hours, they told me, listen, you have the virus, so what we want you to do is stay home, and we’ll prescribe stuff. So a Z-pak which most people use and then the hydroxychloroquine, I took it. So maybe that reduced the effects on me. I didn’t have the respiratory part, which is a real blessing.” Behar replied, “Did you just say that you took the hydroxychloroquine? My sound is a little weird.” “Yes, ma’am,” Kelly said. “Yes, I took it.” “Wow, I can’t believe anybody with a brain would take that stuff, but you seem like an intelligent guy,” Behar said. “You’re a representative in Congress. Why would you take that drug? There are terrible consequences.” “I appreciate that’s your view — that’s not my view, and we’re on ‘The View,'” Kelly said. “But let me say this to you. in my case, I can’t say definitively that’s what cured me, but I can say definitively that I took it and I can say that I went through a period of time that I was sick. I came out of it within about nine days, and then I self-quarantined for another month on top of that. So if you stay within the parameters of what’s the guidance and if you’re smart about what you do, you stay safe, you keep other people safe by staying away from them, I don’t think there’s anything stupid about that. I still think I’m a relatively pretty intelligent guy. But I don’t tell anybody there’s a one size fits all. I say go to the doctors that you have faith in, listen to what they say. If your doctor says don’t take it, then don’t take it. My doctor thought you know what, we have something that we think could possibly work and give it to you.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

The office of Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen announced on Monday that information security services are investigating a suspected cyberattack.  The hackers apparently stole some files from the presidential office and leaked them to the media after they were “doctored” to create political embarrassment for the president. The incident comes as relations between Taiwan and Communist China, which is notorious for its aggressive cyber espionage, are growing steadily worse amid political fallout from the Wuhan coronavirus epidemic. The South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported that a series of four emails were sent from an account called “tsailoser” to local media outlets, containing a set of 11 files that “claimed to detail the infighting and power struggles between Tsai and her confidants.” The SCMP described the contents of the leaked files as “minutes from a meeting to discuss cabinet appointments, details of a potential power play between Tsai and Premier Su Tseng-chang and the strategy adopted by Tsai to defeat former premier William Lai during the Democratic Progressive Party’s presidential primaries last year.” One of the files is reportedly a detailed political assessment of Tsai’s opponent in the DPP primary last year, William Lai. Detailed assessments of politicians are rarely flattering, and an unflattering profile of Lai could cause trouble in the second Tsai administration because he ended up as her running mate and is now vice president. “We have already reported the case to the Criminal Investigation Bureau,” presidential spokesman Alex Huang said.  Members of Tsai’s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) accused Beijing of masterminding the attack with an eye toward disrupting Tsai’s formal inauguration into her second term, which she won by a landslide in January. “Cyberattacks are a kind of information war and President Tsai must demand that the information security department steps up efforts to prevent hackers from hacking into the government system and fabricating information to affect our national security,” said DPP lawmaker Hsu Chih-chieh, who joined several other legislators in wondering how the hackers gained access to the heavily-protected presidential computer system and speculating that it might have been an inside job. Wu Sz-huai, a legislator from the Beijing-friendly Kuomintang opposition party, on Tuesday argued that the leak was more likely the work of a disgruntled presidential employee than Chinese state hackers.  Wu’s defense of China, as summarized by Taiwan News, simultaneously claimed the Communist country would not use cyber-espionage to advance a political narrative and advanced precisely the political narrative the hackers intended, namely that Tsai’s office and party are riven by power struggles and use dirty tricks to defeat their opponents: Wu said that the leaked documents sent to the media likely pointed to a power struggle among the ruling Democratic Progressive Party’s factions, given the leak’s discussions about how to deter President Tsai Ing-wen’s rival William Lai in the 2019 party primary and matters related to personnel decisions in the new term, instead of the defense and diplomatic intelligence preferred by Chinese hackers. Also, Chinese or other state hackers would never wish to draw attention to their intrusions, as they would aim to leave the door open for continued re-entry. He also pointed out that the office building’s intranet has been disconnected from the internet for years, adding that there are defenses which protect information from cyberattacks. Wu considered the leak more likely to have been committed by people with access to the intranet, who disagree with the power plays and new appointments, and wish to expose a crisis in Tsai’s government. Chinese state hackers do have a preference for stealing valuable intellectual property and military secrets, but they hardly confine their efforts to such targets exclusively, and while all skilled hackers prefer to linger undetected in compromised systems for as long as possible, they do not always wait until they have been spotted by security forces before selling or utilizing stolen data. In this case, the rapid deterioration of already poor relations between Taiwan and China after Tsai’s re-election and the coronavirus pandemic could have inspired Beijing to make quick use of pilfered documents to weaken the Taiwanese president. The Kuomintang party announced on Tuesday that its representatives will refuse to approve DPP nominees for the second Tsai administration until the hacking incident has been investigated to their satisfaction. Kuomintang representatives said the documents leaked in the hack, if genuine, exposed an “appalling” degree of presidential infringement upon independent agencies, and suggested the “hack” might actually have been a deliberate leak staged by members of Tsai’s own party who are jockeying for power in the new administration. Taiwan News pointed out that some of the leaked documents pertain to Tsai’s reshuffling of her cabinet for her second term, appearing to show “Tsai favors certain candidates in her camp and hints at a possible power play between herself and Premier Su Tseng-chang, who will retain his post during Tsai’s second term.” Such rumors of intrigue would only be effective at damaging Tsai if leaked very quickly, while the cabinet changes are a big story in Taiwan. Enoch Wu, a former member of Taiwan’s National Security Council, said on Sunday that Taiwanese government systems have been breached by hackers far more often than the public realizes. Wu attributed the government’s weak cyber defenses to over-reliance on third party security consultants and poor security practices by government officials, including a tendency to copy secure documents onto insecure personal devices so they can work outside of their offices. “Every time a data breach occurs, each agency seeks external help to ‘clean up’ office desktops and network servers and that’s the end, while it needs to be addressed properly to avoid the attacks from happening again and again,” he said.

The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) alleged that U.S. President Donald Trump’s remarks on U.S. vaccine development for the Wuhan coronavirus may indicate that the virus originated in America, according to a report Sunday by the CCP propaganda newspaper Global Times. At a White House press conference on May 15, President Trump described the U.S. effort to work toward a Wuhan coronavirus vaccine: Scientists at the NIH [National Institutes of Health] began developing the first vaccine candidate on January 11th … within hours of the virus’s genetic code being posted online … Then, my administration cut through every piece of red tape to achieve the fastest-ever, by far, launch of a vaccine trial for this new virus, this very vicious virus.  And I want to thank all of the doctors and scientists and researchers involved because they’ve never moved like this, or never even close. The CCP latched onto this statement over the weekend, arguing the president’s stated timeline was not possible if the virus originated in China, as the development process of a vaccine could not possibly have begun that early, on January 11. “Trump said that scientists at the U.S. National Institutes of Health [NIH] began developing the first vaccine candidate on January 11, while on January 12 Beijing time, China first shared the genome sequence information of the new coronavirus with the World Health Organization [W.H.O.]. January 11 is one or two months earlier than the February-March initial reported outbreak in the U.S. and 10 days earlier than the first confirmed coronavirus case reported in the U.S. on January 21,” the article claimed. Much of January 12 Beijing time would have still been January 11 in the Western Hemisphere, a fact omitted in the report. “Unless the U.S. had patients contracted with the coronavirus beforehand or had strains of the virus in hand, there was no possibility that within hours of the virus genetic code being posted online that the U.S. had already started vaccine candidate development,” the report claimed, implying that the U.S. had hidden knowledge of and may have possessed samples of the Wuhan coronavirus prior to January 11. Statements released by both the NIH and the private industry vaccine developers it has been collaborating with, such as Moderna, support the president’s statement that researchers “began developing” the work toward the vaccine on January 11. In March, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) published a report indicating that Wuhan authorities documented the city’s first coronavirus case as early as November 17, 2019. The journalists cited unreleased government data reviewed by the newspaper. This contradicts China’s own coronavirus timeline, as CCP authorities claim they notified the W.H.O. about their first known coronavirus case on December 8. As early as January 1, Wuhan police arrested local residents for sharing information online about the coronavirus, such as advice on how to avoid getting sick. This indicates both that the coronavirus outbreak was well established by then and that authorities were already attempting to suppress information about the virus as early as late December 2019. On May 15, the Chinese National Health Commission confirmed that Chinese health officials destroyed early samples of the Wuhan coronavirus. This was done to “prevent the risk to laboratory biological safety and prevent secondary disasters caused by unidentified pathogens” according to commission official Liu Dengfeng. Some observers, who long suspected the CCP had compromised early coronavirus samples, believe the action was taken to prevent confirmation of human-to-human transmission for as long as possible, information which the CCP infamously waited to disclose to the public. At a G20 summit in March, CCP party leader Xi Jinping said that China hoped to capitalize off of the Wuhan coronavirus by monopolizing vaccine development, proposing a “global network of control and treatment” led by China. Xi urged all nations to “pool” their medical data into this network, allowing the CCP full access to the source of intellectual property and virus manufacturing knowledge. Xi added that China would generously offer any coronavirus vaccine it develops to the public for free. According to a report shared by Chinese state media on Monday, “American politicians continue to concoct and fuel conspiracy theories of COVID-19 [Wuhan coronavirus].” On the same day, China claimed that America “deliberately concealed its knowledge of the impending epidemic.” Prior to that report, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian promoted a CCP conspiracy theory that the Wuhan coronavirus began in an American laboratory and was propagated by the U.S. Army. “[I]t might be the U.S. Army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan,” Zhao tweeted in March. Backing up Zhao’s tweet, Chinese state media published a report shortly afterward identifying a U.S. Army laboratory in Maryland that closed last summer, alleging that this indicated that the facility may have leaked the coronavirus to the American population earlier than officially documented. On May 8, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying elaborated on this conspiracy theory, alleging that the lab, Fort Detrick, was responsible for a spate of coronavirus deaths in the area last summer that U.S. authorities disguised as electronic cigarette-related deaths. “There are also reports that soon after the closure [of the Fort Detrick laboratory], ‘E-cigarette disease’ broke out in the surroundings,” Hua stated at a press conference. The CCP attempted to support this conspiracy theory over the weekend when it alleged that the U.S. had early knowledge of the virus, even possessed samples of the virus, prior to January 11. The May 14 report cited supposed “Chinese military experts” as encouraging China’s ally, Russia, to join Beijing in demanding an international investigation into the Wuhan coronavirus’s alleged origin in the U.S. This report was published a few days before at least 116 member nations of the World Health Assembly (W.H.A.) – the W.H.O.’s decision-making body – called for an independent inquiry into the origins of the Wuhan coronavirus and of the W.H.O.’s response to the pandemic. The W.H.O.’s mishandling of the coronavirus outbreak has been criticized by most nations and has led many to believe it was designed to aid the CCP in its cover-up of the virus’s initial outbreak in the city of Wuhan in late 2019. On Monday, President Trump once again commented on the American development of a Wuhan coronavirus vaccine, this time to praise Moderna as it announced the successful preliminary trials of its vaccine. “It’s incredible what they can do, and I’ve seen results and the results are staggeringly good,” the president affirmed.

Appearing Tuesday on MSNBC, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) attempted to dismiss growing accusations that his administration failed to protect nursing home residents during the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, asserting: “We did everything we could” and did not skip any “precautions.”  A partial transcript is as follows:  STEPHANIE RUHLE: You have been criticized for your comments about nursing homes. Some people say you did not act quickly enough, too little, too late. What is your response to that criticism? GOV. ANDREW CUOMO: I’m getting criticized now for doing too much. I have the strongest national provisions in place where staff of nursing homes must be tested twice per week, and the nursing homes are upset that this is too burdensome for them to do it. I understand that it’s burdensome. I understand it’s the most aggressive in the nation, but I also understand that this is the most vulnerable population in the most vulnerable place. We will have lost many Americans in this, but the only solace we’re going to be to take is we can say we did everything we could, and we didn’t lose anyone for want of medical care, precautions, etcetera. Yes, they’re unhappy that I’m saying two tests a week for staff, but I want to make sure every one of us can say we did everything that we could.

In Malakassa, Greece, local politicians and residents have criticised a move to house over 3,000 migrants in a camp next to the village of just 514 residents. The Greek government has placed over 2,000 migrants in the camp in Malakassa since March in what NGO Human Rights Watch labelled as “unsanitary and cramped conditions” and within another structure built for deportation, housing 1,180 migrants. According to the Municipality of Oropos where Malakassa is located, the original plans put forward in 2016 stated that only 400 migrants would be housed at the facility, newspaper Proto Thema reports. “Today, in violation of the agreement of the original request and despite the protests of the municipal authority, their number reaches 2,200,” the local council of Malakassa stated. “In addition, on March 15th, 2020, amid a ban on the uncontrolled movement of citizens due to coronavirus, the second structure was set up within the same camp to accommodate migrants for deportation,” they added and claimed it had been built despite protest from local officials and citizens. Turkey: Migrants Will Return to Border After Coronavirus Outbreak Ends https://t.co/GgmAVC19Cv — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 31, 2020  On the island of Chios, 1,044 citizens and local business owners sent letters to oppose the rental of a property by the Department of Immigration and Asylum to be used to temporarily house migrants for public health reasons due to the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus. Greek officials and others have previously expressed fears that Turkey may send migrants with coronavirus to Greece. Last week it was confirmed that several migrants who landed on the island of Lesbos earlier this month had the virus. Greece has continued to warn that a new wave of migrants from Turkey could be coming to the Greek border soon. Turkish Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu has also previously stated that once the coronavirus outbreak ends, he expected migrants would return to the Greek border. “When the coronavirus pandemic is over, we are not going to deter any immigrants who want to return to the Greek-Turkish border in Pazar,” Soyilu said.

Tech giant Google temporarily suspended a popular podcast app from the Google Play Store over the weekend for cataloging Chinese virus-related content. The app didn’t seek out or highlight podcasts on the Wuhan coronavirus, but merely offered all public podcasts like any other podcast app. Google reversed its decision today. The Verge reports that the popular Android podcast app, Podcast Addict, that has millions of users was suspended for listing coronavirus-related content. The creator of the app, Xavier Guiellemane, stated that Google suspended and removed the ads from his nine-year-old app for violating a new policy for developers requiring any app with a reference to the Wuhan coronavirus to be “published, commissioned, or authorized by official government entities or public health organizations.” Guillemane’s app catalogs public podcast RSS feeds which he is not in control of. This content includes news shows, talk shows, comedy podcasts, and a variety of other programming that mentions the coronavirus. Guillemane stated that Google told him that he needed to address this problem and then republish the app under a different name in order for it to be reinstated. The app is free and Guillemane relies on ads to make money, so with the app suspended the developer has lost his income. “This is the way I’m making my living, and already because of the current situation, our revenue has been really bad for the past few months,” Guillemane stated. Google informed Guillemane that it could take up to seven days before he hears any update on his suspension appeal. “It’s not easy to be at the mercy of just some algorithm banishing the application,” Guillemane stated. Here's the notification I got this morning… pic.twitter.com/UJF20ZnaPw — Podcast Addict (@PodcastAddict) May 16, 2020  Users that have already downloaded the app can still access it but are unable to redownload. New users will not be able to find the app on Google Play. Even if Guillemane somehow managed to alter the app and remove all coronavirus related content he would still have to publish the app under a new name, losing the ratings and downloads that Podcast Addict has built up over the course of years. Google reversed the suspension on Tuesday, as tweeted by the Podcast Addict account. Podcast Addict is back on the Play Store!

The number of people claiming unemployment benefits in the United Kingdom rose by 856,500 during the first month of the national coronavirus lockdown. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that the number of claims rose by a record 69 per cent in April, reaching 2.1 million in total. In response to the dire economic numbers, the deputy national statistician for economic statistics at the ONS, Jonathan Athow, said: “While only covering the first weeks of restrictions, our figures show Covid-19 is having a major impact on the labour market.” “In March employment held up well, as furloughed workers still count as employed, but hours worked fell sharply in late March, especially in sectors such as hospitality and construction,” he added. “Through April, though, there were signs of falling employment as real-time tax data show the number of employees on companies’ payrolls fell noticeably, and vacancies were sharply down too, with hospitality again falling steepest,” Mr Athow warned. Over the weekend, the Bank of England’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, said that the UK is facing levels of unemployment not seen since the 1980s. The number of unemployment claims reveals only a fraction of the scale of the economic crisis, as it does not include those who do not qualify for government assistance or those taking advantage of the government’s employment furlough scheme, probably over seven and a half million people. “Add all that and you’ve got anywhere between a third and a half of the workforce either unemployed, underemployed or working shorter hours, and at least some of them might have a fearfulness about future incomes and about their jobs,” Mr Haldane said. Coronavirus Lockdown: UK Economy Could Shrink 35% This Quarter, World Facing New Great Depression https://t.co/oCNf07dmz4 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 15, 2020  The release of the economic figures comes as a study conducted by the CIPD professional body for HR and the recruitment group Adecco found that over one-fifth of all British businesses are planning to lay off workers in the coming months. Many more companies are reporting hiring freezes and pay cuts to deal with the economic collapse. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) also warned that there is little possibility that the British economy will be able to bounce back this year. The OBR previously stated that the British economy could see a steep decline, by as much as 35 per cent, before recovering in what it is referred to as a ‘V-Shape’ recovery. OBR chairman Robert Chote said that it is now likely that the UK will face a permanent “scaring” to the economy and will “certainly” lead to higher levels of debt. Last week, it was reported that the Treasury Department is projecting under the best case scenario the government will face a £337 billion budget deficit this year, up from the £55 billion that was expected before the crisis. The government said that the deficit could rise to as much as £516 billion with a five-year budget hit of £1.19 trillion, and is considering massive tax hikes to make up for the shortfall, a move that would break the Conservative Party’s 2019 manifesto, as well as possibly prolonging the recession.

The University of Notre Dame announced on Monday that the fall semester will begin on campus on August 10 and conclude before Thanksgiving. The university claims that it will utilize contact tracing, social distancing rules, and mask requirements to mitigate the spread of the Chinese virus on campus. According to a press release, the University of Notre Dame will begin the fall semester on campus on August 10. The fall term, which will conclude before Thanksgiving, will forego the traditional fall break that occurs in October to expedite the semester. The press release notes that the university will utilize a variety of precautionary tools including contact tracing, quarantine protocols, and mask requirements. Additionally, the university suggested that it will conduct “enhanced” campus cleanings. “By far the most complex challenge before us is the return of our students to campus for the resumption of classes in the fall semester,” Notre Dame President Fr. John Jenkins wrote in a statement. “Bringing our students back is in effect assembling a small city of people from many parts of the nation and the world, who may bring with them pathogens to which they have been exposed. We recognize the challenge, but we believe it is one we can meet.” “As we adapt to the new normal brought on by the coronavirus, we will do everything we can to provide you with a safe learning, research and working environment,” Father Jenkins added. Purdue University, North Carolina State, Brown University, and Michigan State have also announced plans to reopen their campus for the fall semester. Breitbart News reported last week that the California State University system will keep its 23 campuses closed for the fall semester. “Our university, when open without restrictions and fully in person, as is the traditional norm of the past, is a place where over 500,000 people come together in close and vibrant proximity with each other on a daily basis,” Cal State Chancellor Timothy P. White said. “That approach, sadly, just isn’t in the cards now.” Breitbart News reported in April that Boston University may keep its campus closed for the remainder of the calendar year. Stay tuned to Breitbart News for more updates on this story.

Tuesday on NBC’s “Today 3rd Hour,” Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI) denied the lockdown protests impacted her decision to reopen regions of her state. Whitmer said, “I worked with the coalition of public health experts and business leaders. We assess risk inherent to different sectors of our economy and different parts of our state. We know that our greatest strengths are the ability to test, the ability to trace, and the ability to isolate. Where we can do that, we can safely start some additional reengagement.” Host Craig Melvin asked, “There have been a number of vocal protests there in your state capital. Some Republican lawmakers are still suing you over the stay-at-home order saying that you went too far with the executive order. How much did the pressure play into the decision to reopen parts of the state?” Whitmer said, “None. I’m not going to succumb to political pressure or political demonstrations or social media pressure. The fact of the matter is we have to listen to our epidemiologists, experts in our phenomenal research universities and Michigan. We are talking with international experts as well. We’re going to stay tethered to the data, follow the science, and we’ve got to get this right. Anything else puts people in jeopardy, and I’m not willing to do that.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

The majority of registered voters in battleground states agree that China poses a military and economic threat to the United States, according to a poll published Tuesday. The poll, conducted April 20–May 2, 2020, by CRC Advisors, showed that 59 percent of those surveyed said they agreed that China poses a military threat to the United States, versus 26 percent who disagreed. It also showed that nearly three-fourths, 74 percent, said they agreed that China poses an economic threat to the United States, versus 14 percent who disagreed. The poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters in battleground states, including Arizona, Florida, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. It had a ±3.1 percent overall margin of error. Anti-Chinese government sentiment has risen in the United States after it failed to contain the outbreak of a coronavirus pandemic in Wuhan, China, in December. Chinese officials destroyed early evidence of the virus and tried to censor doctors warning of its severity or publishing research about its origins. China first informed the World Health Organization about the virus in late December but insisted that it could not be spread through human transmission until mid-January. Around that time, the first person discovered with coronavirus arrived in the United States from Wuhan. China has tried to deflect blame for the virus and its officials have pushed conspiracies that the U.S. Army brought it to China. But even before the pandemic, there has been growing concern in the U.S. about China’s plan to replace the United States as the world’s leading superpower by 2050. China has launched a number of initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to build trade routes from China to Europe, and China 2025, which aims to dominate key technology industries and control the future of 5G communications and manufacturing. Meanwhile, China has militarized islands in the South China Sea, an important sea route for global shipping. The coronavirus pandemic has exposed the extent to which the U.S. relies on China for critical supplies and certain drug ingredients. The poll also said 78 percent of registered voters agree with moving manufacturing out of China to reduce U.S. dependency on the nation. Republicans have launched a task force to address the threat from China. Democrats had signed on to the effort early but pulled their participation out of fear that focus on China would mean less blame on Trump for the pandemic.

The democratic government of Taiwan announced on Tuesday its twelfth day of no new Chinese coronavirus cases in the country and thirty-seventh day since identifying a documented domestic case. Despite its proximity to the virus’s country of origin, China; its dense population; and widespread travel during the Lunar New Year holiday in late January, Taiwan has largely managed to curb the spread of the disease. Health Minister Chen Shih-chung said at his daily briefing on Tuesday that Taiwan is now largely focusing on vaccine development and restoring normalcy in daily life, though he encouraged heightened awareness of maintaining good hygiene to prevent a resurgence of cases. Chen appeared optimistic about vaccines, stating that ten vaccines in development have already entered clinical trials globally. Taiwan’s Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) affirmed that the last domestic case recorded on the island occurred on April 12. The local outlet Focus Taiwan noted that even among the hundreds of documented cases in Taiwan, only 55 of them have been identified as “local infections.” “Since the outbreak of COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] late last year, Taiwan has recorded 440 cases, 349 of which have been classified as imported and 55 as local infections, according to CECC statistics,” Focus Taiwan noted. “The other 36 cases are a cluster infection on a Navy vessel that returned April 9 from a Pacific goodwill mission. Those cases have not yet been classified as either local or imported.” Taiwan has documented seven deaths. Taiwan is home to nearly 24 million people. In comparison, nations with similar populations include Niger (55 deaths), Australia (100 deaths), Romania (1,126 deaths), and Chile (478 deaths). The positive news will result in increasingly opening public venues in the most densely populated parts of the country. Channel News Asia reported on Monday that the Taipei local government is planning to enter a second phase of reopening on May 25 that will see the restoration of services at public assembly halls and other facilities, including a city childcare center. The public venues will have to confirm with limited capacity demands and document closely the people coming in and out of the venues to facilitate contact tracing. These venues will join already ongoing activities, such as Taiwan’s baseball league season, which began last month. Observers have largely attributed Taiwan’s success to early action in the face of intelligence suggesting a contagious respiratory illness in China. Following the SARS coronavirus outbreak in 2003, the Taiwanese government developed an agency specifically to address epidemics called the National Health Command Center (NHCC), which centralized both public health and intelligence operations to ensure a streamlined response. This time around, Taiwan also counted on having an epidemiologist as vice president, Chen Chien-jen, who had served as the nation’s health minister during the SARS epidemic. Taiwan’s success in combatting the virus is particularly notable given its exclusion from the World Health Organization (W.H.O.). The W.H.O., a United Nations agency, bans Taiwan from membership and has not allowed it to participate in its annual meeting, the World Health Assembly, since the election of President Tsai Ing-wen in 2016. Tsai will begin her second term in office on Tuesday. The World Health Assembly began on Monday without Taiwan, despite a large number of member countries urging Taipei’s inclusion. Responding to demands to include Taiwan, W.H.O. officials claimed last week that they did not have the power to extend the invitation because there was no consensus around inviting the country. China is the only country to vocally oppose Taiwan being granted observer status in the agency, threatening “non-peaceful” measures to keep it out last week. The agency tabled any discussion on Taiwan’s status during this year’s meeting. “We won’t be sharing the Taiwan model at the conference, which is the WHO’s loss, but also means we can’t learn from the experiences of other countries,” Chen, Taiwan’s health minister, said on Monday. “We must express our strong dissatisfaction, protest and regret.” Tsai also personally lamented the move, implying that it showed a lack of “professionalism” on the part of the U.N. organization. I regret that @WHO has once again excluded #Taiwan from international dialogue for political reasons. Politics should never override professionalism, & no amount of pressure will stop us from continuing to fight #COVID19 & contribute to global health. #TaiwanIsHelping pic.twitter.com/aUwTyclDLq — 蔡英文 Tsai Ing-wen (@iingwen) May 19, 2020  Speaking on Monday at the World Health Assembly on behalf of the United States, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar called Taiwan a “critical” partner in fighting the Chinese coronavirus and excoriated the W.H.O. for its poor performance against the pandemic. “We must be frank about one of the primary reasons this outbreak spun out of control: there was a failure by this organization to obtain the information that the world needed. And that failure cost many lives,” Azar said, accusing the W.H.O. of having “made a mockery of their transparency obligations, with tremendous costs for the entire world.” “This cannot ever happen again. The status quo is intolerable,” Azar affirmed. Taiwan’s coronavirus experience could be pivotal in containing the pandemic. Taiwanese officials were aware of the Chinese coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, where the virus originated, as early as December 2019. That month, Taipei sent a letter to the W.H.O. detailing that the island had begun isolating patients with a respiratory infection from China. The W.H.O. ignored Taiwan’s warnings and claimed publicly that the Chinese coronavirus was not transmissible from human to human as late as January. Taiwanese officials confirmed in January that the W.H.O. had turned down 70 percent of its requests for meetings regarding the crisis. W.H.O. Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who is not a medical doctor, responded to Taipei making public the fact that its warnings in December were ignored by accusing the Taiwanese government of racism. “Abuses, or racist comments, giving me names, black or Negro. … Three months ago, this attack came from Taiwan. We need to be honest. I will be straight today. From Taiwan. And Taiwan, the Foreign Ministry also, they know the campaign,” Tedros said in April, offering no evidence to support his claims. Taiwanese officials vehemently denied the insults and Tsai invited Tedros to visit Taiwan and see for himself if her people were racist. Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.

MIAMI (AP) — The Miami Marlins will allow players on their 40-man roster access to their spring training complex to pitch off a mound or hit in batting cages beginning Tuesday, a person familiar with the decision told The Associated Press. The person confirmed the decision to the AP on condition of anonymity Monday because the Marlins made no announcement. The rest of the complex in Jupiter, Florida, will remain closed, the person said.
The optional workouts will be individual, with a staff member present, and those involved will abide by social distancing guidelines, the person said. Major League Baseball is considering proposed methods to salvage a season delayed by the coronavirus pandemic. Plans have been formulated to possibly start the season in early July.

The Migration Watch think tank and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage have warned that a new Immigration Bill sold to the public as bringing migration under control could actually increase arrivals, by lowering barriers to entry. “Our population has risen by over six million since 2001 and 80 per cent of that is down to immigration. I do not believe a rapidly rising population improves our quality of life,” Farage observed on his LBC Radio show. Although Boris Johnson concerned migration sceptics early on by dropping a long-standing Tory promise — never kept — to reduce net immigration “from the hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands” and flirting with an illegal migrant amnesty, much has been made of his new Immigration Bill, fronted by Home Secretary Priti Patel, and how it will, finally, get Britain out of the EU Free Movement of People regime. The Immigration Bill has certainly been treated as if it would seal the national frontiers by Britain’s pro-open borders left — but migration sceptics such as Farage, wary of Johnson’s pro-immigration sensibilities, have noticed that it introduced a number of changes which could actually see migrant numbers rise. “They’ve set the barriers for educational ability and income earning potential so low that actually numbers coming into the UK could increase, not decrease as a result of this and then we have to question their competence,” the Brexit Party leader warned. He also highlighted the Home Office’s ongoing failure to stop illegal migrants crossing the English Channel from safe, first world France in record numbers as an ill omen, asking: “If Priti Patel can’t get a grip on what’s happening in the English Channel, how can we trust her to put a completely brand new immigration system into place?” 'Beginning of an Invasion' – UK Boat Migrant Influx Hits New Record https://t.co/2hlpa39ZE7 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 10, 2020  The respected Migration Watch UK think tank founded by Lord Green of Deddington has also raised substantial concerns with Breitbart London about the Immigration Bill in a press release and further explanatory comments. “The government have acknowledged what we have been saying for months – their immigration proposals may well drive an increase in immigration,” they said, in reference to official research which indicates that the Immigration Bill “could lead to non-EU worker numbers (along with their dependants) going up by between 25,000-50,000 per year and students numbers going up (net) by 20,000-25,000 per year.” The research is also clear that the new policies may “offer greater opportunities to employers looking to source skilled labour from outside the UK and EEA” — while dropping the already not particularly rigorous requirement for bosses to try and recruit British workers before seeking cheap foreign labour. “This is absolutely not the time to be opening six million jobs to new or increased international competition,” commented Migration Watch chairman Alp Mehment, in reference to the mass unemployment caused by the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. “It is simply wrong that jobs should no longer have to be advertised in the UK before being opened up to recruits from around the globe,” he added. Brexit: Supermarket Boss Admits EU Migration Used to Keep Wages Down https://t.co/O2d93WEptx — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 11, 2019  “Ministers and MPs must remember that, following the 2008 financial crisis, it took six years for the number of UK-born workers to regain its pre-crash level, while the number of workers born abroad increased by more than a million as employers sought out cheaper overseas labour,” the think tank noted in its press release, stressing the importance of ensuring this pattern is not repeated post-coronavirus. Migration Watch also highlighted multiple “new avenues” for migrants which the Immigration Bill will create to Breitbart London, including opportunities for foreign workers to take medium-skilled roles “at a lower salary, with no cap and no resident labour market test” and opportunities for foreign students to stay on for two years after graduation. “Don’t be fooled by the government’s proposed Immigration Bill,” cautioned Ben Harris-Quinney, who leads the conservative Bow Group think tank, in a separate warning. “It LOWERS the earning threshold for immigrants by £10,000 [and] sets no limit or cap target on immigration (previously 99,000 net). It won’t reduce immigration.” Nevertheless, the bill passed its second reading in the House of Commons last night.

New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D) on Monday stated the people of his state cannot “firmly enter the new normal” until a coronavirus vaccine is developed and available — something some experts warn may never come to fruition. “Until a proven vaccine is widely available, we cannot firmly enter the ‘new normal,’ when life will once again return to all our workplaces, downtowns, and main streets,” Murphy said in a social media post: Until a proven vaccine is widely available, we cannot firmly enter the “new normal,” when life will once again return to all our workplaces, downtowns, and main streets. Posted by Governor Phil Murphy on Monday, May 18, 2020 Murphy outlined the multi-stage approach to slowly reopen the Garden State, stating the people of New Jersey have successfully flattened the curve of coronavirus cases and adding the state is now “well-positioned to continue our restart and recovery process.” “Our multi-stage approach uses science, data, and facts to determine which businesses and activities can reopen according to their risk level and challenges they face to safeguard public health,” he said. New Jersey remains in first stage, which relaxes restrictions on low-risk activities, such as outdoor activities including batting cages, golf driving ranges, shooting ranges, and horseback riding. All of those, per Executive Order 147, will be able to resume Friday, May 22 at 6:00 a.m. The first phase also allows some nonessential retail to reopen with modifications. Stage two is a bit more aggressive, opening up “safeguarded restaurants with outdoor seating, limited personal care, and possibly indoor dining, museums, and libraries, all with significantly reduced capacity”: Today, as part of our Road Back, I unveiled a multi-stage approach to execute a responsible restart of our economy,… Posted by Governor Phil Murphy on Monday, May 18, 2020 Nevertheless, as Murphy’s social media update indicated, the governor does not believe New Jersey can firmly enter a “new normal” until a vaccine for the novel coronavirus is available. While researchers are working on a vaccine for the virus, skeptics warn there is no guarantee that an effective vaccine will be developed, as no vaccine for other forms of coronavirus have ever been approved. Murphy’s remark follows a similar view expressed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), who told Californians this month that they are also not going “back to normal” without a vaccine. “We’re not going back to normal,” he said during a a May 5 press briefing. “It’s a new normal with adaptations and modifications, until we get to immunity and a vaccine.” While President Trump has remained optimistic on the development of a vaccine, he sent a pointed message to the world during last week’s press conference in the Rose Garden. “I just want to make something clear: it’s very important, vaccine or no vaccine, we’re back,” Trump said.

Mexican health officials are only reporting one third of the deaths in Mexico City from the Coronavirus (COVID-19), according to a new report. The revelation comes as the nation surpasses China’s official figures. During the daily news conference, Undersecretary of Health Hugo Lopez Gatell revealed that Mexico had a total of 5,332 fatalities and 51,633 confirmed cases. Lopez Gatell has admitted that his figures only show the cases from government hospitals. Al 18 de mayo de 2020 hay 51,633 casos confirmados, 11,300 confirmados activos y 26,933 sospechosos por #COVID19. Se han registrado 98,567 negativos, 5,332 defunciones confirmadas, 656 defunciones sospechosas y fueron estudiadas 177,133 personas. 1/3 pic.twitter.com/fRSB2KY2wx — Hugo López-Gatell Ramírez (@HLGatell) May 19, 2020  Despite the rising statistics, a new report from Mexicanos Contra la Corrupcion y la Impunidad (MCCI) says that in Mexico City alone, officials recorded 4,577 fatalities that list Coronavirus as a potential cause. But the most recent federal stats for Mexico City place the death toll at 1,381. The report comes as Mexican health officials are accused of doctoring statistics to show a lower number of cases and deaths. For their report, MCCI tracked down death certificates filed in seven different courthouses in Mexico City. They are dated from March 17 to May 12. According to their report, the cases list the cause of death as Coronavirus, but it is written in several different forms such as SARS COV2, COV, COVID 19, NCOV, novel Coronavirus or Coronavirus.

Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage has criticised the government for its inconsistent position on quarantining during the coronavirus pandemic, saying he doubts any new arrivals at British airports will be expected to self-isolate. Speaking on his LBC radio show on Monday night, Mr Farage said that there has been “absolute chaos” over the government’s quarantine rules, with “total, utter confusion over what the government’s quarantine policy is”. Referencing reports that the government may be considering exemptions for some visitors from a planned 14-day isolation order, expected to come into force in June, the Brexit campaigner said: “Boris told us just over a week ago that there was going to be a big change and the people that did fly into the country would be quarantined. Things today looking somewhat different on that score.” Mr Farage has consistently criticised the Johnson administration’s decision to lock down the citizens of the United Kingdom in their own homes while allowing Britain’s external borders to remain open, with arrivals entering without any coronavirus testing. Reporting from April revealed that even at some of the lowest arrival rates of travel, 15,000 travellers were still entering the UK daily at the country’s airports. The Home Office had confirmed that it had quarantined just 273 people out of the 18.1 million arrivals to the UK in the three months prior to March’s lockdown. The government are all over the place on quarantine, I doubt it will ever happen. — Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) May 18, 2020  Maintaining that he thought the UK should be quarantining all arrivals without exemption, Mr Farage said: “I still think we should [quarantine] if we’re serious about avoiding a second wave. If we had done it at the beginning, we would have had a mere fraction of the cases and other deaths we’ve seen in this country. That has been my view, I’ve held it now for about 12 weeks, and I have not changed it one bit.” Transport Select Committee Chairman Hugh Merriman asked on Monday if “air bridges” to let people in from countries with a low infection rate could be used to exempt travellers from the two-week quarantine, with Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, saying that the final details will be confirmed next month. Mr Shapps had said: “We should indeed consider further improvements, for example, things like air bridges enabling people from other countries who have themselves achieved lower levels of coronavirus infection to come to the country.” “We now have a proposal from Boris Johnson to introduce quarantine, but it would seem not only are we not going to get that now for a full month after he told us it was coming, but that it’s going be watered down so much that it might actually be meaningless,” Mr Farage remarked. Given that the UK still has the second-highest death rate in the world for the Chinese coronavirus, Mr Farage pointed out: “If we’re going to give exemptions for countries with a relatively low R-rate, or countries with an R-rate lower than ours, we will be giving exemptions to most of the world. “I’m actually not sure this quarantine policy will ever take place.” The Home Office admitted this week that more than 1,800 private aeroplanes have landed in the UK during the lockdown, with no requirements for those passengers to face coronavirus screening or quarantine.

U.S. Army veteran and Oregon fourth congressional district Republican candidate Alek Skarlatos said Tuesday he had outraised Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-OR) by two-to-one in April. Skarlatos (pictured) appeared on the Lars Larson Show to talk about the rising momentum for his congressional race. Skarlatos said: Our race is going fantastic. We out-raised DeFazio by $68,000 in the month of April, which is 2-1 to what he raised. We couldn’t be happier! Most of our support is coming from grassroots people from across the country. DeFazio’s support is coming from PACs and corporation. DeFazio does not represent one of the 30 congressional districts that went for President Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential election, and Democrats took during the 2018 midterm elections; however, Oregon’s fourth congressional district could serve as a potential pickup for Republicans in 2020. Hillary Clinton won the district by only .1 percent during the 2016 election. Skarlatos said if he were elected to Congress, he would focus on improving Oregon’s forest management, veterans issues, and protecting the Second Amendment. The Oregon Republican chided DeFazio for becoming increasingly leftist over the years, including pushing the Green New Deal. “I think that’s a huge step in the wrong direction and would wreck the economy of the country,” Skarlatos said. “He has gone very left recently,” he added. Skarlatos said while he supports giving small businesses aid during the coronavirus pandemic, he believes that the country should tackle its debt problem. “Even with the bailout packages with the coronavirus, I think we should have some help to businesses but increasing the debt two and a half trillion and wanting to increase it even more. I think that’s very scary, and being a millennial, I’m very scared by the debt,” he said. “It’s a tough race, but it’s a very winnable district, but we look forward to helping President Trump win back the House,” Skarlatos said.

In Qatar and Kuwait, not wearing a sanitary mask could land you in prison, according to new mandates issued by the Persian Gulf states to curb the spread of the Chinese coronavirus, Middle Eastern news site Al-Monitor reported Monday. The maximum penalty for not wearing a mask in Qatar is three years in prison, according to an announcement broadcast on Qatari-state TV over the weekend. The country’s top fine for failing to wear a mask was set at 200,000 riyals ($55,000). The ordinance is effective now “until further notice.” Kuwait’s Ministry of Health announced that those who fail to comply with the country’s mask mandate risk a maximum of three months in prison and a fine of 5,000 dinars ($16,200), according to the report. Qatar’s Cabinet, its chief executive body, orders people to wear masks “upon leaving the house for any reason” except when “alone while driving a vehicle,” the Qatar News Agency reported Thursday, according to the report. Qatar has one of the world’s highest rates of infection for coronavirus, with 33,969 cases but a relatively low death toll by comparison with just 15 deaths. Of the six Gulf States, Qatar has the second-highest coronavirus infection rate. In Qatar, only about 300,000 people out of the entire population of 2.8 million are Qatari nationals. The majority of people in the country to have contracted coronavirus so far are reportedly migrant workers. As reported by Al-Monitor, Qatar recorded 1,000 new coronavirus cases each day last week, with 1,153 cases recorded on Friday, according to Dr. Abdullatif al-Khal, co-chair of Qatar’s National Pandemic Preparedness Committee. “The spike in infections suggests the virus is at the beginning of its peak,” Dr. al-Khal reportedly said, urging Qataris to “stay at home during the remainder of Ramadan,” the Islamic month-long holiday which ends this weekend. Mosques in Qatar have been closed to comply with coronavirus physical distancing measures. According to the Qatar Tribune, the Qatari government has limited the number of people allowed to travel in private cars and other vehicles starting Tuesday. No more than two people are allowed to travel at a time in a self-driven personal vehicle, but up to three people at a time are allowed in taxis, limousines, and cars driven by a “family driver.” Starting Tuesday, Qatar will halt all commercial activities and close all shops, according to the report. Essential shops, such as grocery stores and pharmacies, will remain open. The partial shutdown is expected to last until May 30. With a population of about 30 million people, Saudi Arabia has the highest number of coronavirus cases of all the Persian Gulf states with over 57,345 infections and 320 deaths. Both Kuwait and Qatar share a border with Saudi Arabia. The United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar’s neighbor to the southeast, has the second-highest number of coronavirus deaths among the six Persian Gulf states with 224. It has reported more than 24,190 cases.

In an appearance on Fox News Channel on Tuesday, Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) explained her call for an investigation into Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-NY) and New York State government for the handling of nursing home policy at the outset of the COVID-19 outbreak. Stefanik said the investigation should come from the federal government, not her state’s attorney general. “New York has mismanaged how we approached and how we protected our seniors in our nursing homes,” she said. “We knew going into this that our most vulnerable are our seniors and particularly in those assisted living facilities, whether they’re senior living facilities or nursing homes. New York, when compared to other states, took a number of negative actions that cost over 5,000 lives. The governor took executive action, forcing positive COVID cases back into nursing homes. There was zero transparency in terms of informing the seniors, the workers, or the family members, whether there were positive cases. They also didn’t fully tell the public how many seniors deaths there were coming from nursing homes. So that reporting data, they didn’t count the hospital deaths when there was a positive case that was transmitted because of the senior nursing home.” “We took the opposite approach in my district, and I have to applaud the county public health officials,” Stefanik continued. “In our first case of a senior assisted living facility, the county public health office, this was not taking guidance from New York State. They did this on their own. They put out the information in a transparent way to ensure that other seniors and families in that assisted living facility were notified of that immediately. So I believe that these families owe answers. We cannot dismiss their concerns. I’ve heard from families who are still grieving for loss of their loved ones, and they deserve answers. And it’s not just Republicans who are calling for this independent investigation. It’s Democrats as well. It cannot be conducted by New York’s attorney general either. It needs to be an independent investigation. I’m calling for the Department of HHS to conduct this independent investigation. But I think it needs to come from the federal government.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor

According to a NYU study, the legendary five-minute Abbott coronavirus test misses close to 50 percent of positive infections. Abbott disputes this. The company claims its own false negatives are just .02 percent and it is not convinced NYU did the tests correctly. Also of note is that the NYU study has not yet been peer reviewed, so nothing is official. This test is the one currently in use at the White House and the one President Trump touts as the five-minute test because it can produce a positive result in five to 13 minutes, and a negative result in 13 minutes. The best thing about the test is that it is self-contained. You can ship these things all over the world, to any place that wants to do testing. With some training, the testing and results can all be done right there. Nothing has to be shipped to a lab. To which I say, who gives a shit. Come on, y’all… Wake up. We can’t test our way out of this. We can’t vaccine our way out of this. We can’t quarantine our way out of this. We can’t lockdown our way out of this. This is an infectious disease, an especially infectious infectious disease with no cure, and that means it is eventually going to catch up to all of us. Sorry, it just is. I know you don’t want to believe that. I know you want to believe you’re living through a real-life disaster movie where we can all hide out until Dustin Hoffman or Matt Damon save the day at the last minute, but that’s not how life works. There is still no vaccine for the Spanish Flu of 1918 that wiped out 50 to 100 million. There is still no cure for the Hong Kong Flu of 1969 that wiped out one to three million. Both of those viruses ran their course, and what “saved” us was either herd immunity or the virus mutating into something less lethal, or a combination of both. The only person in this country not spewing bullshit right now is Dr. Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, who said out loud,   the China Virus is going to rage “until it infects everybody it possibly can,” which means it “surely won’t slow down until it hits 60 to 70 percent” of the population. And there it is… Once the coronavirus infects 60 to 70 percent of the population we achieve herd immunity, and herd immunity is probably going to be the only way out of this. Two things would not surprise me: 1) We never-ever-ever come up with a vaccine for the coronavirus, or 2) we achieve herd immunity before we come up with the vaccine. This testing narrative is total bullshit. Whether it’s a five minute test or a five second test or a five month test, it’s all bullshit. You can go out and get your precious little five minute test, test negative, and then immediately walk out the door and catch the coronavirus by walking through an empty hallway — well, empty except for the mist of coronavirus still hanging in the air from the guy who sneezed just before he turned a corner. And let’s split it down the middle… Let’s say your magic five-minute test only gets it wrong 25 percent of the time… You want to know what’s worse than testing positive for the virus? Testing negative when you’re positive. Because now you believe you’re not infected and cannot infect anyone else, and then you go and give grandma (who actually should be quarantining) a big hug to celebrate testing negative and you just killed grandma. It really is better to not get tested and just be careful, especially around grandma, no? This is all so stupid… and pointless. Lockdowns are stupid and pointless.  Massive testing is stupid and pointless — so stupid and pointless, we have more tests than people who want to take them. The only testing the government can do that makes sense is to test enough to ensure our health care system does not get overwhelmed by way of a new cluster of infections somewhere. That’s it. That’s the only testing the government can and should worry about. We want to be able to save everyone who can be saved, so we don’t want the health system to crash. That makes perfect sense. That’s a worthy goal. That’s the only realistic goal. The rest is bullshit. The only testing the health care system needs to do is of those with coronavirus symptoms so they know how to best treat the patient — because hopefully some of these therapeutics eventually bear fruit. That makes perfect sense. That’s a worthy goal. That’s the only realistic goal. The rest is bullshit. Massive testing is ridiculous and pointless, a phony balm for a crybaby country that believes life should be without risk and if there is a risk that can only mean Big Daddy Government isn’t doing enough… Just ask crybabies like ABC’s Jonathan Karl. You want to stay quarantined, stay quarantined. No one’s stopping you. No one’s pulling you out of your home. But can we please stop with this bullshit about how testing and lockdowns are a cure, how a vaccine is right around the corner? Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.

The San Francisco Bay Area went two consecutive days without recording a single death from coronavirus on Sunday and Monday — the first time that has happened since March. “Health officials in the nine Bay Area counties recorded no new deaths due to the coronavirus on Sunday or Monday, as the area’s death toll remained at 390,” the San Francisco Chronicle reported, noting that the last day without a single death from the disease had been March 21. The news came as California Gov. Gavin Newsom began easing some of the criteria for counties to reopen their economies. 53 of the state’s 58 counties would qualify for a “variance” from the state’s rules, Newsom said Monday, according to the Chronicle. Some local governments had complained that the criteria were too stringent, and a few businesses began opening in defiance of the rules — an increasing phenomenon in other parts of the country. In early May, for example, one restaurant opened in Orange County in open defiance of state and local restrictions — and law enforcement did not intervene. There were similar cases elsewhere. Overall, the Los Angeles Times notes, the state has had more than 80,000 cases of COVID-19, and has suffered 3,200 deaths. But California has not been hit as hard as New York and other states, for reasons that are still not understood. Some credit the state’s relatively early decision to order residents to stay at home. But warmer weather may also have played a role, along with the fact that California’s sprawling big cities are less dense than the East Coast hubs. Joel B.

Thousands of Germans from across the political spectrum turned out to protest the Wuhan coronavirus lockdown measures in several cities for a second weekend. Demonstrations took place in several major cities including Berlin and Munich. Stuttgart administrators had issued a permit for 5,000 attendees, but more than 5,000 protested on Saturday, resulting in overflows out of the designated area. Those attending the protest, according to a report by Le Point, came from a variety of political backgrounds from far-left extremists, to conspiracy theorists, and to right-wing activists. President of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution Thomas Haldenwang told Die Welt that most of the protesters who participated were “constitutionally loyal citizens” but claimed that various extremist groups were trying to hijack the demonstrations. “We see a trend that extremists, especially right-wing extremists, are exploiting the demonstration,” Haldenwang told the newspaper. Da dürfte die ehemalige #DDR-Bürgerrechtlerin Angelika #Barbe heute in Berlin wohl ein traumatisches Déjà vu gehabt haben.  pic.twitter.com/UkAWCvwjFM — Georg Pazderski (@Georg_Pazderski) May 16, 2020  “There is a risk that right-wing extremists will use their enemy images and state-destroying goals to lead the coronavirus demonstrations, which are currently being carried out mostly by constitutionally loyal citizens,” he added and compared the situation to that of the 2015 migrant crisis. On Friday in the town of Stralsund in northern Germany, a mock tombstone was placed outside the constituency office of German Chancellor Angela Merkel with the inscription: “Freedom of expression, freedom of movement, freedom of assembly, freedom democracy. 1990-2020.” The slogan, a comparison to the fall of the East German Republic, came just before one of the well-known civil rights activists of that era, Angelika Barbe, was arrested for participating in an anti-lockdown protest in Berlin on Saturday. The 68-year-old former MP, who has supported the populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) in recent years, was filmed being arrested on the outskirts of a protest while claiming she simply wanted to go to a shop. “I just asked the police why they blocked off a demo of Antifa. Shortly afterwards, I was torn away,” she said. The protests coincided with similar demonstrations in various other countries such as the UK where demonstrators took to London’s Hyde Park where several people were arrested, including the brother of former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Piers Corbyn.

Kuwait City (AFP) — Abu Othman, like thousands of Kuwaiti men, has struggled to split his time between two wives living in separate homes amid the Gulf state’s strict lockdown to combat the coronavirus. “My life has become so complicated,” the 45-year-old, who has 10 children between the two women, told AFP. “I am constantly on the move between them,” he said, stressing that he could never choose one wife over the other. The oil-rich country has imposed some of the strictest measures in the Gulf to combat the spread of the virus, which has so far infected over 15,000 people and claimed 118 lives there. Last week, Kuwait announced a nationwide “total” lockdown until May 30, suspending all but essential private and public sector activities. Under the curfew, residents are allowed to shop for food only once every six days, after electronically obtaining official permission, and may otherwise leave home for two-hour evening walks. Those who break the rules, which also include mandatory use of face masks outside the home, can be fined as much as $16,000 and jailed for up to three months. But in response to appeals by scores of polygamists like Abu Othman to ease their restrictions on movement, the Kuwaiti authorities on Sunday introduced electronic permits to men married to more than one woman for one-hour visits twice a week. – ‘Family emergency’ – Traditional Islamic jurisprudence allows Muslim men to marry up to four women — a custom initially meant to ensure the welfare of widows and orphans of those who had died fighting for Islam. A strict requirement is that men treat all their wives equally and fairly. Abu Othman married his first wife in 2001 and his second wife in 2006. The two women live in separate houses in Al-Jahra, a predominantly Bedouin area 40 kilometres (25 miles) west of Kuwait City. Polygamy has become increasingly uncommon in much of the Muslim world. Tunisia was the first predominantly Muslim country to abolish the practice in 1956. Kuwait had one of the highest rates of polygamy in the Gulf between 2010 and 2015, at over eight percent of marriages, according to a study by the Doha International Family Institute. Abu Othman said he was trying hard to make sure neither of his wives feels neglected, especially amid a crisis that has seen much of the world virtually shut down. But with all the restrictions in place to curb COVID-19, he said he has struggled to divide his time equally between the two homes. “Sometimes police patrols understand my situation, while at other times I have to apply for permission claiming there is a ‘family emergency’,” said Abu Othman before the new “second wife” permission was introduced. – Separated from children – The Kuwaiti state’s Islamic scholars have taken pains to clarify the marriage rules amid the lockdown. According to Ahmad al-Kurdi, a member of the Fatwa Committee at Kuwait’s Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs, the notion of justice between wives focuses on “marital spending and good treatment, not sexual relations and love”. “A polygamist who is forced to live at one of his wive’s houses because of the curfew must give the other (or others) a choice between accepting it or agree to a divorce (if they so wish),” he said, according to Kuwait’s Al-Rai newspaper. Another committee member, Issa Zeki, told the daily that a man can “make it up” to his other wives by spending more nights at their homes after the lifting of restrictions to “equal the number” spent with each wife. He suggested that the man blindly draw one of the wives’ names to simplify the decision of which one to spend the quarantine period with. Abu Othman said he tries to spend equal numbers of nights in both homes, saying he considers himself lucky that the two women live in the same area. Other men are not so lucky, such as Abu Abdulaziz, 35, who now lives with his parents, second wife and two children in Al-Jahra. His first wife and their three children reside in the Saad Al-Abdullah area, about 15 kilometres away. “For the first time, I haven’t seen some of my children,” Abu Abdulaziz told AFP, adding that his first wife was “understanding”. However, Abu Abdulaziz’s first wife, who requested anonymity, said that despite trying to be understanding, she was struggling on her own amid the current situation. “He could have chosen to stay with me,” she said.

“Kill the Oldies. Save the NHS.” Perhaps Boris Johnson should think of adopting this for his next slogan because it’s what his government has done. In fact, it’s the second most scandalous aspect of his record so far in dealing with the Chinese coronavirus. The scandal, essentially, is this: on March 19 the UK government issued an order to the NHS quickly to clear out 15,000 patients to make way for the expected surge in patients with Covid-19. Many of these were elderly patients who had nowhere to go save care homes.  Some of these patients were already infected with coronavirus and instead of being isolated — as they should have been — they were instead sent to the very place where they were likely to do the most damage: residential homes full of people in the worst at-risk category. So far, more than 8,000 people have died in care homes with Covid-19. This represents around a quarter of the total coronavirus deaths in the UK so far. We cannot be sure how many of these deaths can be attributed to the government’s panicked decision to dump elderly patients from hospitals into care homes. But the government undoubtedly bears a degree of culpability. Health Secretary Matt Hancock is currently denying responsibility. Last week, he told a press conference: “Right from the start we’ve tried to throw a protective ring around our care homes. We set out our first advice in February… we’ve made sure care homes have the resources they need”. But as Richard North points out at EU Referendum, this is simply untrue. He notes that as late as April 2, the government was blithely insisting ‘that patients with Covid-19, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, could be safely accepted in care homes.’ Here is the official document that proves it. It says: As part of the national effort, the care sector also plays a vital role in accepting patients as they are discharged from hospital – both because recuperation is better in non-acute settings, and because hospitals need to have enough beds to treat acutely sick patients. Residents may also be admitted to a care home from a home setting. Some of these patients may have COVID-19, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic. All of these patients can be safely cared for in a care home if this guidance is followed. As North says: Not by any imagining, and not in any conceivable way could it be said that the Department of Health or the NHS tried to throw a “protective ring” around care homes. Quite to the contrary, the NHS hospitals sought to protect themselves from being “overwhelmed”, by the simple expedient of dumping thousands of vulnerable patients onto the care sector, spreading the infection to thousands of others who were least able to defend themselves from it. North is right on this one, though not, I think, on the bigger picture. Unlike him, I believe the lockdown should end immediately because I don’t think there is sufficient evidence to justify this extraordinary assault on liberty nor all the wanton damage that is being done to the economy. But I’m glad he is driving home with his characteristic subtlety, charm and wit just how badly the government has been dealing with the pandemic. It seems a fairly basic point that if care homes are the location for the most at-risk category of people vulnerable to coronavirus then far more thought should have been given to protecting them. Almost every government has made mistakes in its response to the coronavirus pandemic. Even Sweden — increasingly praised for its non-lockdown policy which enabled it to build herd immunity while doing less damage to its economy — has admitted that it should have done more to protect the elderly in care homes. But mistakes are only forgivable when governments fess up and show evidence that they’ve learned from them. Hancock’s insistence in that interview that the government has done nothing wrong suggests that Britain is still run by an administration far more interested in covering its arse than in doing the right thing. The same point was made more eloquently at the weekend by former Supreme Court judge Lord Sumption, when he wrote in the Sunday Times: The lockdown is now all about protecting politicians’ backs. They are not wicked men, just timid ones, terrified of being blamed for deaths on their watch. But it is a wicked thing that they are doing. Sumption also makes the point that the government’s priorities are all wrong: The lockdown was originally justified as a temporary measure to spread coronavirus infections over a longer period. This was to allow time for the NHS’s critical care capacity to catch up. Hence the slogan ‘Protect the NHS’ It was never much of a rationale. The NHS is there to protect us, not the other way round. It used to be said that however disappointing Boris Johnson and his crew might turn out to be, at least Britain dodged the far bigger bullet at the last election of being run by the dilapidated Marxist Jeremy Corbyn. But I’m not sure this is true any more. At least if Corbyn had been in charge right now, there would have been a Conservative opposition ready to hold him to account, calling for the end of the lockdown, warning of the grave damage being done to the economy, and so on. Instead, we voted Conservative and just got incompetent socialism all the same.

Under the open borders policy maintained by the British government, over 1,800 private aircraft have arrived in the United Kingdom during the national coronavirus lockdown imposed on ordinary citizens. The Home Office has revealed that between March 17th and April 14th, 1,812 private aircraft flights landed in the country, up from 545 less than one month ago. The figure includes privately owned aeroplanes, business jets, cargo aircraft, and foreign military flights. However, the government did not give a specific breakdown for each category of flight. The Home Office minister, Baroness Williams of Trafford, also admitted per The Guardian: “There is no Public Health England requirement to record contact details for arriving or departing passengers for Covid-19 purposes”. Though air traffic to the UK has dropped significantly during the coronavirus pandemic, it has been reported that an estimated 100,000 people have been arriving in the country through airports every week without any form of health screening. The high number of private flights continuing to land in the United Kingdom mirrors the surge in the number of superyachts making berth in Britain over the course of the coronavirus pandemic. While most European nations enacted hard border lockdowns, leaving the yachts stranded and unable to refuel or get supplies in the Mediterranean, the United Kingdom remained open to all-comers, prompting the exodus to British ports. The phenomenon of continued activity of private aviation and superyachts reflects the dichotomy noted by many, including Britain’s Brexit leader Nigel Farage, that while the British people remained under a police-mandated curfew, the borders remained paradoxically open, undermining the authority of the state by exposing the contradictions of their lockdown policies. Months after coronavirus began to spread across Europe, Boris Johnson’s government is expected to implement a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all arrivals to the UK. However, a set date for the implementation of such a policy has not been revealed. The government has claimed that until the transmission of the Wuhan virus was brought under control internally in the UK, any restrictions on international would have been ineffective at bringing the number of coronavirus cases down. “Now that domestic transmission is decreasing, it is the right time to prepare new measures at the border to protect us from imported cases and the risk of a second wave of infections from those arriving here,” a government spokesman had told euronews last week. “Throughout the outbreak, we have brought in the right measures at the right time based on scientific advice,” the spokesman added. ‘Too Late’: Farage Criticises Open Borders While Britons Locked Down in Coronavirus Crisis https://t.co/M2By5p6V6F — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 23, 2020  Critics have warned that the implementation of mandatory quarantines at a time when the British economy will be looking to rebound from the fallout caused by the national lockdown — as opposed to shutting down borders at the outset of the pandemic — will only serve to prolong the coronavirus recession. The Immigration Services Union spokeswoman, Lucy Moreton, said that the government’s plans appear to be “all politics and no science”. The chief executive of Heathrow Airport, John Holland-Kaye, argued that the government should adopt a risk-based approach, allowing travellers from countries with a low number of infections to enter into the country without quarantine. “The quarantine cannot be in place for more than a relatively short period of time if we are going to get the economy moving again. There needs to be a plan for what comes next. We need the government to help develop [an] international standard so that traffic can continue to flow between low-risk countries,” Mr Holland-Kaye said in comments reported by The Telegraph. “I think the approach to take is the risk-based approach, as we do with security where, if two countries are very low-risk free of transmission, there should be a free flow of passengers between those countries,” he suggested.

President Donald Trump delivered a blunt ultimatum to the embattled World Health Organization late Monday, warning it will permanently lose U.S. funding unless it commits to “major substantive improvements within the next 30 days.” Trump suspended U.S. funding to the U.N. subsidiary last month, as Breitbart News reported, noting then the W.H.O. played a key role in “mismanaging and covering up” the global spread of the deadly Chinese coronavirus. Now the president has moved beyond a funding suspension to a permanent cessation of all U.S. finance. “They’re a puppet of China, they’re China-centric to put it nicer,” Trump said at the White House. “They gave us a lot of bad advice.” In a letter to W.H.O. Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Trump said he’ll reconsider the United States’ membership within the organization only after a host of improvements — predicated on it dropping ties with China — are made. “It is clear the repeated missteps by you and your organization in responding to the pandemic have been extremely costly for the world,” the letter said. “The only way forward for the World Health Organization is if it can actually demonstrate independence from China,” it added, giving the body 30 days to show “substantive improvements”: This is the letter sent to Dr. Tedros of the World Health Organization. It is self-explanatory! pic.twitter.com/pF2kzPUpDv — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 19, 2020  The letter outlines the bungled response from the W.H.O. and its relationship to China during the first days of the virus’ detection in Wuhan, saying it later overly relied on Chinese statements that led to “grossly inaccurate or misleading” information about its spread. It also accuses the W.H.O. of being “curiously insistent on praising China for its ‘transparency’” and failing to call on Beijing to allow for an independent investigation into the origins of  the deadly coronavirus. The letter mentions the W.H.O.’s call for people to avoid travel in and out of China during the 2003 SARS epidemic — issued by then-director-general Gro Harlem Brundtland — and its criticism of China during that outbreak as evidence the W.H.O. “could have done so much better” had it “followed Dr. Brundtland’s example.” The United States gives between $400 million and $500 million a year to the W.H.O. in contrast to the roughly $40 million it receives from China, a fact Trump has previously highlighted: Earlier in the day Trump rejected an invitation to address a virtual gathering held by the W.H.O. and instead directed Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar to deliver a “blistering” reponse to its failed coronavirus strategies. Key amongst those was the W.H.O. claim in January that “preliminary investigations” by China found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the virus in Wuhan. Further, the organization pleaded with countries to keep borders open despite labeling the massive outbreak a global emergency. Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in #Wuhan, #China🇳. pic.twitter.com/Fnl5P877VG — World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) January 14, 2020  The W.H.O. and China were wrong on every single count and the human cost is still being calculated. Since the virus emerged from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, more than 4.8 million people worldwide have been infected resulting in more than 318,000 deaths, according to a live tracker of the virus by Johns Hopkins University.

Rep. Dan Crenshaw’s (R-TX) life experiences as a Navy SEAL, a Harvard graduate, and an elected member of the House of Representatives serve as the foundation for his new book Fortitude: American Resilience in the Era of Outrage. The book is both biographical and a guide to fighting life’s battles with integrity rather than outrage. “The lesson is pretty simple,” Crenshaw said Monday on Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow. “You have to challenge yourself and engage in self-imposed suffering in a habitual way.” “When you do that, you do build the mental calluses you need. You build psychological strength. You build physical strength, and you need that to engage in the real world because the real world does hit you hard sometimes,” said Crenshaw, who in 2012 on his third tour of duty, was struck by an improvised explosive device, which destroyed his right eye and left him with only partial vision in his left eye.  “I’m not saying nothing is worthy of outrage, of course,” Crenshaw said. “There is real injustice in this world, of course, and there’s certain things to be outraged about.” “But I also say, don’t ever pretend that there is actually any utility in that emotion,” Crenshaw said. “Even if you’re right — screaming and yelling and insulting — it still doesn’t help you win the battle you’re claiming you want to win. In fact, it probably helps you lose it.” “The only way you are going to win is if you actually get people on your side,” Crenshaw said. The book also recalls when comedian Pete Davidson mocked Crenshaw’s devastating injury on Saturday Night Live — a move Davidson later apologized for on the weekly show. “On behalf of the show and myself, I apologize,” Davidson said before Crenshaw showed up on stage — a move that revealed his character and helped his political career. Marlow also asked Crenshaw about the coronavirus and what has unfolded in the past few weeks with what was, at first, a temporary lockdown that has now stretched out for nearly months. “I think we had plenty to reason to lockdown at first for the stated goals of saving our hospital system and for flattening the curve to some extent, but I fail to see any excuse for the continuation of those lockdowns,” Crenshaw said. “We’ve kind of mentally manipulated ourselves into this abundance of fear,” Crenshaw said. Crenshaw referred to his discussion in his book about the need for people to have a sense of duty in both big ways, such as military service, and in everyday life, including something as simple as returning the shopping cart to the store instead of abandoning it in the parking lot. “We also have a duty to live responsibly with our freedom, just as we always do. Put your shopping cart back, wear a mask in close spaces, and don’t touch people so that we can get back to normal life, maintaining the spread of the virus while also getting our economy back up and running,” Crenshaw said.

Representative Mo Brooks (R-AL) argues governments around the country are violating the U.S. Constitution with shutdown orders, some of which have been in place for nearly two months. According to the Alabama Republican, although some shutdowns were reasonable initially, over time, governments around the country have violated the U.S. Consitution. He said that was backed up by courts striking down shutdown orders. “Let me be real clear: I understand the shutdown when the crisis first began in March in a significant way,” he said. “That was to give us time to get a handle on things, for us to understand it well enough so we could make informed decisions. The Democrats, however, have persevered with their shutdowns beyond that. And the big issue when you start to talk about freedom and liberty is the constitutional aspect of it. We’ve got provisions in the United States Constitution. We’ve got provisions in the Bill of Rights designed to protect individual rights of individual citizens, where the government is subservient to you and to me and to every other citizen that hears our voices.” “Well, what you’re seeing are some of the judicial decisions that are slapping these governors down,” Brooks continued. “Today, you’ve got another judge ruling Oregon’s governor’s shutdown order is now illegal. In Wisconsin, you had a ruling that it’s unconstitutional. As citizens start to wake up with these slaps in the face about the liberty and freedom that they’ve lost, coupled with the recognition that what state has done, or cities have done, are unconstitutional and illegal deprivations of life, liberty and property — that’s when I think you’re going to see the bell go off, the light bulb shine and people starting to figure out, ‘Hey, this is wrong, and this is bad and worse than wrong and bad it is illegal and unconstitutional.’ And we need to fight for our rights.” Brooks recounted an instance in his home state in Alabama where a lawyer was considering a First Amendment challenge to the state’s Republican governor, Kay Ivey. Ivey has since relaxed those restrictions, but Brooks said there were still other places around the United States where a challenge would be in order. He pledged his appreciation to those challenging the shutdown orders in violation of freedoms and liberties and reminded listeners so many fought and died for those freedoms and liberties. “You are starting to see more and more people and entities around the country figure out that they have recourse,” Brooks added. “They’re not hostage to [Bill] de Blasio in New York City or [Andrew] Cuomo in New York State. Rather, they have the ability to fight for their freedoms and fight for their liberty in court. And you are starting to see, and even to this day, you are seeing a huge turnaround in the way the public is reacting to this as they recognize a lot these shutdowns have been illegal and unconstitutional. And I thankful for those who have asserted our rights that so many of our ancestors fought for and often lost their lives for. That’s what’s at stake with this kind of dictatorial government that we’re seeing around our country. Let citizens decide. Give them the information they need. That’s a role that government can adequately play.  But let citizens decide how to best exercise their freedom and their liberty, recognizing that some are going to make bad decisions. But you know what? I trust most citizens to make good decisions.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor

The administration is preserving the nation’s border and border agents by using a healthcare law to help deport 80 percent of migrants within two hours of arriving at the southern border, officials say. Congress’ Title 42 law gives the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) the authority to order border agents to quickly deport migrants before they can spread China’s coronavirus to border agents, migrants, and other people in the United States, a senior official at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) told Breitbart News. The fast-track deportation rules are needed to prevent migrants from spreading the epidemic throughout detention centers along the border, he said. “If you’re going into Border Patrol custody, you’re going into small confined spaces with a lot of people and Border Patrol agents,” he said, adding: If you’re coughing, if you have a contagious disease, you’re going to get other people sick around you. Those people then get more people sick, they get Border Patrol agents sick, and you have to potentially shut down the entire Border Patrol station. Then maybe you are finding entire sectors where hundreds — if not thousands — of Border Patrol agents are calling sick. They can’t go to work. Now we have a danger of drug smuggling [and more migration] …  That’s the concern and that’s exactly what the CDC addresses in the order. The Title 42 law is being combined with the variety of asylum reforms, court reforms, diplomatic agreements, plus the expanding border wall that have been created by President Donald Trump to prevent migrants from even reaching the border detention centers. A May 18 statement from Acting Secretary Chad Wolf said: CBP facilities are not equipped to safely process aliens attempting to enter our country illegally during this unprecedented global health crisis. Under President Trump’s leadership, this administration took decisive action to allow DHS to prevent the illegal entry of aliens at our northern and southern borders. This order continues to keep the American people safe, as well as protect our officers and those in their care and custody. It has been one of the most critical tools the administration has used to prevent the further spread of COVID-19 and continue to protect the American people. This set of defenses allows border agents to detain and process just 100 migrants each day in the border facilities, down from 20,000 per day in early 2019, said a senior official in the Customs and Border Protection agency. “Real quick math tells me that 99.5 percent decrease in terms of numbers in custody is a huge success story,” he added.   The importance of Title 42 was demonstrated by the arrest of one group of four illegal migrants, said the senior CBP official: Just to give you an example of one person that we apprehended back in April [when] patrol agents encountered a group of four that had illegally crossed the border near Calexico into California. It was three Mexican nationals and one Indian national. All four of them crossed the border illegally. The Mexican nationals were expelled under Title 42, and the Indian national was taken to the border patrol facility for processing. He received an initial medical interview outside of the facility. And it was determined that he was exhibiting [coronavirus] symptoms. He was transported to another facility where he was isolated … they came outside to the parking lot to give him a swab test. Two days later, it came back positive. [To get to Calexico] the Indian national had traveled throughout the Western Hemisphere, from his home country to Brazil. He actually went to Ethiopia, and then to Brazil, Lima in Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Mexico — two different locations in Mexico — before he came to the United States. We know that he was with 10 other Indian nationals at the same time down in Central America. And as I mentioned, he was apprehended with the Mexican nationals that were returned to Mexico. Had he been apprehended in circumstances as they applied a year ago, both with the volume and the procedures for taking that individual and putting him into [a detention] setting, in very close quarters with lots of other aliens, particularly for a long period of time at the peak of the crisis. It’s unthinkable [the impact] that single individual could have had. In fact, we know from other Covid scenarios that one person in one location can be responsible for hundreds, if not thousands of cases. So it’s hard to overestimate the difference between taking in that individual … compared to what it would have been a year ago. The administration is expected to announce an expanded version of the Title 42 process in the near future. Health experts urge Trump to welcome foreign migrants w/ coronavirus. Migrants have a right to seek asylum & can be trusted to self-quarantine after they're released to their families, say the experts.But poor migrants want to work, not to self-isolate.https://t.co/JPx23EMCqP — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) May 19, 2020 

President Donald Trump on Monday evening blasted the Fox News Channel after host Neil Cavuto warned of possible health dangers associated with taking hydroxychloroquine. Earlier, the president announced that he is taking the anti-malaria drug as a preventative measure against the Chinese coronavirus. “.@FoxNews is no longer the same. We miss the great Roger Ailes. You have more anti-Trump people, by far, than ever before. Looking for a new outlet!” President Trump tweeted .@FoxNews is no longer the same. We miss the great Roger Ailes. You have more anti-Trump people, by far, than ever before. Looking for a new outlet! https://t.co/jXxsF0flUM — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 19, 2020  Speaking to reporters at the White House, President Trump revealed that he’s been taking a hydroxychloroquine pill daily for roughly a week and a half, along with a dose of zinc. Shortly after the announcement, The Your World with Neil Cavuto anchor called the president’s remarks “stunning” and warned that the drug could kill certain individuals who consume the drug. Cavuto said: A number of studies, those certainly vulnerable in the population have one thing to lose, their lives. A VA study showed that among a population of veterans in a hospital receiving this treatment, those with vulnerable conditions, respiratory conditions, heart elements, they died. Those who took it, in a vulnerable population, including those with respiratory or other conditions, they died. I want to stress again — they died. If you are in a risky population here and you are taking this as a preventative treatment to ward off the virus or, in a worst-case scenario, you are dealing with the virus, and you are in this vulnerable population, it will kill you. I cannot stress that enough. This will kill you. So again, whatever benefit the president says this has — and certainly has had for those suffering from malaria, dealing with lupus — this is a leap that should not be taken casually by those watching at home or assuming, ‘well, the President of the United States says it’s okay. In addition to Cavuto, Fox News medical contributor Dr. Manny Alvarez criticized President Trump’s announcement, describing it as “highly irresponsible.” Alvarez told Special Report host Bret Baier: I found it to be highly irresponsible for the president to have come out and made that statement, and I would like to hear from the White House physician to come out tomorrow and explain to me what has changed in a week and a half or two weeks for the president to take this medication, when all the data that has been coming out very repetitively has shown that there’s really not a major benefit. In most hospitals, including mine, we’re not using chloroquine in the treatment of COVID patients in the present time. Adding zinc to hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin might help the drug combination resolve some COVID-19 symptoms, a study posted online this week said, though experts say the two-drug treatment’s benefit is questionable and carries health risks. The findings breathe new life into a treatment regimen that has been touted by political and business leaders even before the results of clinical trials were in, experts said Wednesday. Studies to date have indicated that the combination offers limited benefits at best, with potentially dangerous side effects. “There is currently no highly effective agent for COVID-19 that we are aware of,” Dr. Joseph O. Rahimian, an infectious disease specialist at New York University Langone Health and co-author of the zinc study, told UPI. “It may end up that optimal treatment will include multiple agents and that zinc may be a part of a treatment ‘cocktail,’” he said. Historically, hydroxychloroquine has been used to treat malaria, while azithromycin is a commonly used antibiotic. Both have been studied in numerous clinical trials since the start of the outbreak of the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. To date, research has yielded mixed results. Last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a warning about “life-threatening” side effects associated with hydroxychloroquine and advised that the drug only be used in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. The UPI contributed to this report. 

Appearing Monday on Fox News Channel’s Special Report with host Bret Baier, network medical contributor Dr. Manny Alvarez ripped President Donald Trump’s announcement that he’s taking hydroxychloroquine as a preventative treatment against the Chinese coronavirus, calling it “highly irresponsible.”  A partial transcript is as follows:  BRET BAIER: Why would the president be taking hydroxychloroquine? DR. MANNY ALVAREZ: I don’t know, your guess is as good as mine. I found it to be highly irresponsible for the president to have come out and made that statement, and I would like to hear from the White House physician to come out tomorrow and explain to me what has changed in a week and a half or two weeks for the president to take this medication, when all the data that has been coming out very repetitively has shown that there’s really not a major benefit. In most hospitals, including mine, we’re not using chloroquine in the treatment of COVID patients in the present time.

Restaurant patios in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, seemed to return to normal over the weekend, following the state’s lockdown in response to the Chinese coronavirus being lifted on Friday. Outdoor patios of Cleveland restaurants and bars looked exactly as they once did on warm weekends during the pre-coronavirus era, as patrons flocked to some of their favorite downtown spots after Ohio’s patio lockdown was lifted on Friday, according to a report by Cleveland.com. Photos of people drinking and dining on patios at multiple establishments in downtown Cleveland later circulated on social media, which elicited outrage among some residents. The social media photos showed what appeared to be packed outdoor patios of patrons who were not “social distancing,” and were not wearing masks. “Lago took great care to implement every guideline that has been set by the State of Ohio,” said Fabio Salerno — the owner of the popular Lago East Bank restaurant in Cleveland — responding to the backlash that was derived from the social media photos. “There were times during our opening that tested those guidelines, and we took immediate measures to thin the ‘crowded’ areas,” added Salerno. “The pictures are one moment, one angle, one second of time.” The social media photos were also apparently seen by Ohio governor Mike DeWine, whose office issued a warning for businesses tempting to test the guidelines of Ohio’s Stay Safe order: As restaurants and bars opened yesterday for patio service, we know many establishments across Ohio are doing their part to follow best practices to keep patrons safe and socially distanced. However, anecdotes are also being distributed across the state about establishments that opened and allegedly ignored these safety guidelines. “Those who operate their businesses while disregarding safety guidelines, designed to protect the health of their customers and all Ohioans, are being irresponsible and need to understand that these guidelines will be enforced,” the statement added. People claim that they feel “unsafe” just from simply looking at the photos of the Cleveland patios, according to Cleveland 19 News. Additionally, Cleveland police responded to 28 calls about mass gatherings at home and businesses over the weekend. Cleveland’s Lago, Harry Buffalo, Mullberry’s, and TownHall were each visited by the police, as they were the four establishments that garnered the most complaints, according to Cleveland.com. Governor DeWine said that Ohio is now assembling “a large contingent of law enforcement and health officials from across state agencies and from our local communities” to conduct checks and refer those in violation for prosecution. The report added that violators could potentially lose their liquor licenses. “Violating the State’s guidelines for the reopening of businesses is something the City of Cleveland takes very seriously,” said Cleveland mayor Frank Jackson in a press release. “We will continue to monitor this situation and will be developing a policy to address the actions of habitual offenders,” he added.

Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont (D) said Monday he was pulling back hair salons and barbershops from reopening in the state on Wednesday, May 20, in order to align with Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo (D). Lamont said hair salons and barbershops would not open now until the target date of June 1. NBC CT reported: The governor’s office first announced the change in a statement saying that Gov. Ned Lamont and Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo would now plan to realign the reopening of hair salons and barbershops in the two states in early June. Asked at his coronavirus briefing on Monday, “what were some of the obstacles” salon owners discussed with him that led him to postpone their opening, Lamont said he looked at the decision from “a pure health point of view.” He explained that, while his reopening advisory board made recommendations of how to reopen salons and barbershops, the owners of these businesses he spoke with said they needed more time. From some of the Twitter responses Lamont received to his announcement to delay the opening of the salons, it appears many owners believe those who felt ready to open should be able to move ahead on May 20: Wow. Way to wait 2 days before these businesses were ready to open. All the preparations and money spent t doing so. — Cassie Bo (@crainey13) May 18, 2020  I'm disgusted to be a resident of CT! My mother and sister own a salon and I have seen the amount of time, preparation and extra costs they have accrued to safely open their business. This is so wrong that you took this away two days before opening. — Miss Boladz (@MissBoladz104) May 18, 2020  @GovNedLamont With all due respect, this is unfair.  If the salons has taken the necessary steps to re-open and it's safe, then they should be able to proceed on May 20th.  How can you expect businesses to plan if you change the date arbitrarily — Jo Marie Mielauskas (@jm1229) May 18, 2020  Unbelievable!!  Two days before they were supposed to open!  People that are complaining are the ones who are making more money staying home!  Get to work!! I hope people open anyway! As long as there is safety, then do it! — AngelinaP (@joaogeorgieper) May 18, 2020  Lamont said during his briefing he originally decided to reopen salons on May 20 because Rhode Island and other neighboring states made the same decision. Now, however, Raimondo has postponed that date. “So, we can still work in collaboration with our regional states, at least Massachusetts and Rhode Island, and give our hair salons and barber shops just a little more time,” Lamont said. Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker (R) announced Monday hair salons and barbershops in his state may reopen May 25. Lamont apologized to those salon owners who were ready to reopen on Wednesday but then said, “Give us a little more time for all your peers to get up and operating.” It is unclear why the governor believes all hair salons and barbershops must reopen on the same day. In an interview with the Hartford Courant, Lamont said he would not commit to a date of June 20 for indoor dining, stating he “will want to try and coordinate that better with our other governors.” “As you know, [Rhode Island Gov.] Gina Raimondo is doing outdoor dining as well,” he said. Lamont is allowing offices, retail stores, and restaurants for outdoor dining to reopen Wednesday. Connecticut Senate Republican Leader Len Fasano said in a statement Lamont’s decision to postpone hair salons and barbershops from reopening “has completely shaken the public’s trust”: Governor Lamont has repeatedly talked about the importance of making decisions based on science. But today’s last-minute delay is not based on science. It’s not based on a change in hospitalizations or testing or any other metric identified by the experts. It’s a policy decision based on input that should have been sought long before decisions were made. Fasano pointed to the many salon owners who have worked to reopen Wednesday. “[T]oday’s delay has absolutely nothing to do with medical science,” he said. “It’s about political science. This last-minute announcement is a slap in the face to job creators.”

Monday on CNN, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) argued President Donald Trump should not be taking hydroxychloroquine because he was “morbidly obese.” Host Anderson Cooper asked, “Madam Speaker, what is your reaction to the president saying he is now taking hydroxychloroquine? Are you concerned?” Pelosi said, “As far as the president is concerned, he’s our president and I would rather he not be taking something that has not been approved by the scientists, especially in his age group and in his, shall we say, weight group — morbidly obese they say.” She added, “So I think it’s not a good idea.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

On Monday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “The Beat,” former House Impeachment Manager Rep. Val Demings (D-FL) discussed President Trump’s firings of multiple inspectors general and his handling of coronavirus testing and stated that the Senate had a chance “during the impeachment trial, to hold Donald Trump accountable and perhaps avoid” those things, but didn’t. Demings said, “President Trump, and it looks like even long before he occupied the White House, has zero interest in transparency or oversight. We’re talking about a president who believes that, if he fires the person in charge of oversight, then there’s no scandal. We’re talking about a person who, just like he’s indicated several times, if we don’t do testing for COVID-19, then maybe 2 million people in this country will not contract COVID-19. The Senate had their opportunity, during the impeachment trial, to hold Donald Trump accountable and perhaps avoid a lot of that — what we’re seeing right now. But they either didn’t have the political will, the courage, or the backbone to hold him accountable. And so, here we are. Yet another watchdog has been fired for doing his job, faithfully performing and executing the duties of his job, which is simply disgraceful.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

The coronavirus outbreak has led to disruptions in the food supply chain in the United States, leading some farmers and ranchers to destroy animals to keep their operations sustainable. But the final destination for 1,000 laying hens rescued from a struggling Iowa egg farm is an animal sanctuary in Grass Valley, California. The lucky chickens were rescued by Animal Place, described in a press release as “California’s oldest and largest sanctuary for farmed animals.” The group took 1,000 of the more than 100,000 facing a “depopulation plan” and flew them by charted aircraft to their new home. The flights were paid for by a “generous donor,” a press release announcing the rescue said. “Given the distance and the logistics, our staff and supporters had to step up even more than usual,”  Animal Place Executive Director Kim Sturla said in the press release. Hannah Beins, animal care director at Animal Place, said in the press release: The entire process, from the 27-hour drive, arriving at the farm at 3 a.m., loading and unloading full crates from the planes and vehicles, and going straight to caring for them once we arrived at the sanctuary was the most exhausting experience I’ve ever had. I would do it again in a heartbeat, because until their rescue these hens never got to touch grass or feel the sunshine, and now they can live out the rest of their lives as chickens should. The animal rights group criticized egg farmers for keeping the hens in cages and replacing them when they age and egg production drops. In fact, many egg farmers are keeping their birds “cage free,” and in Michigan and Oregon chicken cages will be illegal in 2025 and 2024, respectively, media outlets reported. Many businesses that use eggs are only using cage-free suppliers, including Walmart, McDonalds, Starbucks, Burger King, Hyatt Hotels, and Unilever. Many people who are vegetarian or vegan reject eating eggs because they believe it to be consuming a potential chicken when, in fact, only chicken eggs that have been fertilized contain a chicken embryo.  “The lucky 1,000 will be nursed back to health and then adopted into backyard flocks throughout California,” the press release said. “Any hens who are too ill to be adopted will remain at the sanctuary and receive lifelong care.” “To celebrate 1,000 lives saved, Animal Place is serving 1,000 vegan lunches to local farmworkers and their families,” the press release said.

Monday on MSNBC, Minority Leader Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY) called President Donald Trump announcing he’s taking hydroxychloroquine “reckless.” Schumer said, “Well, our role is to put pressure on the president to respect the truth, to keep the truth-tellers in office, and to let the public know when he’s doing what he always does. Even what he said about hydroxychloroquine, who knows if it’s true. He may not have been taking it for all we know. He likes to make a splash.” He continued, “What the president did with hydroxychloroquine was reckless, simply reckless. The experts say, every expert that looked at it says it doesn’t help you against COVID. So he is giving people false hope. He may have people take it instead of going to the doctor. But it is worse than that. His own FDA says it has bad side effects, whether it affects the rhythm of the heart in many bad ways. For him to say this is reckless shows no regard for the public. Then you have to ask yourself, why did he say it? Does he have a friend or member of the family that might be benefitting? Trying to divert attention from his failure at COVID? Maybe he likes to make a splash, regardless of the consequences, As I mentioned, one thing you don’t know, maybe he is really not taking it, he lies about things characteristically, and when he hears the truth like with the inspector general, he runs away from it, fires it, pushes it aside. That’s happened throughout COVID, recently with the head of BARTA.” Guest host Steve Kornacki asked, “When you say maybe the president isn’t taking it, do you have information or have you heard something?” Schumer said, “No, I don’t. I just know he seems at the press conferences to go into flights of fancy, make things up. I don’t know whether he is taking it or not. I know him saying he is taking it, whether he is or not, is reckless, gives people false hope, has people avoid real medical attention, and can actually cause them trouble. It is just dangerous what he did.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

An Iraqi refugee, linked to al-Qaeda and accused of murder, is now seeking release from an Arizona prison claiming he is vulnerable to contracting the Chinese coronavirus. Ali Yousif Ahmed Al-Nouri, a 42-year-old Iraqi national, first entered the United States as a refugee in 2009 — three years after Iraqi government officials say Al-Nouri participated in the murders of two police officers in Fallujah, Iraq. After being resettled in the U.S. as a refugee, Al-Nouri was approved in 2015 by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to become a naturalized American citizen. In May 2019, an Iraqi judge issued a warrant for Al-Nouri’s arrest, alleging that he had led an al-Qaeda terrorist group that was responsible for the murder of the two Fallujah police officers. Court records allege that Al-Nouri led the al-Qaeda group in the premeditated murders in 2006. Al-Nouri had been running a driving school in Phoenix, Arizona. U.S. officials arrested Al-Nouri in February and locked him up in a Florence, Arizona prison, holding him for extradition to Iraq. Now, Al-Nouri is seeking release from prison, claiming he is vulnerable to contracting the coronavirus. Al-Nouri’s attorney, according to the Associated Press, says her client has heart and lung issues which make him particularly vulnerable to contracting coronavirus. Prosecutors have refuted the claims, noting that Al-Nouri is in a cell by himself and, if released, would flee the U.S. to avoid extradition. U.S. Magistrate Judge Michael Morrissey is expected to soon rule on whether Al-Nouri will be released from prison. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter at @JxhnBinder.

UC Berkeley students responded to the indefinite postponement of their graduation with a custom-built virtual celebration. Cognitive science major Bjorn Lustic took a sarcastic Facebook response to the indefinite postponement of their graduation and decided to make it a reality, “brick” by virtual brick. Graduating senior Nick Pickett remembers the comment suggesting that someone just build Memorial Stadium in Minecraft. And that is precisely what Lustic did, along with seven of his friends. Over the following weeks, the project ballooned in popularity. Soon other students, and even faculty, were contributing to the digital replica. “I think due to the circumstances (of sheltering in place) a lot of people could relate and wanted to help,” Lustic said. Slowly, familiar features took shape. The dome and its familiar yellow bleachers, framing a built-to-scale touchline, and a field sporting the Golden Bears logo. Even fraternity houses and greenery gilded the scene. “Blockeley University” held its virtual commencement on Saturday afternoon, featuring pre-recorded speeches by Chancellor Carol Christ, Vice Chancellor Marc Fisher, and others who managed the blocky avatars’ choreography.  The ceremony spared no detail; there was the conferring of degrees, to “Pomp and Circumstance” by the UC Berkeley Wind Ensemble, and even the traditional choir performance of “Hail to California.” The entire event was streamed live on Twitch.tv, and the archive is still available to watch.

Six of seven convicted sex offenders freed in Orange County, California, last month due to fears of the Chinese coronavirus crisis spreading in local jails have since been rearrested for violating their terms of release. In April, as Breitbart News reported, “high risk” sex offenders Luis Joel Ramirez, James Franklin Bowling, Rudy William Grajeda Magdaleno, Calvin Curtis Coleman, Kyle Albert Winton, Jose Adrian Oregel, and Mario Ernesto Sandoval were authorized for release by Court Commissioner Joseph Dane despite the opposition of Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer. A Mercury News report this month reveals that six of those seven sex offenders have been rearrested after their release. Law enforcement officials said the sex offenders violated their terms of release: According to the DA’s office, most of the six accused of violating parole after their release either failed to adhere to their supervision or rendered their GPS units inoperable. As of Monday they remained behind bars, local jail records show. [Emphasis added] “It comes as no surprise that these high-risk sex offenders continue to violate the law and do everything they can to avoid being tracked by law enforcement,” Spitzer said in a statement. “There is a concerted effort here in California and across the nation to open up the jailhouse doors and let dangerous criminals back into our streets without regard for the safety of the public which we are sworn to protect.” [Emphasis added] One of the sex offenders rearrested is 39-year-old Rudy William Grajeda Magdaleno who allegedly exposed himself to parole center employees weeks after his release. Generally, California officials admit that inmates in local jails and prisons are not being tested for coronavirus before they are released back into communities. One inmate, detailed in the Los Angeles Times, was freed from the Riverside County Jail before he was told his coronavirus test results. The inmate was, in fact, positive for coronavirus.

Café du Monde has delayed the reopening of its famed French Quarter location in an attempt to be responsible during the global coronavirus pandemic. “We’re very fortunate when people think of New Orleans, we’re one of the things that comes to their minds, we take that very serious,” Café du Monde president Jay Roman said. Roman himself, along with his family — and those of employees — are working behind the scenes to prepare the New Orleans institution for a safe start. The pandemic has prompted many new safety concerns, and customer care is in the forefront of Roman’s mind. “You start figuring out the formulas to which doors to open first and how many hours, and how many people you can have and table placements, and the list just goes on and on,” Roman said. There are financial hurdles, as well. Chief among them is ensuring the work pays enough to be worth abandoning the vital help the government has provided during the COVID-19 crisis. “We looked at ways to help people, but the CARES act did more than anyone could’ve imagined, so now our focus has changed to working with people so they can come back to work and still preserve that benefit that they’re getting,” Roman said. Despite all of these concerns, there has been one significant upside: The downtime has allowed for work to be done that Roman said would otherwise be much more difficult. “When you’re open 24-hours, 7-days a week, you don’t get the chance to do some of the things we’re doing now,” he explained. “We’ve got 40 year old underground pipes that we’re digging up and replacing, we painted the kitchen, we changed our lighting fixtures from incandescent to LED for the future.” The delay allows Café du Monde a little more time to finish all of these things. They still expect to open by the end of the week, even though it may be a while until customers are lined up down the street again. “I don’t see a line for a while, but at least, all I’m looking for is life,” Roman said. “After we get life, then we can worry about a line.”

The World Health Organization (W.H.O.) warned countries this weekend against spraying disinfectants on the streets in an effort to contain the Chinese coronavirus, arguing that it does not reduce the risk of contagion and may present health risks. In a document providing advice on the cleaning and disinfecting of surfaces to reduce the virus’s spread, the W.H.O. said using spraying or fumigating streets was “not recommended.” “Spraying or fumigation of outdoor spaces, such as streets or marketplaces, is … not recommended to kill the Covid-19 [Chinese] virus or other pathogens because disinfectant is inactivated by dirt and debris,” the organization said. “Even in the absence of organic matter, chemical spraying is unlikely to adequately cover all surfaces for the duration of the required contact time needed to inactivate pathogens.” Despite the large number of people passing through, the W.H.O. added that streets and pavements are generally not considered “reservoirs of infection,” and that using them could be “dangerous for human health.” “This could be physically and psychologically harmful and would not reduce an infected person’s ability to spread the virus through droplets or contact,” said the document. “Spraying chlorine or other toxic chemicals on people can cause eye and skin irritation, bronchospasm, and gastrointestinal effects.” Experts also warn against the excessive spraying of disinfectant in indoor spaces, citing a study that found that it does not work on spaces that are not directly sprayed. “If disinfectants are to be applied, this should be done with a cloth or wipe that has been soaked in disinfectant,” it says. The virus, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan last year, has so far killed over 300,000 people worldwide and is understood to be able to spread by attaching itself to objects and surfaces. Some countries, including Iran and India, have sprayed disinfectant in the streets in the hope that it will reduce contagion. Both countries have recorded more than 100,000 cases, making them two of the most severely hit countries in the world. Yet given India’s population of around 1.35 billion, this still remains a relatively low figure in proportion to other countries.

Thousands of American workers are returning to their manufacturing jobs at Ford, General Motors (GM), and Fiat Chrysler this week after shuttering for nearly two months amid the Chinese coronavirus crisis. Thousands of autoworkers at 24 Ford plants, 19 GM plants, and eight Fiat Chrysler plants are reopening this week with another five Fiat Chrysler plants reopening on May 26. The plants had closed late March due to fears of the coronavirus spreading at factories, leaving tens of thousands of autoworkers in limbo. In a statement to the Detroit Free Press, United Auto Workers (UAW) President Rory Gamble said the union would continue to monitor the reopened plants and push for widespread, readily available testing of its workers: We would like to thank the many UAW members who have worked so hard throughout the shutdown to keep the plants ready for today, as well as members who have worked to reconfigure plants for the safety of all. The UAW will continue to do everything we can to protect the health and safety of all members as plants reopen. And we will continue to advocate for as much testing as possible and full testing as it becomes available. UAW Local 600 President Bernie Ricke said the 600 autoworkers whom he represents are split over the plants’ reopening — with about half excited to get back to work and the other half with concerns. A United Auto Worker member leaves the Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Warren Truck Plant after the first work shift on May 18, 2020 in Warren, Michigan. United Auto Workers members leave the Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Warren Truck Plant after the first work shift on May 18, 2020 in Warren, Michigan. Ricke told the Detroit Free Press the plants’ reopening is about striking a balance between returning to the job and taking precautions. GM executives have said they will offer autoworkers with symptoms of the coronavirus on-site nose swab tests that will produce quick results. Likewise, Ford executives said they have partnered with neighboring medical labs to quickly get tests to autoworkers who are experiencing coronavirus symptoms. Fiat Chrysler executives say they have plans to get symptomatic autoworkers quickly tested but said testing asymptomatic autoworkers is not feasible. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

World Health Organization (W.H.O.) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a meeting of his agency’s governing body, the World Health Assembly (W.H.A.), on Monday that the coronavirus pandemic should teach the nations of the world “humility.” “For all the economic, military, and technological might of nations, we have been humbled by this very small microbe. If this virus is teaching us anything, it’s humility,” Tedros told the W.H.A., held by teleconference this year due to the pandemic. “Six months ago, it would have been inconceivable to most that the world’s biggest cities would fall eerily quiet; that shops, restaurants, schools, and workplaces would be closed; that global travel would grind to a standstill; that simply shaking hands could be life-threatening. Terms once used only by epidemiologists, like ‘reproduction number,’ ‘physical distancing,’ and ‘contact tracing’ have become common parlance,” he said. The W.H.O. director said that countries “rich and poor, large and small” have “faced challenges in coming to grips with this virus,” but the challenges have been especially difficult for “low-income countries, small island developing states and those suffering from violence and conflict.” “Nations have come together as never before, and geopolitical divisions have been thrown into sharp relief. We have seen what is possible with cooperation, and what we risk without it,” Tedros said, making his only indirect reference to the political battles fought by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to avoid a thorough international investigation into the origins of the virus. Most of Tedros’s lengthy speech consisted of bromides and superficial observations — the pandemic is a tough challenge, people are scared, it’s amazing how much damage it has done to the world economy, everyone has difficult lessons to learn from this ordeal, and so forth — and he included the obligatory genuflection to climate change as the paramount issue that drives all of the world’s other problems, including viral pandemics. A few passages were aimed at deflecting charges of malfeasance against himself and other top W.H.O. officials: W.H.O. sounded the alarm early, and we sounded it often. We notified countries, issued guidance for health workers within 10 days, and declared a global health emergency — our highest level of alert — on the 30th of January. At the time, there were less than 100 cases and no deaths outside China. We have provided technical guidance and strategic advice, based on the latest science and experience. We have supported countries to adapt and implement that guidance. We have shipped diagnostics, personal protective equipment, oxygen and other medical supplies to more than 120 countries. We have trained more than 2.6 million health workers, in 23 languages.  We have driven research and development, through the Solidarity Trial. We have called for equitable access to vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics through the ACT Accelerator. We have informed, engaged and empowered people.  We have fought the infodemic, combating myths with reliable information. And we have called consistently for the two essential ingredients for conquering this virus: national unity and global solidarity. Tedros insisted the W.H.O. is “committed to transparency, accountability, and continuous improvement,” and promised he would “initiate an independent evaluation at the earliest appropriate moment to review experience gained and lessons learned, and to make recommendations to improve national and global pandemic preparedness and response.” The director claimed he has “made a priority of transforming W.H.O. into an organization that is agile and responsive, focused on outcomes and impact,” and listed various bureaucratic reforms he has implemented, giving the clear impression that more serious reforms are not on the table.  Tedros finished his address with a pitch for universal health coverage, whose importance he said was highlighted by the coronavirus pandemic: COVID-19 is not just a global health emergency, it is a vivid demonstration of the fact that there is no health security without resilient health systems, or without addressing the social, economic, commercial and environmental determinants of health. More than ever, the pandemic illustrates why investing in health must be at the centre of development. I will repeat this: More than ever, the pandemic illustrates why investing in health must be at the centre of development. We’re learning the hard way that health is not a luxury; it’s a necessity. It is a necessity. Health is not a reward for development; it is a prerequisite.  Health is not a cost; it’s an investment. Health is a pathway to security, prosperity and peace. “Now more than ever, we need a stronger W.H.O. There is no other way forward but together,” he concluded.

India backed calls this week for an independent investigation of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic and the World Health Organisation’s (W.H.O.) response at the World Health Assembly (W.H.A.) annual meeting this week, the Times of India reported on Monday. India joins an international coalition of 116 member states – out of a total of 194 – putting forth the draft resolution for review at the summit for the W.H.O.’s decision-making body. This puts the resolution close to the two-thirds majority needed to pass. The vote is scheduled for Tuesday. Led by the European Union (E.U.) and Australia, the proposed inquiry aims to investigate “the zoonotic origins of the coronavirus,” or how the Chinese coronavirus was transmitted from animals to humans, according to Reuters on Monday, which previewed a draft of the resolution. Many have posited that the virus originally jumped from animal to human at a Chinese wet market – where exotic animals are sold for human consumption – in December. While unproven, this theory competes with others, including one that the coronavirus originated in a virology lab in China. The calls for an investigation hope to clarify the virus’s origin. According to the report, the coalition also hopes that the probe will allow an “impartial” evaluation of the W.H.O.’s response to the pandemic, which has been widely criticized. Many countries accuse the W.H.O. of being complicit in China’s cover-up of its initial outbreak in the city of Wuhan last December. The resolution calls for a timeline of the W.H.O.’s response to the virus outbreak. India’s decision to support the inquiry marks “the first time that India has formally articulated its stand on the coronavirus outbreak,” according to the Hindustan Times, although Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has previously indicated his support for W.H.O. management reform. At a Group of Twenty (G20) summit in March, Modi called for “a new crisis management protocol” for global health bodies in the wake of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. On Monday, India took over as chair of the W.H.O. executive board, meaning it will have considerable influence on the world health body’s management moving forward. Indian government sources who previewed the draft resolution pointed out that it does not specifically mention China or Wuhan. “It has language that was acceptable to all including [the] E.U. and Australia and wasn’t objected to by either China or the U.S.,” an anonymous government official told the Times of India on Monday. In response to the mounting calls for a coronavirus inquiry, Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leader Xi Jinping insisted that Beijing had “always had an open, transparent, and responsible attitude,” throughout the coronavirus crisis in a video call at the virtual W.H.A. on Monday. Xi said that China supports a “comprehensive evaluation” of the international response to the coronavirus pandemic, but added that an inquiry should be carried out only after the situation “has been brought under control.” Xi said that any investigation into the coronavirus outbreak should be guided by the W.H.O. China has previously rejected calls for an independent international investigation into the coronavirus outbreak, labeling the demands for an inquiry “politically motivated.” Chinese foreign ministry officials have claimed that the coronavirus may have originated outside of China, sharing conspiracy theories that virus was spread by the U.S. military. In supporting the resolution, India joins Japan, South Korea, Chinese ally Russia, Britain, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Indonesia, Malaysia, Bangladesh, South Africa, and an African group of 47 member countries. Since its outbreak in Wuhan, China in December 2019, the Chinese coronavirus has caused at least 316,898 deaths.

Appearing Monday on CNN, network chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said President Donald Trump “shouldn’t be taking” Hydroxychloroquine as a preventative treatment for the Chinese coronavirus, claiming his announcement is “going to cause a lot of confusion.” —@drsanjaygupta on Trump taking hydroxychloroquine: "He shouldn't be taking it" pic.twitter.com/o1L8fqGyTo — Oliver Darcy (@oliverdarcy) May 18, 2020  A partial transcript is as follows: WOLF BLITZER: Listen to how the president describe why he decided a weekend ago to start taking Hydroxychloroquine. PRESIDENT TRUMP: The frontline workers, many, many of them are taking it. I happen to be taking it, I happen to be taking it. I’m taking it, Hydroxychloroquine. Few weeks ago I started taking it. I think it’s good, I’ve heard a lot of good stories. I’m not going to get hurt by it. It’s been around for 40 years for malaria, for lupus, for other things. I take it, lot of frontline workers take it, doctors take it. BLITZER: What do you think Sanjay? DR. SANJAY GUPTA: He shouldn’t be taking it. He’s own FDA has said this is still something under investigation and it should not be taken outside of a clinical trial, and only hospitalized patients should be getting it. What [Trump] said about the fact that it’s been used for malaria prophylaxis for decades is true. What we have found more recently is that in people who already have COVID, that there are some real concerns about the impact on the heart, possibly causing these heart arrhythmias. He said there’s a lot of healthcare workers that are taking it. There is a trial that is going on still, most of the data we’ve been talking about is, which was not at all impressive regarding Hydroxychloroquine was in people who already had the disease or already quite sick. There has been this lingering question if it could be used as a prophylaxis to prevent the virus from entering cells in the first place, but there’s no evidence to suggest that. But as we try to be very responsible, we want to present the evidence as we get it. There’s no evidence to say that works in that way. That trial is ongoing. It’s for healthcare workers who have significant exposure. Obviously, President Trump doesn’t fit either of those categories. This is one of those things that I think is going to cause a lot of confusion.

D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) said on Monday that the city is just six days away from reaching the criteria necessary to begin reopening, with “community spread” cases of the novel coronavirus trending on a decline over the past eight days. “We are eight days toward 14 days of decrease,” Bowser announced on Monday, adding that other critical metrics, like testing and hospital capacity, are “also on track.” “And I think also our tracing capability is almost where we needs it to be,” the mayor stated. Bowser last month outlined the public health criteria necessary for the nation’s capital to begin the reopening process — requirements which include a consistent downward trend in new coronavirus cases over a two week period and a health care system that is able to “treat everyone who needs care without the use of Crisis Standards of Care.” “In other words we need to make sure that we’re able to provide appropriate care for everyone who needs it,” she said during the April 23 press conference, emphasizing the importance of wide spread contract tracing ability and accessible testing. The mayor signaled that an announcement on the reopening process could come as early as Thursday if trends continue in the current direction. D.C. reported 7,270 cases of the coronavirus in the district and 392 related deaths as of Monday afternoon. Bowser’s update comes as members of Congress continue to grapple with the implications of the shutdown orders and fears over the virus, with the Democrat-led House on Friday approving a rule change, allowing members to vote by proxy, 217 to 189. “Now, a member can vote on behalf of 10 others who can’t travel to Washington, D.C. Committees can also hold hearings and markups through video conference,” NPR reported. Republicans are largely unhappy with the rule change, contending that it undermines years of constitutional tradition. “We can continue to work in a safe and effective manner without overturning 230 years of constitutional and legislative tradition,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) stated. “It’s unconstitutional, first of all,” House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) said of the rule change during a Friday appearance on Fox News Channel’s Hannity. “Because a quorum under this — just — this resolution they just passed, 20 people on the floor, 20 Democrats can constitute a quorum of the House of Representatives, 435 people. That goes against Article I of the Constitution,” he continued. “If they pass anything significant using this, it will be challenged. It’ll be challenged,” he promised. Bowser last week extended the city’s stay-at-home order to June 8, emphasizing that she has the ability to revise the order “at any time to reflect a phased reopening, if the data suggests that we can do that.” Meanwhile, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) on Monday announced that he will allow officials in Virginia Beach to reopen its beaches with certain restrictions in time for Memorial Day weekend. Group sports, for instance, are prohibited, as are speakers, alcohol, tents, and “groupings under umbrellas.” Parking lots will be capped at a 50 percent capacity. “It’s very simple. You must be responsible,” Northam said.

A national poll published this week by the firm Meganálisis found that nearly 90 percent of Venezuelans do not believe that President Juan Guaidó is capable of governing the country about a year and a half into his presidency. Another 80% said they do not believe his movement has any credibility. Guaidó became the legitimate president of Venezuela in January 2019 after the last legal term of current dictator Nicolás Maduro expired. Maduro refused to step down, citing support from the nation’s socialist military and triggering a constitutional mechanism that allows the National Assembly to choose an interim president, tasked with holding elections as soon as possible. The National Assembly chose Guaidó, a member of the socialist Popular Will party at the time. Nearly a year and a half later, Guaidó has failed to organize elections, failed to dislodge Maduro from the presidential palace, and failed to convince the nation’s armed forces to look to him as their commander-in-chief. Popular enthusiasm towards Guaidó’s efforts waned as reports surfaced that he had sent envoys to talks with Maduro and faced accusations of misappropriation of relief funds. More recently, Guaidó faced criticism over what Maduro claimed was a failed attempt to dethrone him by American private contractors that a senior Guaidó official admitted signing a contract with. The Megánalisis survey published this weekend, but conducted throughout the nation’s 23 states and capital on May 9, asked Venezuelans, “Do you consider that Juan Guaidó is capable of governing Venezuela?” The vast majority, 88.3 percent, said no, while 4.1 percent said yes. Nearly twice that, 7.5 percent, answered “don’t know.” Similarly, when asked, “do you think Juan Guaidó has led the Venezuelan political opposition well?”, 85.7 percent said he was leading “very poorly.” The second-largest response was for “don’t know,” which received 8.8 percent of the replies. Only 2.6 percent said he was doing “very well.” Asked if the Guaidó-led opposition had “no credibility” and is currently in its worst moment, 80.3 percent said “yes.” Respondents also stated they largely believed that Guaidó had poorly administered resources offered by President Donald Trump – 86.3 percent said so. The poll did not indicate that distaste for Guaidó was translating into support for Maduro, however. Asked, “Do you think that Maduro’s government and chavismo guarantee a future with wellbeing, progress, and better quality of life?”, 71.5 percent said no. Asked to choose between Maduro and Guaidó, 59.5 percent said “neither.” Notably, nearly ten times as many respondents chose Maduro over Guaidó, however, 27.5 percent to 3.8 percent. Asked their partisan affiliation, 74.2 percent said they belonged to no party. Over twice the number of respondents (17.5 percent) said they supported Maduro’s United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) over the Democratic Unity Roundtable (MUD), Guaidó’s coalition (6.8 percent). Meganálisis stated the margin of error on the poll to be 3.5 percent, meaning that Guaidó may have received no support at all in some of these answers. The dire results for the true president of the country represent a near-complete nosedive in support of the young leader. A year ago, Meganálisis polled Venezuelans about Guaidó, who had just announced that the Venezuelan military had agreed to abandon Maduro and follow his orders (this proved to be false). At the time – the poll is dated May 2-4, 2019 – 89.5 percent of respondents told Meganálisis that they supported a foreign minister intervention; 91.2 percent said removing Maduro without one was impossible. After Guaidó’s declaration that the military would oust Maduro, Maduro took to national television and denied it. By the end of the month, reports surfaced that Guaidó had entered talks with the Maduro regime – a move unpopular with 87.6 percent of respondents in the Megánalisis poll. detailed above. Guaidó denied that the talks were “negotiation,” calling them instead “mediation.” Less than five percent of respondents in that poll said Maduro was Venezuela’s head of state. The last time Meganálsis asked that question, in March, the answer was 71 percent. More people said they did not think Venezuela had a president at all than said that Guaidó was in charge. This month, Guaidó and his supporters have shifted the emphasis of their messaging towards fighting the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, which Maduro insists he has under control despite the dysfunctional state of the Venezuelan healthcare system. Guaidó’s presidential office published a poll Sunday detailing exactly how dysfunctional the system is. Over 90 percent of those in the health sector do not have access to hand sanitizer while treating patients; 68 percent have no access to soap. Resultados de la encuesta nacional sobre el impacto CICID-19 en Venezuela. 17/05/2020 pic.twitter.com/IJzc0YDsKT — Centro de Comunicación Nacional (@Presidencia_VE) May 18, 2020  Outside of health care, Guaidó’s office found that 95 percent of the country experienced significant interruptions in electrical services, access to water, and properly stocked food markets. These shortages are not the product of the current pandemic, as Venezuela has struggled with chronic medical and food shortages for years, but they should be exacerbating the impact of the deadly disease. At press time, Maduro’s regime insists that the virus has only infected 541 people in the country and killed ten, rates that are not compatible with what neighboring countries are experiencing. For example, Colombia – which shares a long, often porous border with Venezuela – has confirmed 15,574 coronavirus cases and 574 deaths. In April, Reuters reported that Guaidó had entered secret talks with Maduro for how to address the pandemic. Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.

France is already starting to see movie and TV production return even though the country continues to experience a higher COVID-19 mortality rate than the United States. Amazon Studios and Netflix are reportedly planning to re-start TV production in France as early as July, according to Variety. Feature film production is slated to resume even earlier, with two films from Pathé slated to start shooting in June. Neither Amazon nor Netflix has said when they will resume shooting in the U.S. Hollywood production remains at a virtual standstill in the U.S. as the major studios work with individual state governments on establishing safety protocols. Universal is reportedly taking a tentative step forward with a low-budget Blumhouse horror movie that will shoot on the backlot. But the studio hasn’t announced a time frame for the project, which will cost $6.5 million, according to The Hollywood Reporter. France is still wrestling with the Chinese coronavirus, including recent flare-ups that have forced the country to close certain schools that had only begun to re-open. President Emmanuel Macron has come under fire for his handling of the crisis, with critics singling out a shortage of masks, ventilators, and other key equipment. France’s COVID-19 mortality remains stubbornly high at more than 15 fatalities per 100 confirmed cases, according to Johns Hopkins University’s Coronavirus Resource Center. The U.S. has a rate of 6 fatalities per 100 cases. Variety reported Monday that the Amazon’s high school series Voltaire, Mixte will start shooting in early July in the south of France while Netflix will resume production on Arsène Lupin in September due to talent availability. Pathé will begin shooting the movies Eiffel and Adieu Monsieur Haffmann in the Paris area in June. Unlike Hollywood, the French entertainment industry receives state funding. France’s government has earmarked funds to help certain movie and TV shoots that had to be postponed due the coronavirus. While Netflix production in the U.S. is still in limbo, the streamer has already resumed production on a limited basis overseas, including in Iceland and South Korea. New Zealand recently gave the greenlight for movie and TV shoots to begin again, as have Poland and the Czech Republic. France is expected to do so later this week, according to Variety.

Reuters reported Monday that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is planning a nationwide study on the spread of coronavirus into next year — and that the study will involve 325,000 participants. Reuters reported: The CDC study, expected to launch in June or July, will test samples from blood donors in 25 metropolitan areas for antibodies created when the immune system fights the coronavirus, said Dr. Michael Busch, director of the nonprofit Vitalant Research Institute. … Antibody studies, also known as seroprevalence research, are considered critical to understanding where an outbreak is spreading and can help guide decisions on restrictions needed to contain it. The CDC study should also help scientists better understand whether the immune response to COVID wanes over time. … The six metropolitan areas being surveyed in the precursor study are New York, Seattle, the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, Boston and Minneapolis, said Dr. Graham Simmons, another Vitalant researcher involved in the project. “In all likelihood” the next phase will add Miami, Atlanta, New Orleans, Dallas, St. Louis, Chicago, Denver and others, Simmons said. Researchers hope that the results of the study will help policymakers make better decisions about opening the economy. Some fear that a “second wave” of the virus may return in the fall. California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) also said Sunday that there could possibly be a “third wave” of coronavirus until a vaccine is developed. He noted that the influenza pandemic of 1917-1919 had several waves as well. Joel B.

Monday on MSNBC’s “Deadline,” network political commentator former Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO) said White House trade advisor Peter Navarro having said the CDC “let the country down with the testing” was akin to saying President Donald Trump “sucks.” Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” White House trade advisor Peter Navarro said, “Early on in this crisis, the CDC, which really had the most trusted brand around the world in this space, really let the country down with the testing. Because not only did they keep the testing within the bureaucracy, they had a bad test. And that did set us back.” McCaskill said, “Navarro clearly was green-lighted by the White House to go after the CDC, and then, Azar comes on and tried to defend the CDC. What you have at a moment of crisis, you have a desperate need for everyone to work together. Especially all of those people who have responsibility. So the notion that the White House green-lighted Navarro to go on a Sunday show and try to take down both HHS and the CDC in the middle of a health pandemic that’s killing Americans, it is stunning incompetence. You just wonder, who is strategizing this? Who thinks this is a good idea?” Host Nicolle Wallace said, “I mean, Claire, do you really wonder that? Who strategizes everything? Donald Trump sits there with the clicker in his pajamas and his iPhone. I mean, who strategizes anything?” McCaskill said, “I think, you know, I think he’s so ill-equipped and I’m being kind here for this job. He doesn’t understand that how well he leads the people who work for him matters. I mean, that matters how well he leads them. He thinks it’s okay to let them all fight with each other. He thinks that is somehow shows who’s strong and who isn’t. What it is showing America is that they can’t get their act together. I mean, the CDC is Donald Trump. It’s his! It’s his! He owns the CDC. The guy who runs it is his appointee. Who, by the way, couldn’t get the job under Bush because they vetted him and said we don’t want him.” Wallace said, “Claire, you just hit the nail on the proverbial head here. He’s not going to be judged in November on how many of his own executive branch officials he had fired and smeared on “Fox and Friends.” He’s going to be judged on how well he took control and helmed the CDC when the test was not up to par and redirected HHS when it first it wasn’t doing everything it needed to do and took control of the WHO and demanded more transparency from China and got on the phone with the European leaders and said let ban together. He’s not going to be judged on how well he acted like he was still a buffoon on reality TV show and fired people that worked for him. This is his team. He will sink or die politically based on how well he runs the pandemic response team. Do you think anyone has explained that to him, Claire?” McCaskill said, “I don’t think he gets that part. When Peter Navarro goes on TV and criticizes the CDC, it is just as if Peter Navarro stood and looked at the camera and said, You know Trump sucks. It’s the same thing. The CDC is Trump. HHS is Trump. Azar is Trump. You know, Seema Verma is Trump. They’re all Trump. And by the way, the CDC was working at the WHO during the period in question, they had dozens of people embedded in the WHO so why weren’t they exposing China’s lies. It is really is just a comedy of errors. It’s worse than a circling firing squad because people are dying.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Chinese state media seized upon a rumor that U.S. President Donald Trump could restore partial funding to the World Health Organization as proof the U.S. is “calculating and stingy.” The charge is a tricky one for even Chinese Communist propagandists to lob in this particular instance, since Trump is reportedly thinking about funding W.H.O. at exactly the same level China does, instead of fully restoring American contributions that were many times larger. China’s state-run Global Times noted that if the policy outlined in a leaked draft letter from Trump to W.H.O. Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus is implemented as described, the U.S. will “agree to pay up to what China pays in assessed contributions” to W.H.O. China usually loves to brag about how rich and powerful it has become, but at times such as these, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) suddenly begins posturing as an impoverished Third World nation: In the WHO, the amount each member state must pay is relative to the country’s wealth and population. According to data from the World Bank in 2018, the US ranked 10th in terms of GDP per capita worldwide, while China ranked only 72nd. There is a wide gap between China and the US in terms of GDP per capita, and yet Trump has repeatedly compared China with the US for fear that China will take any advantage from the organization. Trump tweeted Sunday that China, with “a population much bigger than ours,” is paying a “tiny fraction” to WHO, the UN and the WTO. WTO Director-General Roberto Azevedo said Thursday that he would resign and Trump responded that he was “OK with it,” saying that “China gets a lot of the benefits that the US doesn’t get” from the WTO. The US is calculating, and this has been manifested in many aspects. For example, the Trump administration has willfully withdrawn from the Paris Agreement because of an “unfair economic burden,” seriously damaging global efforts to combat global warming. The US has shocked the world in its mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Even former US president Barack Obama said Saturday that many “folks” in charge “aren’t even pretending to be in charge.” What the US is doing is repeatedly disregarding other countries’ interests for its own benefits and undermining the international system. Naturally, the Global Times skipped over the reason for freezing, and perhaps permanently cutting, American funding to W.H.O.: the disturbing and dangerous degree of political influence Beijing wields over W.H.O. despite contributing only a tenth as much as America does. As President Trump wrote in the leaked alleged draft letter to Tedros, “China owes a massive debt to the entire world, and it can start with paying its fair share to the W.H.O.” “If China increases its funding to the W.H.O., we will consider matching those increases,” Trump added in the letter. Speculation about what Trump will do with W.H.O. funding has varied over the weekend, with some sources saying the president is “skeptical” of the proposal to “provide reduced funding to the W.H.O. on par with what China contributes,” as the Wall Street Journal put it on Sunday. When Lou Dobbs of Fox Business Network criticized the partial funding idea by asking which country Trump’s advisers are working for, the president responded to him directly on Twitter, saying, “Lou, this is just one of numerous concepts being considered under which we would pay 10% of what we have been paying over many years, matching much lower China payments. Have not made final decision. All funds are frozen.”

Fox Business Network host Neil Cavuto expressed shock over President Donald Trump’s announcement Monday that he is taking hydroxychloroquine as a preventative measure against the Chinese coronavirus, warning that the drug could kill certain people taking it. President Trump told reporters at the White House that he’s been taking hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malaria drug, saying that he’s been consuming one tablet daily for about a week and a half. The president also revealed that he is taking zinc. “A number of studies, those certainly vulnerable in the population have one thing to lose, their lives,” Cavuto said on his program following President Trump’s announcement. “A VA study showed that among a population of veterans in a hospital receiving this treatment, those with vulnerable conditions, respiratory conditions, heart elements, they died.”  “Those who took it, in a vulnerable population, including those with respiratory or other conditions, they died,” the Fox Business Network host continued. “I want to stress again — they died. If you are in a risky population here and you are taking this as a preventative treatment to ward off the virus or, in a worst-case scenario, you are dealing with the virus, and you are in this vulnerable population, it will kill you. I cannot stress that enough. This will kill you.” “So again, whatever benefit the president says this has — and certainly has had for those suffering from malaria, dealing with lupus — this is a leap that should not be taken casually by those watching at home or assuming, ‘well, the President of the United States says it’s okay,’” he added. Adding zinc to hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin might help the drug combination resolve some COVID-19 symptoms, a study posted online this week said, though experts say the two-drug treatment’s benefit is questionable and carries health risks. The findings breathe new life into a treatment regimen that has been touted by political and business leaders even before the results of clinical trials were in, experts said Wednesday. Studies to date have indicated that the combination offers limited benefits at best, with potentially dangerous side effects. “There is currently no highly effective agent for COVID-19 that we are aware of,” Dr. Joseph O. Rahimian, an infectious disease specialist at New York University Langone Health and co-author of the zinc study, told UPI. “It may end up that optimal treatment will include multiple agents and that zinc may be a part of a treatment ‘cocktail,'” he said. Historically, hydroxychloroquine has been used to treat malaria, while azithromycin is a commonly used antibiotic. Both have been studied in numerous clinical trials since the start of the outbreak of the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. To date, research has yielded mixed results. Last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a warning about “life-threatening” side effects associated with hydroxychloroquine and advised that the drug only be used in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. The UPI contributed to this report. 

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Monday called for “national contact tracing” program in response to President Trump’s call to reopen the country. “Once again: You can’t just ‘re-open’ our economy with a tweet,” Warren said, referencing Trump’s tweets to “REOPEN OUR COUNTRY!” and “TRANSITION TO GREATNESS.” “You need to do the work, day in and day out, to make sure that our communities can stay safe,” she continued. “And that means—to start—implementing programs like widespread testing and national contact tracing”: Once again: You can’t just “re-open” our economy with a tweet. You need to do the work, day in and day out, to make sure that our communities can stay safe. And that means—to start—implementing programs like widespread testing and national contact tracing. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) May 18, 2020  Contract tracing involves monitoring and tracing the contacts of individuals who have been infected by the novel coronavirus — a method many critics view as a slippery slope and an assault on privacy. The British government has already embraced the concept, introducing a contract tracing app, which stores user data on government servers. As Breitbart News reported: The app was developed by NHSX (the digital arm of the country’s socialised medical system) alongside the GCHQ intelligence agency. The app will store user data on centralised government servers rather than taking the decentralised approach advocated by Apple and Google, which are also developing a contact tracing app for other countries. Other nations in Europe including Germany, Switzerland, Estonia, Austria, and the Republic of Ireland have all opted for a decentralised system of contact tracing, in which data is stored locally on a user’s device, not sent to a central or government server. House Democrats, meanwhile, are promoting the COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone Act (TRACE Act), or  H.R. 6666, which authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to “award grants to eligible entities to conduct diagnostic testing for COVID–19, and related activities such as contact tracing, through mobile health units and, as necessary, at individuals’ residences.” Per the proposal, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) would issue $100 billion in grants to entities — including federally qualified health centers, school-based health clinics, academic medical centers, and non-profits — to conduct extensive contact tracing, which could lead workers straight to an individual’s doorstep. “Until we have a vaccine to defeat this dreaded disease, contact tracing in order to understand the full breadth and depth of the spread of this virus is the only way we will be able to get out from under this,” Rep. Bobby L. Rush (D-IL), who introduced the measure, said. He added: The COVID-19 TRACE Act will allow us to do this by creating a $100 billion dollar grant program for local organizations to hire, train, and pay individuals and to purchase supplies to run mobile testing units and door-to-door outreach as is safe and necessary, with special preference being given to those operating in hot spots and medically underserved communities, as well as those entities who commit to hiring from these neighborhoods. “This is nothing but a massive government surveillance program cloaked in a cure-the-coronavirus label,” the Washington Times’ Cheryl K. Chumley said of the proposal. Rush has rejected the strong opposition of critics, claiming that there is “nothing in this bill that will threaten anyone’s individual liberties”: Question: How can we ensure our liberties will be preserved?  Answer: I have spent my entire life fighting for the liberty of my community & others. There is nothing in this bill that will threaten anyone's individual liberties. Again, this bill is about increasing testing. https://t.co/63pt42plvY — Bobby L. Rush (@RepBobbyRush) May 12, 2020  H.R. 6666, dubbed the “devil” coronavirus bill, has several well-known progressive co-sponsors, including Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), Ro Khanna (D-CA), and Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL). Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) this month also outlined the need for “comprehensive contact tracing.” Without that and widespread testing, “consumers won’t have the confidence needed to jump-start our economy,” he warned during Friday’s Democratic weekly address.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) is seeking applicants for her new “Return to Learning Advisory Council,” but interested residents will first be quizzed about their gender, race, and whether they’re a member of the LGBTQ community. WILX reported: The panel – which will be comprised of students, parents, frontline educators, administrators and public health officials – will be tasked with providing the COVID-19 Task Force on Education within the State Emergency Operations Center with recommendations on how to safely, equitably, and efficiently return to school in the Fall. The State of Michigan will also partner with a national nonprofit organization called Opportunity Labs to bring national expertise to this project. “This panel will use a data-informed and science-based approach with input from epidemiologists to determine if, when, and how students can return to school this fall and what that will look like,” Whitmer said. On the application, a “Gender” response is required, according to the application found on Whitmer’s official website. Two options are available: Male and Female. Applicants are also asked their race, but a response does not appear to be required. The next question is “Are you a member of the LGBTQ community?” The answer options are “Yes,” “No,” or, “Prefer not to say.” The request for personal information, which could be used to fill quotas championed by progressives, comes as the Michigan State Police (MSP) is being sued by troopers who allege the agency is creating hiring quotas based on gender and race. Michael Caldwell and Robert Hahn filed suit against the MSP, alleging Director Joe Gasper last year told command officers that the department was “way too white and way too male,” the Detroit Free Press reported. “He then revealed that as part of the affirmative action directive the MSP was to set aside 25% of the positions within the MSP for minorities and 20% for females,” according to the lawsuit, Mlive said. A 2006 constitutional amendment passed by voters forbids the hiring of government workers based on gender or race. “The state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting,” the state Constitution reads, according to Mlive.

SALEM, Ore. (AP) — A county judge has declared Oregon Gov. Kate Brown’s coronavirus restrictions “null and void” because she didn’t have her emergency orders approved by the Legislature. Baker County Circuit Judge Matthew Shirtcliff made the ruling Monday in a lawsuit brought by churches that had sued saying the social-distancing directives were unconstitutional. The suit had also argued that emergency powers only last for a month and after that Brown would have needed legislative approval. The judge agreed. Brown said she would immediately appeal the ruling to the state Supreme Court to try to keep the emergency orders in effect.
“This will ensure we can continue to safeguard the health of all Oregonians — including frontline health care workers, those living in nursing homes, workers in agriculture and food processing plants, and Oregonians with underlying health conditions –– while the legal process moves forward,” Brown said. Ray Hacke, the attorney who represented the plaintiffs in the case, said in a phone interview Monday the ruling invalidates Brown’s ban on churches gathering for worship but also the entire stay-at-home order, Hacke said. Common Sense intervened after the Sacramento-based Pacific Justice Institute filed the case earlier this month on behalf of Oregon businesses, expanding the scope, he said. “The stay-at-home order is no longer in effect. It is invalidated. If people want to get their haircut, they can. They can leave their home for any reason whether it’s deemed essential in the eye of the state or not,” he said. He added that the ruling was a vindication not just for freedom of religion, but for all Oregonians’ freedoms. “Praise God. I’m excited, and I’m glad that the judge saw that there are limitations on the governor’s power, even in the midst of emergencies,” he said. Shirtcliff, the judge, was the district attorney of Baker County from 2001 until Brown appointed him judge last September, with the appointment having taken effect on Nov. 1.

Tighter U.S. border security to stop the spread of the coronavirus has led to a decrease in illegal immigration, including along the northern border with Canada. Like the U.S., Canada has also put in place the policy of turning migrants back immediately, according to the Associated Press (AP): Five Mexican citizens apprehended this week after illegally entering the United States in remote northern Maine were returned to Canada within hours under a rule put into place as part of the U.S. government response to the COVID-19 pandemic. While the restrictions haven’t ended illegal immigration into the United States from Canada, the emergency policy has all but ended the use of Roxham Road in Champlain, New York — one of the most well-known routes used by people fleeing the U.S. to seek asylum in Canada. President Donald Trump closed the borders with Mexico and Canada to all-but-essential traffic in March. For those entering illegally or seeking asylum, the administration has suspended immigration laws on public health grounds, giving border officials authority to rapidly expel them. The order from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) allows “rapid expulsions” along the Mexican and Canadian borders and is set to expire on May 21, but administration officials could extend it, according to AP. AP noted that the “vast majority” of expulsions have taken place along the southern border with Mexico, with Customs and Border Protection (CBP) reporting that since Trump tightened the borders in March up to the end of April more than 20,000 people were returned to Mexico. That number for the same time period was 27 migrants trying to enter the U.S. along the northern border who were returned to Canada, AP reported. The report also said: One of the first instances of returning northern border crossers came on March 21, the day the policy was implemented, when border patrol agents in Richford, Vermont, apprehended six individuals who had just illegally entered the U.S. from Canada. They were returned to Canada the same day. Amnesty International Canada joined a lawsuit challenging the “safe third country agreement” that allows northbound migrants to seek asylum in Canada. “The terms of the arrangement between Canada and the U.S. have never been publicly disclosed, and thus it is unclear how Canada is ensuring that it will not be complicit in any violations committed by American authorities,” Justin Mohammed said Friday in an emailed statement to AP. But Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies for the Washington-based Center for Immigration Studies, said on Friday that the reduction in illegal immigration is a positive development. “It’s pretty clear the main reason for this is the policies,” Vaughn said. “They are not going to get away with making asylum claims, they are not going to be able to game the system.” The AP reported that “tens of thousands” of migrants who couldn’t get “safe haven” in the United States headed to Canada, including many along Roxham Road in New York that leads to the Canadian border. Before the coronavirus pandemic the illegal crossers were arrested by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and allowed to apply for asylum. Most were released into Canada to wait for their application to be processed. But, like the U.S., Canadian officials have tightened border security in the wake of the pandemic.  “In an email response to questions, the Canada Border Services Agency said that between March 21 and May 13, 26 asylum seekers were returned to the U.S., including 21 “irregular” border crossers — 14 in Quebec and nine in British Columbia. The other three asylum seekers presented at a port of entry in southern Ontario and were sent back to the U.S.,” AP reported. “Two other asylum seekers were allowed to enter Canada under exceptions to the rule that include being an unaccompanied minor or a U.S. citizen seeking to make an asylum claim in Canada.” Follow Penny Starr on Twitter

The Florida Keys will reopen to tourists starting June 1, allowing hotels to resume business at 50 percent capacity, Monroe County officials said. The county added that checkpoint screenings to gain access to the Keys by road will also be removed, and bus restrictions and airport screenings will be eliminated, the South Florida Sun-Sentinel reported. The Miami Herald reported that as of Sunday, the Keys had 100 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, 3 deaths, and 12 hospitalizations. “Should the Florida Keys experience an increase in cases and under the advisement of the Florida Department of Health, restrictions may be heightened, and amenities may again be closed,” county spokesperson Kristen Livengood said. The decision to reopen was made because of the Keys’ low coronavirus infection rate compared to neighboring Miami-Dade and Broward counties. Livengood said the only new cases in the past week came from an upper Keys nursing home. The Keys have been closed to nonresidents or people who do not own property in the area since March 22. Airports in Key West and Marathon currently remain open, but passengers are screened upon arrival and advised to self-quarantine for 14 days. On March 27, checkpoints onto roads into the Keys were added to keep tourists and nonresidents out. Officials announced the June 1 reopening plan Sunday night, when Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said gyms could reopen, and restaurants could operate their dine-in services at 50 percent capacity.

Appearing Monday on MSNBC, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms (D) conceded that the reopening of Georgia is “not as bad as I thought it would be” after harshly criticizing Gov. Brian Kemp’s (R) decision to lift the state’s stay-at-home order.  BRIAN WILLIAMS: Mayor, I believe I remember when we were talking to you prior to the quote-on-quote reopening of Georgia, which as we know, was very early, and let’s also remember there’s a robust conversation going on about the quality of the numbers we’re all getting out of the state of Georgia, but I think I remember you saying that you hoped to be wrong, that you hoped the situation would be better than you feared. You also said if you were, in fact, wrong, you would say to the governor, “I was wrong.” Is it a little muddier than being able to say, “I was right” or “I was wrong”? Are we as of the time of this conversation somewhere in the middle, do you think? MAYOR KEISHA LANCE BOTTOMS: What I can say is it’s not as bad as I thought that it would be. I am pleased about that. But I still think it’s too soon to say. The reason being, whereas initially, we were seeing increases between deaths and people testing positive, rising anywhere from 25 to 30 percent over a seven-day period. Right now we’re somewhere between 12 and 15%. And it’s better than it was, but it’s still not great. We’ve still not seen that 14-day decline, as recommended by the CDC. We’re not quite there where I can say that we are out of the woods, because we are not. Because what we know, as we reopen this state, we’ll also see whether or not this impacts our number of people who are testing positive.

The biggest sports news of the day, may have come from the nation’s two biggest states. On Monday, the governors of California, New York, and Texas, announced that pro sports leagues could begin returning to normal business operations within the next few weeks. Texas Governor Greg Abbott announced that professional sports could return in the Lone Star State, without fans, on May 31st. Governor Gavin Newsom said that his sports without fans could resume in California in the “first week or so of June.” Earlier in the day, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo also encouraged sports leagues to play ball, without fans. “Hockey, basketball, baseball, football — whoever can reopen — we’re a ready, willing and able partner,” Cuomo said. “I think this is in the best interest of all the people and the best interest of the state of New York.” The governors remarks come after the UFC and NASCAR made their return last week. New York is home to two Major League Baseball teams who hope to be playing after Commissioner Manfred pitches a new pay structure that would pave the way for a resumption of play in early July. The NFL has also given its teams permission to open their facilities this week. However, teams must still comply with local quarantine and social distancing restrictions in their respective states. While Texas has been on a path toward reopening for some time, the change in attitude in California and New York, two of the most restrictive states in the country, can likely be attributed to financial fears. Several teams in  New York and California had begun exploring relocation options in places like Texas or Florida, if policies in their home states had not changed.

President Donald Trump on Monday confirmed at the White House that he was taking hydroxychloroquine and zinc as preventatives against the coronavirus. “I happen to be taking it. I’m taking it. Hydroxychloroquine. Right now, yeah,” he said. Trump said that he had been taking the medicine for about a week and a half. “I’m taking the two, the zinc and the hydroxy, and all I can tell you is, so far I seem to be ok,” Trump said. He said that a doctor and many others had sent him positive letters about the effectiveness of the drug. “I’ve heard a lot of good stories and if it is not good, I will tell you right,” he said. “I’m not going to get hurt by it.” The president spoke to reporters about the drug on Monday afternoon at a White House roundtable with restaurant owners. “I’m still here,” he said, saying that he had “zero symptoms” from the drug or the virus. The president said that he consulted with the White House doctor before taking it, who said it would be all right to take it if he wanted. He said that he would not profit from any use of the drug, but wanted the country to know that it was fine to take. “I want the people of this nation to feel good, I don’t want them being sick and there’s a very good chance that this has an impact, especially early on,” Trump said. Corporate news outlets and many public health experts have criticized the president for weeks for talking about the drug as a cure for the virus. But the president appeared optimistic about its effects. “There’s a very good chance that this has an impact, especially early on,” Trump said. He said that even doctors and nurses were taking hydroxychloroquine as a preventative measure. “You know the expression that I’ve used … what do you have to lose?” he asked reporters. “What do you have to lose?”  

Former Vice President Joe Biden claimed Monday that President Donald Trump’s response to the deadly Chinese coronavirus pandemic has fanned the flames of “hate” and “fear” and “nakedly xenophobia” against Asian-Americans, according to The Hill. Biden leveled the accusations during his virtual remarks to Asian American and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) Victory Fund. The presumptive Democrat nominee said President Trump moved too slowly to combat the outbreak that originated in Wuhan, China, adding that his “denials, delays and distractions, many of which were nakedly xenophobic.” “The pandemic has unleashed familiar forces of hate, fear, and xenophobia that he always flames… that have always existed in this society,” the former vice president said. “But this president brought it with him, has brought with it a new rash of racial messages, verbal and physical attacks and other acts of hate, some subtle, some overt, against the Asian American and Pacific Islanders.” President Trump implemented a travel ban from China in January as part of an effort to prevent the virus from spreading in the U.S. Biden took aim at the action during a January 31 campaign event in Fort Madison, Iowa, calling the measure “hysterical xenophobia.” However, in an April statement to CNN, the Biden campaign reversed course by coming out in favor of the travel ban. “Joe Biden supports travel bans that are guided by medical experts, advocated by public health officials, and backed by a full strategy,” Kate Bedingfeld, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, told the news outlet. “Science supported this ban, therefore he did, too.” Bedingfeld claimed that Biden’s accused of “xenophobia” referring to President Trump labeling the coronavirus the “Chinese virus.” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is among the various leading scientific experts who have praised the administration’s implementation of travel bans on China, saying the move “absolutely” helped prevent further spread of the disease.

Police made at least seven arrests and at least several police officers were injured in Florida after a weekend block party attended by 3,000 people went out of control, according to reports and video. The block party was being held for a man who was murdered in 2008, but a video released by the Volusia Sheriff’s Office showing the masses attending the block party on Saturday and Sunday in Deland, Florida, showed “things getting out of hand as day turned to night,” the New York Post reported. The West Volusia Beacon reported that although Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis’s executive order advises against large gatherings due to the coronavirus pandemic, no law is in place prohibiting such crowds. The gatherings were held to remember Kenya Alexander, who was killed in 2008, according to the Beacon. Police said they faced several obstacles in trying to control the crowd during the mayhem. Some of the issues law enforcement had to face include: “a long gun pointed out of the passenger window of a passing vehicle, a loaded gun handed off from one convicted felon to another, agitated crowds of bystanders and bottles, and jars and bar stools used against law enforcement as weapons or projectiles,” the Volusia County Sheriff’s Office said in a release. One deputy suffered a minor knee injury, and a police officer suffered a minor head injury when he was pelted in the head with the jar, WFTV reported. A 34-year-old man from Orlando was shot in the foot and got admitted to the hospital. Alphonso Parker, 27, and Charles Turner, 37, were two of the men arrested in the shooting, charged with resisting an officer without violence, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, and inciting a riot, WKMG reported. “Overall, deputies conducted 12 traffic stops, issued five citations, towed five vehicles, made seven arrests, recovered two firearms, some narcotics and $3,840 in cash,” Volusia County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Andrew Gant said.

President Donald Trump rejected an invitation to address a virtual gathering held by the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) on Monday and instead directed Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar to deliver a “blistering” speech criticizing the United Nations-backed agency’s failed handling to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, according to a report. Axios reports: The WHO extended an invitation earlier this month for Trump to speak at Monday’s virtual gathering of the World Health Assembly, according to two sources familiar with the situation. He delivered his rejection to the WHO leadership through the U.S. Mission in Geneva, according to these sources. […] Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar gave a blistering speech attacking the WHO. Azar said the WHO failed to obtain the information the world needed about COVID-19, “and that failure cost many lives.” Azar reportedly continued: “We saw that WHO failed at its core mission of information-sharing and transparency when member states do not act in good faith. This cannot ever happen again. The status quo is intolerable. WHO must change and it must become far more transparent and far more accountable.” Communist Chinese dictator Xi Jinping opted to accept W.H.O.’s invitation to the event and delivered a speech in which he announced that the regime would donate $2 billion in aid to combat the pandemic. The development follows an Axios report stating that President Trump is “leaning toward” maintaining his administration’s freeze on U.S. funding for the W.H.O. On Friday, Fox News Channel’s Tucker Carlson Tonight, first reported that the White House had drafted a letter on a planned partial refunding of the W.H.O., which reads that the U.S. “will continue to partner and work with the World Health Organization and agree to pay up to what China pays in assessed contributions.” The letter reportedly reads: “Despite [its] shortcomings, I believe that the W.H.O. still has tremendous potential, and want to see the W.H.O live up to this potential, particularly now during this global crisis” and “That is why I’ve decided that the United States will continue to partner and work with the World Health Organization and agree to pay up to what China pays in assessed contributions.” The letter also slammed the W.HO.’s response to the coronavirus and advocated for the organization to undergo various reforms. President Trump announced April 14 that his administration would place a hold on funding to the W.H.O., citing the organization’s slow response to the coronavirus outbreak and its cozy relationship with China. “Had the WHO done its job to get medical experts into China to objectively assess the situation on the ground and to call out China’s lack of transparency, the outbreak could have been contained at its source with very little death,” the president said at the time. “This would have saved thousands of lives and avoided worldwide economic damage. Instead, the WHO willingly took China’s assurances to face value… and defended the actions of the Chinese government.” As Breitbart News reported, “The W.H.O. claimed in January that ‘preliminary investigations’ by China found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the virus in Wuhan. Further, the organization called on countries to keep borders open despite labeling the massive outbreak as a global emergency.” Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in #Wuhan, #China🇳. pic.twitter.com/Fnl5P877VG — World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) January 14, 2020  U.S. taxpayers dished out roughly $400 million to the W.H.O. last year compared to China’s $86 million. In late April, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced it would pledge another $30 million to the organization. Earlier May, the German newspaper Der Spiegel reported that Xi pressured embattled W.HO. chief, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, during a phone call to withhold information regarding human-to-human transmission of the virus and delay declaring a pandemic. In response, the U.N. agency claimed Tedros and Xi “have never spoken by phone” and stated that “such inaccurate reports distract and detract from WHO’s and the world’s efforts to end the COVID-19 pandemic.”

Aaron Rodgers had no objection when it came to quarantines designed to flatten the curve. However, when it comes to what seems like quarantines “until a cure is found,” the Green Bay signal-caller says the restrictions seem more like “house arrest.” Recently, during a conference call with Packers reporters, Rodgers was asked whether he felt safe returning to NFL play. “I think we all were buying into the idea of quarantine to flatten the curve,” Rodgers said. “And, I think there are a lot of questions now that it’s more of a house arrest to find a cure with people wondering exactly what that means as far as the future of the country and the freedoms we’re allowed to have at this point.” Rodgers added, “I’m very hopeful that we can have a season.” Rodgers continued, “I think the important thing to think about, though, which is more important than that is the state of the country and the fact that we have 36-plus million people on unemployment right now; you have obviously rising poverty levels to go along with the unemployment, you have suicide hotline is up 8,000 percent. “There’s really a lot of problems going on in the country right now associated with the fear around this pandemic, and I hope that we can use some common sense moving forward and make decisions that are going to be in the best interest of all people moving forward. And, I hope that sports is a part of that at some point.” The NFL has given its teams permission to open their facilities this week. However, teams must still comply with local quarantine and social distancing restrictions in their respective states. Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn

Illinois businesses that reopen in defiance of Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s (D) stay-at-home order may face a Class A misdemeanor charge, resulting in a fine of up to $2,500 and jail time, per the governor’s emergency filing. On Friday, Pritzker filed an emergency rule, which his spokesperson said will serve as an “additional enforcement tool for businesses that refuse to comply with the most critical aspects of the stay-at-home order.” Businesses, including restaurants, salons, and gyms, could now face a Class A misdemeanor charge, resulting in up to a year in jail or a fine as much as $2,500. “Law enforcement has relied heavily on educating business owners about the order and always first discusses the regulations with business owners to urge compliance,” Jordan Abudayyeh, a spokeswoman for the governor, said. “Only businesses that pose a serious risk to public health and refuse to comply with health regulations would be issued a citation,” she continued. “The rule gives law enforcement a tool that may be more appropriate and less severe than closing the business altogether,” Abudayyeh added. Ann Spillane, general counsel to Pritzker’s administration, likened the charge to a “traffic ticket.” “Nobody’s getting arrested or handcuffed,” she assured. “But they are getting a citation where they would have to go to court.” State Rep. Jim Durkin (R) slammed the administration’s move, deeming it “beyond the scope of the governor’s authority.” “It will be a dark day in Illinois when we charge small businesses with a jailable crime for salvaging their livelihoods,” he said in a statement on Sunday. All regions of Illinois remain under a stay-at-home order for May, which permits nonessential retail stores to operate via curbside pickup and delivery only. Religious gatherings are also limited to groups of ten or fewer under phase two of the governor’s five-phase plan, and personal care services and health clubs are instructed to remain closed. Nonessential travel also remains “discouraged.” Pritzker admitted last week that, despite his restrictions, his wife has been traveling, spending weeks at their $12.1 million equestrian estate in South Florida and visiting their farm in Wisconsin, where the state’s Supreme Court struck down Gov. Tony Evers’ (D) stay-at-home order. “My wife and daughter were down in Florida in early March and, in fact even a little before that, and you know, they sheltered in place when the stay-at-home order came up,” he said last week. “And they stayed there until very recently, so you know we’ll say, you know, we have a working farm. They’re there now. There are animals on that farm,” he said, adding that it is “an essential function to take care of animals at a farm”: WATCH: @govpritzker asked where his family has been during stay at home order. He admits they were in FL at one of their homes…and then traveled to another one of their homes in WI…to take care of farm animals. #twill pic.twitter.com/t95egrJ9kO — Illinois Rising Action (@ILRisingAction) May 15, 2020  “A Pritzker spokeswoman later clarified that the family is at home in Chicago and have visited the farm but haven’t stayed there,” the Chicago Tribune reported. This is not the first time Pritzker has issued threats to local leaders and business owners. “There were leaders in the legal community this morning that spoke about the challenges that will be brought to those local law enforcement to local governments and to businesses that are open,” he said on Thursday. “They’re putting people at risk, they’re making their communities unsafe, and they’ll be subject to liability as a result,” he added. The warning prompted a swift response from the Illinois Sheriffs’ Association, which blasted the governor’s threat as “outrageous.” “Illinois Sheriffs have been elected by their local citizens to keep their communities safe, a trust that every sheriff and sworn law enforcement officer holds dear,” Illinois Sheriffs’ Association President Jim Kaitschuk said last week.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) on Monday warned people who attempt to swim at the city’s public beaches Memorial Day weekend will be removed from the water as part of an effort to combat further spreading of the Chinese coronavirus. De Blasio said that New York City will begin installing fencing along the city’s beaches and asked residents to avoid large gatherings, and playing sports. Lifeguards will also be prohibited from being on duty. “Anyone tries to get in the water, they’ll be taken right out of the water,” De Blasio said. “It’s a dangerous situation to ever go in the water if there are no lifeguards present,” he added. Though Big Apple beaches are closed for Memorial Day weekend, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo will allow beaches in other parts of the state to open. Beaches in Connecticut, Delaware, and New Jersey are also opening this coming weekend. As of Monday, New York City has over 193,000 coronavirus cases and 15,786 deaths, according to data tracked via Johns Hopkins University. Half of New York state’s 10 regions began reopening their economies Friday as New York City’s mayor said local officials are formulating how to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic in upcoming hot summer weather. Cuomo, at his daily briefing in Albany, announced that five of the state’s 10 regions have moved on from the restrictions of the statewide “NY Pause” order prohibiting all non-essential work. But while the upstate regions of Central New York, Mohawk Valley, Finger Lakes, North Country, and the Southern Tier are reopening Friday, non-essential businesses in New York City, its surrounding suburbs, and several other areas will remain closed. The Pause order was extended through May 28 for regions not meeting enough health criteria to allow for reopenings, but the areas can move on at any time if they meet them, Cuomo said. The UPI contributed to this report. 

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) told reporters Monday morning in Albany that the state was now making nursing homes its “top priority” — nearly two months after a directive requiring them to take in coronavirus patients. The New York Times has reported that more than one-third of all coronavirus deaths in the U.S. have occurred at nursing homes. In some states, more than half of coronavirus fatalities have occurred at nursing home facilities. That is partly because the elderly are more vulnerable to the disease. However, it is also partly because governors in several states — notably, New York — required nursing homes to accept coronavirus patients referred to them. As Michael Goodwin pointed out on Saturday in the New York Post: “The 5,500 nursing-home deaths in New York are more than the total deaths in all other states except New Jersey.” Florida, by contrast, had a relatively low number of nursing home deaths despite having a large elderly population. There, Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) allowed nursing homes to reject coronavirus patients. Not so in New York, where Gov. Cuomo issued a directive on March 25 prohibiting nursing homes from turning away coronavirus patients or even testing new arrivals for the potentially deadly virus. Last Sunday, Cuomo changed his policy to prevent coronavirus patients from being discharged to nursing homes. And on Monday, Cuomo declared: ‘We now have a top priority, which we had from day one, which is our nursing homes.” After forcing nursing homes to take in COVID-19 patients in March and only stopping it in May, Gov. Andrew Cuomo states: "We now have a top priority, which we had from day one, which is our nursing homes." pic.twitter.com/KdzzGlQtE6 — Julio Rosas (@Julio_Rosas11) May 18, 2020  He noted that nursing homes housed “the most vulnerable population in these most vulnerable place — senior citizens in a congregate facility.” He noted that nursing home residents in Washington State had been among the earliest victims of the coronavirus. Somehow, that did not factor into his decision-making in March. Cuomo said that nursing home staff would be required to be tested twice per week, both to protect them and provide early warnings of outbreaks. He called it the “most aggressive standard in the nation.” “We drew bad cards in this hand,” he added, referring to coronavirus in general. New York did have the highest number of cases. Not because we did anything wrong, but because the virus fooled everyone.” Joel B.

Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker (R) on Monday introduced a four-phase approach to reopening, announcing that the Bay State can begin moving into the first phase immediately. “Starting today, based on current public health data and trends, Massachusetts will begin Phase 1 of a cautious reopening, and workplaces that are permitted to open are required to follow new safety protocols and guidance,” a release announcing the decision reads: Today, we're releasing "Reopening Massachusetts," the report of our Reopening Advisory Board.  The report details a four-phased strategy to responsibly reopen businesses and activities while continuing to fight #COVID19MA ⏩More about reopening: https://t.co/L5FAI0K3Js pic.twitter.com/wiih2fRw3E — Charlie Baker (@MassGovernor) May 18, 2020  The plan, titled “Reopening Massachusetts,” details a four-phase approach to reopening the state. Massachusetts can begin entering the first phase today, allowing manufacturing facilities and construction sites to reopen with “applicable guidelines.” Places of worship will also be allowed to open “with guidelines that require social distancing and encourage services to be held outdoors,” according to the plan. Additionally, hospitals and community health centers “that attest to specific public health and safety standards can begin to provide high priority preventative care, pediatric care and treatment for high risk patients.” More businesses will be able to operate in Phase 1 beginning Monday, May 25, including office and lab spaces. Personal services will remain limited, with hair salons, car washes, and pet grooming facilities adhering to strict guidelines and operating by appointment only. Beaches, parks, drive-in theaters, zoos, “select athletic fields and courts,” and outdoor gardens will also be allowed to reopen on May 25 as well, with certain restrictions in place. The following phase will focus on reopening retail stores and restaurants with limited capacities, and Phase 3 will incorporate gyms and bars. The final phase will address larger venues and nightclubs, per the guidance. Baker’s administration estimates that each phase will last “a minimum of three weeks and could last longer before moving to the next phase.” “If public health data trends are negative, specific industries, regions, and/or the entire Commonwealth may need to return to an earlier phase,” the state’s website adds. The administration also announced an updated “Safer At Home” Advisory, instructing vulnerable individuals to remain at home except for essential errands, urging residents to leave home “only for healthcare, worship and permitted work, shopping, and outdoor activities,” and requiring everyone to wear a mask in public spaces where social distancing is not feasible: ⏩@MassDPH is also releasing a new “Safer At Home” Advisory, which instructs residents to stay at home unless engaging with newly opened activities, as a way to continue limiting the spread of COVID-19. 🏡Read that advisory here: https://t.co/xmLKbDv6C6 — Charlie Baker (@MassGovernor) May 18, 2020  The Bay State reported 86,010 confirmed cases of the virus and 5,797 related deaths as of Monday afternoon.

President Donald Trump on Monday voiced optimism about the testing results of the coronavirus vaccine from Moderna. “It’s incredible what they can do, and I’ve seen results and the results are staggeringly good,” Trump said. The stock market jumped 890 points after news of the Moderna vaccine was released on Monday morning. The company announced that its preliminary test of the vaccine was successful and would move into phase two of testing. The president appeared delighted by the news, speaking to reporters after meeting with Sen. Tim Scott and other advisors about economic Opportunity Zones in urban communities. “You’re seeing it maybe today for the first time where not only are the markets up tremendously, but we’ve had tremendous, tremendously good and positive information on therapeutics, on cures and on vaccines,” he said. He said the United States had some of the best scientists, doctors, and researchers working on coming up with a vaccine. “I think you’re going to have the ‘v,'” Trump said, referring to a spike in economic activity after the coronavirus-fueled economic plunge. “I think it’s going to be terrific.” The president said that the economic third quarter would be difficult, but that 2021 would be much better. “2021 is going to be amazing,” Scott agreed. “This is a very big day, this feels much different than Friday,” Trump said, referring to last week’s market plunge of over 600 points.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has told sports league sin his state to start getting ready to reopen. Speaking at his daily press briefing on Monday, the governor signaled that it was “in the best interest” of New Yorkers to have their sports teams playing. “Hockey, basketball, baseball, football — whoever can reopen — we’re a ready, willing and able partner,” Cuomo said. “I think this is in the best interest of all the people and the best interest of the state of New York.” The governor’s remarks come after the UFC and NASCAR made their return last week. New York is home to two Major League Baseball teams who hope to be playing after Commissioner Manfred pitches a new pay structure that would pave the way for a resumption of play in early July. The NFL has also given its teams permission to open their facilities this week. However, teams must still comply with local quarantine and social distancing restrictions in their respective states. “Personal disclosure, I want to watch the Buffalo Bills,” Cuomo cracked.

Emory & Henry College in Virginia has invited prospective students to tour their campuses from their vehicles. The modified campus tour is just one of many ways American universities and colleges have adjusted their programming in response to the ongoing Chinese virus pandemic. According to a local news report, Emory & Henry College in Emory, Virginia, has devised a new way for students to tour their campuses that upholds social distancing measures. Prospective students have been invited to tour the campus from their cars with the guidance of a YouTube video created by students that typically offer campus tours. Emory & Henrey President Dr. John W. Wells explained that he decided to keep their campus open so that prospective students would have the opportunity to continue their college search during the pandemic. “While our buildings are closed, our campus is open for students to see,” Wells said. “We respect the Virginia governor’s orders to stay at home to stop the spread of COVID-19, and we want families to know this is an option to continue your college search process.” Breitbart News reported earlier in May that the University of California, San Diego, plans to utilize rapid testing kits to mitigate the spread of the virus when campus reopens this fall. The university will also offer “isolation housing” for students that test positive for the virus. Stay tuned to Breitbart News for more updates on this story.

Left-wing actor Jim Carrey channeled the 1980 horror film The Shining in his latest political painting, essentially blaming President Donald Trump and U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson for those killed by the Chinese coronavirus in their respective countries. “90,0000 in the US, over 40,000 in the UK. Highest death tolls in the COVID world,” tweeted Jim Carrey alongside a political painting, which featured President Trump and Prime Minister Johnson as the infamous ghost twins from The Shining. “Half of those deaths…preventable,” added the Liar Liar actor. “REDRUM! REDRUM!! REDRUM!!!” 90,0000 in the US, over 40,000 in the UK. Highest death tolls in the covid world. Half of those deaths…preventable. REDRUM! REDRUM!! REDRUM!!! pic.twitter.com/swu7FYtdpQ — Jim Carrey (@JimCarrey) May 17, 2020  In the film, while a young boy is in a trance, he shouts “redrum” — which is later discovered to mirror of the word “murder.” Carrey’s painting is just his latest political cartoon attacking the president over his efforts in stopping the spread of the Chinese coronavius, which originated in Wuhan, China, proliferating around the world, spreading disease, health care crises, and financial devastation. Last week, the Dumb and Dumber actor shared a painting of the grim reaper giving President Trump the middle finger, insinuating that the Angel of Death is “jealous” of the president and the Republican Party’s so-called “death count.” “Grim reaper officially jealous of Trump and GOP’s ability to double the death toll,” Carrey captioned the painting. In January, however, the 58-year-old actor swore that he stop making his anti-Trump political paintings. “I basically didn’t bring that into 2020 with me,” Carrey insisted. “That’s gone — pretty much, for the most part.” “I’ve said what I need to say, and I’ve allowed it to inhabit my body and cause whatever low vibrations do to a body,” he added. “You know, I sounded my yelp, I warned people, and that’s enough. They know how I feel.” But Carrey’s hiatus from bashing Trump with his paint brush didn’t last long. You can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo, and on Instagram.

Restaurants in 12 of Maine’s 16 counties reopened for dine-in services on Monday, as permitted by the state’s “Rural Reopening Plan” outlined by Gov. Janet Mills (D). Restaurants in 12 counties — Aroostook, Piscataquis, Hancock, Washington, Somerset, Franklin, Oxford, Kennebec, Waldo, Knox, Lincoln, and Sagadahoc — resumed dine-in services on Monday. According to the guidance, restaurant employees are required to wear masks, with an emphasis on frequent handwashing and hand sanitizing, “especially between contact with customers and customer items.” The guidance urges employees to maintain proper social distancing and suggests that restaurants stagger employee shifts “to avoid crowding in common work areas.” “Place signage at entrances and throughout the store alerting customers to COVID policies, especially to maintain 6 feet physical distance to the extent possible,” the guidance continues, adding that restaurants should only permit one member of a party to wait inside for a table. Additionally, menus must be sanitized after each use, and salad bars and buffets must remain nonoperational. Restaurants in the neighboring state of New Hampshire are permitted to reopen on Monday but for outdoor seating only. Maine, which has an estimated population of 1.3 million, has reported 1,713 cases of the novel coronavirus, 223 hospitalizations, and 71 related deaths during the pandemic.

Monday on Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends,” former President George W. Bush senior adviser Karl Rove said former President Barack Obama committed a “political drive-by shooting” with his veiled criticisms of President Donald Trump’s coronavirus response during a virtual commencement speech on Saturday. Co-host Brian Kilmeade said, “Karl, it was a bit surprising to see President Obama —for me anyway — to take a shot at President Trump in a virtual commencement address about his pandemic coverage. I thought he was supposed to be inspiring the next generation of graduates. I don’t know if that fits in, but it must sound familiar because … didn’t President Obama take countless shots at you and the Bush administration?” Rove said, “Well, yeah, but you put your finger on it. It is so unseemly for a former president to take the virtual commencement ceremony for a series of historically black colleges and universities and turn it into a political drive-by shooting.” He continued, “This is a moment where these young graduates who could be inspired to a life of service, to recognize that life is going to bring challenges in how we handle the challenges is going to demonstrate our character. There are lots of positive messages that the former president could have delivered.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Horror author and Hollywood producer Stephen King is worth an estimated $400 million. Inoculated from the effects of economic lockdowns that working-class families and entrepreneurs face, King is making light of the 90,000-plus already killed by the Chinese coronavirus while appearing to blame Trump supporters for their deaths. “Hey, MAGA fans! Almost 90,000 dead on your boy’s watch,” King said before asking “Is it enough yet, or do you need even more?” Hey, MAGA fans! Almost 90,000 dead on your boy's watch. Is it enough yet, or do you need even more? — Stephen King (@StephenKing) May 18, 2020  Stephen King is just the latest leftist Hollywood elitist to smear millions of Americans, many of whom are willing to risk contracting the Chinese coronavirus to go back to work. To feed their families. To support their communities. There’s even a growing list of states with Democrat governors who’ve reopened everything from businesses to places of worship and parks. Even Maine, where Stephen King was born and has lived for years, has announced a plan to reopen businesses. Other states — many of them populated by people who may never support the president — like Colorado Nevada, Wisconsin, Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts, Montana, and roughly half the counties in Pennsylvania — are open or opening up. But this is the same Stephen King who’s long hoped for President Trump to be removed from office. The same Stephen King who derided Trump as a “Mendacious, narcissistic, draft-dodging, chickenshitty, bullshitty, chauvanistic, pussy-grabbing, bullyragging, racist, overweening, tax-dodging, whiny, boastful, dictatorial, and semi-literate.” And it’s the same Stephen King who said Trump supporters “may be supporting a President who is an active or passive Russian asset.” Jerome Hudson is Breitbart News Entertainment Editor and author of the bestselling book 50 Things They Don’t Want You to Know. Order your copy today.

European cities have begun lifting lockdown restrictions for business after months of quarantine, but scenes taking place across the continent depict a “new normal” that would have seemed alien to people in pre-coronavirus Europe. On Monday, Italy began to ease its lockdown measures, some two months after the country became the epicentre for the coronavirus in Europe. Italians were finally allowed to frequent cafes, restaurants, shops, and bars after months of quarantine. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said that the country had to accept the risk that coronavirus cases may spike again, or Italy would not recover economically. “We’re facing a calculated risk in the knowledge that the contagion curve may rise again,” said Conte. “We have to accept it otherwise we will never be able to start up again,” he added. The scenes that unfolded on the first day were markedly different than pre-coronavirus Italy. Socially-distanced gondola rides in Venice, makeshift plexiglass pod-style restaurant seating in Milan, and masked hairdressers in Rome were all witnessed on Monday. The Chief Executive of Milan’s Rinascente department store, Pierluigi Cocchini, told the Evening Standard that his store will be taking extra precautions in opening up. Guards will track the number of customers in the store at a time through an app, and clothes that were tried on in changing rooms will be quarantined for a day before being restocked on the shelves. “It won’t be business as usual given all the protocols, but this is the new normal for now and we have to accept it,” Chocchini said.

Elsewhere in Europe, Ireland has begun opening up its golf courses and garden centres. Health Minister Simon Harris said that if the country can get the next three weeks right, “we as a country will find a way to live safely alongside the virus.” Greece, meanwhile, has opened the Acropolis and other archaeological sites to the public, with stickers and glass barriers separating tourists. Spain and Portugal have both begun easing lockdown restrictions as well.

Earlier this month the European Commission predicted that the bloc as a whole will face a 7.4 per cent loss in GDP in 2020 as a result of the pandemic. “Both the depth of the recession and the strength of the recovery will be uneven, conditioned by the speed at which lockdowns can be lifted, the importance of services like tourism in each economy and by each country’s financial resources,” said the EU’s Commissioner for Economy, Paolo Gentiloni. Countries like Italy, Greece, and Spain are expected to see 9 per cent declines in their economies, the Commission warned.

The number of new coronavirus cases in Pennsylvania dropped over the weekend — news which comes as the state slowly begins the process of reopening, county by county. The state, with a population of nearly 13 million, reported 623 new cases of the virus as of midnight on Sunday. That is 366 less than the 989 cases reported on Saturday. According to the York Daily Record, the state also saw a drop in coronavirus-related deaths, reporting 15 on Sunday — down from 61 reported the day prior. The updates come as Gov. Tom Wolf (D) slowly permits clusters of counties to move into the yellow phase of reopening. Only 37 counties are currently under this phase, which eases restrictions, allowing for some nonessential businesses to operate at a limited capacity. But even under the yellow phase, restaurants and bars are limited to takeout and delivery, and gyms and salons must remain closed. The governor announced last week that 12 additional counties can move from the lockdown phase to yellow on Friday, May 22. That will still leave 18 counties under the lockdown order, which is not set to expire until June 4. The red phase is the most restrictive, permitting travel exclusively for essential needs, and barring non-life essential businesses from operating. Pennsylvania reported 62,234 positive coronavirus cases and 4,418 related deaths as of Monday morning. According to the state health department’s data, 13,447 of those positive cases are among residents of nursing homes and personal care facilities, and another 2,091 cases are among employees of such facilities. Nearly 70 percent of the state’s coronavirus deaths — 3,057 of 4,418 as of Monday morning — are connected to nursing homes. Wolf has faced intense backlash from residents, many of whom gathered at the state Capitol on Friday to protest his “draconian” lockdown orders. “I’m here protesting Commie Tommy Tom Wolf,” one protester, Catherine Callahan, told Breitbart News. “I mean he’s a communist, and everything he has demonstrated for us today just proves that he is a communist,” she continued: “Threatening to take away licenses to open your business, your liquor licenses, et cetera. He is refusing to let people run their lives and feed their families,” she added. “This is America. This is not Stalinist Russia. But he is trying to turn Pennsylvania into his own makeshift Stalinist Russia, and we won’t stand for it.”

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) announced Monday that some retail businesses in northern Michigan can begin reopening on Friday as the governor continues to face heavy criticisms over her stringent lockdown measures. Bars and restaurants will also be allowed to reopen, with restrictions that include limiting capacity to 50 percent and keeping groups at least six feet apart. Waiters will be required to wear face masks. “The move will affect two of the eight regions identified in the governor’s gradual reopening plan amid the coronavirus pandemic: one covers the Upper Peninsula and another includes 17 counties in the northern Lower Peninsula, including Traverse City,” Wood TV 8 reports.
“This is a big step, but we must all remember to continue doing our part to protect ourselves and our families from the spread of COVID19,” said Whitmer. “The data shows that these regions in Michigan are seeing consistent encouraging trends when it comes to the number of cases, deaths, and the percent of tests that are positive for COVID-19,” Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, Chief Deputy Director for Health for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, said in a separate statement. The development comes after the Michigan House of Representatives and Senate sued Whitmer after she circumvented the legislature to extend the state of emergency declaration, alleging that the order is improper and invalid under state law. Whitmer, who is being floated as possible former vice-presidential pick, has been accused of taking draconian measures amid the pandemic, which has resulted in 51,142 confirmed virus cases and at least 4,891 deaths in Michigan. Whitmer has also faced intense blowback for branding her state’s lockdown protesters as “racist and misogynistic.” “These have been really political rallies where people come with Confederate flags and Nazi symbolism and calling for violence. This is not appropriate in a global pandemic, but it’s certainly not an exercise of democratic principles where we have free speech. This is calls to violence,” the governor said of the protests in a recent interview with ABC’s The View. “This is racist and misogynistic, and I ask that everyone who has a platform uses it to call on people to observe the best practices by the CDC, and to stop encouraging this behavior because it only makes it that much more precarious for us to try to reengage our economy which is what everyone says they want us to be able to do.”

Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker (R) released on Sunday his “mandatory safety standards” for “reopening” the state, which includes the requirement that churches and other houses of worship limit their occupancy to 40 percent of the building’s maximum capacity. According to the mandatory standards, when houses of worship are permitted to open Monday, the 40 percent occupant count “shall include all persons inside the place of worship, including attendees and staff”: Phase One guidelines for places of worship are out. MA churches can now have gatherings of up to 40% of their building's capacity. Read the full list of requirements and recommendations here: https://t.co/LluVNXG6pd pic.twitter.com/0pE0DZlsb4 — MA Family Institute (@MAFamilyInst) May 18, 2020  “Attendees who are not part of the same immediate household must be seated at least 6 feet apart,” the standards state in keeping with social distancing practices. “If there is fixed seating, rows should be blocked off and kept empty to allow for sufficient distancing between rows.” All occupants of the church buildings are required to wear masks. The “safety standards” recommend “online sign-up” in advance of church services to allow easier monitoring of the number of attendees. Also, houses of worship are “encouraged to place tape or other visual distancing markings on seating to delineate 6 foot separations” and to include floor markings to enable one-way aisles. The NewBostonPost reported Thursday that Catholics in the Boston area are calling on Cardinal Sean O’Malley to reopen churches in his archdiocese. O’Malley and the other Catholic bishops of Massachusetts have all banned public Masses since mid-March. “We very much want to resume public Mass and gatherings as soon as it is safe to do so,” Terrence Donilon, Archdiocese of Boston spokesman told the NewBostonPost. “The Archdiocese currently has a team of priests, deacons and the laity working with parishes to devise a phased-in plan for resumption of public Masses as soon as it is determined safe”: “We all miss the sacraments, and we think it’s about time to open up the churches to worship in,” said Anne Kane, one of the organizers told the New Boston Post. “It’s our right. And during this time especially we need to be in churches praying.” https://t.co/SUXAFNiK1a — MA Family Institute (@MAFamilyInst) May 15, 2020  The new Massachusetts standards forbid any services or socializing outside actual worship services, such as child care services or coffee hours, but do allow for food pantry collections. Additionally, the standards urge houses of worship to collect donations only through mail or electronic contribution sites. “Places of worship shall be cleaned and disinfected between each service, including disinfection of heavy transit areas and high-touch surfaces (e.g., doorknobs, bathrooms, microphones, shared instruments),” the standards state. Baker held a press conference Monday morning during which he announced his four-phase “reopening” approach. In addition to houses of worship, the state’s construction and manufacturing sectors may also reopen on Monday. Office spaces, laboratories, hair salons and barber shops, car washes, and pet grooming businesses will be permitted to reopen on May 25.

Last week, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro revealed the Trump administration is working “full bore” to craft an executive order to increase the domestic production of medicines and medical supplies. A reshoring of pharmaceutical production is needed now to respond to the coronavirus more than ever. The U.S. is currently dependent on China, the nation that unleashed this devastating pandemic, for the vast majority of medications we now use. China controls the raw material and chemicals needed to make thousands of generic drugs. In a March testimony before the Senate Small Business Committee hearing, Rosemary Gibson, a national expert on the healthcare supply chain and author of the book, China Rx, testified that China has a chokehold on 90 percent of the materials used in medicines to care for people seriously ill with coronavirus. U.S. dependence on China threatens the country’s coronavirus response. From sedatives such as propofol given to people on ventilators, to antibiotics needed for secondary infections and medicines to raise dangerously low blood pressure, China controls most of the chemicals required to make them. This utter dependence on China fuels the U.S. crisis of drug shortages, which are especially consequential during a pandemic. The FDA announced its official first coronavirus-related drug shortage in February. Critical antibiotics to treat pneumonia are already being rationed in hospitals across the nation. At the Senate Small Business Committee hearing, a Johns Hopkins University professor said that its hospital has a shortage of 200 to 300 drugs, far more than the 98 officially reported by the FDA.  At least 75 countries have banned exports of critical medicines and supplies such as masks and other protective gear to ensure enough for their own people. Allies including the U.K. and India banned exports of essential drugs. We can no longer rely on others to make our medicines. In March, China threatened Americans in its state-run media: “If China announces that its drugs are for domestic use and bans exports, the United States will fall into the hell of a new coronavirus epidemic.” China’s generic manufacturing dominance threatens not only drug supply shortages but also drug integrity. Millions of Americans had their blood pressure medicines recalled beginning in 2018 because they contained carcinogens. A Chinese company supplied the key ingredient for many of these products; these key ingredients contained more than 200 times the acceptable limit of a chemical found in rocket fuel. More than 31,000 active-duty military personnel, veterans, and their family members were affected.  In 2008, 246 Americans died and thousands more were injured when a widely used blood thinner made in China, heparin, was contaminated. Detecting faulty drugs is difficult-to-impossible. The last thing critically ill patients and their doctors should have to worry about is whether their medications being used are contaminated.  The White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy is preparing rules to direct HHS, the VA, and the Department of Defense to buy U.S. manufactured medicines and supplies for their government contracts. This is the first and most crucial step in securing safe and reliable medication for the American public.  At the same time, lawmakers must immediately work to bring the supply chain back to American shores. They can achieve this goal by deeming medicines a strategic asset, requiring federal government departments and agencies to buy medicines made in the U.S., and supporting capital investment and other incentives to restart drug manufacturing. These initiatives can be included as part of the upcoming Phase 4 coronavirus stimulus legislation. They would boost the economy, create jobs, and revitalize communities around the country.

Entrepreneurs with expertise in pharmaceutical manufacturing are ready to step in to manufacture critical generic drugs in the U.S. By using advanced manufacturing technology, the cost of production is lower and the quality of medicines can be assured with real-time quality control.  

Generic medicines such as antibiotics are vital to Americans’ health and wellbeing in the best of times. Even more during a pandemic. The coronavirus reinforces the importance of domestic production capacity and provides the impetus for legislation to bring critical manufacturing home and ensure our health security.  This is not a partisan issue and patient care is not political. We must be able to manufacture our own medications to protect Americans during this pandemic and in its aftermath. The White House’s executive order will make help make this vision a reality.

Monday on ABC’s “The View,” actress Rita Wilson discussed the vote-by-mail campaign she is chairing with her husband actor Tom Hanks. Co-host Joy Behar said, “So you and Tom are co-chairs along with Michelle Obama of ‘When We All Vote,’ a nonpartisan organization working to close the race and age voting gap. So what are you doing? Tell us what you are doing to make sure the pandemic won’t hinder people from voting in November in the election. I’m very worried about that.” Wilson said, “Well, it’s ‘When We All Vote.’ I’m glad you mention it is bipartisan. It is important for Americans just to remember that we have this very valuable right, which is the right to vote, and Whenweallvote.org is a place that you can go to and get three friends to register to vote and also you can sign up for taking the census. But it’s a way to also ensure through your legislators that you can get either mail-in ballots or early voting. Some people want to come in early in person, and a lot of states need to be offering that opportunity to do that. It’s a way to put your voice in that, on that petition that will allow you to vote in the way that you feel most comfortable with. You know, we still are in the middle of a pandemic. We’re still taking precautions. So some people don’t feel comfortable going to a polling place, and we want to ensure that every American gets the right to vote, and if that’s by doing it mailing in, then we’ve got to make that happen. So Whenweallvote.org. go there, and all the information is there.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Tech giant Apple is reportedly planning to reopen 25 more stores in the United States after initially opening five stores as a test. Apple will now have 100 stores open worldwide, after closing all Apple stores outside of China in response to the Wuhan coronavirus. Reuters reports that Silicon Valley tech giant Apple plans to reopen more than 25 of its stores across the United States, continuing a gradual reopening process that has seen almost one-fifth of its worldwide stores back in business. In March, Apple closed all of its stores outside of Greater China in response to the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic. The firm also shut down 50 stores in the Greater China area in January but had reopened them by March. Deirdre O’Brien, Apple’s head of retail, wrote in a post on the company’s website on Sunday: “Our commitment is to reopen our stores when we are confident the environment is safe.” Apple’s stores will be imposing social-distancing rules, will limit the number of people allowed in stores, and some outlets will only offer curbside or storefront service. Apple has not disclosed its retail store revenue but direct sales including retail stores, web, and corporate sales accounted for 31 percent of its $260 billion in revenue in 2019. Apple CEO Tim Cook declined last month to provide an outlook for the June quarter, citing business uncertainty created by the Wuhan coronavirus. First-quarter sales figures from China were $9.46 billion, down by about $1 billion from the same period a year earlier. Apple re-opened five stores in the U.S. last week, customers were required to undergo temperature checks and wear masks before entering the premises. The firm also plans to re-open ten of its store in Italy beginning on Tuesday. Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

The Florida Keys will reopen to tourists beginning June 1 as the Sunshine State moves through the process of loosening restrictions, per Gov. Ron DeSantis’s (R) orders, which are largely in line with the guidelines released by the White House. Monroe County leaders on Sunday announced that the Florida Keys will reopen to visitors next month, after what will amount to over two months of restricted travel. Officials installed checkpoints on U.S. 1 and State Road 905 as part of an effort to slow the spread of the virus, particularly from travelers hailing from Miami-Dade County, which emerged as one of Florida’s coronavirus hotspots, along with Broward and Palm Beach. “Airport screenings and bus restrictions will also be lifted on June 1,” according to Monroe County’s government website: Monroe County lodging establishments, like hotels, campgrounds, vacation rentals, and other transient-licensed establishments will be required to implement sanitation procedures and follow the American Hotel and Lodging Association COVID-19 guidelines for enhanced cleaning practices (www.ahla.com). The timeline for removing the 50 percent capacity restriction for lodging will be determined at a later date. Per Governor Executive Order 20-123, the County Administrator will submit a written request and safety plan to the Department of Business and Professional Regulation Secretary to seek approval for the operation of vacation rentals. Officials added that they reserve the right to amend the order and reimpose the restrictions, should the Florida Keys “experience an increase in cases” the Florida Department of Health recommends the county do so as a result. The county is also requiring individuals to wear face coverings in public. Monroe County has reported just 100 cases of the Chinese coronavirus, ten hospitalizations among residents, and three related deaths. The low case county is significant, as its neighboring county, Miami-Dade, saw 15,658 confirmed cases, 2,385 resident hospitalizations, and 561 related deaths. Gov. DeSantis also took similar action as Monroe County but on a broader scale, installing checkpoints along the Florida-Alabama border and Florida-Georgia border, as authorities screened individuals traveling from coronavirus hotspots such as New Orleans and the New York tri-state area. Similar screenings occurred at major Florida airports, including the Jacksonville International Airport (JAX), Miami International Airport (MIA), Orlando International Airport (MCO), Tampa International Airport (TPA), Southwest Florida International Airport (RSW), Palm Beach International Airport (PBI), and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (FLL). While DeSantis came under heavy scrutiny from the media over his refusal to impose draconian lockdown orders, Florida has fared significantly better than its blue state counterparts — New York, for instance — despite its larger population and older demographic, as Breitbart News detailed. Florida is currently undergoing the process of reopening, with the state entering Full Phase 1 on Monday, allowing gyms to reopen and expanding restaurant and retail store capacity to 50 percent.

The World Health Assembly (W.H.A.), governing body of the World Health Organization (W.H.O.), convened via teleconferencing on Monday to discuss the global coronavirus pandemic.  The country that unleashed the pandemic through its dishonesty and corruption, Communist China, was present while the country that did the best job fighting the pandemic, Taiwan, was absent. China forced Taiwan out of observer status at the W.H.O. in 2016 after the election of anti-communist President Tsai Ing-wen and is stubbornly blocking its return to even that limited degree of participation for purely political reasons while thousands die around the world from the Wuhan virus. Taiwan announced on Monday that it has temporarily withdrawn its request to regain observer status, because it does not want a political battle to distract W.H.A. members from working on solutions to the pandemic. “Due to Covid-19, the agenda for this year’s WHA has been significantly shortened. Understandably, countries want to use the limited time available to concentrate on ways of containing the pandemic,” said Taiwanese Foreign Minister Joseph Wu. “For this reason, like-minded nations and diplomatic allies have suggested that the proposal be taken up later this year when meetings will be conducted normally, to make sure there will be full and open discussion. After careful deliberation, we have accepted the suggestion from our allies and like-minded nations to wait until the resumed session before further promoting our bid,” Wu said. In addition to working on a vaccine and sharing its expertise in controlling the pandemic, Taiwan has donated millions of protective masks and thousands of pieces of diagnostic equipment to other countries. Wu said about 25 million more masks, hundreds of thousands of protective gowns, and other equipment will soon be donated. A growing number of world leaders have joined the United States in calling for Taiwan to return to the W.H.O., including Canada, Australia, Japan, and every member of the European Union. According to the Taiwanese Foreign Ministry, as of Monday, 29 world governments have formally expressed support for Taiwan to rejoin W.H.O., while hundreds of lawmakers and officials from 43 countries have individually given their support to the effort. “Given what the world has endured as a result of COVID-19, U.N. member states joining together to insist Taiwan be invited to the upcoming virtual W.H.A. session in May 2020 is the right place to start,” said a bipartisan letter from the U.S. Congress to about 60 other countries sent last week. “Taiwan’s isolation from the global health community not only presents a serious public health concern, but also is an obstacle that hampers ongoing and future efforts,” the letter said. According to the World Health Organization’s legal counsel, there are “divergent views among member states” over Taiwan, so there was “no mandate” for the W.H.O. director to invite Taiwanese representatives into the W.H.A. meeting. In other words, China still has enough political clout to keep Taiwan out, a reality U.S. policymakers will doubtless consider carefully when deciding whether or not to resume funding the W.H.O. Although Taiwan temporarily set aside its request to attend the W.H.A. so as not to distract its members with a political struggle, Foreign Minister Wu expressed his country’s continuing dissatisfaction with how the assembly has “yielded to pressure from the Chinese government and continues to disregard the right to health of the 23 million people of Taiwan.” The regime in Beijing remorselessly continues to block Taiwanese participation, despite the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) incessant claims to be concerned about world health above all other things, because the CCP cannot tolerate Taiwan holding any membership position that would grant it legitimacy as an independent nation-state. During the seven years when Taiwan had observer status in W.H.O., it was obliged to refer to itself as “Chinese Taipei.” The CCP restated its callous position last week as calls for Taiwan’s inclusion in the World Health Assembly grew, explicitly laying out its purely political reasons for blocking Taiwanese membership. Between 2009 & 2016, the central government made proper arrangement for Taiwan’s observer status in World Health Assembly (WHA). But Democratic Progressive Party has stuck to the separatist position since it took office, damaging its own political basis for WHA participation. pic.twitter.com/QjbbZ9Aj0x — Lijian Zhao 赵立坚 (@zlj517) May 14, 2020  Chinese Communist propaganda denounced the effort to restore Taiwan’s membership as an “evil” stunt by “anti-China forces in Washington” to use the pandemic as an excuse to endorse the pro-independence stance of Taiwanese President Tsai’s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP): In short, the DPP has hatched a political conspiracy to take advantage of the pandemic to seek “Taiwan independence”. And this conspiracy is being strongly backed by anti-China forces in Washington. In fact, some US officials and congressmen have been pressuring the WHO to allow the island to attend the WHA meeting unconditionally. That the United States is trying to incite the international community against the WHO and Beijing is evident from the fact that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has personally urged countries around the world to back Taiwan’s unreasonable demand and has been pressuring WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to invite the island to attend the WHA. From the US Congress and US ambassador to the UN to the American Institute in Taiwan, all of them have joined the island-cheering squad on social media. The US’ active support to the “pro-independence” Taiwan authorities is one in a series of US moves that has deteriorated Sino-US relations in recent years. The US is playing the “Taiwan card” to create more political troubles for the Chinese mainland, especially to divert American people’s attention from the failure of the administration to control the coronavirus outbreak at home. By openly backing the DPP’s separatist policies, Washington intends to intensify cross-Straits disputes and get the upper hand against Beijing. It is of least concern to Washington that in this Sino-US conflict the island could end up being the worst sufferer. Unsurprisingly, this tirade concluded with Beijing’s latest thinly-veiled threat to attack Taiwan if the island keeps refusing to accept Chinese Communist dominance. China’s state-run Xinhua news service claimed Beijing has already done more than enough to address Taiwan’s concerns – an outrageous claim given the CCP’s constant lies and evasions about the coronavirus – and insisted the rest of the world must keep giving Taipei the cold shoulder to demonstrate its commitment to the “one China principle”: The 73rd session of the WHA, scheduled from May 18 to 19, will only cover essential items including COVID-19 response and an executive board election. This shows that the goal of the member states is to focus on international cooperation to battle COVID-19. The WHA has for many years rejected some countries’ Taiwan-related proposals, demonstrating the shared international commitment to the one-China principle, an overriding trend that cannot be challenged. Since COVID-19 broke out, Taiwan’s Democratic Progressive Party authorities have been hyping up the so-called “Taiwan’s participation in the WHA,” exposing their intention to use the epidemic to seek “Taiwan independence.” Such an attempt will never succeed. Taiwanese Foreign Minister Wu called out the CCP for its hypocrisy, declaring that the people of Taiwan “abhor the two-faced behavior of the Chinese government, which claims to care for their health and welfare while actually seeking to deprive them of their right to health at every turn.”

Wheel of Fortune host Pat Sajak took a swipe at media elites who have the luxury of working from home but who are discouraging less fortunate, out-of-work Americans from leaving their homes. The long-time game show host said that “it’s okay to question” the dominant media narrative pressuring people to stay indoors. Sajak tweeted his message over the weekend, addressing those Americans who find they “can’t work, pay bills or pay their rent or mortgage” during the coronavirus crisis. “When a disc jockey or a talk show host or a journalist who is being paid to work from his or her home tells people who can’t work, pay bills or pay their rent or mortgage to ‘Stay home and be careful because we’re all in this together,’ it’s okay to question the premise,” he wrote. When a disc jockey or a talk show host or a journalist who is being paid to work from his or her home tells people who can’t work, pay bills or pay their rent or mortgage to “Stay home and be careful because we’re all in this together,” it’s okay to question the premise. — Pat Sajak (@patsajak) May 16, 2020  Sajak’s message comes as pressure continues to build throughout the country for states to lift shelter-at-home restrictions and to allow businesses to re-open. During the weekend, anti-quarantine protesters took to the streets in numerous states, including true-blue California and New York. More than 36 million people have filed unemployment claims as a result of the coronavirus lockdowns. But mainstream media outlets have frequently portrayed  protestors as irresponsible and sometimes even dangerous, claiming that they are being manipulated by political operatives. Pat Sajak, who recently recovered from surgery, is a rare Hollywood conservative who continues to work in the industry. In the past, he has used social media to criticize the liberal media, global warming activists, and the Obama administration. Follow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg. Have a tip?

The Chinese state propaganda newspaper Global Times published a column on Monday declaring that the Chinese people are undergoing a cultural “Enlightenment” during the Chinese coronavirus pandemic that makes their culture and society superior to the West. The column, written by Chinese professor Wang Wen, praises the “discipline” and “national maturity” of the Chinese people for overcoming the coronavirus, failing to mention that at least three provinces in the country – Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Hubei – are experiencing significant escalations in the number of cases documented. In contrast, Wang laments that the values of individual freedom and small government in the West, particularly America, have allegedly made fighting the virus more difficult. “As long as the government does not officially announce lifting the ban, [Chinese] people will always exercise discipline. Even if their residential areas have never reported an infection case, they will continue to make their own sacrifices for epidemic prevention and control,” Wang contended. “This stands in comparison with the U.S. where an average of 20,000 daily cases have emerged for two consecutive months, the public in many states cannot bear stay-at-home order. Certain people even go to the street to protest control measures. Some even refuse to wear masks and flock to the beach. Some cities are even starting to prepare large-scale sporting events.” Wang attributed this to “differences of cultures.” “[N]ational maturity is key to China’s phased success in fighting the epidemic. During the initial stage of the outbreak in January, Chinese society was somehow chaotic, but the situation was soon much better,” Wang claimed. “Obviously, the COVID-19 fight is changing Chinese people’s social and political values. It is like the Enlightenment, and Chinese people are experiencing a new spiritual awakening that is surpassing Western neoliberalism.” Wang conceded that Western values “contributed to the success of China’s reform” following the brutal tyranny of mass murderer Mao Zedong, but gave them little credit for anything happening in China in the last 40 years. He concluded that criticism of “Chinese experiences” was “ideological discrimination.” China has repeatedly used vague references to Communist Party “culture” to assert the alleged superiority of the majority Han ethnic group. China is home to other ethnic groups, but the Communist Party has launched violent campaigns to erase the religious beliefs, language, and values of the largest among them, including the Tibetans and Uyghurs, implying that any references to “traditional Chinese culture” are limited references only to the Han. Most recently, the Global Times published an article insisting that China’s alleged success in fighting the Chinese coronavirus is due to the fact that “our society is quite clean … probably the only one in the world.” This claim rapidly evolved into assertions that the virus could not have possibly originated in China, despite the fact that no documented cases outside of China exist before those diagnosed in Wuhan in November 2019. Chinese officials began accusing the United States of causing the pandemic, claiming the real origin of the virus was a U.S. Army facility in Maryland. In early March, the Chinese Foreign Ministry claimed that documented illnesses related to e-cigarette, or vape, use in America could be evidence that the coronavirus originated there, even though none of the vaping illness patients were found to be contagious. While upholding its own values, the Global Times, in particular, has attacked American culture as inferior and dangerous. In September, the newspaper published an article blaming American culture for the growing number of deaths in the country attributable to the use of fentanyl, a highly potent opioid manufactured at high quantities in China. The article cited remarks by a Chinese Communist Party anti-narcotics official, who stated that American “culture, politics, and companies” are to blame for opioid deaths. A year before those declarations, in 2018, the Global Times published an article claiming “drug abuse in American society is very rampant with addiction multiplying sharply in many areas. It is hard to find even one young person in the country who hasn’t tried drugs.” “In the U.S., consuming marijuana is considered a private affair or even a manifestation of personality and taste,” the article continued, using as its example marijuana use but not distinguishing between the large gap in danger levels between marijuana and fentanyl use. Unlike marijuana, fentanyl is so dangerous that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has warned it could be used as a weapon of mass destruction. “As little as two to three milligrams of fentanyl can induce respiratory depression, respiratory arrest, and possibly death. And some fentanyl analogues such as carfentanil are orders of magnitude more potent,” a February 2019 DHS memo stated. Chinese state media has not limited its bigoted criticism of Western cultures to America. “My experience says whether a country can achieve industrialization depends on many factors, culture being the most important. … It may sound racist to differentiate development based on culture. But after living in Brazil for a while, you will find out the answer,” a Global Times contributor wrote in 2018, arguing that the South American country would never become developed because Brazilians are lazy. “Brazilians are not willing to be as diligent and hard working as the Chinese. Neither do they value savings for the next generation, like the Chinese do. Yet they demand the same welfare and benefits as those in developed countries.” Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.

CNNLOL staffer Chris Cuomo is still trying to sleaze his way out of getting caught violating his coronavirus quarantine. He is now laughably insisting he did not violate his quarantine when he left his home while still sick and, therefore, infectious. Over the weekend, someone on Twitter accused Cuomo of violating his coronavirus quarantine. Cuomo struck back with this very revealing tweet (which I’ll address in detail below)… “Lie. Did 14 days. Then went to my own home. Never in public,” Cuomo raged. “Was accosted by trespasser who cursed at wife and kids and has open case for allegedly biting a man’s hand. These are all facts. Beat it.” Here’s the timeline… March 31: Cuomo announces he tested positive for the coronavirus and that he will continue to broadcast his nightly CNNLOL show from his basement at home. Cuomo also announces he intends to quarantine in his basement for the duration of the illness to avoid infecting his wife and kids. Infecting them “would make me feel worse than the illness,” he said. April 1 (one day later): Playing the selfless hero, Cuomo begins broadcasting from his basement. For the next few weeks, a big part of his message is that the rest of us must make the noble sacrifice he’s making: stay home so you don’t infect others. April 12 (13 days later): On Easter Sunday, with his wife and kids, and while still sick and, therefore, infectious with the deadly coronavirus, Cuomo is caught red-handed violating his quarantine. He exits his basement, exits his home, and drives to a property he’s developing about thirty miles away. Here he gets into a confrontation with a guy on a bike. April 12 (13 days later): On the very same day Cuomo violated his quarantine while infected with a deadly disease and traveled some 30 minutes with his wife and kids through a state (New York) ravaged by this disease, Cuomo’s own wife shared in her public diary that Chris Cuomo had a fever of 100. In her diary, Cuomo’s wife made no mention of her and her husband’s day trip and went on to lecture her readers about the importance of self-quarantining: “Besides the obvious social distancing and self-quarantine to limit the spread of this virus, here is some important information from Dr. Linda…” It is also worth mentioning that Cuomo’s unnecessary travel violated his own brother’s (New York Democrat Gov. Andrew Cuomo) stay-at-home order. April 13 (14 days later): Cuomo confirms the Easter Sunday run-in with the biker but does not mention he had traveled away from home. April 14 (15 days later): Cuomo confirms he was still sick and, therefore, infectious when he went out on Easter Sunday. April 16: (17 days later): Cuomo’s wife tests positive for the coronavirus. April 20: (21 days later): Saying the CDC has finally cleared him to end his quarantine, CNN stages Cuomo’s phony exit from his basement, as though it were the first time he has left after three long, grueling, self-sacrificial weeks. April 23: (24 days later): Cuomo’s 14-year-old son tests positive for the coronavirus. So let’s go through Cuomo’s tweet… “Lie. Did 14 days.” Cuomo is saying it’s a lie he didn’t quarantine because he did quarantine for 14 days. Well, to begin with, the 14-day quarantine is only for those who are suspected of having the coronavirus after they have been in close contact with someone who’s infected. After 14 days, the quarantine ends if — and only if — that person is not sick. If you are sick, you are obviously supposed to remain in quarantine until you are no longer infectious. According to Cuomo himself, he was not cleared until April 20, a full week after he left his home while still sick and infectious. Secondly, as you can see from the timeline above, even though the suggested 14-day quarantine did not apply to him, he still did not remain quarantined for 14 days. Assuming this was the only time he violated his quarantine, he violated his quarantine after 13 days. “Then went to my own home.” According to various reports, this is not true. Cuomo does not have a “home” at this second property. He is building a home there, a home that is only at the framing stage. So he did not go to his “own home”; he went to some property he owned for whatever reason. “Never in public.” This is also not true. According to the biker who caught him outside of quarantine, he was outside in public, which makes sense because there is no “home” on this property, so he could only be outside in public. Further, he was with his wife and kids, and his wife and one of these kids would soon test positive, so how often were they out in public when unaware they were sick? This is a virus that spreads when you do not show symptoms. “Was accosted by trespasser who cursed at wife and kids and has open case for allegedly biting a man’s hand.” There is no proof the biker trespassed. So this appears to be fake news. According to the biker, he merely parked his bike and did to Cuomo what Cuomo does to America every night: asked him why he was not quarantining. Secondly, how does Cuomo know about this man’s alleged background? Sounds like Fredo is doing oppo-research on the guy who busted him. Few closing thoughts… First off, Chris Cuomo is the only person I know of in the whole wide world who violated his quarantine while knowing he was sick and, therefore, infectious, which is the act of a stone-cold sociopath. Secondly, he’s such an unfeeling sociopath that while infectious, he traveled for 30 minutes with his own wife and children — and eventually, his wife and son were stricken with this potentially fatal disease. Who does that? What kind of sociopath risks infecting his own family with a virus that’s killing tens of thousands of Americans? Finally, where the hell are the rest of the media on this fraud? For three weeks, Cuomo pumped his low ratings a little higher where he played the hero in his own fraudulent story, where he staged the fake news event about leaving his basement, and some three weeks later, he’s STILL lying about what he did, and the Guardians of Holy Journalism still refuse to call him on it.

BRUSSELS (AP) – Belgium is taking the next step in its relaxation of the coronavirus lockdown on Monday and is also telling people: get up! Schools are opening up to more students, markets are setting up again and museums are the reopening their doors. And the snip of a barber´s scissors fills the air again. Schools went through a dry run on Friday, but primary and secondary classes are resuming for real on Monday, though with a limited number of pupils to make sure that social distancing can be fully respected. In many cases, though, distance learning through laptops remains the order of the day. “It is a bit weird feeling, but it is ok, I can see that the school is well-organized, well-equipped for the safety of our children,” said Eliana Luboko, mother of 12-year-old Diego at the Les Magnolias primary school in Brussels. Across the country, kids were gingerly taking steps in school playgrounds, running around even as teachers sought to ensure social distancing. That is the kind of activity that the government wants to see among adults now. A major study by the public science institute Sciensano involving over 40,000 participants said that during the lockdown, twice as many adults had succumbed to a sedentary lifestyle as two years ago. A total of 56.1 per cent said they were sitting or at rest for more than 8 of their waking hours. On average, adults are now sitting or resting 8.6 hours during their waking day compared with 5.8 hours two years ago. A quarter of respondents said they had gained weight while locked inside, with the oven churning out homemade pastries breads and other recipes from long-forgotten cookbooks. “These are unusual circumstances, but better times are ahead for your weight,” said Prof. Steven Van Gucht, of Sciensano. With the relaxation of lockdown measures “there are more possibilities to move about and do sports outside.” “Take your chance. Get out! Move!” Van Gucht said, adding that people should heed social distancing advice.

President Donald Trump signaled support on Monday for Australia’s push for a probe into the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. “We are with them!” Trump wrote, noting that India, Japan, Britain, Canada, New Zealand, Indonesia, and Russia were among the nations supporting the probe of the World Health Organization’s failure to respond properly to the pandemic. Australia’s demand for an investigation into the origin and the spread of the virus now has the backing of 62 nations. China has threatened Australia with trade penalties if they continue to defy the Chinese communist government. But Australia has not backed down. “Now, it would seem entirely reasonable and sensible that the world would want to have an independent assessment of how this all occurred, so we can learn the lessons and prevent it from happening again,” Australia Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in April. We are with them! https://t.co/H7DRHXPJYb — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 18, 2020   

Monday on Fox News Channel’s “America’s Newsroom,” Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) shared what he believes the United States can do to hold China responsible for its part in the spread of the coronavirus while misleading other nations about its severity. With China threatening sanctions against GOP lawmakers for their criticisms of the China Communist Party’s handling of the virus, Biggs floated the possibility of the Stop COVID Act, tariffs, and incentivizing companies to come back to the United States. “[T]here are a number of things that we can do,” Biggs told host Ed Henry. “And I think the first of all is the lawsuit permission that is in legislation sponsored in the House right now. That is appropriate. I also think we need to go back and take a look at pre-Clinton era prohibited sales and transfers policy and lists that we had. we basically built up China’s economy, given them advanced rocket telemetry, given them a blue water Navy, we’ve given them a middle class, and that’s been done from everything from our tech transfer to IP theft on the part of China.” He continued, “There are things we can do, and I think going back to that list is one, the president’s talked about tariffs. That’s another issue that might be addressed. I think we can also provide incentives to bring our supply chain manufacturing back to the United States. All of those are important, Ed.” Biggs went on to say if the United States steps up and holds China accountable, “it will wake up China.” “There’s a whole toolbox we’ve got,” Biggs emphasized. “We must act this time.” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent

Unsuccessful 2016 Democrat presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton lumped in armed shutdown protesters with “domestic terrorism” following Michigan shutdown protests.

It cannot be tolerated.https://t.co/NcCFgA5COE — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) May 15, 2020  Clinton’s tweet came after Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer (D) claimed she received death threats and promises of other acts of violence by alleged protest rally supporters. Newsweek quoted Whitmer saying, “There are legislators who are wearing bulletproof vests to go to work. No one should be intimidated by someone who’s bringing in an assault rifle into their workplace.” Bearing Arms’ Cam Edwards notes that a local report indicates only “about 12 of 250 protesters…were armed” and no gun owners were arrested. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) cited alleged concerns of violence in his state in January 2020, then unilaterally barred the carrying of guns on State Capitol grounds as protesters gathered to oppose the Democrat legislature’s gun control push.

HOUSTON (AP) — Former major league manager and infielder Art Howe was released from a Houston hospital Sunday after a stay in intensive care because of the coronavirus. “Relief, back in my own bedroom. It’s just sweet,” the 73-year-old Howe said. “It was a long five days or so. I’m finally feeling a little bit better. Still not able to eat real good, taste buds are giving me a hard time. It’s just nice to be back home and hopefully continue to progress.” Howe will be isolated at home for another week or two. Best known as the manager of the “Moneyball” Oakland Athletics playoff teams in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Howe confirmed Thursday night he has been dealing with the illness since first feeling symptoms of COVID-19 on May 3. He went to the hospital by ambulance Tuesday. Howe spent 12 seasons in the majors as a player, primarily at second base and third base. He played for Pittsburgh (1974-75) and Houston (1976-82), but missed the 1983 season with an injury before playing two more years for St. Louis (1984-85). Howe hit .260 with 43 home runs and 293 RBIs. His only postseason homer in three playoff trips came in the 1981 NL Division Series against Los Angeles. Howe began his big league managerial career with the Astros in 1989 and led them for five seasons. He took over the A’s in 1996 and managed them for seven years while winning 600 regular-season games and leading Oakland to the playoffs three times. Those teams became known for general manager Billy Beane’s then-unconventional method of using sabermetrics to evaluate players. Author Michael Lewis wrote a bestselling book on the A’s called “Moneyball,” and it was later turned into a film starring Brad Pitt as Beane and Philip Seymour Hoffman as Howe. Howe was released from his contract with the A’s after the 2002 season and became the manager of the New York Mets for two seasons. He has a 1,129–1,137 record in the majors.  

The British university behind the doomsday coronavirus projections that resulted in the introduction of national lockdown restrictions has signed a deal with Chinese tech giant Huawei to build tech centres on its campus in West London. Imperial College London has landed a £5 million deal with Huawei, which will sponsor research projects, the construction of new tech facilities, as well as a 5G network for the college. “Like other UK universities, we have received support from Huawei for high-quality and open research for several years. Such funding is subject to our robust Relationship Review policies,” Imperial College London told the Mail on Sunday. The British government has used the research and modelling conducted by the university to inform its response to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. The projections conducted by disgraced Imperial College Professor Neil Ferguson have come under increased criticism following his ousting from the government’s coronavirus response team. ‘Professor Lockdown’ resigned from his post after it was revealed he was breaking the very lockdown measures his research called for, to receive visits from his married left-wing activist lover. Delingpole: Ferguson’s Dodgy Model Has Engendered a World-Historical Blunder https://t.co/2wIk5JM9QZ — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 8, 2020  Conservative MP Iain Duncan Smith said that the deal between the Chinese tech firm and Imperial College was symptomatic of China’s attempt to influence the United Kingdom. “This is a perfect example of how the Chinese strategy is to use their money to insert their influence in the world’s intellectual thought process. How ironic it is Imperial that is dealing with the fallout of Covid-19. This is a deeply worrying and dangerous relationship,” Smith said. Former Brexit Party MEP Ben Habib echoed the sentiments against the deal, writing: “Not a great believer in conspiracy theories but this is suspicious, to put it mildly. It needs investigation.” China has long been charged with pushing communist propaganda on Western universities, through the Chinese Communist Party-backed Confucious Institutes. The UK has 29 Confucious Institutes on campuses throughout the country, the second-most in the world. The ‘cultural centres’ have been accused of stifling debate in British universities, particularly when it comes to ‘sensitive’ topics for the Beijing regime, such as Taiwan and Tibet. Farage: Huawei Decision Threatens Five Eyes, Trade, Even Future of NATO https://t.co/HPdvbT7XXS — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 19, 2020  Huawei, which claims to be independent of the CCP, has been at the centre of a growing controversy in the UK, following Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s decision to allow the tech firm to help build the nation’s 5G network. The government has said that Huawei will only have access to the “periphery” of the network. However, critics, including the United States, have warned that Huawei has the capability of building backdoor access into its systems that could be used for Chinese espionage. Earlier this month, Breitbart London reported that the U.S. is reviewing the status of all military and intelligence assets in the UK to see if they should be removed from the country as a result of the Huawei deal. In April, Sir Simon McDonald, the Foreign Office’s permanent undersecretary, said that the British government had made a “firm decision” to allow the Chinese company to help build the network. A spokesman for Huawei said: “We are pleased to be working with Imperial to explore how new technologies can bring economic and social value through collaboration.” Exclusive Video: Boris 5G Deal with Huawei Is 'Madness' – Hong Kong Watch Founder https://t.co/jcvNM2Rqm9 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 2, 2020  Follow Kurt on Twitter at @KurtZindulka

The United Kingdom’s train operating companies (TOCs) pushed services to 70% of the regular timetable Monday, but enforced social distancing means the equivalent to just 10% of the normal capacity of passengers will be able to travel. While the number of journeys on Britain’s National Rail Network has fallen to four per cent of normal levels in the wake of the government’s police-enforced coronavirus lockdown, the number of daily trains operating had remained reasonably high, allowing those who still need to travel to do so in near-total isolation. Following Boris Johnson’s instruction to the nation last week to get back to work where possible, the capacity of the network has again ramped up, with 70 per cent of normal services — equivalent to a normal weekend service in non-coronavirus times — now running on weekdays. Yet that growth in theoretical capacity will not allow a great increase in the number of travellers, however, as the normally crowded train carriages are to be kept nearly empty even during peak times, with officers of the British Transport Police on hand at major railway stations to enforce the change, Britain’s Guardian newspaper reports. While the number of travellers could now double from its new coronavirus low, actual working capacity will be around 10% of normal, with Britain’s network of lines and services operated for a tiny minority of people. In the case of TOC Avanti West Coast, on their peak time services, this means carriages could not be any more than one-third full. Given that many trains in normal times run well over maximum capacity — standing room only — this one-third of seats occupied only mode will mean a huge fall in revenue for operators. So far, the fall in passenger numbers have been paid for by the government, a barely-noticed stealth nationalisation of the industry that has attracted little attention in the national press. Despite the huge cost to the taxpayer of the move, there remains a lack of clarity over how precisely the government will withdraw from this arrangement, if and when passenger numbers should recover. The BBC reports stations now have crowd barriers and security guards in place to prevent passengers boarding trains that are already too ‘crowded’, with intercity trains now running as reservation only. At Euston Station, the 1960s modernist concrete slab that controversially replaced an earlier Victorian station and is itself in the process of again being replaced, the various entrances are now set up with folding barriers, allowing staff to control access to the building quickly.

Our bodies are essential — but we can’t control them, right?” The abortion industry giant states House Democrats’ $3 trillion coronavirus HEROES Act will address this “systemic inequality” women are experiencing during the pandemic: Women are on the front lines and facing the harshest impacts of this pandemic.

One Planned Parenthood official in New York State boasted that the organization’s new tele-abortion service is so much in demand that one mother began her drug-induced abortion “at home with her children running around behind her.” Dr. Meera Shah, chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood Hudson Peconic, told the Associated Press (AP), “We provided a medication abortion to an EMT while she was sitting in her ambulance. We provided abortion care to a mother who was at home with her children running around behind her.” Planned Parenthood received considerable criticism for using the coronavirus crisis to achieve its goal of taxpayer-funded abortion from Twitter users and pro-life leaders.  pic.twitter.com/TM1xFLtdcp — Mary Olsen (@maryeolsen) May 17, 2020  What kind of psycho thinks a coronavirus relief package needs more abortion funding? — Alex Madajian (@AlexMadajian) May 17, 2020  Hard no.

She added; This latest attempt to repeal the Hyde Amendment, which protects taxpayers from funneling money towards abortion businesses, must be rejected. Congress should focus on guiding our nation through this pandemic and providing real, life-affirming support to Americans in need, not on fulfilling the wish list of Planned Parenthood. Psychologist and Christian leader Dr. James Dobson also said in a statement the HEROES Act “has nothing to do with our current health and economic calamity.” “It is appalling the Democrats are willing to mortgage the future of our children and grandchildren, all to ram through a socialist agenda that runs counter to the wishes of most Americans, not to mention the Constitution of the United States!” he added.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) said Sunday that “nobody” should be prosecuted for his state’s fatalities caused by the Wuhan coronavirus, including deaths in nursing homes. Cuomo made the remark in response to a reporter’s question regarding the mounting death toll in his state’s nursing homes and the need for accountability. “We lost 139 people yesterday in hospitals. Who is accountable for those 139 deaths? How do we get justice for those families who had 139 deaths? What is justice? Who can we prosecute for those 139 deaths? Nobody,” Cuomo replied. “Despite whatever you do, because with all our progress as a society, we can’t keep everyone alive,” the governor said. Cuomo has garnered blowback for a now-reversed March 25 directive regarding nursing homes, which reads: “No resident [of a nursing home] shall be denied re-admission or admission to the NH [nursing home] solely based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19. NHs are prohibited from requiring a hospitalized resident who is determined medically stable to be tested for COVID-19 prior to admission or readmission.” To date, at least 4,800 residents have died in New York nursing homes between March 1 and May 1, according to figures from Cuomo officials. Cuomo faced criticism at a recent briefing for saying that providing masks and gowns to nursing homes is “not our job” because the homes are privately owned. “It was such an insensitive thing to say,” said state Assemblyman Ron Kim, a Queens Democrat who noted that it wasn’t until just this past week that New York and neighboring states announced a plan to combine forces to buy protective gear and medical supplies for nursing homes. “If we had focused on that early on,” he said, “we could have saved a lot of lives.” Cuomo’s administration defended its response to the crisis, saying it has provided more than 10 million pieces of protective equipment to nursing homes and created a database of 95,000 workers who have helped out in hundreds of New York homes. “This was an overwhelming situation for everyone,” said Jim Malatras, who serves on the governor’s COVID-19 task force. “There were deaths and it’s unfortunate. But it doesn’t mean we weren’t aggressive.” One key criticism is that New York took weeks after the first known care home outbreaks to begin publicly reporting the number of deaths in individual homes — and still doesn’t report the number of cases. By the time New York began disclosing the deaths in the middle of last month, the state had several major outbreaks with at least 40 deaths each, most of which were a surprise to the surrounding communities and even some family members. The AP contributed to this report. 

Representative Tim Ryan (D-OH) on Monday’s “Mornings with Maria” discussed the House last week passing the additional $3 trillion coronavirus stimulus bill, which includes items from the Democrats’ wish list that have nothing to do with dealing with the coronavirus. Ryan acknowledged he does not agree with everything in the House’s bill, but emphasized the importance in its passage because the “vast majority” of the bill is to help first responders, teachers and small businesses. He advised Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) to take up the bill, remove what he does not want and then send it back so the government can help those who need it. “I’ve been in Congress 18 years, I’ve voted on a lot of bills for them that, you know, I don’t agree with everything in there, and I don’t agree with everything in this bill,” Ryan told host Maria Bartiromo. “But the vast majority of this is to help police, fire, nurses, teachers and small businesses. We extend that date out for the PPP, small business people, from eight weeks to 24 weeks. That’s essential for these small businesses. Our frontline workers who rely on state and local government, they’re going belly up, and we need to get some money to those state and local governments, not to bail out their pensions — I’m not for that — but to make sure they have enough money to get going.” “Mitch McConnell, take this bill up, take out what you don’t like and send it back. It’s the legislative process,” he added. Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent

Monday on FNC’s “Fox & Friends,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) criticized his Democrat colleagues for using the pandemic to promote socialist governance in the United States and highlight Democrat priorities in the HEROES Act as examples. “I’m not crazy about it,” he said. “Democrats are not crazy about it. Democrats talked about this bill going nowhere. And it’s really sickening that the Democrats are using this opportunity to enforce their socialism. Remember, what is this bill that they just passed on Friday? Well, it’s about pot, it’s about prisoners, it’s about politicizing election law, prioritizing illegal immigrants and pensions. These are all things that are socialist wish lists that they’ve been trying to pass long before COVID ever came to this land. And that’s exactly what they’re trying to do, knowing that it will not go anywhere.” “They’re just using this as an opportunity to restructure government,” McCarthy continued. “And I’m not just saying that. That’s what Democrats say. Joe Biden said it the other day. Their whip said it, Clyburn. It goes beyond AOC. It’s now throughout the entire Democrat socialist base of what they want to utilize this opportunity to because when we wanted to help small businesses with their loans, Nancy Pelosi went to the freezer to stop it.” McCarthy pointed to all of the items not related to coronavirus in the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives effort, which he said was being used to give House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) more power. “What I’m finding is, all the things that the Democrats advocated for, the reasons why Speaker Pelosi held up the CARES bill that dealt with unemployment, gave the small businesses the loans, was able to give the state and the hospitals money, she held it up because she wanted to change election law,” McCarthy said. “She wanted to focus on cannabis. She wanted to focus about pensions. Well, we were able to keep that out. Yes, she got more money for the Kennedy Center.” “But now when the Democrats crafted their own bill, the focus was on those items, those socialism items that they wanted to bring up,” he continued. “Nothing about COVID. That is a waste of money. Three trillion dollars that never went through one committee. This was only written in Pelosi’s office. And they knew it wasn’t going anywhere. You talk to Democrats. They didn’t like it. They didn’t want it. And it’s the only reason she brought us back and to change the election law on how the House will work because the House is essential. We should be working. You have businesses across America that want to open again, and she keeps it closed to keep her — to give her more power.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor

Former Vice President Joe Biden’s campaign has frequently pointed to a 69-page “playbook” that the Obama-Biden administration created for dealing with pandemics, arguing that President Donald Trump had ignored it. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany recently called the playbook “insufficient,” according to the Washington Examiner. In fact, the playbook is less than advertised. Of the 69 pages, only 27 are the actual “playbook.” The first 13 pages are the table of contents, executive summary, and various title pages. The last 29 pages are appendices. And within the 27 pages of the “playbook” section, only 17 deal with an international outbreak of an infectious disease. The introduction to those 17 pages explains: This Rubric is not intended to serve as a comprehensive concept of operations or replace national or pre-existing U.S. Government response structures, but rather to serve as a proposed guide based on existing authorities, guidance, and response frameworks for staff monitoring emerging infectious disease threats and interagency planning and response, should the need arise in the future. This document is divided into two sections: key questions that provide the foundation for analytic work and key decisions and response options in accordance with the epidemiological rating. This Rubric is not intended to supplant other existing guidance such as the U.S. Government international disaster response system, United States Government International Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Response (ICBRNR) Protocol [footnote omitted] and the United States Government Policy Framework for Responding to International Requests for Public Health and Medical Assistance during an Influenza Pandemic (PI Framework, see appendix B) [footnote omitted] or those of the World Health Organization and the Global Outbreak Alert & Response Network (GOARN). Users are encouraged to refer to these documents, as applicable. Translated into English, what that means is that the document is a summary of documents that exist elsewhere. All the new playbook does is create a set of color-coded categories to define different stages of a pandemic and the different questions that might be asked at each stage, as well as the different agencies that might be asked to respond. It is not clear what, if anything, the Trump administration’s coronavirus task force omitted that the playbook included. The document itself admits that it is not intended to replace existing plans — only to provide a new way of organizing them. (President Trump had his own thoughts about organizing the federal government’s response, and they were expressed in the structure of the task force, which brought the expertise of several agencies together, with clear accountability at the top.) Some of the steps the playbook suggests are quite obvious. For example, in a situation of “elevated threat,” defined as an “infectious disease outbreak with high mortality or morbidity,” the playbook recommends asking about borders and travel: “Can the cisease [sic] be effectively screened in travelers as a means to stop transmission?” Curiously, a note adds: “It is rarely appropriate to put border screening measures in place at an elevated threat level.” In a situation of “credible threat,” when a case may have been “imported to the U.S. regardless of evidence of community transmission” — roughly the situation the U.S. faced in late January with coronavirus — the playbook is ambivalent about restricting travel. “The issue of border screening is complex and requires extensive and operational consultations,” it advises. The next level of threat occurs when the World Health Organization (WHO) declares a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern” (PHEIC). That only happened on Jan. 30 with the coronavirus; President Trump imposed a travel ban on China the next day. Had he been following the playbook, he might not have imposed the travel ban: the playbook’s recommendation does not change as the threat level rises: “The issue of border screening is complex.” Throughout the playbook, there is a glaring weakness: reliance on the WHO. In the cast of the coronavirus, the WHO advised as late as Jan. 14: “Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in #Wuhan, #China.” The “playbook” refers to WHO several times; while it anticipates weaknesses in local and regional WHO leadership, it does not suspect the kind of failure at senior levels of WHO that caused the world to underestimate the threat of the virus. There is some discussion — though not much — about supply chains, “diagnostic capacity,” and “contact tracing,” but hardly the emphasis that one might have expected, in retrospect, given the challenges posed by the coronavirus. In one very important sense, the playbook anticipates the current crisis: it advises that “[t]he epidemiologic analysis and country context is likely to be dynamic and change. We recommend continuous reevaluation of the epidemiology to inform changes in US response options.” In plain English: our knowledge of a new disease is likely to change, and policy changes will have to be made as our knowledge improves. That is exactly what has happened with COVID-19. Later, in the section that deals with domestic pandemic outbreaks, the playbook reiterates the point: “Early in the emergence of an emerging infectious disease threat, either within or outside the United States, there will be more that is known than what is known. Decision-makers will choose courses of action with incomplete information.” Thus while the Biden campaign has suggested otherwise, the playbook itself admits that there is no magical plan for containing pandemics, and that policymakers would have to learn and adjust over time — which Trump has done. The appendices to the playbook include a list of government agencies and departments, and a few pages of charts showing how the color-coded threat levels would have applied to past pandemics, none of which reached the scale of coronavirus. In at least two other respects, the playbook is indeed “insufficient,” as McEnany suggests: it downplays the use of travel bans, and emphasizes the role of the WHO. It is to President Trump’s credit that he chose a different path. The Biden campaign places great store in the “playbook,” but never explains exactly how it would have made the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus any better. Arguably, it would have made the response worse. If Joe Biden seriously believes that a document with a color-coded “rubric,” filled with bureaucratic jargon, is the answer to a pandemic threat like the coronavirus, perhaps Americans have new reasons to question his judgment.

The UK’s coronavirus lockdown was caused by “the most devastating software mistake of all time, in terms of economic costs and lives lost,” according to a report by a British newspaper. The essay is referring to computer modelling by Neil Ferguson and his team at Imperial College London that predicted enormous deaths in the UK and elsewhere and led to draconian lockdown measures. The Imperial College team published a 20‐​page report on March 16 forecasting that an uncontrolled spread of COVID-19 could cause as many as 510,000 deaths in Britain and as many as 2.2 million deaths in the United States. In Britain, these astronomical figures “triggered a sudden shift in the government’s comparatively relaxed response to the virus,” the New York Times reported at the time. The predictions, which were considerably wide of the mark were the result of radically deficient modelling, according to a report in British newspaper The Daily Telegraph by software developers David Richards and Konstantin Boudnik, who compare the disaster to the failed Mariner 1 Venus space probe in 1962. Imperial’s unreliable microsimulation model moved policymakers to “mothball our multi-trillion pound economy and plunge millions of people into poverty and hardship,” the authors note. The simulation code was so bad, the writers insist, that they “would fire anyone for developing code like this and any business that relied on it to produce software for sale would likely go bust.” Imperial’s model “is vulnerable to producing wildly different and conflicting outputs based on the same initial set of parameters,” they state. “Run it on different computers and you would likely get different results. In other words, it is non-deterministic.” In their contention that the Imperial model was “fundamentally unreliable,” the authors question why the government did not get a second opinion before radically altering the lives of millions of citizens. The writers register their suspicion that “the Government saw what was happening in Italy with its overwhelmed hospitals and panicked.” It “chose a blunt instrument instead of a scalpel and now there is going to be a huge strain on society,” they conclude.

China’s foreign ministry on Monday dismissed as “premature” growing calls an independent investigation into the origins and spread of the deadly Chinese coronavirus, as a coalition of nations prepare to canvas the possibility at this week’s World Health Assembly (WHA). Spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters during a daily briefing that despite the infection killing more than 300,000 people globally, the “vast majority” of countries do not yet think the pandemic is over, according to Reuters. As such, he argued it is too soon to entertain any line of inquiry. The outright rejection of any exposition of the facts relating to the virus came after White House Trade Adviser Peter Navarro stated China deliberately allowed the coronavirus to spread to the rest of the world and that virus “could have been contained in Wuhan.” As Breitbart News reported, Navarro said, “China hid the virus behind the shield of the World Health Organization, and that was a time, Gerry, when that virus could have been contained in Wuhan. Instead, what China did was put hundreds of thousands of Wuhanians and Chinese on planes that were allowed to go to Milan and New York and elsewhere, but not to Beijing and Shanghai.”  Despite the growing clamor for China to take responsibility for its actions, President Xi Jinping is is scheduled to give a video speech from Beijing on Monday for the opening ceremony of the W.H.A. during which he is expected to rebut criticism of China’s actions – or lack thereof. As Breitbart News reported, at least 62 countries beg to differ with the official view of the Chinese Communist Party. They are all backing Australia’s push for an official examination into the World Health Organization’s bungled response to the deadly pandemic which was first identified in the southern Chinese city of Wuhan late last year. The nations of the world are uniting to demand answers and accountability from the embattled World Health Organization (W.H.O.) for its disastrous handling of the Chinese coronavirus global pandemic. https://t.co/hpL3Zaxxvb — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) May 17, 2020  Foreign Minister Marise Payne on Monday said it was encouraging to see so many countries backing the inquiry, SBS News reports. “I think what it illustrates is a broad view that given the experience of COVID-19 – over 300,000 deaths, millions of people around the world losing their jobs, the impact on economies from one corner of the globe to the other – that there is a strong view that it is appropriate to engage in a review of what has happened. “I don’t want to preempt speculate about the outcome, those discussions will be under way later this evening. I think it’s a win for the international community.” The motion Australia will put to the W.H.A. requires the director-general of the World Health Organisation, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, to “initiate at the earliest appropriate moment, and in consultation with the Member States, a stepwise process of impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation”. The details call for an investigation into all the “experience gained and lessons learned from the W.H.O.-coordinated international health response to COVID-19”. Australia’s inquiry also wants and evaluation of the “effectiveness of the mechanisms at W.H.O.’s disposal and the actions of W.H.O. and their timelines pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic”. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has urged all nations to back Australia’s call for answers while at the same time taking Beijing to task over its reluctance to cooperate with countries seeking answers to the origin and spread of the pandemic.

Youngsters were assigned dystopian one-child “play squares” at a French school trying to figure out how to maintain social distancing as the national coronavirus lockdown eases. Pictures shared on social media by Lionel Top, a journalist at BFMTV and RMCinfo, showed a variety of measures in place to try and maintain social distance at the school, with the most striking being a shot of children confined in lonely, chalk-outlined boxes as they played outside. The Frenchman said there was a “Very strange, even disturbing atmosphere” at the school as it opened to a limited number of pupils, manned by schoolteachers wearing protective masks. “And if these photos sadden us, imagine what the teachers feel,” he added, quoting one educator as having told him the situation “makes me sick, you can’t imagine”. Contexte :Pour faire respecter les distances, tout en profitant des récrés, l’équipe pédagogique a dessiné des carrés au sol pour les + petits. Les enfants jouent, dansent, sautent, rient ensemble… mais depuis ce carré.De ce qu’on a vu, ils ne le vivent pas comme une punition https://t.co/i98ZltvteN — Lionel Top (@lioneltop) May 12, 2020  Top did go on to add, however, that the children did at least appear to be taking the strange situation in stride. “To ensure that distances are respected, while taking advantage of recreation, the educational team has drawn squares on the ground for the little ones. The children play, dance, jump, laugh together… but from this square,” he explained at length. “From what we’ve seen, they don’t see it as a punishment.” He said that while the photos “are striking and most of the reactions on Twitter show the same emotion,” it seemed that “the children this morning were not ‘unhappy’.” The Chinese coronavirus does not appear to have a high mortality rate among children, although paediatricians have in recent weeks begun warning that the pandemic appears to be coinciding with a small but significant spike in Kawasaki syndrome among youngsters — an often deadly condition in which the heart and blood vessels become inflamed. There are also concerns that children could become a vector for infections spreading among adults, infecting each other, their parents, and by extension those their parents come in contact with.

California Governor Gavin Newsom on Sunday said there could be a potential third wave of the coronavirus and policymakers need to be “humbled” by what they do not know about SARS-CoV-2. Policymakers have been expressing concerns about a potential second wave this fall, but the California governor on CNN went further, saying previous pandemics like the one in 1918 had multiple waves. “If history doesn’t repeat itself, it certainly rhymes. And the realities of previous pandemics around the globe and those we experienced in the United States suggest not just second waves, but potential third waves,” Newsom said. “And so one has to be very, very sober as we move forward to this next round of re-openings, and do so with the modifications that are required of the moment, and,  I think, a humbleness of spirit on all sides of the political aisle that’s also needed at this moment. Newsom was responding to questions about how quickly schools will re-open and if there will be major gatherings like sporting events and concerts this year in the Golden State. He predicted that “some school will not be” ready to open in the fall though “many schools will be.” “And it’s all conditioned on our ability to not only keep our children safe, but to keep staff and faculty safe, to keep the community safe. So, it’s all predicated on data, on science, on not just observed evidence, the reality on the ground,” Newsom said. “So, I think it’s a question that is a difficult one to answer in absolute terms. There’s nuance. But we are moving forward, in hope and expectation that we can start that school year very strategically and methodically, again, based upon the health as a prime frame of reference in terms of those decisions.” Newsom added that “each part of California is unique and distinctive” and “certain conditions will present themselves favorably, some unfavorably.” “But, look, I’m a father of four kids, and deeply anxious about their health and safety, as every parent watching is as well. And so it’s just another proof point. Those that claim we know what we know about this pandemic, it was 90 days ago no one even knew the word Covid, let alone what corona actually meant,” he continued. ” And so we are in a situation where, every day, we have to be humbled by what we don’t know, and we have to be open to argument, interested in evidence. You cannot be ideological about this disease, and nor — forgive me for belaboring — can we be naive.” Newsom, pointing out that businesses are re-opening with plenty of “modifications,” also gave realistic expectations about major sporting events returning this fall with crowds, saying that the health consequences associated with packed stadiums could be “profound.” “So, when you look for the future, you have got to paint a picture of those modifications, where people are practicing physical distancing, or should be, where people are putting face coverings on when they otherwise are coming into contact with strangers,” Newsom said. “But the idea of having stadiums filled with 80-plus-thousand people, strangers coming together across their differences, as much as we want to see that happen, and the spirit and the pride that comes from people coming together in that respect, the health consequences could be profound and devastating and set back all the progress we have made.” The California governor said state officials “are moving into that very cautiously, working with all the major leagues across the spectrum, to make sure that” they are “not promoting things or promising things” that they “can’t deliver.”

Eight-in-ten Americans believe “it is necessary” for people to wear masks when leaving their homes during the coronavirus pandemic, according to a Washington Post/University of Maryland poll released this week. The poll also found that “clear majorities of Democrats, Republicans and independents support” measures like wearing masks and social distancing. But “about a third or more of Republicans say wearing masks, avoiding gatherings with friends and staying home as much as possible are unnecessary,” according to the poll. “The widespread belief that people should wear masks and restrict their contact with people outside their homes is striking,” said Michael Hanmer, “a professor of government and politics at the University of Maryland who co-directed the survey.” “This stands in stark contrast to the handful of crowds in close spaces that have gained media attention.” A Morning Consult/Politico poll released this week also found widespread support for masks with more than 70 percent of respondents, including a majority of Republicans, saying that President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence “should wear face coverings in public places.” Eight-two percent of Democrats, 70 percent of independents and 58 percent of Republicans said Trump and Pence should wear masks in public places while just 12 percent said they should not. “When it comes to President Trump and Vice President Pence, there is a rare, bipartisan consensus among voters that they should be wearing masks when in public. This issue is sure to remain center-stage as the White House deals with its own outbreak of COVID-19,” Morning Consult’s Vice President Tyler Sinclair said. The Washington Post/University of Maryland poll was conducted May 5-10 and has a margin of error of +/- 3.5 percentage points. The Politico/Morning Consult poll was conducted May 8-10 and has a margin of error of +/- 2 percentage points.

MSNBC host Chris Hayes on Friday evening said nothing is more counterproductive than re-opening advocates to not wear masks as some sort of “badge of honor” while ripping President Donald Trump for perniciously “spreading propaganda” to make it more difficult to contain the coronavirus pandemic. Hayes bemoaned that “not wearing a mask has kind of become a sort of weird, culture war virtue signaling by Trump people” and told those want to re-open business: “The mask is your friend.” The MSNBC host said “it’s bad enough” Trump has failed to solve the coronavirus problem and “declared bankruptcy” on his ability to do so. But he added that there is “nothing more pernicious” and “nothing more stupid than actively spreading propaganda to make the problem worse.” “But for Donald Trump’s own stated aims, for the stated aims of those protesters, and all the right-wingers out there who think they’re the ones, the vanguard of opening up America and getting American capitalism cracking again, there is nothing stupider, nothing more counterproductive you can do than turn not wearing a mask into some right-wing badge of honor,” Hayes said. “If the stated goal here is to open up the American economy and get people back to work and achieve some level of normalcy, something we all desperately want, there is really good evidence that everyone wearing a mask can really help us in that project.” The MSNBC host noted that polls have found that 80 percent of Americans want people to wear masks when they leave their homes and pointed out that in places like Hong Kong, people continue to live their lives and even ride subways and go to crowded restaurants because masks work. Hayes also ripped Rush Limbaugh for mocking Dr. Anthony Fauci for wearing a mask during an appearance with Trump just days after Fauci went into limited quarantined and testified remotely before Congress because he may have been exposed to the coronavirus. Fauci presumably wore the mask to protect the president from potentially getting infected. Hayes said his masks fog up his glasses and make him feel claustrophobic but he wears them because it is the least he can do to help contain the spread of the coronavirus. “We are facing a pandemic that has ravaged everyone’s life,” Hayes added. “The easiest, lowest-hanging fruit to make things at least somewhat better, the smallest, most trivial thing is: Let’s all wear masks.” A recent in-depth study found that coronavirus infection would plummet the more people wore masks.   

Former Vice President Joe Biden’s presidential campaign accused President Donald Trump Sunday of allowing “countless unnecessary deaths” in the coronavirus pandemic, an escalation in response to criticism by Eric Trump. Trump’s son appeared Saturday evening on Fox News’ Justice with Judge Jeanine, telling host Jeanine Pirro that Democrats were “are trying to milk this for everything they can.” He referred specifically to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s effort to mandate vote by mail as part of her latest coronavirus relief bill, which passed along party lines on Friday — with 14 Democrats voting against the bill. Eric Trump also took a shot at Biden. “Biden loves this,” he said, referring to the lockdowns. “Biden can’t go onstage without making some horrible blunder. I mean, even from his basement, he’s making awful gaffes every single day. So his campaign is thrilled that he’s not going out there.” He continued: “And they think they are taking away Donald Truump’s greatest tool, which is being able to go into an arena, and fill it with 50,000 people every single time, right? So they will. And you watch — they’ll milk it every single day between now and November 3rd. And guess what? After November 3rd, coronavirus will magically, all of a sudden go away and disappear and everybody will be able to reopen. They’re trying to deprive him of his greatest asset, which is the fact that the American people love him, the fact that he is relatable the fact that he can go out there and draw a massive crowd. Joe Biden can’t get 10 people in a room. My father is getting 50,000 in a room. And they want to do everything they can to stop him. So make no mistake. To a lot of them, Jeanine, to a lot of them, this is a very cognizant strategy that they are trying to deploy. No different than, again, the nonsense that they’re trying to throw in the Hope Act [sic], it’s no different than the mail-in voting that they want to do all these places, no different than wanting illegal immigrants to vote in our country. It is a cognizant strategy, and it’s sad — and again, it’s not going to be allowed to happen, and we’ll going to win in November. In response, Biden’s deputy campaign manger and spokesperson, Kate Bedingfield, issued the following statement (emphasis added): We’re in the middle of the biggest public health emergency in a century, with almost 90,000 Americans dead, 1.5 million infected, and 36 million workers newly jobless, so for Eric Trump to claim that the coronavirus is a political hoax that will “magically” disappear is absolutely stunning and unbelievably reckless. The simple fact is that President Trump ignored the threat of the coronavirus for months and has mishandled the response at every step since — destroying the strong economy he inherited from the Obama-Biden administrations and leading to countless unnecessary deaths. Trump’s campaign knows he can’t run on that dismal record so they’re desperate to do whatever they can to throw up a smokescreen to try to conceal his historic mismanagement of the crisis. Biden’s son Hunter has kept a low profile, since he has been accused by critics of using his father’s former position to earn money from the corrupt Burisma energy company in Ukraine, and to secure funding from the Bank of China for a private investment fund he co-founded. Both arrangements began during the Obama-Biden administration. Joel B.

Lindsey Graham, a salon owner in Salem, Oregon, detailed how state authorities dispatched child protective services (CPS) to her home as part of their response to her ongoing business operations in defiance of Gov. Kate Brown’s (D-OR) statewide “stay-at-home” order. Graham, owner of Glamour Salon, described “harassment” and “bullying” directed against her by the government on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Sunday in an interview with host Joel Pollak. Graham recalled how an agent from Oregon’s Child Protective Services, a subsidiary of the state’s Department of Human Services (DHS), was sent to her home on the same day as the reopening of her hair salon. “On May 7th, I got a phone call from my nanny,” said Graham. “As soon as I went to work, a DHS officer came to my home and tried to speak to her, and she said, ‘I don’t feel comfortable answering any questions for you. I think you need to call the homeowner.’ So DHS basically stopped by my house and said they had some claims against me and my family about our home being unfit.” The same CPS agent returned to Graham’s home the following Monday, and he separated Graham and her husband from their six-year-old son in order to privately interview the child. Graham is also the mother of a three-year-old girl and an eight-week-old son. Graham stated, “[The CPS agent] came back to my home, and my intention was, ‘Great, let this guy in and let him see what a great, loving, clean, and happy home we have, so he’ll just kind of get out of here.’ … He interviewed myself and my husband in separate rooms. He interviewed my six-year-old son in a separate room, and he searched our home. He made me lift up toilet seats and open our fridge. None of this is warranted. These are all bogus claims. Our home is completely safe and always has been, so this is definitely some kind of vendetta, sending a government agency after my family.” LISTEN:  Graham shared the episode during a press conference held last Friday. While holding back tears, Graham shared, “Child protective services showed up my home. They questioned my husband and I. They questioned my child without me present. They searched our home, and I never expected such a violent, aggressive, vindictive thing could ever have been done to me or my family because I’m trying to learn a living [and] because I’m trying to work.” “They wouldn’t let me in the room while they questioned my child,” Graham noted of CPS’s private questioning of her six-year-old son. “As far as I’m aware, the case is open, and they are still insisting that they want to talk to my three-year-old daughter privately, as well. So, I don’t know if they’re going to talk to my eight-week-old newborn. We’ll see, but they did check his diaper.” “This is a false claim that wasted CPS’s valuable time when there are children who are really in need,” determined Graham. “Everyone’s job is essential, not because of what we do or how we do it, but because it’s the way we make our living,” added Graham. “I’m continually terrified for the surrounding businesses in Marion County that are still deemed non-essential. How many more businesses are going to go bankrupt and have to close because of this order?” WATCH:
 Municipal authorities in Salem have threatened to terminate Graham’s lease, given that her business is located on property leased from the city. Graham also said she was initially threatened with a $70,000 fine and eventually issued a $14,000 for operating a “hazardous facility” for her “employees.” She noted that her salon does not have employees but instead partners with independent contractors who voluntarily choose to work at her business. “I don’t have employees in my salon, right now,” remarked Graham. “I have independent contractors that are choosing to work, and they are choosing to do their clients’ hair, so they can provide for their families and their children.” Authorities further threatened to revoke Graham’s and her contractors’ professional licenses for operating in defiance of the governor’s “stay-at-home” decree. “By revoking our licenses, they saying, ‘If you continue to do hair, we will take your entire livelihood from you for the rest of your life,'” explained Graham.

A man in Gustavus, Alaska, is doing whatever it takes to make sure his entire town is fed during the coronavirus pandemic. When the state’s ferry system shut down because of the health crisis, Toshua Parker, the owner of Icy Strait Wholesale, was unable to get shipments of supplies from the Costco in Juneau to restock his store, according to WBAL-TV. However, with no alternative delivery method and 450 residents in the remote area depending on him, Parker took matters into his own hands. “Alaskans are fiercely independent and resourceful; you really have to be to survive here. So when a problem arises, we don’t typically look to someone else for help, we just find a way to do it,” he said. Working with his employees and local fishermen, the grocer has made the 50-mile boat trip to Juneau in a 96-foot-long converted military landing craft nearly once a week since February, according to a Facebook post: Prior to each journey, Parker took orders by phone and kept a list of everything his neighbors asked him to buy. “It’s like Christmas when the load gets here. Everyone is waiting for it. Word gets out, and they all seem to know when it’s coming,” he explained. May 5, the store locals also refer to as ToshCo, shared a photo of its shelves full of ammunition and assured residents that there was plenty to go around: “We learned our lesson after the last national unrest and ordered tons of handgun and rifle ammunition the minute this pandemic took hold. So while ammunition may be scarce or even non-existent in most places, ToshCo has you covered!” the post read. Recently, Gustavus Mayor Calvin Casipit expressed his thanks to the grocer for his dedication to the community’s well-being. “Toshua pretty much saved the town. I really don’t know what we would’ve done without him,” he stated. However, Parker gave the majority of the praise to his staff who worked hard every day for their neighbors. “Just another day in our world. Next year it will be another obstacle to overcome and we’ll buck up and deal with it,” he concluded.

Michigan protester Rob Cortis told Breitbart News that Democrats now believe walls work because of the quarantines they’ve imposed. Cortis and his “Trump Unity Bridge” float were in Grand Haven, Michigan, on Saturday to protest the closure of a huge parking lot at Gand Haven State Park, shuttered due to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s shutdown orders. “Nancy Pelosi, [Chuck] Schumer, even Joe Biden and [Barack] Obama. They all finally agree with President Trump that walls do work because they’re endorsing the quarantine around all the people, building a wall around them and saying, ‘If we build a wall around you with quarantine, you’ll be safe,'” Cortis told Breitbart News. “And if you’re safe, we’ll slowly let you out properly. We’ll put some rules and guidelines together, just like President Trump said,” he said. “They all agree with President Trump!” he declared. Cortis accepts donations so he can stay on the road promoting Trump, and he said he’s traveled over 260,000 miles supporting the president. In Grand Haven, Cortis was offering “President Trump 2020” masks as a fundraiser for his efforts, which he said are available on his website. “If everybody wears a Trump 2020 mask, you know what’s going to happen? CNN’s going to start announcing, ‘You don’t have to wear masks anymore,'” he said. “Wear a Trump 2020 mask, the quarantine will be over,” Cortis said. Kyle Olson is a reporter for Breitbart News.

DARLINGTON, S.C. (AP) — This was a 400-mile drive unlike any other in modern day NASCAR. The grandstands were completely empty. There wasn’t a single tailgate inside the track. Everyone wore face coverings — some with the team logos, others opting for plain disposable medical masks. It was nothing close to the corporate sponsorship, pomp and patriotic traveling circus that symbolizes NASCAR. But when the engines fired at Darlington Raceway following a 10-week layoff during the coronavirus pandemic, it turned into a regular old race. Kevin Harvick beat Alex Bowman to win NASCAR’s first race back, a spectacle closely watched to see if the largest motorsports series in the United States could successfully return to the track. “I just want to thank everybody from NASCAR and all the teams for letting us do what we do,” Harvick said. “I didn’t think it was going to be that different, then we won and it’s dead silent out here. We miss the fans.” It was a crucial gamble for NASCAR, which had to get back to the track to stave off financial ruin. With races on hold, no money was coming into the sport whatsoever and the NASCAR business model can not sustain the lack of revenue. NASCAR developed a health plan approved by officials in both South Carolina and North Carolina and scheduled seven races over the next 11 days at two tracks. As other states began to open, the series tacked more races to fill the calendar with 20 events across seven Southern states between now and June 21. There will be no spectators at least through that date. This first event was called the “The Real Heroes 400” and dedicated to health care workers fighting the coronavirus pandemic. The names of health care workers across the country were substituted for the drivers’ name above the door on each of the 40 cars. Harvick’s car honored Dr. Joshua Hughes, an emergency medicine physician in the Charlotte area. “Josh is one of my really good friends, I spend a lot of time talking to him through this pandemic and really have heard how those doctors are affected with everything they have going on with their personal life and whether they’re sick, not sick, how they should treat people,” Harvick said. “I’m just really honored and really thankful for all of our front line workers, not only our doctors, but grocery stores, truck drivers, fire fighters, police departments — you name it. “All of you front line workers are the reason that we’re here today and our country is actually still running.”
The health care workers then virtually gave the command to start the engines.
“Our drivers, race teams and officials have been eagerly awaiting the opportunity to get back to the race track and we want to assure you that we have taken the return to racing very seriously,” NASCAR President Steve Phelps wrote in a letter to fans released Sunday morning. The industry had to be extremely careful because to even get to the Coca-Cola 600 next week at Charlotte Motor Speedway, NASCAR had to get it right at Darlington. Steve O’Donnell, executive vice president of NASCAR, was pleased with the collective effort from the industry.
“We didn’t have to tell anyone or remind anyone to wear a mask,” O’Donnell said. “It felt a little odd with the garage area because it was scaled down in terms of personnel, but all in all I think it went really well.” Teams were required to submit rosters in advance with only 16 members allotted per car. Names were on a list at a checkpoint at the end of a gravel road just off Harry Byrd Highway and everyone who passed through had their temperature checked and logged before they could enter. NASCAR did not have to turn anyone away, and all 40 drivers were cleared to race. NASCAR has declined to do COVID-19 testing to ensure those tests go to those in need, but competitors are supposed to log who they come into contact with, not return to the race shop after being at the track and continue to follow CDC guidelines on social distancing. Among those to make it inside were Ryan Newman, back for the first time since he suffered a head injury exactly three months ago in a wreck on the final lap of the Daytona 500. Newman missed only three races because of NASCAR’s shutdown and finished 15th in his return. Also in the field was Matt Kenseth, who at 48 was the oldest driver at Darlington and he raced for the first time since the 2018 season finale. Kenseth was brought out of retirement by Chip Ganassi when Kyle Larson was fired for using a racial slur during an iRacing event that kept NASCAR occupied when racing was on hold. Kenseth finished 10th. The odd and empty setting was the backdrop for some typical NASCAR mishaps. Seven-time champion Jimmie Johnson crashed while leading on the final lap of the first stage, a better result than poor Ricky Stenhouse Jr., who barely made it out of the second turn before he crashed. Stenhouse never finished a single lap and finished last. And even without fans allowed on the property, a small grass fire still broke out behind a section of the track. Gray smoke billowed during a caution, which isn’t that odd a sight at a NASCAR race. Bowman, who signed a one-year contract extension with Hendrick Motorsports on Saturday, was second. Kurt Busch, winner of the closest finish in Darlington history, was third for Ganassi. Chase Elliott gave Hendrick two cars in the top-four. Denny Hamlin was the highest-finishing Toyota driver at fifth for Joe Gibbs Racing, one spot ahead of teammate Martin Truex Jr. Tyler Reddick, a rookie with Richard Childres Racing, was seventh at “The Track Too Tough To Tame.” Erik Jones, winner of the Southern 500 here last September, was eighth and John Hunter Nemechek was the second rookie inside the top-10 at one of the most technical tracks on the circuit. It was the first top-10 for Front Row Motorsports on a track other than a superspeedway in three years. It was the 50th career victory for Harvick, in a Ford for Stewart-Haas Racing. A previous winner at Darlington, Harvick led 159 of the 293 laps. Harvick tied Hall of Famers Junior Johnson and Ned Jarrett for 12th on NASCAR’s all-time wins list.
NASCAR’s elite Cup Series next races Wednesday night at Darlington, which is hosting three events in four days before the sport shifts to Charlotte.  

On Sunday’s broadcast of New York AM 970 radio’s “The Cats Roundtable,” Rudy Giuliani, personal legal counsel for President Donald Trump and former New York City mayor, addressed the ongoing lockdown in New York amid the coronavirus pandemic. Giuliani said New Yorkers “are fed up” with the uncertainty in getting back to normalcy and having to rely on the government to get by, which he argued is how socialists like Mayor Bill de Blasio “would like to keep it.” “The socialists who run this place don’t understand any of these things,” Giuliani told host John Catsimatidis. “I think [Bill] De Blasio would like to keep it this way. Nobody’s working, people are getting paid by the government — that’s what they believe in — no grades in school.” He continued, “The one good thing about this is these people have given us a glimpse of the future — Michigan, New York, California — of what they’re going to do if they ever govern. They’re not going to care about work. They’re not going to care about businesses. Businesses can go to hell as far as they’re concerned because you can always go on welfare. And then, they’re going to start getting authoritarian. They’re going to start bossing us around like the governor of Michigan threatens people. And even De Blasio — about a week ago he threatened people if they weren’t social-distancing … and there he was with no mask on and 200 people not social-distancing right in back of him, but they were his supporters.” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent

Inmates in Los Angeles County, California, are generally not being tested for the Chinese coronavirus before being released from jail, a county official reveals. An official with Los Angeles County’s Office of Diversion and Reentry told the Los Angeles Times in a report that many inmates are being released from jail over concerns of the coronavirus spreading but are never administered a coronavirus test. Even if inmates are given a coronavirus test, they sometimes are not told their results until after they have already been released from jail. The LA Times reports: “We slowed our work down in court and shifted our resources to address the number of people released from jail,” said Peter Espinoza, a retired Superior Court judge who now heads the office. Espinoza said they added 211 beds in new housing sites, and found housing for more than 170 inmates in a two-week period. [Emphasis added] He said inmates in L.A. County generally are not being tested for COVID-19 before their release unless they show symptoms and many service providers now are checking for symptoms when they arrive. [Emphasis added] The LA Times detailed the case of Frank Cooper who was released from the Riverside County, California Jail on April 24. Cooper was not supposed to be released until November, but officials decided to allow him to serve the rest of his sentence on house arrest. Cooper told the LA Times he had been quarantined in jail and was administered a coronavirus test by a nurse before being released. He said county officials never got his results to him and so he sought out testing himself. On May 2, a week after his release from jail, he found out he was positive for coronavirus. California has led a national prison release effort over fears that the coronavirus will overwhelm jails and prisons. Last week, Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva made public surveillance footage showing inmates purposefully trying to infect themselves with coronavirus so they would be more likely to be released from jail. As of the beginning of May, California officials have released more than 5,500 inmates into local communities since March 11. On average, nearly 700 inmates are being released every week across the state. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter at @JxhnBinder.

A man was arrested last week for allegedly attempting to carjack a woman and then choking her young son just ten minutes after being released from jail. Daniel Orozco, 28-years-old, was released from the Monterey County, California, jail after being arrested by highway patrol officers for allegedly driving while under the influence of drugs and driving the wrong way. After his arrest, Orozco was almost immediately released from jail. About ten minutes after his release, Salinas Police Department officials said Orozco allegedly forced a female driver out of her car in a parking lot. Orozco, Salinas officials said, began choking the woman’s 11-year-old son after she refused to give him the keys to her car. Eventually, the woman gave Orozco her keys and pulled her son out of the car, Salinas officials said, and Orozco fled the scene.  Orozco was arrested on Highway 101 and was again booked into the Monterey County Jail. He has been charged with carjacking, kidnapping, child endangerment, and assault with a deadly weapon.

A man with cerebral palsy in Seward, Nebraska, is feeling loved thanks to community members who heard he needed some cheering up amid the coronavirus pandemic. Dee Soflin’s brother, Marc Bogert, has cerebral palsy and is a resident at the Ridgewood Rehabilitation and Care Center, KOLN reported. According to his sister, Marc is a social butterfly who never stops smiling. “His favorite spot, from what I’m understanding, is by the nurse’s station so he can be the greeter. He’s just — he’s such a good guy,” she said. However, because of the health crisis, Marc’s movement around the facility has been limited, and he cannot wear a mask due to existing breathing issues. “He was just feeling kind of down because he couldn’t do his usual routine where he was always telling everybody ‘hi’ and ‘hey.’ You know, big thumbs up guy,” she explained. To lift his spirits, Soflin put out a call on social media on May 7 and asked her neighbors for help. “Can I ask that anyone who could take time to send him a card or something cheerful to help him get through this seclusion, please do so?” she wrote, adding that Marc was a big Huskers and WWE wrestling fan. “He needs a pick me up in other ways than human contact right now. The staff will take his mail to him and read them to him. Just one little cheerful note will help him out,” Soflin continued. Thanks to his sister, Marc later received dozens of heartfelt letters, balloons, and gifts from people who wanted to make him feel better. “It surprises me how many, but it doesn’t surprise me that it’s happened. I mean, I have a lot of friends and a lot of family that, you know, that’s just the kind of people we are,” she said. Because of their generosity and love, Marc has a smile on his face again. “It made me feel really good because he really deserves it, and they are telling me it has really, really made a difference,” Soflin concluded. Those who wish to send Marc a card can mail it to: Ridgewood Rehab and Care Center, 624 Pinewood Avenue, Seward, NE 68434.

American union workers are warning against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) coronavirus relief package over worries that it will gut employees’ pension plans. House Democrats passed their coronavirus relief package, dubbed the HEROES Act, this weekend despite labor unions’ pleading that the legislation will destabilize their pensions at an already uncertain time. In a letter signed by a number of unions, labor leaders said the relief package will weaken the pension system overall and leave workers vulnerable to having benefits and contributions cut in the near future. “Composite legislation is deeply flawed because it allows multiemployer plan trustees to ‘refinance’ their obligations to workers and retirees in the existing plan over 25 years instead of 15 years, so they can divert money to start a new composite plan,” the letter stated. “This weakens the existing plan and leaves neither plan — the existing plan nor the composite plan — with enough money to pay promised benefits.” Read the full letter here: Union Coalition Letter to C… by John Binder on Scribd  The letter was signed by the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union (BCTGM), the Directors Guild of America (DGA), the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE), the International Assoc. of Machinists & Aerospace Workers, the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU), the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades (IUPAT), the Musicians for Pension Security, the Pension Rights Center, the SEIU, the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW), the United Steelworkers, and the Western Conference of Teamsters Pension Trust. Previous analysis by the Western Conference of Teamsters warned that drastic cuts to workers’ pensions are necessary under such a policy. “A typical, mature composite must cut workers’ on-going benefits by 70 percent and their previously earned benefits by 25 percent … Additionally, the legacy plan must still cut workers’ previously earned benefits by 21 percent,” the analysis stated. Labor leaders for the United Steelworkers (USW) and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) likewise urged their members to write letters to Congress demanding the provision be removed from Pelosi’s HEROES Act. Leaders with IBEW sent around literature to members saying the provision will “bail out employers.” “IBEW opposes composite pension plans because they will sharply reduce pension benefits for current workers and retirees, eliminate employer withdrawal liabilities, and threaten the viability of the federal pension insurance program,” the literature states. Economic populists on the left came out against Pelosi’s HEROES Act, noting its inclusion of a massive tax break for the top one percent of billionaires and millionaires by eliminating the cap on the SALT deduction. The relief package allows employers to hire illegal aliens over unemployed Americans at cheaper wage rates without facing prosecution by federal agencies. The relief package now moves to the GOP-controlled Senate where it is unlikely to pass in its current form. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter at @JxhnBinder.

The first temporary sanctioned tent encampment opened this week in San Francisco, California, to give the homeless somewhere to go during the health crisis. “The move comes as outrage mounts over sidewalks clogged with tents and dire conditions in the Tenderloin amid the coronavirus pandemic,” the San Francisco Examiner reported. San Francisco has opened its first sanctioned camping site for the homeless, and more are in the works. https://t.co/VFYOAYd7Dp — SF Examiner (@sfexaminer) May 16, 2020  A recent count by the city found that the number of tents on sidewalks and other public areas had increased by 71 percent citywide and 285 percent in the Tenderloin district since January. The report continued: The first designated encampment, or safe sleeping site, is in a fenced-off area on Fulton Street near City Hall and contains roughly 50 tents spaced apart for social distancing, along with a handful of portable toilets, a couple of handwashing stations and 24-hour security. Officials say food, access to showers and cleaning services will also be provided. Friday, Mayor London Breed announced that the city planned to open a second Safe Sleeping Village at a former McDonald’s lot on Stanyan Street and that other locations were under consideration. “So we will be moving 40 tents to the site on Stanyan. Supervisor @DeanPreston is working with neighbors on the implementation. This is in addition to the 70 tents at the Civic Center site, and we’re looking for more sites right now,” she wrote on Twitter. In April, the city canceled plans to move hundreds of homeless people to an indoor convention center space after 70 shelter residents tested positive for the virus, according to Breitbart News. “San Francisco is also allowing outdoor tents — once viewed purely as a nuisance — to remain in place, at least for the duration of the pandemic, because it is easier to maintain ‘social distancing’ and the virus is harder to transmit outdoors,” the article said. In March, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Ben Carson told Breitbart News that the pandemic presented a unique opportunity to address the nation’s homelessness issue. He said the best solution was to build tent cities on public land where the spread of the disease would be less likely and where people could get help in becoming self-sufficient. “But if we don’t concentrate on doing that, what we will do is accumulate more and more and more dependent people, and pretty soon the total will be so great we will not be able to handle it,” he concluded.

Former Donald Trump administration official Jim Bognet told Breitbart News Saturday that Rep. Matt Cartwright (D-PA) has failed to lead on the coronavirus pandemic in Pennsylvania. Bognet, who is running to unseat Cartwright in Pennsylvania’s eighth congressional district, called on Pennsylvania Democrat Gov. Tom Wolf to face impeachment or resign if he will not reopen the state. “I’ve called for Wolf to be either be impeached or resign unless he can give us a plan to open up Pennsylvania in a safe way. We want our state back. We want to work. We don’t want government handouts. We need to get Pennsylvania open again,” Bognet said on Breitbart News Saturday. Bognet charged that Wolf and Rachel Levine, who is the nation’s first transgender state health secretary, have been a “complete disaster” for the state’s nursing homes. He told Breitbart News Saturday host Matthew Boyle, “Wolf and his minion Rachel Levine have handled this horribly. It’s been a complete disaster in Pennsylvania, we’ve had 2,700 of our seniors that have essentially been sentenced to death because of the criminal negligence that we’ve seen from Levine and Wolf.”  Bognet said that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Cartwright have not helped the crisis either. “Instead of focusing on protecting our most vulnerable population in our nursing homes, they sent COVID-infected patients into the nursing homes to spread the disease,” Bognet said. “It’s been horrible mismanagement and Nancy Pelosi and her lapdog Matt Cartwright; they haven’t helped anything either.” “They’ve been vacationing at home for two weeks instead of being in Washington and doing what we need to be done to help to get this country moving,” Cartwright said. “We need leadership,” Bognet said. “Where’s Nancy Pelosi on the streets of Hazleton, Pennsylvania? Where’s Matt Cartwright on the streets of Wilkes-Barre and Scranton, Pennsylvania? They have been cowards.” Breitbart News Saturday airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Eastern.

A U.S. postal service worker from New Hampshire who saw many graduating high school seniors could not have a traditional graduation ceremony because of the coronavirus left $5 Dunkin’ Donuts gift cards in their mailboxes. “$5 isn’t much, but it’s something so that the kids can get out of the house and go get a donut and an iced coffee,” Josh Crowell, 39, told CNN. The postal worker also leaves a hand-written note congratulating the 2020 graduate, signing it off with “your mailman Josh.” Crowell, whose delivery route is near Concord, New Hampshire, has dispensed at least 25 gift cards. But he keeps more in a lunchbox that he takes with him on his route in case he sees more 2020 graduation signs. Crowell, an essential worker, says he buys the gift cards using his own money. “I’m not very well-off myself, but I look at it as, if I put a smile on somebody’s face, then I will do it,” he said. He started working for the post office in November 2019, and his routes usually run through Concord, Loudon, and Bow. Various seniors who have received his gifts have responded with thank you notes for his kindness and continued work as an essential worker during the coronavirus pandemic, Crowell said. “This year has not been easy for most, but I think being able to make someone’s day is important. Thank you for being an essential worker, it means a lot,” one of the notes read. Crowell is the father of two daughters, so he knows how important it is for these students to partake in commencement ceremonies as a rite of passage. “She had some issues in school learning-wise, so she struggled,” Crowell said. “To know that she was able to graduate and walk across the stage and get her diploma was very meaningful for her and for me. To know that the students for 2020 are not going to be able to do that is hard and sad.”

President Trump called into an NBC Sports golf broadcast on Sunday, to talk about how important it is to get the country’s sports leagues back on the playing field. The call took place during the TaylorMade Driving Relief event in Florida, the first televised golf event held in about two months. Trump told NBC announcer Mike Tirico vital sports were to the nation’s “psyche.” “We want to get sports back. We miss sports,” Trump said. “We need sports in terms of the psyche, the psyche of our country. “We want to be back to normal where you have the big crowds where they’re practically standing on top of each other, not where they’re worried.” Trump’s remarks about wanting to see the return of “big crowds,” comes on a day when NASCAR made its return in front of an empty track in Darlington, South Carolina. The UFC, the first organization to return to action since the sports world went silent roughly two months ago, held three events from May 9th through May 16th, all without fans in attendance. Still, as Carolina Panthers Owner Dave Tepper said this week, there’s some optimism that fan attendance – with social distancing restrictions in place – could return in the next few months.

Several Chicago area churches held in-person Sunday services in defiance of Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s (D) stay-at-home orders. Pastor Florin Cimpean of the Philadelphia Romanian Church of God in Ravenswood said he expected around 50 to 60 people to attend services, which was about 10 percent of the congregation on a regular Sunday, according to ABC 7. “The church is a spiritual hospital, okay. We help people with their spiritual needs, emotional needs. And this church is much safer than any other open space like Home Depot, Costco, any type of store,” he commented. Cimpean, who grew up in Soviet-controlled Romania, added that the church served an immigrant community that survived communism in the past and felt it was threatening their freedoms once again. “All of these restrictions, they sound more like communism,” he said at an event outside the Thompson Center on Thursday. Former mayoral candidate Willie Wilson organized the gathering to give pastors a platform to voice their disagreement with Pritzker’s order, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. “Not even communists were able to completely shut down churches,” Cimpean stated. “We are essential. The spiritual, emotional and mental impact of this [coronavirus] will probably be greater long-term than the medical one.” However, after Wilson and others urged churches to reopen and called them “essential businesses,” Mayor Lori Lightfoot said she found the effort dangerous. “This is not playing Russian roulette. This is playing with a gun that’s fully loaded and cocked,” she claimed. Wednesday on Twitter, Pritzker said there were no easy decisions during a pandemic and added that he had “sympathy for leaders struggling with those choices — but not for those so intent on disregarding science & logic that they put people’s lives at risk.” “You weren’t elected to do what’s easy. You were elected to do what’s right,” he continued. Despite their warnings, Cimpean said Thursday that if violating the stay-at-home order meant being arrested, he was willing to face the consequences. “I don’t think the mayor will do that. But if they want to do that, let them come. It is what it is,” he concluded.

Dr. Nicole Saphier, physician and author of Make America Healthy Again: How Bad Behavior and Big Government Caused a Trillion-Dollar Crisis, said it was unreasonable to make economic reopening contingent on development of a vaccine for the coronavirus, offering her remarks on Tuesday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Daily in an interview with host Alex Marlow. Marlow asked about those calling for development of a coronavirus vaccine as a prerequisite to “opening up the country.” Various Democrats and assorted left-wing figures such as Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA), Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, and Bill Gates have linked a resumption of economic and social normality to formulation and mass administration of a vaccine for the novel virus. Saphier replied, “It is completely unreasonable to say that we are waiting to open up for the vaccine, because that vaccine may never come.” The novel coronavirus’ asymptomatic spread is “the biggest” concern with the outbreak, she added, urging the use of social distancing in dealing with vulnerable persons. LISTEN:  “We really have to maintain social distancing from those that are most vulnerable, and that means continuing to restrict visitors from nursing homes and making sure nursing homes can actively surveil their workers because their workers are healthy, but they may be bringing it in via asymptomatic spread,” Saphier stated. Saphier addressed Sen. Chris Murphy’s (D-CT) repeated linking of coronavirus testing to economic “reopening.” If we're going to safely reopen in the coming months, we need a lot more tests. Our bill has a plan to get there.https://t.co/uLNp1a5HjE — Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) May 1, 2020  Saphier remarked, “Is it reasonable to say every American needs to be tested? Not really, because not every American needs to be tested. If you are a stay-at-home mother working with her kids, or just being at home, you don’t need to go and get tested. But when it comes to kids going back to college, I think that that is potentially something that needs to be done.” Coronavirus testing policies should be determined by local conditions, added Saphier. “Widespread testing” should be implemented in “places where you still have a lot of circulating virus,” she said, “But you shouldn’t need a negative test to go to the grocery store.” Masks are valuable in places of human traffic such as grocery stores, Saphier remarked. “You just need to assume that everybody has the virus, because so many people could be walking around asymptomatic,” Saphier stated. “In these public spaces, you may still need to be wearing masks in the interim until we start seeing cases die down, and it may not happen this summer, but we will start seeing a dying down of cases. It will happen within a couple of years. It would be amazing if we could have a vaccine in the interim, but I’m not sure we will.” Marlow noted that Democrats and the broader left continually shift the benchmarks upon which they claim economic reopening should be contingent. “The problem I’m concerned about is we do not have a standard that we are trying to meet [for reopening],” Marlow expressed. “They have now continued to move the goal posts, so now everyone must be tested or we can’t go back to work. The goal posts will keep shifting so that we can’t meet those marks.” Quick on-site testing at businesses is unlikely to be feasible, predicted Saphier. Saphier said, “I don’t think that [the 12-minute tests] are going to be as widely available as we might think. They give off these numbers that include the rapid test, but it also includes the public health test that has to be sent to the lab, so it’s not a matter of being able to take a swab and then walk in somewhere. It’s not that easy.” “The media would love to make [universal testing] the standard [for reopening],” Marlow assessed. Marlow asked about the utility of masks in reducing the spread of coronavirus infections. He said, “I think it probably does some good [to wear masks], but I’m seeing a lot of people who are not social distancing because they’re wearing masks.” Saphier responded, “There’s a reason that public health officials and physicians like myself don’t necessarily recommend wearing masks for the general public, because the vast majority of people are not wearing them appropriately and they’re giving them a false sense of confidence.” Some news media personalities wear masks at White House press briefings as political props, assessed Saphier. Saphier recalled, “I’ve watched some of the press briefings, and you see the media actually touch their masks for their questions to be heard. What is the point of that? Because now they’ve contaminated their hands [and] their masks. People are not wearing these appropriately. It’s much more about political posturing to make sure they’re doing something right, but I don’t know how much it’s helping them. But I will say it is containing some of respiratory droplets whether they’re coughing or speaking. It might be doing a little bit, but it is not the be-all and end-all.” Saphier added, “I certainly don’t want to turn into a society where everyone is wearing masks.” Both Marlow and Saphier concurred that an assortment of medical professionals would be better able to ask questions of importance to the nation’s public health at White House press briefings than the current rotation of news media personalities.

Sunday on MSNBC, Rep. Steve Cohen (D-TN) slammed President Donald Trump, saying he was “just defunct of knowledge and talks like a third-grader.” In a clip, former President Barack Obama said, “All those adults that you used to think were in charge and knew what they were doing, turns out they don’t have all the answers. A lot of them aren’t even asking the right questions. Do what you think is right. Doing what feels good, what’s convenient, what’s easy, that’s how little kids think. Unfortunately, a lot of so-called grown-ups, including some with fancy titles and important jobs, still think that way. Which is why things are so screwed up.” Host Alex Witt said, “So look no names there but when he is talking about the so-called grown-ups, and that’s how little kids think, is he talking about President Trump? Do you endorse this kind of language and that assessment that way?” Cohen said, “Well when you talk about somebody who thought a nuclear bomb could deter a hurricane, who thought that injecting some type of light or heat into a person’s body or some chemical could cure them of COVID-19, you are talking about somebody who is just defunct of knowledge and talks like a third-grader. He’s exactly right.” He continued, “Today Navarro was on “Meet the Press,” and said Obama and the previous administration left our stockpiles empty. They had been in office three years, don’t you think that could get the stockpiles up to snuff. You buy a house, and you go in, and you can see the pantry doesn’t have the food you want, you go to the store and buy food. They are blaming Obama for the stockpile not being where they want it three years later. They have been in charge of it for three years. They haven’t taken care of it. It’s absurd. President Obama was right. He is highly respected. This attack on Obama, it’s fantasy. That’s a hoax. It’s typical of what Trump does. He projects, and he lies. He is a mendacious individual. It’s dangerous at this serious time that we have somebody in office who is not capable of facing reality, dealing with science and being a leader and putting the country first.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

The Pride’s Corner drive-in movie theater in Westbrook, Maine, reopened on Saturday to a sold-out crowd of moviegoers who packed the lot for a showing of the 1939 classic Wizard of Oz. “It feels very nice because I’ve been inside so long,” said Emma Ferris, one of the moviegoers. “It feels good to be able to see a movie again.” A local ABC news affiliate reported that guests were required to park their vehicles between poles that were specifically installed to ensure that each car remained at a safe distance apart and that social distancing and mask-wearing guidelines were also enforced on the premises. Attendees were also allowed to sit in front of their cars but not at the sides of them. “The general public has been doing a great job — they’ve been following the COVID-19 requirements and recommendations so it’s gonna be a great evening,” said Jeff Tevanian, the operator at Pride’s Corner, according to WMTV 8. The Pride’s Corner was not the only drive-in theater to have recently garnered a large crowd. On Friday, the Capri Drive-in Theater in Branch County, Michigan, was also packed, as moviegoers flocked in defiance of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s stay-at-home order. The drive-in theater opened for business for the first time all year on Friday night — just hours after governor Whitmer held a press conference slamming businesses in Michigan defying her orders. Drive-in movie theaters have increased in popularity as draconian lockdown measures have been established by politicians in response to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. In fact, this new “pandemic generation” currently has more than 300 drive-in theaters available to them across the United States, which is down from about 4,000 in 1958, according to a report by the Middletown Press. The concept of drive-in events don’t just stop with movies, as Florida is about to host what is likely the nation’s first-ever drive-in music festival. The festival, called, “The Road Rave” promises “a ​full festival main stage production” headlined by DJ Carnage, who is calling the event “North America’s first-ever drive-in festival of the COVID era.” You can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo, and on Instagram.

In California’s Central Valley, where farmers grow the food Americans eat and shops provide goods for them and their families, the coronavirus era is coming to a close, as Atwater declares itself a “sancuary city” where businesses and churches are opening their doors. The San Francisco Chronicle describes the move as “in defiance of the California’s shelter-in-place order,” but the people who live there believe it is about their survival — not from dodging the virus, but from the draconian lockdown that cost people their livelihoods: The City Council heard from a parade of business owners, pastors and residents on Friday who described pandemic-related hardships. Many insisted they could be responsible and keep the community safe by following safe practices like wearing face masks and keeping social distance. Resident Caleb Hampton — a lonely voice for upholding the shelter order — said there was little proof people would be responsible in protecting public health, as evidenced by those attending the council meeting, most without masks, including the council members and staff. (Hampton wore a mask.) “How many people came up and touched this lectern and then was it ever disinfected?” he said. “The council has pressed this narrative that small businesses can be responsible to implement these guidelines on their own … But I don’t see evidence of that in daily activities even here.” The members of the city council, “without discussion” according to the Chronicle, passed unanimously a resolution “affirming the city’s commitment to fundamental constitutional rights and declaring the city of Atwater a sanctuary city for all businesses.”  Council members said the measure also applies to churches. “If they don’t open up, they’re going to be in a really bad state, and we’re going to have bankruptcies and foreclosures and we’re just going to have families that are decimated financially,” said Chamber of Commerce President Don Borgwardt, who is also a local pastor and made a plea for people to be allowed back inside houses of worship. “It’s time to do the right thing and listen to the people who put us here,” Mayor Paul Creighton said in the Chronicle report. “We want you guys to survive and thrive. It’s really critical that the elected in this country and especially this state start listening to you.” “Creighton later told the Merced Sun-Star that while the city would take no action against anyone who reopened outside the state’s guidelines, local businesses were taking their own risks by reopening,” the Chronicle reported. “If you do have a state (business) license, that’s between you and the state of California,” Creighton said. Atwater is in Merced County, California, and has recorded 200 coronavirus cases and six COVID-19 deaths, according to the county website.  On Saturday, County Sheriff Vernon Warnke said on Facebook that he “will not be taking any enforcement action in this county for any of the COVID-19 ‘violations,’” the Chronicle reported. “The citizens themselves can make informed decisions on how to proceed and protect their lives and livelihood and not the governor of a state,” the Facebook post said.

We few, we happy few, we band of brothers. That’s how it felt at the anti-lockdown rally in Hyde Park, London, yesterday, where I was threatened with a fine and arrest for the crime of doing my job. It’s also where I got to see Britain at its best – and worst. There weren’t many protestors but those who were made me proud to be British. We were a very mixed crowd, very representative of the melting pot that London has become – and definitely considerably less white and middle class than the crowd you’d find at an Extinction Rebellion rally. I met a black working-class couple who were both bus drivers; several smartly dressed, well-spoken elderly people; an American former US diplomat and former Democrat voter; a very distressed French-sounding girl distraught that she’d been harassed by police simply for remaining in the same area for more than 45 minutes; a woman who had grown up in 70s Czechoslavakia and recognised the symptoms of Communism all too easily. There were anti-vaxxers, yes, and people who felt that all the world’s current ills could be traced back to Bill Gates, yes. But mostly this was a rally about freedom, where everyone present could not quite believe just how easily so many British people had surrendered willingly to the most flagrant assault on liberty in centuries. This ought not to be a weird, eccentric thing to want to protest. As former Supreme Court judge Lord Sumption puts it in the Times, the lockdown was something Prime Minister Boris Johnson entered “in a blind panic provoked by Professor Neil Ferguson’s ‘reasonable worst case’ of 510,000 deaths.” But now that the Ferguson study has been so comprehensively discredited and its assumptions proved false, the entire raison d’être of the lockdown has gone. So why is the lockdown continuing? According to Lord Sumption, it’s as simple — and depressing — as this: The lockdown is now all about protecting politicians’ backs. They are not wicked men, just timid ones, terrified of being blamed for deaths on their watch. But it is a wicked thing that they are doing. Do please take time to watch the videos and listen to what the protestors have to say. I think you’ll be impressed not just by their passion but also how articulately they express what should be obvious to everyone: the lockdown just isn’t normal; the freedoms the government has stolen from us without so much as a by-your-leave should never have been surrendered so lightly. Imagine how absurd it would have felt six months ago if someone had told you: “In May 2020 the police will arrest you if you stand closer than six feet to someone in a park.” Yet now lots of people take it for granted. When I say I saw Britain at its worst, I don’t mean the police who were, yes, a bit heavy-handed and definitely operating in sledgehammer-to-crack-a-nut territory. Rather, I mean the useful idiots who had come to the rally not to protest against Boris Johnson’s lockdown policy, but to remonstrate with those of us who disagreed with it. “No, it’s not a police state,” declared a posh gentleman, even as the police all around us stalked members of the crowd like lions hunting wildebeest, threatening and arresting people for the tiniest of infractions. The lockdown, he insisted, was purely in the public interest. The right to protest is a long-established British tradition — and never more important than in times as illiberal as these. Yet some Britons seem happy to surrender our ancient liberties without a shot. Britain’s economy has been ruined, millions of jobs and thousands of businesses have been destroyed, our children are being denied an education, and the populace is now being fed daily propaganda by a mainstream media which has been bought and paid for by the government. If this isn’t worth risking arrest to protest against, I don’t know what it is. I salute all those who were there. And I think in the coming weeks and months, as more information emerges about the flimsy scientific basis for the government’s lockdown, the numbers of protestors will only grow and grow.

Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) called “rethinking some fundamental tenets about the way our government and society works,” a “silver lining” of the coronavirus pandemic. Sanders said, “George, to tell you the truth, that if there’s any silver lining in this midst of this terrible, terrible, and unprecedented moment in American history in terms of the economy and in terms of the pandemic, is that maybe we start rethinking some fundamental tenets about the way our government and society works. And we should ask ourselves, among other things, is health care a human right that all of us deserve? Because we’re human beings. Or is it simply a health care benefit that somehow we lose when we lose our jobs?” He continued, “You know, Mr. Navarro talked about the great economy, a beautiful economy that existed before the pandemic — well, half of people in America were living paycheck to paycheck. I don’t think it’s beautiful economy that when paychecks stop for two weeks, millions and millions of people don’t have enough money to buy the food that they need to feed their families. We need an economy that works for all, not just Trump and his billionaire friends. We need an economy that says we shouldn’t have three people on top owning more wealth than the bottom half of the American society. We need an economy that says health care is a human right, like every other country. We’re not getting ripped off by the pharmaceutical industry.” He added, “There’s a lot to be done. And if there’s anything that I hope we learn out of this horribly painful experience is that maybe we create an economy and a government that works for all, not just the few and wealthy campaign contributors.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar disputed claim that the Center for Disease Control let the country down on coronavirus testing in the early stages of the pandemic. Earlier on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” White House trade advisor Peter Navarro said, “Early on in this crisis, the CDC, which really had the most trusted brand around the world in this space, really let the country down with the testing. Because not only did they keep the testing within the bureaucracy, they had a bad test. And that did set us back.” Partial transcript as follows: BRENNAN: The CDC has been blamed for failure and mistakes with testing. Do you take responsibility for that? AZAR: So we were confronting a situation here that’s completely novel. There has never been a national, immediate testing regime across public and private sectors. We have had to literally build this from the ground up, Margaret. That’s what some folks don’t quite understand here, is that the CDC’s role is to develop an initial, fairly low throughput public health test that health labs will- will do for initial diagnosis. But then we count on the private sector actually to scale up these high throughput, large test capacities. And that’s what we’ve done in historic time. You know, these tests normally would take– BRENNAN: So- so you don’t– AZAR: –six to nine months to get. BRENNAN: –take responsibility for any problems that the CDC has admitted to having had? AZAR: We, you know, what did the- what problem did the CDC have? The CDC had an issue as they scaled up manufacturing of tests to get them out to about 90 public health labs. There was apparently a contamination at an end-stage there on the third part of the reagent that never led to false negatives or false positives, but that prevented some of the scale up for a couple of weeks. But that was never going to be the backbone of testing, of broad mass testing in the United States, Margaret. That depends on the companies like Abbott and Roche and Thermo Fisher for these high throughput tests. BRENNAN: I just want to clarify because your colleague, Peter Navarro, has said that the CDC let the country down. Given the CDC reports up to you, — AZAR: I– BRENNAN: Do you take responsibility for that? What do you think about that? AZAR: I don’t believe the CDC let this country down. I believe the CDC serves an important public health role. And what was always critical was to get the private sector to the table. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Tragedy struck former U.S. Women’s National Team goalkeeper Hope Solo and her husband, former NFL player Jerramy Stevens, after their dog Conan was shot and killed. On Saturday, the former Olympian took to Instagram to share the heartbreaking story after the dog succumbed to massive blood loss as a result of the shooting.     ‪We‘re brokenhearted to share that Conan passed away from blood loss last night. He fought up until the very end.‬ We’re crushed. Just a dog running through the woods, trying to make his way home. We bought our 60-acres so our dogs have space to run and live their most full lives.‬ Conan was kind and loving. He wandered 30 yards off our property when he was shot. As animal lovers we are struggling to make sense of anyone using their right to own guns to shoot pets of any kind. We have had pets come onto our property and always helped them get home safe.‬ A post shared by  Hope Solo (@hopesolo) on May 16, 2020 at 6:02pm PDT “‪We‘re brokenhearted to share that Conan passed away from blood loss last night,” Solo wrote. “He fought up until the very end.‬” The former goalie had first posted about the shooting incident on Thursday. “It’s hard news to share, but harder to make sense of this heinous act. Jerramy and I are shocked and heartbroken, but we want to say thank you to Wilkes Veterinary Hospital and their staff for rushing Conan into emergency care, as well as their COVID-19 care practices,” Solo posted to Instagram on Thursday. “We‘ve heard that there are developments in canine prosthetics and would love any information about getting Conan a new front leg!” Solo expressed shock that someone would shoot her dog, considering it was a pet, “as animal lovers we are struggling to make sense of anyone using their right to own guns to shoot pets of any kind. “We have had pets come onto our property and always helped them get home safe,” she said. Solo and Stevens recently announced that they are expecting twins.

Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) said federal lawmakers have a “moral” and “ethical” obligation to provide emergency relief to states amid the coronavirus pandemic. Partial transcript as follows: TAPPER: So, the position of the White House seems to be that any money for states would be premature. What’s your response, sir? NEWSOM: Well, it’s not charity. I mean, a year ago, Jake, we were running a $21.5 billion surplus. And here we are at $54.3 billion budget deficit that is directly COVID- induced. We have been managing our budget effectively, efficiently, paying down our long-term pension obligations. We had a bond rating that went up twice last year, the highest in decades. So, we’re not looking for charity. We’re not looking for handouts. It’s social responsibility, at a time when states not just California, large and small, all across this country, cities, and counties, large and small, all across this country are facing unprecedented budgetary stress. It is incumbent upon the federal government to help support these states through this difficult time. TAPPER: Well, the House passed a bill on Friday night with money for states, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has suggested it’s dead on arrival. Can you explain what you think will happen to California if the federal government doesn’t give you money to help you out? NEWSOM: Well, these same folks that say it’s dead on arrival, I hope they will consider this. The next time they want to salute and celebrate our heroes, our first responders, our police officers, and firefighters, consider the fact that they are the first ones that will be laid off by cities and counties. The folks that are out there, the true heroes of this pandemic are health care workers and nurses. Those county health systems have been ravaged. Their budgets have been devastated and depleted. Their budget counts depleted since this pandemic. They’re the first ones to be laid off. So, we have got to square our rhetoric with the reality. Twenty percent of Americans are unemployed. In a few weeks, over 100,000 Americans will have lost their lives. These are Depression-era unemployment numbers, and we have to own up to that. So, I’m not looking to score cheap political points, but I do want to make this point, Jake. We have an obligation, a moral, an ethical obligation to American citizens all across this country to help support cities, states and counties. Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Sunday on MSNBC’s “AM Joy,” former Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams said President Donald Trump and Republicans do not want vote-by-mail because they do not want to be “held accountable for their mismanagement and incompetence,” amid the coronavirus pandemic. In a clip, Trump said, “They had levels of voting, that if you ever agreed to it, you’d never have a Republican elected in this country again.” Host Joy Reid asked, “Has it been as clear to you from Republicans that what they object to with vote-by-mail is the fact that more people would get to vote and that would hurt them in being able to win.” Abrams said, “Yes, that has been the unequivocal statement not only made by Donald Trump, it was actually made in the state of Georgia by the speaker of the House. There was a reaction when the secretary of state in Georgia agreed to expand access to vote by mail by sending out 6.9 million ballot applications. The following weeks he created a voter fraud task force basically trying to use this to intimidate people out of using a right that they hold in the state of Georgia and have held since 2005. The challenge is this if everyone can participate, then choices we make will reflect the values and the needs of our communities. And because our communities have evolved, they’re more diverse, and they’re facing the consequences of COVID-19, not simply economically but physically, they are very afraid the Republicans are deeply afraid they will be held accountable for their mismanagement and incompetence, and that’s why they don’t want voting to be expanded to every eligible American voter.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

MADRID (AP) — Spain’s health minister says the government will consider making the use of face masks mandatory in public spaces. Face masks in Spain are currently only mandatory on public transport, while strongly recommended in public spaces. Many people now wear them while out of their homes after Spain managed to overcome a scarcity of masks in the first weeks of the pandemic. Health Minister Salvador Illa said Sunday that “there is a wide consensus (among Spain´s regional governors) to reinforce the obligation to wear masks.” Illa said the ministry’s experts still need time to study the details on the new restriction. Spain is emerging from a strict lockdown that has slowed down a COVID-19 outbreak that has killed more than 27,000 people in the country and infected more than 277,000. Spain to Introduce Mandatory Mask Wearing on Public Transport https://t.co/WKGNNX9uSi — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 3, 2020  Spain’s two largest cities are still largely shut down while most of the country has begun to reopen following a lockdown to fight the coronavirus pandemic. Madrid and Barcelona have been told to wait by the government’s health officials since they have been the hardest-hit areas and need to improve their capacity to monitor new cases. That has led to complaints by Madrid’s regional leaders and to daily protests of a few hundred people in one of the capital’s upscale neighbourhoods and other cities like Salamanca and Zaragoza. Many marchers carry Spanish flags and shout, “Freedom!” Spain’s right-populist Vox party and the conservative leader of the region have voiced their support for the protests, saying that the city´s economy must restart soon to save jobs. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez made a plea on Saturday for his detractors to consider that keeping the health crisis under control was key to protecting the country´s fragile economy. “By saving lives, we also save businesses and jobs,” Sánchez said. Coronavirus: Boris Govt Decides Masks Work After All https://t.co/Tq5hBU7i77 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 12, 2020  Spain has registered its first daily death toll of fewer than 100 confirmed fatalities since declaring a state of emergency to fight the coronavirus two months ago. Spain’s health minister says regional authorities have reported 87 new deaths, the lowest daily count since March 16. Spain reported over 900 deaths a day at the height of the outbreak. The country of 47 million has had 27,650 deaths and 277,719 infections from Covid-19. Spain is easing its strict lockdown measures that succeeded in slowing the spread of the virus but have also brought its economy to a halt.

Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said the Center for Disease Control (CDC) “really let the country down” over coronavirus testing. Host Chuck Todd asked, “It does seem as if the initial guidelines, they didn’t want them put out. They’ve put down very limited guidelines with more detailed ones coming later. CDC hasn’t been able to give a briefing now in over a month. Does the president have confidence in the CDC as our lead on this pandemic?” Navarro said, “Well, I’d say two things about that, first of all, you should ask the president that question, not me. Early on in this crisis, the CDC, which really had the most trusted brand around the world in this space, really let the country down with the testing. Because not only did they keep the testing within the bureaucracy, they had a bad test. And that did set us back.” He added, “Going forward with these guidelines, the important thing to understand here for the American people is this — opening up this economy is not a question of lives versus jobs. The fact of the matter is, and what President Trump realized early on is that if you lock people down, you may save lives directly from the China virus, but you indirectly are going to kill a lot more people.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Konrad Ott and some of the parents with his Northern California girls volleyball club skipped a popular Florida tournament that is now postponed. They could soon face a similar decision about a national event in Dallas. A boys baseball tournament organizer in the St. Louis area generated debate by staging an event less than a week after the Missouri governor cleared such gatherings. These scenarios playing out across the nation illustrate how a return to youth sports amid the coronavirus pandemic is fraught with questions, from the health of everyone who attends to the ethics of potentially putting children in harm’s way in the name of getting back to business. “Obviously, there’s two sides to this story,” said Rob Worstenholm, whose youth baseball tournament in suburban St. Louis with social-distancing alterations for 50 teams or so was among the first sports activities of any kind since the shutdown in March. “I mean, 50% of the people hate me. But the other 50%, I could have run for president.” The Amateur Athletic Union was planning to proceed with a volleyball event it has touted as the world’s largest, scheduled for June in Orlando, Florida. An event that drew nearly 3,000 teams last year had about 500 entrants when it was postponed Friday and moved to mid-July. Ott’s Absolute Volleyball Club included six of the hundreds of teams that withdrew even as the AAU spent two weeks saying the event would be held with temperature checks, no handshakes and plenty of space between courts at the sprawling Orange County Convention Center. While some clubs said organizers didn’t make it clear what would happen if a player, coach or parent tested positive for the coronavirus, Ott’s issue was the plan to allow each team’s group to be twice as large as he thought it needed to be. Politics are at play as well, with California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, taking a more cautious approach than Gov. Ron DeSantis, his Republican counterpart in Florida. “I know my families are very wary about traveling to states that have, they’re trying to rush to open,” Ott said. “My families were just really apprehensive, as was I, about getting on an airplane and flying across country, the hotels, the food. It just seems like a lot to get done in a pretty short amount of time.” Before the postponement, Tony Carrow of the Nebraska Elite club said his parents were comfortable with what they thought was a low infection rate in the Orlando area. In one of the club’s age groups, opinions were split on two teams, so they were combined into one. “We had a very strong voice from certain parents that they wanted their kids to go,” Carrow said. “They want to get back to living their life.” Since physical risk is inherent in most youth sports, the question of playing your children in a pandemic turns to the perception of risk, according to Scott Kretchmar, professor emeritus of exercise and sports science at the Penn State College of Health and Human Development. “The ethical issue comes in about necessary risks and unnecessary risks,” Kretchmar said. “And if waiting another two months removes an important, unnecessary risk, then you might argue let’s wait two months, let’s wait three months until the risk is more tolerable rather than pushing the envelope.” With the AAU’s postponement, the next major event for volleyball clubs around the country is a USA Volleyball tournament in Dallas in late June. The event is on for now, although Ott said he’s already leaning against traveling with any of his club’s teams. For many clubs, the AAU and USA Volleyball events wrap up the season. “I would say that those are high-risk events,” said Dr. Richard Pan, a pediatrician and state senator in California. “You’re drawing people from so many different parts of the country. And some of these areas may have a higher rate of this disease and others. But now we’re going to take all those people, bring them to one place, have them mixed together.” Worstenholm’s baseball tournament last weekend ended up with about a quarter of the teams he usually attracts. He anticipates keeping for now social distancing measures that include separating players and parents, putting the home plate umpire behind the pitcher’s mound and spraying baseballs with disinfectant. And “unless something blows up,” he is planning events with higher numbers of teams most weekends through the summer. “I love to see kids play,” Worstenholm said. “But I’ve never seen anything like this. It was like a joy times a hundred. It wasn’t just kids being happy because they’re playing baseball. It was way beyond that.”
The adults have to weigh when, and where, that return to play can happen.  

NEW YORK (AP) — Major League Baseball will look somewhat like high school ball this year under protocols to deal with the new coronavirus, with showers at ballparks discouraged and players possibly arriving in uniform, like they did when they were teenagers. Team personnel will be banned from eating at restaurants on road trips. Even the Phillie Phantic and Mr. Met will be missing, banned from the field along with all other team mascots.
The traditional exchange of lineup cards would be eliminated, along with high-fives, fist bumps, and bat boys and girls, according to a 67-page draft of Major League Baseball’s proposed 2020 Operations Manual. A copy was sent to teams Friday and obtained by The Associated Press. The guidelines, first reported by The Athletic, are subject to negotiation with the players’ association. Teams will be allowed to have 50 players each under the plan, with the number active for each game still be negotiated. Spitting is prohibited along with water jugs and the use of saunas, steam rooms, pools and cryotherapy chambers. Hitting in indoor cages is discouraged, batting gloves encouraged.
Batting practice pitchers are to wear masks, dugout telephones disinfected after each use. Players may not touch their face to give signs, and they’re not allowed to lick their fingers. Teams are encouraged to hold meetings outdoors, players spread apart. Teams were asked to respond with their suggested input by May 22. The protocols were written by MLB senior vice presidents Patrick Houlihan, Bryan Seeley and Chris Young, and vice president Jon Coyles. Young is a former pitcher who retired after the 2017 season.
Protocols include details on testing for team staff, who are divided into three tiers. All others may not enter clubhouses, dugouts and the field. Seats in the empty stands near the dugout should be used to maintain distance, according to diagrams in the manual, and the next day’s starting pitcher can’t sit in the dugout. Everyone must keep their distance during “The Star-Spangled Banner” and “God Bless America,” Fielders are “encouraged to retreat several steps away from the baserunner” between pitches. First and third base coaches are not to approach baserunners or umpires, and players should not socialize with opponents.
Managers and coaches must wear masks while in the dugouts. The entire traveling party — including players — must wear personal protective equipment while on buses and flights. Restaurants are off limits on the road, including the ones in hotels, as are hotel fitness centers. “We emphasize that this is a first draft, and will undergo several rounds of changes as we collect comments and suggestions from the clubs, the players’ association, players, and government officials,” deputy commissioner Dan Halem wrote in an email to owners, team presidents and CEOs, and general managers that accompanied the protocols. “The document is designed to set minimum standards and identify best practices, but we have attempted to provide clubs with enough flexibility to achieve the desired health and safety objectives in a manner that is tailored to their particular circumstances, including ballpark configuration, location, and the nature of any local governmental regulations or restrictions,” Halem wrote. Scoreboard video is prohibited but music allowed. While there won’t be fans, at least not at the start, it will provide a familiar background audio for the telecasts critical to MLB’s bottom line. A ball will be thrown away after it is touched by multiple players, and throwing the ball around the infield will be discouraged. Personnel who rub baseballs with mud for the umpires must use gloves.
“Individuals must avoid any physical interactions (such as high-fives, fist bumps, or hugs) while at club facilities,” the manual says. Tier 1 people in the plan include players, managers and coaches plus two each from among physicians, athletics trainers and bullpen catchers plus one strength and conditioning coach. Tier 2 includes clubhouse staff, additional coaches, medical and training staff, traveling staff, owners, front office, translators, communications staff, video personnel, the head groundskeeper and security plus players’ union and MLB staff along with contractors. Tier 3 covers broadcast personnel and other event services. Players must wear masks while in restricted areas “except while on the field or engaging in other strenuous activities” and lockers must have at least 6 feet between them. If needed, temporary clubhouse space will be added, preferably outdoors or areas with better ventilation. “Showering in club facilities should be discouraged,” the plan says. “To the extent showering occurs, clubs should explore modifications to facilities to allow for physical distancing and hygiene” such as installing partitions and limiting the number of players using the showers at the same time.
Teams “should consider requiring (on-field staff) to arrive at club facilities dressed for the day’s activities in order to limit time spent in the clubhouse or locker room.” Only medical personnel allowed near injured players. There will be staggered reporting dates for the resumption of spring training. When pitchers and catchers arrive, only five players may work out at a time. Then come full team workouts, with small groups encouraged but not required, followed by exhibition games. There will be intake screening upon arrival followed a self-quarantine for 24-48 hours until results are available. Players not assigned to big league team when the season starts will remain at spring training or another separate facility. All games at spring training facilities in Florida and Arizona, whether exhibition or regular season, must be scheduled for 7-9 p.m. local time unless MLB gives specific consent.
A fifth umpire would be allowed when the temperature reaches a certain level, allowing for rotation, including sharing of plate umpire duties, Teams should take batting practice on back fields. Among the road trip changes: —Use of Uber, subways and public buses is banned. —Private airports encouraged and if not available, teams are to use private aviation facilities to board and exit. —Transportation Security Administration screen should take place at ballparks if it can be arranged. —In-flight catering is limited. —Lower floors are to be used if possible at hotels, so stairs can be used instead of elevators, and private areas arranged for entrances, exits and check-in. —Six staggered bus trips will be scheduled to and from the ballpark. Team staff, including players, will be given thermometers for self screening and are to take two tests in quick succession each morning. At the ballpark, people will be given temperature checks twice a day and multiple fluid swabs each week. Comprehensive Drug Testing will collect samples and Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory in Salt Lake City is to provide results within 24 hours. Family members of players, umpires and the households of anyone covered under the plan will be offered access to testing and PPE. The individuals are encouraged to avoid crowd when away from ballpark. Anyone with a temperature of 100 or higher or who exhibits COVID-19 symptoms or has come in contact with someone confirmed to be infected will be subject to rapid testing at a nearby site. A person cannot rejoin the team until testing negative twice in tests taken at least 24 hours apart. The person also must not exhibit symptoms or COVID-19, and the team physician and MLB medical staff must determine the person not at risk. If an individual is exposed to a person with an infection, that person must show no signs of disease, be tested daily for at least seven consecutive days and undergo more frequent temperature checks. The person also must wear a mask at all times except while on the field. Each spring training and regular season ballpark must have dedicated testing and isolation areas. MLB also will offer testing of people who live in same household as covered individuals and to health care workers/first responders in big league cities. Most tests will take saliva but there may be oral or nasal swabs. Blood samples will be collected less frequently for serology testing used to detect antibodies.  

Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) basically lost him with the next coronavirus stimulus bill with the inclusion of “$1,200 checks for illegal immigrants.” Navarro said, “So, Nancy Pelosi basically lost me with that package when she has $1,200 checks for illegal immigrants, and it just goes downhill from there. What we have to do, George, is basically go with the fiscal and monetary stimulus that we have been going through. We have a lot of coursing through the system now. We may need more. I’ll let others above my pay grade negotiate that. What I’m focused on George, and this is the real key to success is going to be the structural adjustments we are going to have to make. For every service sector job, we might lose as we adjust to this China virus, we will have to replace that with manufacturing jobs, which do have a high multiplier in terms of creating service sector jobs again. So what I’m focused on with President Trump is a buy America, deregulate, innovate agenda, which will start with bringing our pharma supplies chains homes, bringing our medical supplies chains home. Build it here. Both good economics, but also good national security.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” host Jake Tapper said President Donald Trump and his team were attacking his critics with “deranged and indecent” attacks “unmoored from reality.” In a clip, former President Barack Obama said, “More than anything, this pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they’re doing. A lot of them aren’t even pretending to be in charge.” Tapper said, “The criticism from Obama comes at a time when President Trump and his team are launching an unprecedented smear campaign against any rival. Leveling wild and false allegations against critics in the media and political rivals that range from bizarre false conspiracy theories to spreading false allegations of pedophilia to even suggesting one TV anchor committed murder. These smear campaigns are unmoored from reality. They’re deranged and indecent and seem designed to distract from us from this horrific health and economic crisis.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Tehran (AFP) — Iran said Friday it had recorded nearly 7,000 deaths from the novel coronavirus, warning of infection clusters in new regions after it partially eased lockdown measures. Health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said the COVID-19 illness had claimed a further 51 lives over 24 hours into Sunday. The ministry raised the overall death toll to 6,988 since Iran announced its first fatalities in the Shiite pilgrimage city of Qom in February. Jahanpour warned that cases were rising “in the province of Lorestan, and to some extent in Kermanshah, Sistan and Baluchistan”. “Khuzestan province is still in a critical situation,” he added. The southwestern province has become Iran’s new coronavirus focal point, with the most critical “red” ranking on the country’s colour-coded risk scale. It is the only region so far where authorities have reimposed business lockdowns after a country-wide relaxation in April. Iran stopped publishing provincial figures for the coronavirus last month, but the health ministry’s latest report said there is a “rising trend or the beginning of a peak” in eight provinces, including Khuzestan. The country on Friday reported its highest number of new infections in more than a month. A virus taskforce official said Sunday that the increase was due to a surge in testing, not just of COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms. Early in the outbreak “our focus was on severe cases that had to be hospitalised, but as we started to manage the disease we looked at those infected and not hospitalised,” said Ali Akbar Haghdoost, head of the taskforce’s epidemiology committee. “It is possible that the reported number of infections have gone up, but this in no way means more have been infected with COVID-19,” he told ISNA news agency. According to Jahanpour, 1,806 new cases had been confirmed across Iran in the past day, bringing the total to 120,198. Over 1,460 of the new cases were “outpatients, including those who had been in close contact with the infected,” he said. The ministry said 94,464 people hospitalised with the virus have recovered and been discharged. Experts both at home and abroad have voiced scepticism about Iran’s official figures, saying the real toll could be much higher. Iran also cancelled rallies held annually in solidarity with the Palestinians, set for Friday next week. President Hassan Rouhani had said Saturday that the Qods (Jerusalem) Day parades would go ahead with some measures against the virus. But organisers said Sunday the event could not be held “decently” and would be scrapped apart from a televised speech by the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said there has been no spike in coronavirus cases in the states that are reopening. Host Jake Tapper asked, “Let me ask you, this is intrigue to me because some states have been reopening despite warnings of dire consequences from health experts, states like Georgia and Colorado began reopening weeks ago, and it seems at least so far that we have not seen a dramatic spike in new cases from those two states, Georgia and Colorado. What have you seen from those states? Is there any cause for concern that they reopened early? Is it still too early to tell? Or are they taking measures such as social distancing and masks that make this reopening work?” Azar said, “Jake, I think your question is very insightful. We are seeing that in areas that are opening, we’re not seeing the spike in cases. We still see spikes in some areas that are, in fact, closed, very localized situations. And so this is going to be very important for us to watch the circumstances on the ground. With reopening, what’s the key to reopening? First, we need to have good surveillance. So we need to look for influenza-like illness and other respiratory disease. We have a great surveillance system for that. We look for spikes and early indicators. We have adequate testing capacity. We need to make sure anybody who is symptomatic is tested and that we have adequate asymptomatic surveillance in areas of greatest burden. Senior living, congregate living situations like prisons or m facilities where people are close together. So we look for early indicators. Then we use the traditional public health tools to surge in there. We would test everybody there. We would do contact tracing and isolation. That’s where places like Georgia and Colorado, as they reopen, it’s these tools that allow us to be reopened, but do so in a safe way that lets the economy function but allows us to use the traditional tools of public health to move forward as we would with any other disease.” On if reopening is dependent on a vaccine, Azar added, “So what the president was making the point on is, everything does not depend on a vaccine. We’re committed to delivering a vaccine. We’ll put the full power of the U.S. government and our private sector towards getting a vaccine, but that’s one of a multifactorial response program. First is the testing we talked about before, broad surveillance to find cases, surge in and contain.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Churches throughout Greece have opened their doors to the faithful after two months. They limited the number of congregants and dispensed disinfectant outside, but communion was given using the same spoon. Those who flocked to churches for Sunday Mass sat three chairs apart and observed social distancing of at least 1.5 meters (5 feet) from each other. The number of people attending was limited to 1 per 10 square meters (108 sq ft). Many were left outside, but avoided crowding, and churches used loudspeakers to broadcast Mass. Some churches performed Mass two or three times to accommodate the number of people who showed up.

There have been fewer than 3,000 confirmed cases. Greeks will be able to travel freely in the mainland and on the island of Crete starting Monday. Bars, cafes and restaurants will reopen March 25th.

Rallies next week across Iran to mark the annual Quds Day mass protest against Israel and its allies will involve protesters driving in packed motor vehicles while shouting “Death to Israel! Death to America!” through the windows at startled pedestrians rather than taking to the streets on foot. The change is a result of the need for isolation during the Chinese coronavirus epidemic and protesters will still be required to wear masks while driving. The same applies to those traveling in buses chartered for the same purpose. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on state television Saturday the elite Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) would be in charge of organising the car and bus rallies, adding those joining in could still chant the slogans from their vehicles and wave flags as long as they strictly obeyed road rules and regulations at all times. Reuters reports Rouhani said Quds Day, held each year on the last Friday of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan which falls on May 22, would go ahead as normal in 218 other towns and cities, with certain conditions applied. “The coronavirus danger is still there, but our situation is better than before,” he said. “”We have crossed the main peak.” Crying “Death to America” or “Death to Israel” is a popular pastime in Iran, sometimes used as a greeting between friends and at other times as an opener or closer to large public gatherings. Family events are also common venues for the chants where it is used to enliven proceedings, although senior Islamic clerics have in the past made clear not all Americans should take the cursing personally because it does not mean death to all the American people – just some, as Breitbart News reported.  In April last year, Iranian lawmakers opened a new session of the country’s Parliament with chants of “Death to America.” The taunt was meant as a response to the White House’s designation the IRGC as a foreign terrorist organization. Iran’s Supreme National Security Council also registered its displeasure by calling the U.S. Central Command, known as CENTCOM, and all its forces as “terrorists”, and labeling the U.S. a “supporter of terrorism.”

LONDON (AP) — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson says there might never be a vaccine for Covid-19 despite the huge global effort to develop one. The British government is giving 93 million pounds ($110 million) in funding to speed up the opening of the new Vaccine Manufacturing and Innovation Centre. Johnson said Britain also is supporting research into drug treatments to help people recover quickly from the virus. Johnson wrote in the Mail on Sunday newspaper “there remains a very long way to go, and I must be frank that a vaccine might not come to fruition.” “I just want to make something clear: it’s very important, vaccine or no vaccine, we’re back,” Trump said. https://t.co/goGCqlFSS9 — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) May 16, 2020  Johnson says “we need to find new ways to control the virus,” including testing people who have symptoms and tracing contacts of those infected people. The British government relaxed some restrictions on outdoor activities in England last week and plans to continue easing rules over the next few months. Johnson says “I know this will not be easy — the first baby steps never are.” Coronavirus: Boris Govt Decides Masks Work After All https://t.co/Tq5hBU7i77 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 12, 2020 

Several Danish political parties have announced support for opening Denmark’s borders as the Chinese coronavirus outbreak declines in the country — but not to Sweden, where cases and deaths continue to rise. The Danish government has until June 1st, under existing lockdown measures, to announce whether the border will be opened — and which countries it will be opened to. Several parties have expressed support for opening the country to Germany and Norway but many have said the Swedish border should remain closed. Kristian Thulesen Dahl, of the populist Danish People’s Party, is one of the party leaders who support such an approach, telling broadcaster DR: “I believe that if you open differently to tourists from different countries, you can also open faster.” “If it is not justifiable for health to open the border with Sweden, then the Swedes can stay there and then the Germans can come up,” chairman of the Left Party Jakob Ellemann-Jensen agreed. Sweden Says Relaxed Coronavirus Response Is Working, Despite Highest Fatalities in Scandinavia https://t.co/B46ExF4BsH via @BreitbartNews — Rebecca Mansour (@RAMansour) April 20, 2020  Søren Pape Poulsen, chairman of the Conservatives, and Pernille Vermund, chairman of the New Civil Party, both also supported the idea. So far the government has been tight-lipped on opening the border but Justice Minister Nick Hekkerup did state this week that German tourists visiting a holiday home was a “worthy purpose” to enter the country. “We are in the process of new phases of the reopening, so there are a number of elements around it. But we will come up with an answer to that before June 1st,” Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod said. In the Baltic region, Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania have formed their own open border zone nicknamed the “Baltic Bubble” and have invited both Finland and Poland to also be a part. Sweden, however, has not been invited. “The opening of borders in the Baltic region is a pretty serious signal to Europe and the world that our region has handled the corona crisis properly,” Lithuania’s Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis said. While some have championed the Swedish approach to the coronavirus outbreak and their absence of a real national lockdown, it may come at the cost of being closed to its neighbours in the short term as the virus continues to spread there.

ROME — The Italian government issued a decree Saturday allowing travel to and from other countries beginning on June 3. With consistently good numbers regarding the slowing of the coronavirus, the government has moved up the date for international travel from the previous marker of June 15. The opening to international travel will now coincide with Italy’s opening for travel between its regions. The date of June 3 was chosen to keep the current travel ban in place until after the long holiday weekend ending on June 2, Italy’s Republic Day. Also on June 3, any sector of the economy still shuttered at the time will be allowed to re-open provided people follow safety protocols. Meanwhile, hairdressers, restaurants, and worship services will start up again on Monday, May 18, under strict social distancing and hygiene rules. As of Monday, those moving about their own regions will no longer be obliged to carry the hated “autocertificazione” papers. On Sunday, patrols of Italy’s military police were in full evidence, stopping those wishing to sneak off to the seaside from anticipating the opening by a day. Italy’s 31,763 deaths with coronavirus is the third-highest total in the world after the United States and the United Kingdom, but the number of active cases of infection has been declining rapidly, at a rate of over 10,000 cases per week. The government warned that if numbers of new cases were to start increasing, the relaxation of restrictions could be revoked. Follow @tdwilliamsrome

(AFP) — Top-flight football in Germany kicked off again on the weekend, becoming the first major sports league in the world to resume play, as parts of Europe took more tentative steps towards normality after the devastation unleashed by the coronavirus pandemic. With the worldwide death toll past 310,000 and the global economy reeling from the vast damage caused by lockdowns, the reopenings in some of the hardest-hit countries provided much-needed relief from the pandemic. The French returned to the beach and Italy announced a resumption of European tourism with outbreaks in Europe slowing, but the rising number of fatalities in the United States and Brazil were a grim reminder of the scale of the crisis, with more than 4.6 million infections reported globally. With governments trying to reopen their economies while avoiding a second wave of infections that could necessitate more lockdowns, Germany’s Bundesliga resumed its season on Saturday with games played in vacant, echoing stadiums. League heavyweights Borussia Dortmund hosted rivals Schalke at the all-but-empty Signal Iduna Park — which would usually be packed with more than 80,000 raucous fans. “It’s sad that matches are played in empty stadiums, but it’s better than nothing,” said 45-year-old Borussia Dortmund fan Marco Perz, beer in hand, as he prepared to watch the game on TV. Dortmund’s Erling Braut Haaland became the first player to score a goal after the two-month shutdown, and celebrated by dancing alone — away from his applauding teammates — in keeping with the strict hygiene guidelines which allowed the league to resume. The only noise was the cheering and clapping of players and coaches. League champions Bayern Munich will play Union Berlin in the capital on Sunday, with the resumption in Germany seen as a test case as other top sports competitions try to find ways to resume play without increasing health risks. “The whole world will be looking at Germany, to see how we get it done,” said Bayern boss Hansi Flick. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy, however, said Saturday he needed more guarantees before the government can give the green light for the resumption of its top football league, which is struggling with logistical difficulties as clubs try to arrange training sessions and quarantine facilities. Europol Warns Migrant-Smuggling Surging as Lockdowns Ease https://t.co/8HQ2XmHNUT — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 16, 2020  ‘Calculated risk’  With the Northern Hemisphere’s summer approaching, authorities are moving to help tourism industries salvage something from the wreckage. Italy, for a long stretch the world’s worst-hit country, announced that European Union tourists would be allowed to visit from June 3 and a 14-day mandatory quarantine would be scrapped. “We’re facing a calculated risk in the knowledge that the contagion curve may rise again,” Conte said during a televised address. “We have to accept it otherwise we will never be able to start up again.” In France, the first weekend after the strictest measures were lifted saw many venture out into the spring sunshine — and hit the beach. In the Riviera city of Nice, keen swimmers jumped into the surf at daybreak. “We were impatient because we swim here all year round,” said retiree Gilles, who declined to give his full name. With the threat of a second wave of infections on their minds, authorities in many countries have asked people not to throng public spaces like beaches as they are made accessible again. Officials in parts of England on Saturday warned people to stay away from newly reopened beauty spots and avoid overcrowding. Germany also saw the latest in a growing wave of anti-lockdown protests in many parts of the world, with rallies in major cities bringing together conspiracy theorists, anti-vaccine activists and other extremists. There were similar protests in France, Switzerland, and Poland.

With more than 88,000 deaths and 1.47 million confirmed coronavirus cases, the United States is the worst-hit country on the planet, and the administration of President Donald Trump has faced intense criticism of the way it has handled the crisis. Former president Barack Obama took a swipe at the response to the pandemic, telling graduates at a virtual commencement ceremony that many leaders today “aren’t even pretending to be in charge” — a remark widely regarded as a rare rebuke of his successor. Trump is keen to reopen the US economy — the world’s largest — despite warnings from experts that infections could flare up again if social distancing measures are eased too quickly. Forty-eight of the 50 US states have now eased lockdown rules to some extent. Much like Trump and his political allies, Brazil’s far-right President Jair Bolsonaro is also keen to end lockdowns, which he claims have unnecessarily damaged the South American nation’s economy over a disease he has dismissed as “a little flu”. But the virus has continued its deadly march in Brazil, where the death toll passed 15,000 on Saturday and it became the country with the fourth-largest coronavirus caseload with 230,000 infections.

Gov. Ned Lamont (D) said Thursday he would like to “avoid” having people from out of state travel into Connecticut to shop and dine when he begins his reopening plan on May 20. The Hartford Courant asked Lamont “what’s to stop people” from New York and other nearby states from entering Connecticut to eat or shop once some businesses begin opening on May 20. Lamont responded he “would like to avoid” such interaction. “We don’t want to have a lot of traffic back and forth,” the governor said. I commend @SpeakerPelosi, @RepJohnLarson, @RepJoeCourtney, @rosadelauro, @jahimes, and @RepJahanaHayes for advancing this legislation. It now is critically important that Senate Republicans set aside partisanship and bring this bill up for a vote. (3/3) — Governor Ned Lamont (@GovNedLamont) May 16, 2020  While hair salons and barber shops may open on May 20, Lamont said he recommended these owners only grant appointments to people they know and maybe begin opening with only one chair: I think I’d probably offer some of the same advice to the restaurant owners … Our parks and our beaches were pretty busy. There were a fair number of out-of-staters coming in. Rhode Island has now opened up their parks and beaches. We’re able to make sure that out-of-staters have to have an appointment and maybe pay a fee to go use a Connecticut beach. In his interview with the Courant, Lamont would not commit to indoor dining returning by June 20. “[M]aybe sometime in mid-June, we say, ‘maybe we can risk it for restaurants,’ or maybe not,” he said. “We’ve got to be very careful about that. When it comes to indoor dining, we will want to try and coordinate that better with our other governors. As you know, [Rhode Island Gov.] Gina Raimondo is doing outdoor dining as well.” Asked what he expects the summer will look like in Connecticut, Lamont replied, “There are a lot of questions,” and that “outdoors is a lot safer than indoors.” “I’ll let you know how I’m thinking about things, and that’s the best I can do, and we have to reserve the right to change our minds,” he said. As of May 16, Connecticut had 36,703 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19, an increase of 618 since the previous day. Deaths associated with the coronavirus reportedly rose by 54 from Friday to Saturday to 3,339. Hospitalizations decreased by 39 to 994.

Australia’s demand for an investigation into the World Health Organization’s bungled response to the deadly Chinese coronavirus pandemic now has the backing of 62 nations, all willing to support a draft resolution addressing the issue Tuesday at a meeting of the World Health Assembly. Australia’s motion includes more robust language than that contained in an earlier watered down European Union version. It is supported by key nations including India, Japan, the UK, Canada, New Zealand, Indonesia, Russia, Mexico and Brazil, and all 27 E.U. member states amongst others. The Australian newspaper reports the motion calls on W.H.O. Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to “initiate at the earliest appropriate moment … a stepwise process of impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation” of the international response to the pandemic, the actions of the W.H.O. and its “timeline” of the pandemic. Australia Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s refusal to back away from the matter has infuriated China which regards the W.H.O. and its leader very much as an extension of its own geopolitical ambitions. In recent weeks China has threatened trade penalties for Australia if it continues to defy Beijing, as Breitbart News reported. The Australians have also been among the most outspoken critics of China’s dangerous refusal to close the live animal “wet markets” seen as spawning grounds for the viral pandemic, and of the W.H.O.’s baffling endorsement of their reopening: Australia confronted the World Health Organization over claims it supports so-called wet markets reopening in the Chinese city of Wuhan. https://t.co/TjH4HmGDzv — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) April 17, 2020  Morrison previously said his conservative coalition government will not be deterred by China’s litany of threats, as SBS News reported. “This is a virus that has taken more than 200,000 lives across the world,” he told reporters in Canberra last month. “It has shut down the global economy. The implications and impacts of this are extraordinary. “Now, it would seem entirely reasonable and sensible that the world would want to have an independent assessment of how this all occurred, so we can learn the lessons and prevent it from happening again.” China’s anger at Australia’s refusal to bow to its demands is not new, as Breitbart New reported. China Warns Australia: Drop Coronavirus Probe or Pay an Economic Price https://t.co/V54exGJuOT — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 27, 2020  Beijing did the same thing when Australia became the first country aside from the U.S. to block China’s Huawei telecom giant from supplying equipment for its 5G network, and the latest diplomatic row is seen as an extension of that blow to China’s global standing. China’s ruling Communist Party is also furious with Australia for being one of the leading voices calling for the W.H.O. to allow Taiwan full membership.

During an interview broadcast on Friday’s edition of the Fox Business Network’s “WSJ at Large,” White House Trade Adviser Peter Navarro stated that China deliberately allowed the coronavirus to spread to the rest of the world and that the virus “could have been contained in Wuhan.” Navarro said, “China hid the virus behind the shield of the World Health Organization, and that was a time, Gerry, when that virus could have been contained in Wuhan. Instead, what China did was put hundreds of thousands of Wuhanians and Chinese on planes that were allowed to go to Milan and New York and elsewhere, but not to Beijing and Shanghai.” Host Gerry Baker asked Navarro if he was saying, “China, quite deliberately, shutting off some — a lot of domestic travel, but allowing international travel, quite deliberately knew how serious this was and allowed the virus to be exported, along with a lot of other Chinese exports to the United States and elsewhere?” Navarro responded, “That’s a matter of fact. It should not be in dispute.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

On Friday’s “PBS NewsHour,” New York Times columnist David Brooks stated that while states need more money, the House Democrats’ coronavirus relief bill is just “a political poster” and “a political ploy.” Brooks stated, “It’s a political ploy. I think it’s a mistake to put…together a proposal where you’ve had no negotiations with the other side, where it’s clearly going to go nowhere in the Senate. It’s just a sort of a political poster that you’re putting up on the wall. I just think that’s a mistake. At the same time, I think we’re going to have to spend a lot more money. And the heart of this bill is correct, which is aid to states.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

The massive $3 trillion stimulus bill passed by House Democrats on Friday is “dead on arrival” in the Senate, Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-MI) told Breitbart News Saturday evening. Huizenga also slammed new proxy voting rules passed by House Democrats, which would see some members voting for others on their behalf. “This is abdicating your constitutional duty. The idea that literally 22 people holding ten proxies each could go run the House of Representatives, because it takes 218 (votes) to do anything in the House,” he said. “What a consolidation of power from Nancy Pelosi,” Huizenga continued. “She just got what she wanted. I just do not understand my colleagues and their interest in handing their voting card to somebody else,” he said. “How do you count people towards a quorum who aren’t physically there?” Huizenga said. He said there should be a lawsuit filed against the new rule and believes one likely will be. “How do you pass laws when you don’t even physically have a majority of the House of Representatives in attendance?” Huizenga posted a video on Facebook shortly after the House vote on the stimulus on Friday.  After humorously noting that he needs a haircut — which is currently difficult to come by in Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s Michigan — said Republicans attempted to send the bill back to committee because it contained stimulus checks for illegal immigrants. “That, to me, seemed very wrong, especially while we can’t even get our state unemployment insurance situations figured out,” he said in the selfie video. “I’m getting the angry emojis and that’s fine. If you want to prioritize illegal immigrants before we have people on unemployment, we’re coming from very different pages on that,” he told viewers. “Go ahead and throw out your hate emoji, that’s the wrong way to go.” “This is dead on arrival. They’re not even going to take this bill up,” Huizenga told Breitbart News of the Senate and added that the upper chamber would “basically start from scratch” if there is another bill. “Doing pension bailouts, money for Planned Parenthood, money for the National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities, billions for the Post Office, $10,000 student loan forgiveness. I guess Bernie Sanders, (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez), and Elizabeth Warren did get something in the bill,” he said, and called it an “1,800-page press release.” “We haven’t even gotten the money out the door that we appropriated for the first waves,” Huizenga noted.

Former President Barack Obama on Saturday advised 2020 graduates to give up on the adults currently in charge and chart a new way forward for the world. “The old ways of doing things just don’t work,” Obama said in his online commencement speech to 2020 high school graduates who could not attend ceremonies due to the coronavirus pandemic. The former president did not specifically criticize President Donald Trump but had a lot of criticism for adults and current people in power. “All those adults that you used to think were in charge and knew what they were doing, turns out they don’t have all the answers, a lot of them aren’t even asking the right questions,” he said. He added that adults with “fancy titles and important jobs” sometimes behaved like “little kids.” “Doing what feels good, what’s convenient, what’s easy, that’s what little kids think. Unfortunately, a lot of so-called grownups, including some with fancy titles and important jobs, still feel that way, which is why things are so screwed up,” he said. Obama said that the coronavirus pandemic only heightened the current divisions and social injustices like economic inequality, racial disparities, and the lack of universal health care. He sympathized with the graduates, noting that they were already struggling with the “added pressures of social media, reports of school shootings, and the specter of climate change.” Obma tried to cheer them up by noting that even though they were missing their graduation ceremonies, they would not have to sit through long speeches. “Not that many people look great in those caps, especially if you have big ears like me,” he said. The president offered a lot of advice, but not a lot of hope, particularly about attending college in the fall. “If you planned on going away to college, getting dropped off on campus in the fall, that’s no longer a given,” he said. He acknowledged that he was “one of the old guys” but urged them to leave the past behind and move the world forward. “With so much uncertainty, when everything is up for grabs, this is your generation’s world to shape,” he said, noting the past American struggles of slavery, civil war, famine, disease, the Great Depression, and the terrorist attacks of 9/11. “Each time we came out stronger, usually because a new generation, people like you, learned from past mistakes and figured out how to make things better,” he said.

A 10-year-old girl in Danbury, Connecticut, is on a mission to give art kits to children who need cheering up during the coronavirus pandemic. For her birthday in August, Chelsea Phaire asked people to give her art supplies so she could donate them to kids affected by school shootings, according to Fox News. However, since the pandemic hit, Chelsea has been sending them to children living in homeless shelters and foster homes around the country as a way to make them smile again. “It means a lot because of the coronavirus. It’s just really nice to know kids are helping kids during this really stressful time. It really makes me feel happy,” she told the outlet. Last year, she founded Chelsea’s Charity to distribute the donated supplies and help children with their social-emotional and mental health development. “Research shows that you don’t have to excel in art for it to help with your development. You just need access to the materials…our main goal,” its website read. Practicing art therapy can help people of any age improve their self-esteem, relieve stress, and deal with symptoms of anxiety and depression, according to Psychology Today. In February, Chelsea said she believed art should be available to everyone. “Art really helps me communicate when I can’t, it helps me if I’m happy, sad, or I just want to draw. I can always go to my sketchbook and its always there for me,” she commented. Since stay-at-home orders were put in place, Chelsea has mailed over 1,500 art kits to children in at least 12 states. Tuesday, she posted a photo of herself on Twitter with packages that were mailed to recipients in California: Glad that the art kits I made 4 the kids  @JamesStorehouse got to California! Now they have art supplies while schools are closed! Click my bio to help me make more art kits 4 kids in shelters & foster care.  #ChelseasCharity #ArtIsAStart #FosterCare #MentalhealthduringCovid19 pic.twitter.com/SpS7qL3iJp — Chelsea’s Charity (@CharityChelseas) May 12, 2020  After everything she has done, Chelsea said she had big plans for the future. “I want to visit and give kits to every single state and then move onto other countries as well. There’s kids that need good art out there, and I just want to find every single one of them out there. Who knows, maybe world peace will happen. It doesn’t hurt to try,” she concluded.

House Democrats’ Chinese coronavirus relief package bails out coastal millionaires and billionaires while ensuring big businesses are able to freely hire illegal aliens and visa overstayers over unemployed Americans. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) HEROES Act would end the cap on a little-known SALT tax deduction that has been strictly limited by President Trump, offering the top one percent in coastal states like New York, Massachusetts, and California a huge tax break. The maneuver would give millionaires and billionaires, for 2020 and 2021, a windfall of more than $100,000 for taxpayers with annual incomes over $1 million. (Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget) “Completely repealing the cap retroactively for the last two years would cost over $130 billion, with about half the benefit going to households making over $1 million a year,” Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) analysts write. They add: Repealing the SALT cap retroactively for two years will also send out checks as people amend their 2018 and 2019 taxes, but those checks would be almost exclusively sent to high-income households. The average household making over $1 million would receive over $100,000. Households making less than $50,000 would receive almost no benefit from repealing or raising the SALT cap. Likewise, Pelosi’s HEROES Act would provide business with a neverending flood of cheap, illegal foreign labor that they would be legally allowed to hire over the roughly 36.5 million Americans who are jobless due to the crisis. The provision would suspend the Department of Labor’s ability to prosecute any employer hiring illegal aliens and visa overstayers. A separate provision would drive up foreign competition against unemployed Americans by allowing illegal aliens taking “essential” U.S. jobs to receive work authorization. Extensive research by economists like George Borjas and analyst Steven Camarota reveals that the country’s current mass immigration system burdens U.S. taxpayers and America’s working and middle class while redistributing about $500 billion in wealth every year to major employers and new arrivals. Similarly, research has revealed how Americans’ wages are crushed by the country’s high immigration levels. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter at @JxhnBinder.

Tennessee announced Friday that it would start reopening amusement parks and theaters, as well as lift capacity restrictions on restaurants and shops beginning next week. Tennessee’s Economic Recovery Group noted that 89 out of 95 counties in the state could lift capacity restrictions on businesses, adding that the next reopening phase for larger noncontact attractions would start as soon as May 22, WSMV reported. Attractions included in the next phase of reopening include large museums, auditoriums, race tracks, and recreational parks. But restrictions keeping gatherings to no more than ten people will remain in place for now. “We’re able to allow restaurants and retail businesses to operate at a greater capacity and large attractions to open in a safe and thoughtful way,” Republican Gov. Bill Lee said in a statement Friday. A spokesperson for Dollywood told WBIR Friday that the theme park was working on its reopening plan as the state loosens its restrictions on large venues. The state’s decision is made of several factors, including White House criteria they must meet in terms of coronavirus illnesses and hospitalizations. Tennessee has reported downward trajectories in both of those categories. Davidson County, where the city of Nashville is located, logged 3,795 coronavirus cases and 42 deaths.

A church in Goodlettsville, Tennessee, is helping small businesses get back on their feet during the coronavirus pandemic. When Chic Artique store owner Jenna Rummel was forced to close her furniture and home decor shop’s doors due to the health crisis in March, she called the experience “very humbling,” according to the Tennessean. She also had to lay off two of her 14 employees and even with online orders, her sales dropped about 75 percent. However, when the Goodlettsville Church congregation heard how small businesses like Rummel’s were hurting, they decided to do something to help. “We’re trying to keep people employed rather than having to take care of them when they’re unemployed,” said Rev. Tim Stutler, who also leads a campus in Gallatin. The church launched the Small Business Blessing initiative as a way to support business owners through the difficult circumstances. As part of the effort, Stutler encouraged members to do their Christmas shopping in May, pay for several hair appointments in advance, buy gift cards, and tip generously. “We believe it’s a great way to help keep the economy stimulated and keep these businesses open. We love those folks who invested in our community and we want to help them keep their people employed,” the reverend stated. Recently, Stutler approached his fellow church leaders and they voted to split an entire week of the church’s budgeted income, $12,500, among three small businesses in Goodlettsville and Gallatin. Thanks to the surprise $5,000 gift, Rummel was able to pay the bills she had prayed over when she did not know where the money was going to come from. “I immediately remembered the prayer we had prayed and knew that it was an answer to the prayer, because it was enough to really make a difference,” she recalled. Later, Stutler said he hoped other churches would follow in their footsteps and give back to those in need during the pandemic. “We could make a very significant impact,” he concluded.

The Pennsylvania state Supreme Court on Friday rejected a lawsuit that would force election officials to accept mail-in-ballots as long as they are received within a week after the primary or general elections while the coronavirus pandemic is in place. The Senior Law Center, Disability Rights Pennsylvania, and other organizations filed the suit in late April, arguing that postal delays caused by the coronavirus pandemic could cause ballots not to be received at their destinations in time to count, the Associated Press reported. However, Democrat Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration argued against it, saying the plan would be unconstitutional because it would give voters different deadlines. According to a 2019 law, the deadline for county elections offices to receive mail-in-ballots is 8:00 p.m. when the polls close on election day. Pennsylvania’s primary was postponed from April 28 until June 2 because of the coronavirus, and officials say many votes will be cast by mail. Meanwhile, counties are planning on limiting the number of polling locations due to the coronavirus. The state legalized mail-in-ballots last fall, and they will be implemented for the first time this year. If voters wish to request a mail-in-ballot, they must do so by May 26, NBC 10 Philadelphia reported. Recent data has not shown a compelling public health justification for mail-in-ballots. Wisconsin is one of the only U.S. states that held its primary election with in-person voting after the nation’s coronavirus lockdowns began. The election drew 413,000 participants, and only a few dozen out of that group were confirmed to have contracted the virus by either voting or serving as a poll worker. None of those cases was fatal, and the data on the current infection rate equals a rate below two-hundredths of one percent.

Former President Barack Obama said in a commencement speech on Saturday that current leaders during the coronavirus crisis were failing 2020 graduates. “More than anything this pandemic has fully finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they’re doing,” he said. “A lot of them aren’t even pretending to be in charge.” The former president did not directly criticize Donald Trump, but he repeatedly referred to leaders currently in power. “Broad majorities agree on the ends,” he said, urging graduates to seek unity. “That’s why folks with power will keep trying to divide you over the means. That’s how nothing changes.” The former president spoke online to recognize historic black college and university graduates on Saturday, offering a 2020 commencement speech for those who were unable to graduate due to the coronavirus. “Even though half of the semester was spent in Zoom university, you’ve earned this moment. You should be very proud,” he said. The president was joined by celebrities Kevin Hart, Steve Harvey, Chris Paul, Debbie Allen, Common the rapper, and Vivica Fox, as well as national politicians such as Sen. Kamala Harris and Sen. Tim Scott. Obama urged graduates to fight for “economic and environmental justice and health care for everyone” and to fight the “system that looks out for the rich and the powerful and nobody else.” He said that the virus only enhanced the understanding that the black community continues to suffer inequality in the United States, but that they should reach out and find others who suffered the same struggle. “Meaningful change requires allies and common cause. As African Americans we are particularly attuned to injustice, inequality, and struggle but also that should make us more alive to other experiences of others,” he said. Obama urged graduates to stand up for immigrants, refugees, the rural poor, the LGTB community, low-income workers, and women. The president also referenced 25-year-old Ahmaud Arbery, noting that the injustice of “a black man goes for a jog and some folks think they can stop and question and shoot him if he does not submit to their questioning.” He said the same struggles were not new in the United States and asked all graduates to do their part to fight. “What is new is that so much of your generation has woken up to the fact that the status quo needs fixing,” he said.

President Donald Trump shared a tweet of a local television reporter being confronted by anti-shutdown protesters in Long Island, New York, who called him “fake news.” “Fake news is not essential,” the president wrote, retweeting the videos from News 12 Long Island reporter Kevin Vesey. “FAKE NEWS IS NOT ESSENTIAL!”https://t.co/5286zgRVWQ — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 16, 2020  Vesey recorded the viral videos, which have been viewed more than 11.9 million times, while he was on assignment covering a rally on Thursday protesting the stay-at-home orders during the coronavirus pandemic. The News 12 Long Island reporter said the demonstrators in the town of Commack were confronting him over his profession and “repeatedly invading” his “personal space.” I'll probably never forget what happened today.I was insulted. I was berated. I was practically chased by people who refused to wear masks in the middle of a pandemic.All the while, I was there to tell THEIR story. Here's the finished product. pic.twitter.com/HV2Hrcs7gi — Kevin Vesey (@KevinVesey) May 14, 2020  According to the video taken at the event, several protesters called Vesey “fake news, with one protester shouting, “You are the enemy of the people!” Most people were not wearing masks or were properly practicing social distancing at the event. And just like that, I’ve been tweeted by the President https://t.co/LnDLRwrAZx — Kevin Vesey (@KevinVesey) May 16, 2020  When Vesey found out the president retweeted him, he simply said, “And just like that, I’ve been tweeted by the president.” Several mainstream media reporters defended Vesey after Trump’s retweet, and accused Trump of “bullying a civilian.” It’s discouraging enough to watch the tape of these knuckledraggers harassing a reporter who’s just doing his job by covering their protest (and who produced an even-handed segment for his local newscast).

The death toll from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in Mexico surpassed the “official” figures reported by the Chinese government. Both countries are widely accused of doctoring figures to downplay the true scope of the pandemic. During a daily news conference, Mexico’s Undersecretary of Health Hugo Lopez Gatell and his staff released their most recent statistics that point to 45,032 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 4,767 fatalities since the start of the pandemic. The true numbers could be even higher since, as Breitbart Texas reported, Lopez Gatell admitted that his figures are from government hospitals and do not include private cases. Al 15 de mayo de 2020 hay 45,032 casos confirmados, 10,238 confirmados activos y 29,028 sospechosos por #COVID19. Se han registrado 89,631 negativos, 4,767 defunciones confirmadas, 462 defunciones sospechosas y fueron estudiadas 163,691 personas. 1/3 pic.twitter.com/eBJoiTCKPT — Hugo López-Gatell Ramírez (@HLGatell) May 16, 2020  Mexican health officials revealed that since the start of the pandemic, they have only carried out 163,691 tests in government hospitals and clinics nationwide. Because of the low number of tests and the way that cases are recorded, numerous politicians have accused Lopez Gatell of cooking the books to give the appearance that Mexico is containing the pandemic. The figures released by Mexican health officials surpass the most recent figures released by China, where the virus first appeared. Chinese reports only account for 4,637 fatalities and 82,941 cases. The Chinese government is also widely accused of lying about the number of cases and fatalities since the virus first appeared in the Wuhan province.

A man in Long Island, New York, whose father died of complications from the coronavirus in April is joining others in a lawsuit against China.
 In March, 58-year-old Richard Guasto entered a Nassau County nursing home and rehabilitation facility to recuperate after a car accident left him with a fractured pelvis and ankle, according to the New York Post. However, shortly after he was admitted, Guasto developed severe respiratory issues and was taken to a local hospital, where he tested positive for the Chinese coronavirus, said his son, Richard Jr. On April 15, Guasto died of complications from the disease, and his family has said they believe the rehab facility was “riddled” with it. “It’s just not fair. He was a relatively young man. This should not have happened to him,” Richard Jr. commented, adding that his father was in overall good health prior to contracting the illness. The Post article continued: Guasto is now one of 15,000 plaintiffs suing the Chinese government and the Chinese Communist Party in a Florida federal court for wrongful death. The complaint accuses them of “intentional, deliberate and reckless cover-up” of COVID-19, which originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. The lawsuit, one of two class-actions filed by the Berman Law Group, is seeking trillions of dollars in compensation for virus victims and their families. On Thursday, Wuhan authorities reportedly locked down certain districts of the city following a resurgence of the virus, Breitbart News reported. “News of the resurgence followed weeks of government authorities alleging that Wuhan and other parts of Hubei province were ‘free’ of coronavirus, assuring the public that the region was ready to open again following an extended lockdown,” the article said. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Breitbart News on Saturday that President Trump was “committed” to holding the Chinese Communist Party accountable for the coronavirus pandemic. “We have to hold nations accountable for the things and actions that they undertake which create risk, and in this case created enormous loss of life here in the United States,” he said. Although Richard Guasto Jr. does not know what to expect from the lawsuit, he hopes it will bring his family some closure regarding the loss of his father. “He was a good guy, an Italian American who liked football and baseball and kept pictures of his grandkids at the nursing home. He didn’t deserve this,” he concluded.

The British police have issued over 14,000 fines to people who have allegedly broken the government’s lockdown measures — and today in London I nearly got a £100 ticket myself. My crime? Covering an anti-lockdown rally in London’s Hyde Park, interviewing some of the protestors and seeing for myself how extraordinarily high-handed and belligerent the police have become in accordance with the government’s draconian Covid-19 restrictions. The rally was held at Speaker’s Corner, traditionally the spot in Britain where anyone can come along and celebrate their right to say whatever they like — because that’s what freedom of speech means in a free country. Not any more though, apparently. I witnessed members of the crowd being threatened and given tickets for offences as minor as holding placards, distributing stickers (they said “Fuck Coronavirus”. Unfortunately mine fell off my jacket) and “staying here for longer than 45 minutes”. People who didn’t comply were treated roughly. One man, lying on the ground, looked as if he might have had his leg injured by a policeman leaping wantonly, knee first, on top of his thigh as he lay on a tarmac path. There were several arrests, including Piers Corbyn — brother of former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. According to the Mail, whose reporter witnessed his arrest: Piers Corbyn, 73, was seen surrounded by police officers as he made his way through the crowds, getting involved in the action and making his voice heard. He was later seen being removed in handcuffs, after earlier holding a sign which read: ‘End lockdown now — Free NHS to save those it’s left behind.’ Corbyn was taken away after showing up with a megaphone and proclaiming 5G and the coronavirus pandemic were linked, calling it a “pack of lies to brainwash you and keep you in order”. The policeman who gave me my warning was not at all unpleasant. But he did unwittingly expose some of the absurdities of the way that Boris Johnson’s lockdown policy is being policed. For example, under the current restrictions, everyone is supposed to remain a minimum of 2 metres (6 feet) apart from one another for their own safety. Yet the police themselves clearly weren’t observing these restrictions, which does make you wonder: do they really believe in it? And how, in all conscience, can they impose on members of the public rules which they break so flagrantly themselves? What shocked me most though was the absurd overkill of the police response. The crowd was small — in the low hundreds — because police had warned people not to turn up and perhaps quite a few were put off by the fear of being arrested. Though there were some noisy chants — ranging from “we want freedom” to “arrest Bill Gates” — there were no displays of aggression. Yet the police turned up in such large numbers they almost outnumbered the protestors. Compare and contrast with the noticeably more relaxed response of the police in  2019 when, for several days, activists from the eco-fascist group Extinction Rebellion rendered whole areas of London impassable to traffic –occupying Waterloo Bridge, for example — as well as disrupting business and damaging property. Or when, in 2018, they closed five London villages. Those eco-protests cost the police — or rather the taxpayer — £37 million, yet during much of this flagrant act of economic terrorism, the police treated them with kid gloves and even tried to ingratiate themselves with the eco-loons, with one police officer trying to impress them with his skateboarding moves. #extinctionrebelion #peacefulprotest #radiclepolice pic.twitter.com/aqKuX244Ik — Jack Tibbs (@JackTibbs7) April 16, 2019  So here’s what I don’t understand about the police’s priorities. If you protest against an imaginary problem like the “Climate Emergency” they’ll leave you more or less free to do what the hell you like, no matter how many ordinary people are inconvenienced and no matter how much economic damage you do. But if you protest against something that really matters — the biggest restriction on civil liberties in Britain in modern history — then they’ll come down on you like a ton of bricks. There’s something wrong here. How do we fix it? 


The Capri Drive-in Theater in Branch County, Michigan, was packed on Friday evening, as moviegoers flocked in defiance of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s stay-at-home order in response to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. Tom Magocs, who co-owns The Capri with his wife Susan, said that he knows opening the theater comes with risk — like being shut down — but that staying closed also poses a massive finial risk. The drive-in theater, according to a report by MLive Michigan, is the Magocs family’s only source of income, and it had garnered zero profit this year. That is, until it opened Friday night in defiance of governor Whitmer’s stay-at-home order. “It’s our livelihood — it’s the way we make our living,” said Magocs, who added that his family’s “coffers are down to the bottom” due to having been forced to shut down all year. The Capri opened for business Friday night, just hours after governor Whitmer held a press conference slamming businesses in Michigan defying her orders. “I think the vast majority of people in our state get it, and they’re doing the right things,” said Whitmer. “For those who aren’t, you know, we take this serious. This is not a suggestion.” “These are not thoughts about how you can protect yourself,” she added. “This is the force of law, and we expect to people to follow the law.” But despite Whitmer’s executive orders for people to shelter in place, and for all “non-essential” businesses to remain closed, The Capri opened, and vehicles — roughly a quarter mile long — lined up to get into the drive-in theater on Friday evening. Magocs said that they have made changes to The Capri in an effort to stay safe during the Chinese virus pandemic. Some of the changes include mandating more space between cars, allowing people to bring food from home, the snack bar being delivery only, employees now wear protective gear, and customers are being required to remain inside their vehicles. The report added that The Capri is one of the latest businesses to defy Whitmer’s orders, and that earlier on Friday, Boulder Ridge Wild Animal Park in Kent County, and the Ardor + Grit Salon & Lounge in Holland were also open for business. Magocs said that if he gets a ticket for opening his drive-in theater he will fight it in court. You can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo, and on Instagram.

The Italian government announced plans Saturday to begin lifting its travel ban, as the country is experiencing a sharp drop in coronavirus infection rates. “The Italian government plans to allow travel to and from the country beginning June 3, according to a new decree signed Saturday by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. Citizens will also be able to travel freely within the country starting that same day,” CBS News reported. However, certain travel may remain limited based on disease risks and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. “People who have tested positive for COVID-19 will still remain under strict quarantine orders,” the outlet said. Opening its borders was a huge step forward in the country’s attempt to reopen its economy as the summer tourist season begins, according to the Associated Press (AP). “Many hope the move will revive a decimated tourist industry, which is worth 13% of Italy’s gross domestic product,” the article noted. Last week, several Italian regions demanded that their shops and restaurants be allowed to begin the reopening phase on May 11, and the economy opened up more as the month progressed, according to Breitbart News. “The autonomous region of South Tyrol voted 28 to one in its regional council to begin lifting restrictions this week after it saw a second consecutive day with no new Chinese coronavirus cases, and will allow several industries to reopen their doors on Monday,” the report noted. The industries allowed to reopen under social distancing rules and health precautions would include restaurants, hairdressers and beauty salons, museums, libraries, and youth centers. When Rome did not listen to requests for regional differentiation of the measures for several weeks, South Tyrol Gov. Arno Kompatscher said, “We decided to undertake our autonomous legislative path and the region wants to face phase two in the name of applying its autonomy.” Per Saturday’s decree, all sectors of the economy that were still closed would be allowed to reopen in June as long as health and safety guidelines were followed, according to CBS News. “Health officials plan to closely monitor reopening in order to limit further infections,” the article concluded.

Themi Sacarellos, owner of Pennsylvania’s Round the Clock Diner, told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview on Friday that Gov. Tom Wolf (D) must “put the politics aside and let the people work.” Round the Clock Diner made waves this week after the owner reopened the restaurant’s locations in Manchester and Springettsbury for dine-in services, in contravention to the governor’s stay-at-home order. The restaurants are located in Pennsylvania’s York County, which is one of 12 counties that can begin reopening next week, May 22, Wolf announced on Friday. However, like the red phase, the yellow phase of reopening does not allow restaurants to operate dine-in services. Despite that, Sacarellos is charging ahead. Sacarellos, 80, said he attended a meeting and decided to charge forward and open his restaurant on Mother’s Day for dine-in services. He thought others would follow his lead, but they never did. “But I’m still standing, and I think I just follow what’s right,” Sacarellos, who has been in the business for 52 years, told Breitbart News’s Matthew Perdie, who visited the diner on Friday. Sacarellos said they are keeping the restaurant “very clean” and taking safety protocols, like seating patrons at every other table. “We’re in a hospital here,” he joked. “We try to operate normal. We’re not trying to hurt anybody,” he said, noting that employees wash their hands and wear gloves and masks. A lot of people are coming into the restaurant, he explained. He said every customer that comes in is grateful, thanking him for reopening. “‘Thank you or opening. Thank you for opening. We’re not going to be a prisoner anymore. We’re not going to be a prisoner anymore,'” he said, quoting his patrons. “Only in communist countries do they do that.” He added that businesses need a green light from the governor to proceed and said he wished others would follow his path. “I paved the way, and they didn’t follow that. So I hope everyone can open up,” he said, noting that Pennsylvania is not moving as swiftly as other states and wondering if state officials are trying to save lives or play politics. “That goes through my mind,” he said, urging Wolf to “let the people open up. Operate. Forget the politics.” “I didn’t back down. I’m still operating and will continue,” he said. “We’re not opening just because we need the money. We didn’t change the prices for 11 and half years. … So we’re not looking for money. We’re looking for money to pay the bills and support our families and that’s it,” he said, explaining that customers have tried to provide him with additional support. Everyone says thank you, he said, even offering, in some cases,”$50 dollars, $100 dollars.” “I said I don’t need money. Just pay for your meals. That’s all I need. That’s all I want you to do so I can pay my people,” he said. Sacarellos pays his employees $14 an hour, noting that it helps them support their families and encourages them to “come in and work.” “Put the politics aside and let the people work, because the country is turning into more like a communist system here,” he warned, “and I know better than a communist system. I lived in those days.” Sacarellos immigrated from Greece and briefly touched on the brutality he witnessed growing up, at the hands of communism. “I have seen in my life a lot. The American people don’t even know,” he said, explaining that “Russia took over” and adding that it was “coming down.” They came to Greece, he said, but Americans jumped in and “helped us out, and Russia didn’t take over Greece.” “A lot of American people don’t know that. I do. I lived those days. I was there,” he said, recalling the brutality. As for President Trump, the restaurant owner said he is doing an excellent job and warned that the U.S. would be in “bad shape” if the previous administration were in charge. At the end of the day, Sacarellos said, the governor should allow Pennsylvanians to work. “Thanks for being open,” two patrons said as he wrapped up the interview.

Indonesian police arrested three people on Thursday for using fake “coronavirus-free” documents to island-hop from Java to Bali. The suspects allegedly used the fake letters so that they could travel amid restrictions on movement during the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic, Coconuts Jakarta reported on Friday. Indonesian authorities have required citizens traveling during the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic to present official medical documents declaring them free of coronavirus, prompting some websites in the country to illegally forge and sell fake “coronavirus-free” letters. According to the report, only people who need to travel for “logistics purposes, health, and COVID-19 [coronavirus]-related matters” or “extremely important” personal reasons are allowed to travel in Indonesia currently, as the government has imposed strict limits on peoples’ movement in an effort to curb the country’s coronavirus outbreak. On Thursday, police on the island of Bali arrested three people found using the fake coronavirus medical documents to cross from the island of Java to Gilimanuk Port on the island of Bali, according to the report. “We have arrested three people. … They are still being investigated further in Gilimanuk,” Ketut Gede Adi Wibawa, the chief of police in Jembrana, where the travelers were detained, said on Thursday. One fake medical document seen by Coconuts Jakarta appeared to copy the letterhead of Mitra Keluarga, a distinguished private hospital on the island of Java. According to the report, some of the letters have been sold online for “millions” of rupiah, the local currency, or about $70. Mitra Keluarga, whose letterhead was duplicated in the recent forgeries, denied any connection with the seller of the fake medical letters in a statement released on Thursday, Indonesian newspaper Rupiblika reported on Friday. In connection with the circulation of the news on social media as well as news outlets regarding the medical letter using Mitra Keluarga’s letterhead, we hereby inform you that our management has never partnered with those who sell COVID-19-free [coronavirus-free] statement letters. The hospital warned against the further use of its brand, adding that it would seek “legal action” against any future forgeries. “Mitra Keluarga will take legal action should there be anyone who uses the name or attributes  of Mitra Keluarga, which includes the usage of our letterhead without our permission.” Some major electronic commerce websites in Indonesia, including Tokopedia and Shopee, said this week that they have taken down fake medical letters sold on their platforms in addition to suspending the sellers’ accounts, Coconuts Jakarta reports.

A Democrat county sheriff is the latest to say he is not going to enforce Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s shutdown order. Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson told Charlie LeDuff’s No BS News Hour on Friday that he won’t be assisting Whitmer in going after residents she believes are violating her decrees. “First, you know, people have to talk about the Constitution in its entirety. And that’s the separation of powers,” Swanson told him, the Detroit News reported. “And the sheriff is the executive branch of that separation. We enforce laws — with discretion, remember that.” Swanson continued: It is dangerous for police officers to determine what’s right and what’s wrong. Otherwise I could look at Lafayette (Boulevard in Detroit) and say: “You know, by the order of the sheriff, I don’t agree with the speed limit. Go as fast as you want.” I can’t do that. But what I can do is say: “I’m not going to park cars there and pull over everybody going one (mph) over.” I tell this to my people in Genesee County, because I have seen people and I have seen people on the nursing side… the business side, they’re dying. We have not raided a business. We have not shut a business down. We’re not pulling people over. We’re not writing tickets. And don’t expect us to do it. On Tuesday, Livingston County Sheriff Mike Murphy also said he would use discretion in not enforcing Whitmer’s order:  Murphy said Whitmer’s vague order has left residents and law enforcement confused: For example, I go out and ticket a boat that’s operating with a motor, and I get hauled into court, and the judge says, “What are you doing?” “Hey, I’m upholding the executive order. Governor says you can operate a boat, but you can’t operate a boat with a motor.” And I hold up this executive order that nowhere in that executive order does it say you can’t have a motor. She mentioned that in a press conference. She mentioned that in the Frequently Asked Questions. But it was not in the order. So I’m supposed to uphold an order that’s not clear and concise, that’s based on Frequently Asked Questions. Shiawassee County Sheriff Brian BeGole, too, said his department would not enforce Whitmer’s order: The Sheriff of Shiawassee County has publicly announced his department will not enforce the Governor's current executive orders! This is the county where Karl the Barber Manke's shop is located. We are going to win this fight.#StandUpMichigan pic.twitter.com/0c7PiOGMbd — Garrett Soldano (@GarrettSoldano) May 11, 2020  “With limited resources, staffing and facilities, our priority focus will be on enforcing duly passed laws for the protection of Shiawassee County citizens,” BeGole wrote in a public letter.  “I have decided, within my authority, that our office cannot and will not divert our primary resources and efforts towards enforcement of the Governor Whitmer’s executive orders.”  Whitmer lashed out at residents on Monday. “I expect people to follow the law,” she said. “These executive orders are not a suggestion. They’re not optional. They’re not helpful hints.” Kyle Olson is a reporter for Breitbart News. He is also host of “The Kyle Olson Show,” syndicated on Michigan radio stations on Saturdays.

President Donald Trump on Saturday confirmed a report that he is considering partially restoring U.S. funding of the World Health Organization as it investigations the United Nations-back agency’s alleged role in helping China cover-up the severity of the Wuhan virus, though no final decision on the matter has been made. “[T]his is just one of numerous concepts being considered under which we would pay 10% of what we have been paying over many years, matching much lower China payments. Have not made final decision. All funds are frozen,” the president said of the potential decision, which was first reported by Fox News Channel host Tucker Carlson. Lou, this is just one of numerous concepts being considered under which we would pay 10% of what we have been paying over many years, matching much lower China payments. Have not made final decision. All funds are frozen. Thanks! https://t.co/xQUzHy4NDa — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 16, 2020  During Friday’s broadcast of Tucker Carlson Tonight, the host reported on a draft letter on a planned partial refunding of the W.H.O., which reads that the U.S. “will continue to partner and work with the World Health Organization and agree to pay up to what China pays in assessed contributions.” Further, the letter reportedly reads: “Despite [its] shortcomings, I believe that the W.H.O. still has tremendous potential, and want to see the W.H.O live up to this potential, particularly now during this global crisis” and “That is why I’ve decided that the United States will continue to partner and work with the World Health Organization and agree to pay up to what China pays in assessed contributions.” The reported letter also takes aim the W.HO.’s response to the coronavirus and advocates for the agency to undergo a series of reforms. President Trump announced April 14 that his administration would place a hold on funding to the W.H.O., citing the organization’s slow response to the coronavirus outbreak and its cozy relationship with China, and would be conducting an investigation of the matter. The president said at a White House press conference he was instructing his administration to halt funding while “a review is conducted to assess the World Health Organization’s role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus.” “Had the WHO done its job to get medical experts into China to objectively assess the situation on the ground and to call out China’s lack of transparency, the outbreak could have been contained at its source with very little death,” he added. “This would have saved thousands of lives and avoided worldwide economic damage. Instead, the WHO willingly took China’s assurances to face value… and defended the actions of the Chinese government.” As Breitbart News reported, “The W.H.O. claimed in January that ‘preliminary investigations’ by China found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the virus in Wuhan. Further, the organization called on countries to keep borders open despite labeling the massive outbreak as a global emergency.” Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in #Wuhan, #China🇳. pic.twitter.com/Fnl5P877VG — World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) January 14, 2020  American taxpayers have given over $400 million to the W.H.O. last year compared to China’s $86 million. In late April, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced it will donate an additional $30 million to make up for the U.S.’s funding cuts. President Trump’s confirmation that he is weighing returning funding to the W.H.O. comes after Der Spiegel reported that Chinese dictator Xi Jinping asked the agency’s chief, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, during a phone call to withhold information regarding human-to-human transmission of the virus and delay declaring a pandemic. In response, the U.N. agency claimed Tedros and Xi “have never spoken by phone” and added that “such inaccurate reports distract and detract from WHO’s and the world’s efforts to end the COVID-19 pandemic.”

A story by ABC News regarding Texas’ number of cases and deaths related to the coronavirus since the state’s reopening on May 1 is going viral. The article presents misleading numbers that don’t appear to take increased testing and deaths related to pre-reopening contracted cases into account. An article by the news network’s Houston affiliate directly contradicts the national fake news story. ABC News reported on Saturday that “Texas has seen a steady rise in novel coronavirus cases and fatalities since reopening just over two weeks ago.” While statistically, that number is true, it does not take into account the massive increase in coronavirus testing in the Lone Star State in recent weeks and the lag in reporting caused by a backlog of coronavirus testing. A more accurate story published by KTRK ABC13 in Houston appears to directly contradict the national news article. The article, originally headlined “No sign of COVID-19 spike since Texas reopened, hospitalization numbers remain flat.” That headline has since been changed to, “COVID-19 cases still rising across Texas, hospitalizations remain flat.” Two weeks after Texas reopened, no sign of Coronavirus spike, and hospitalization numbers remain flat – ABC13 Houston https://t.co/WXkIWGcdgQ — ❌VoteThemOut2020❌ (@OutIn2020) May 16, 2020  Screenshot of Google Search showing original headline from ABC-13 article. The office of Texas Governor Greg Abbott responded sharply to the ABC News article in a phone interview with Breitbart Texas Saturday morning. “We have done more testing in the first 16 days of May that we did in the previous two months combined,” said Abbott’s Communication Director John Wittman. “The percentage of positive test results is decreasing steadily.” Wittman said that on April 13 the positive test result was about 13 percent of those tested. At that time, Texas was testing about 8,000 people per day. On April 15, the percentage of positive test results fell to about 5 percent, Wittman said. Texas is now testing at the rate of about 17,000 tests per day, according to HealthData.org, a website published by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle, Washington. “The governor has been clear all along that as we test more people, the raw numbers will rise,” Wittman said. Houston Public Health Authority’s Dr. David Persse told ABC13’s Nick Natario it is too early to draw conclusions about the raw numbers. “If it were me, I would probably wait another two weeks to see what happens,” Dr. Persee said. “I think that because of the lag in reporting, what we’re looking at today, may not be reflecting what we think it is.” The governor’s office and ABC13 appear to agree that a better indicator is the number of people hospitalized. ABC13 reported: One thing that is reflecting today is hospital numbers. There are fewer coronavirus patients at the Texas Medical Center than in April. And statewide, as of Thursday, there were 130 fewer people in the hospital compared to two weeks ago. The Texas Department of State Health Services reports that on May 15, there were 1,716 people hospitalized in Texas with COVID-19. The number of hospitalization has remained relatively flat since about April 22. The ABC News article then delves into the number of deaths in Texas, reporting: The state also experienced its highest and second-highest daily death toll just a day apart. On Thursday, 58 deaths were recorded in 24 hours and Friday that number dropped only slightly to 56, according to the health department. The total number of fatalities is at 1,272. Last Friday, the daily death toll was 31. Wittman took exception to that report as well, saying the deaths are a lagging indicate from cases contracted long before the re-opening of Texas. “In fact,” Wittman said, “Texas has the lowest per capita death rate of any state in the country.” The number of COVID-19 related deaths in Texas is about five per 100,000 people, according to the Washington Post. Only nine states have a lower per-capita death rate than Texas. Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior news contributor for the Breitbart Texas-Border team.

Left-wing pop icon turned left-wing activist Cher penned another angry diatribe on President Trump early Saturday morning, calling him a “lazy, orange faced miscreant” who should be charged. “Why do ppl keep expecting trump to act like a Human,” the “Dov’e L’Amore” singer began, unleashing her tirade in her classic all-caps style.

California’s Congressman-elect Mike Garcia joined Sirius XM’s Breitbart News Tonight on Thursday, where he discussed the “renaissance and awakening” from the American public and what his race portends for November. Garcia, a former military pilot, defeated his Democrat opponent Christy Smith (D-Santa Clarita) in a special election to fill a House seat once held by Democrat Katie Hill in Southern California. “I do believe there has been a renaissance and an awakening from the general public, not just Republicans, but Americans in general — that we really do need to pay attention to who we’re voting for … and this district is an extremely purple district,” Garcia said in response to a question from Breitbart News Editor-at-Large Rebecca Mansour regarding what his being elected means for national elections. Garcia also said he believes his being elected is “an opportunity of a lifetime for 2020.” “I’m in the northern LA county with Santa Clarita, Antelope Valley, Simi Valley, and Ventura County,” Garcia explained. “So as far as registered voters it’s maybe only 25 to 30 percent Republican, but what it represents is folks understanding the message and the values and understanding that we’ve gotta hire people for these jobs that are competent, qualified, and know how to run a business, and are running for the right reasons as patriots and not any self-serving motives or political agenda. I think people are recognizing that. I think that this is truly an opportunity of a lifetime for 2020, for our party, for conservatives in general. … I think we have an opportunity to get the house back, but we’ve got to continue to work our tails off to make sure that that happens and not take it for granted.”  Garcia also spoke about some of the issues he is facing in the race as he will be on the ballot again in November. “It’s been a special campaign all along,” he said. “Remember this was the seat Katie Hill had and then resigned from, so dealing with all of that — and I had been running against her for about nine months before she resigned, so that was the primary issue, just having a qualified candidate and a patriot and someone who had the life experiences of someone that was representative of our district versus someone who wasn’t. As she resigned and things pivoted, it became about — at the core it’s always been about the constitution, capitalism, and competition, and allowing folks the free will and liberties to continue to conduct themselves as Americans with all the rights that that comes with, but in California especially we started seeing that erode even before the COVID-19 crisis, and it really became a matter of not letting our nation turn into what California has become.” Garcia also spoke about the problems Californians face, including the “highest taxes, homelessness problems, the challenges that we see on a daily basis here” that are beginning to “creep to a national level.” “People just want to be able to afford to live here. They want to be able to continue to survive here, and the COVID-19 thing was obviously a completely different dynamic, so the focus has really been allowing small businesses to flourish, getting taxes down, and lowering the bureaucracy,” Garcia said, adding that there are “a lot of bad bills in California that make it almost impossible for small businesses.” Garcia went on to discuss the lasting impacts of COVID-19 and how it has affected politics in America: “I think now what we’re starting to see is blurring of the fault line, as you called it, and less about party allegiances or even conservative versus liberal values, and I really do believe we’re seeing a shift to people saying, ‘Okay we can still mitigate this virus, get back to work, and do it in a safe and responsible manner.’ It’s going to require us all to do it, but we absolutely have to figure out how to do that. … They’re not mutually exclusive. We need to save lives, but also save the economy in parallel or it is going to be a bad situation.” Questioned about the coronavirus relief packages stemming from purple states, Garcia said they must be “throttled and feathered in correctly.” “It all needs to be throttled and feathered in correctly and look, the odds of the first couple stimulus packages totaling close to 2.5 trillion, the odds of that number being right is slim to none,” Garcia said. “It’s very low odds that what is out there is actually the right number. It’s probably not enough. We probably do need something additional. Not necessarily the three trillion dollars that’s being floated for a bunch of political agenda topics in this latest bill floated by Pelosi — so that’s part of that. We’ve got to look at the longer it continues the longer the impact is, and you know 2.5 trillion is just over ten percent of the nations GDP, but we’ve been out of business for more than ten percent of the year, so the implications are going to ripple and magnify, so there will likely be more stimulus, but I think the state, the governors, and the lower level government who are making some of these decisions now need to also be held accountable and also need to try to figure out how to make things whole if they decide to extend these stay at home orders.” “My priority with the 25th District here is we haven’t had representation for eight months, so there’s a tremendous amount of backlog for casework and constituent services, and a tremendous number of people who still haven’t gotten the existing COVID relief that they’ve been expecting,” Garcia said. “So, my priority especially this year is to make sure we’re opening those cases and getting them closed and completed and getting the checks that people are entitled to right now, out so those are priorities one and two.” Garcia also addressed the issue of homelessness, saying that he believes it is “not a housing crisis.” “I mentioned the three big c’s: the constitution, capitalism, and competition,” Garcia stated. “There’s a 4th C called charity, and I believe this homeless problem is not a housing crisis; it’s not due to a lack of units. What’s happening in California is it’s almost impossible to build low-income housing and affordable housing, but there still are units out there and opportunities.” Garcia continued, “This is less about housing prices and more about mental health and drug rehab — and again in California these are some of the examples of bad legislation at the state level with things like prop 47 and 57 that are reclassifying felonies to misdemeanors and misdemeanors to effectively slap-on-the-wrist charges. These folks are being recycled through the system and the law enforcement officers are trying to do what they can, but the laws frankly aren’t set up to allow them to help the people who need it, so we need more mental health facilities. We need to be able to enforce laws and get people drug rehabilitation that need it, and there needs to be some piece in those action so that when people are put into rehab for either mental health or drugs, they’re kept there until they show progress.” Follow Kyle on Twitter @RealKyleMorris and Facebook.

Photos and videos of Zimbabwean health workers wearing bedsheets as personal protective equipment (PPE) amid a shortage of Wuhan coronavirus medical supplies have outraged locals, Zimbabwe’s Pindula News reported on Friday, who are demanding the government come to their aid. A photo of nurses wearing bedsheets in place of personal protective equipment (PPE) at the nation’s largest hospital has gone viral throughout Zimbabwe social media this week. According to Pindula, the picture was taken at Parirenyatwa General Hospital, Zimbabwe’s largest medical center located in the capital, Harare. These are nurses at Zimbabwe’s BIGGEST hospital, Parirenyatwa, wearing BEDSHEETS as an alternative form of Personal Protective Equipment. This is in a country where a company close to the President has LOOTED BILLIONS of dollars, yet Mnangagwa can’t provide PPE. FAILED NATION! pic.twitter.com/FIdHV0POfg — Hopewell Chin’ono (@daddyhope) May 14, 2020  Many citizens have criticized the national government for failing to provide frontline healthcare workers with basic supplies as the country fights to contain its coronavirus outbreak. In response, Zimbabwean nurses at public health facilities have been resigning en masse, according to the report. Zimbabwean health workers anticipated this shortage. In April, the Zimbabwe Association for Doctors for Human Rights (ZADHR) sued the national government for its failure to provide hospitals with sufficient PPE amid the country’s coronavirus outbreak, a move doctors hoped would spur authorities into action. Prior to the lawsuit, in March, doctors and nurses in Zimbabwe went on strike to protest the lack of PPE. They also did this at the end of last year, prior to the coronavirus pandemic, to demand better wages. On April 21, Chinese companies donated a large shipment of coronavirus PPE to Zimbabwe’s first lady, Auxillia Mnangagwa. “Huawei and Sichuan PD Times donated 50,000 medical surgical masks, 510 protective suits, and 1,000 pairs of medical goggles to Angel of Hope Foundation. These medical supplies will be distributed to medical workers on the frontline against COVID-19 [Wuhan coronavirus] in Zimbabwe,” Beijing announced in a statement shared by state-run news agency Xinhua. “The donated supplies were brought to Harare from Beijing by a charter plane of Air Zimbabwe on [April 21],” the statement said. Angel of Hope is the first lady’s foundation. Zimbabweans criticized China for donating the supplies to Mnangagwa directly rather than to the country’s public health ministry. Zimbabwean lawyer Alex Magaisa said that to give Mnangagwa PPE when it was urgently needed by frontline workers was a callous move, as it caused delays in distribution to public health facilities. “Now they [Chinese companies] come through a non-state actor [the foundation] when the state entities exist … We can see through the veil,” the lawyer said. Magaisa argues that the donation was merely a political act to generate positive publicity for China and to flatter Zimbabwe’s president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, and his ruling party. The photos of Zimbabwean nurses wearing bedsheets as PPE this week, nearly a month after China’s donated PPE allegedly landed in Harare, appear to support Magaisa’s doubts that the PPE would actually reach public hospitals. At press time on Friday, Zimbabwe had recorded 42 infections and 4 deaths from the Wuhan coronavirus.

Vote-by-mail “must become the default option for the vast majority of Americans” during the coronavirus epidemic, declared the Center for American Progress. The Center for American Progress (CAP), which functions as somewhat of an idea factory for the Democratic Party, has been a central part of the progressive nerve center pushing the vote-by-mail scheme. CAP is funded by Soros’s Open Society Foundations and joins scores of other Soros-financed groups using the virus to lobby for the overhaul of the U.S. election system. Analysts have posited that such proposals help the Democratic Party. Republicans specifically fear the prospect of voter fraud, since mail-in voting would be harder to authenticate. Danielle Root serves on the Democracy and Government Reform team at the CAP. She penned a column lamenting how “in-person voting still remains the most popular method of casting ballots in most states” although “voting by mail is used broadly in a handful of places.” Root urges: “States officials must not delay in implementing vital policies such as vote by mail and extended early voting for upcoming elections—nor must Congress delay providing additional funding in the amount of $4 billion as recommended by noted experts for states to make all necessary upgrades to election procedures and infrastructure in time for upcoming elections.” The CAP activist cautions that “although vote by mail must become the default option for the vast majority of Americans during this health crisis,” the vote by mail system is “not an ideal or accessible option for many others.” She wrote that preserving in-person voting for a segment of the population is important to protect against what she described in a previous column as possible voter disenfranchisement. Those who could be impacted, she wrote, include voters who rely on same-day voter registration, people living on tribal lands who may not have access to reliable mailing systems and African American voters who “traditionally rely on in-person voting.” Still, CAP views vote-by-mail as necessary for most Americans under the pandemic. The group recently published its wish list for the next round of recovery legislation during the coronavirus crisis. The compilation recommended requiring all states to “significantly expand vote-by-mail opportunities; implement at least 14 days of early voting; adopt online and same day voter registration.” CAP joins a slew of other Soros-funded progressive groups seeking the expanded use of mail-in balloting for elections by citing fears that coronavirus makes it too dangerous to vote in person. Prominent among those groups is the Brennan Center for Justice, which is heavily financed by Soros and released an updated $4 billion nationwide funding blueprint for voting reform during the coronavirus pandemic. Democrat lawmakers have cited the Brennan Center’s coronavirus voting plan as influencing their legislative proposals while the news media has routinely spotlighted the radical proposal. The original Brennan Center coronavirus voting reform plan released in March was budgeted at $2 billion. Late last month, the Center doubled that estimate to $4 billion. Breitbart News previously reported the Brennan Center was listed in leaked Open Society Foundations documents as receiving funds specifically earmarked for “litigation to expand access to registration and improve ease of voting.” Alongside the Brennan Center are a slew of other progressive groups tied to Soros money that are working overtime to push mail-in voting. The Soros-funded Brennan Center’s mail-in ballot plan was weaponized by the Stand Up America activist group, which launched a nationwide program urging Americans to nudge Congress to fund the voting changes.  The group’s activities reportedly resulted in more than 19,000 calls to congressional offices in one day alone. Stand Up America is funded by the Sixteen Thirty Fund, which is managed by the shadowy Arabella Advisors, a for-profit consultancy funded by far-left donors. The Soros-funded Democracy Alliance recommended that donors invest several million dollars into Sixteen Thirty Fund. The massively Soros-funded American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which routinely partners with Brennan, has been pumping materials urging coronavirus voting legislation that pushes mail-in voting. Soros’s Open Society Foundations donated $50 million to the ACLU. The Brennan Center has been the recipient of numerous grants from Soros’s Open Society Foundations totaling over $7,466,000 from 2000 to 2010. Meanwhile, a coalition of progressive groups are reportedly mounting a multimillion-dollar campaign to not only change the presidential election system to mail-in voting during coronavirus, but to keep the mail-in balloting as part of the permanent way Americans will vote in the future. The other groups in the mail-in advocacy coalition include the National Association of Non-Partisan Reformers, Public Citizen, Common Cause, National Vote at Home Institute and the Center for Secure and Modern Elections. Common Cause is funded by Soros’s Open Society Foundations. So is Public Citizen. The Center for Secure and Modern Elections is a project of the left-leaning New Venture Fund, which doesn’t disclose its donors. The National Vote at Home Institute is partnered with the Soros-funded League of Women Voters, as well as the Soros-funded Common Cause. The National Association of Non-Partisan Reformers lists its founding organization members as including FairVote. FairVote is a project of the Soros-funded Center for Voting and Democracy. A recent Washington Post oped by election experts cited a study finding “people who vote by mail are significantly more likely to make mistakes than those who vote in person… Of course, people who vote in person may make mistakes — but they can more easily ask for help in correcting their ballots.” Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

Authorities in Wuhan locked down certain districts of the city on Thursday, restricting access into and out of residential communities amid a resurgence of Wuhan coronavirus cases in the city where the virus first emerged late last year, Radio Free Asia (RFA) reported. On Monday, Wuhan, the epicenter of China’s coronavirus outbreak in December 2019, reported six new cases of the Wuhan coronavirus in what government officials claimed was the first cluster of new cases since Wuhan’s lockdown was lifted one month ago, Caixin Global – a Bejing-based news outlet owned by a state-run press group – reported on Tuesday. All cases confirmed Monday were reportedly recorded within the previous 24 hours, and all were documented within the same residential compound. The announcement prompted the local government to raise the coronavirus risk level from low to medium in the city district surrounding the compound. The report added that a local government official had been fired amid news of the coronavirus resurgence in Wuhan. News of the resurgence followed weeks of government authorities alleging that Wuhan and other parts of Hubei province were “free” of coronavirus, assuring the public that the region was ready to open again following an extended lockdown. According to RFA’s report on Thursday, this residential compound, Sanmin, houses about 5,000 people. A local citizen journalist named Zhang told RFA that Sanmin was inaccessible from the outside. “I went there to find out more about the situation, but it has been placed under quarantine. There are police outside on the street now guarding the place, and no vehicles are being allowed through,” Zhang said. “I asked a nearby resident how many people were taken away in ambulances, and he told me that 180 people were taken away for isolation.” Residents of Sanmin who were outside of the compound at the time it was sealed have not been allowed to return to their homes. Zhang told RFA that Wuhan authorities have started to close off other housing compounds as well, including the city’s Sanyanqiao residential compound. “The barriers have been put back and the place is under lockdown. There is also an online announcement saying that delivery drivers aren’t being allowed to enter certain compounds,” Zhang said. At least eight Wuhan city districts – including Dongxihu, Wuchang, Jiangxia, Jiang’an, and Hongshan – have suspended their courier services from May 12, according to RFA, indicating that these districts have also been locked down by authorities. The new coronavirus cases were reported on Monday shortly after Wuhan announced that it planned to carry out city-wide coronavirus testing on all of its 11 million residents. A man who lives in Wuhan surnamed Sun told RFA on Thursday that Wuhan has informed all residents that they will be tested “district by district.” “The city government is implementing the testing order from the epidemic prevention center, and each administrative region will notify the neighborhood committees in the residential compounds when they need to organize nucleic acid testing,” Sun said. A resident of Wuhan’s Qiaokou district surnamed Ma confirmed to RFA that the Wuhan government was tracking down residents for mass coronavirus testing. “Every district and neighborhood committee has to register [residents’] IDs for blanket nucleic acid testing,” Ma said. “This is just to show the international community that China really has got the epidemic under control like it said it had.” “It is being carried out as a top priority political task,” added Sun. On May 13, authorities in China’s northeastern Jilin province announced a lockdown of the capital, Jilin City, after the community documented several new coronavirus cases in recent days. Jilin City’s outbreak was directly linked to another coronavirus outbreak in the nearby city of Shulan which forced the city to lock down on May 10. There, authorities declared “wartime control mode” and raised the coronavirus risk level to the highest level. Local reports indicate that the number of coronavirus cases in Jilin province is much higher than what the government has reported so far. The lockdowns in Jilin province, which borders North Korea, follow a surge in new Wuhan coronavirus cases across northeastern China in recent weeks, including in the neighboring province of Heilongjiang, which borders Russia.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Breitbart News exclusively that President Donald Trump is “committed” to holding the Chinese Communist Party accountable for the coronavirus pandemic and will be considering options on how to do so in the near future. Pompeo, who joined Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel for an exclusive interview, said he is coordinating with his counterparts around the world and working with the president on developing what “precise mechanisms” will be used to hold China accountable for the pandemic. “I don’t want to get out in front of what President Trump will ultimately decide, but I think we all know in this administration that we have to make sure that something like this can never happen again,” Pompeo said when asked how the United States will proceed with accountability with regard to China over coronavirus. “That means deterrence. That means setting up processes. The president has already stopped funding to the WHO so that we can evaluate that and figure out which pieces of the WHO might actually work and which pieces don’t so that we can deliver good outcomes and keep Americans safe and make sure this doesn’t happen again. Then, there will come a time, there will come a day when we evaluate what it is that needs to be done to convince the Chinese Communist Party that there are real costs—real costs—connected to this kind of misbehavior. You know this—we say this all the time inside the United States but around the world too, we have to hold nations accountable. I’m talking with many of my counterparts around the world. We have to hold nations accountable for the things and actions that they undertake which create risk, and in this case created enormous loss of life here in the United States. President Trump is committed to doing that. The precise mechanisms we will choose. I want to make sure he gets fully briefed to make those decisions.” What should the penalty be for #China's role in spreading the #coronavirus? @SecPompeo joins @BreitbartNews Saturday, tomorrow at 11 am ET, to discuss the threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party https://t.co/GYAzJnPHxP pic.twitter.com/KLbULPiDmJ — SiriusXM Patriot (@SiriusXMPatriot) May 16, 2020  The U.S. Intelligence Community has unanimously confirmed that the coronavirus emanated from Wuhan, China, originating there. It is unclear whether the virus leaked out of the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), a lab that the U.S. partially funded with American taxpayer dollars from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Institute on Allergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) or from a wet market. A statement from the acting Director of National Intelligence a couple weeks ago confirmed that U.S. intelligence officials believe it either came from the lab or the wet market—but it definitely came from China. Pompeo told Breitbart News in this exclusive interview that the Chinese Communist Party is blocking American investigators from learning more about the origins of the virus. The lack of transparency from the Communist regime, he noted, is hampering public health officials in their quest for a vaccine or other treatments and has slowed the ability of the world to be able to respond to the pandemic. He added that U.S. efforts to learn more about the origins of the virus are not political in nature, but aimed at trying to help doctors worldwide fight COVID-19—and that the Chinese Communist Party’s cover-up of this is hurting those efforts. “Sadly, we’re not much further than we were weeks and weeks ago,” Pompeo said when asked how the investigation is going. “The Chinese Communist Party has relentlessly deceived and denied information to the west. We have repeatedly asked to have teams go in and assist them to identify where the virus originated. We know it began in Wuhan, but we don’t know from where or from whom, and those are important things. Your listeners need to know. We still need to know that so we can break the code on this thing. One of the key facts for scientists and epidemiologists to build out vaccines and therapeutics and to identify how this was ultimately delivered to the world. You have to know where patient zero began and how patient zero became infected. Yet, the Chinese Communist Party has at every turn attempted to manage the World Health Organization to manage the information flow, to punish doctors who wanted to talk about this publicly, to undermine the central understandings of transparency that every country has a responsibility to deliver. As a result of that, we still have so many unanswered questions. We, the United States, the world, have so many unanswered questions that are incredibly important so we can address these issues going forward to keep the American people safe. This isn’t political. This isn’t aimed at achieving a political victory. It’s aimed squarely at getting the right health outcomes and saving lives across the world.” What’s more, Pompeo said that the Chinese knew at least by December—potentially as early as November—what a major threat the coronavirus was and withheld that information even into January from the rest of the world. Had the Chinese been more transparent at the outset, and had they been honest, Pompeo said the world’s ability to confront the coronavirus pandemic would have been much different. “We know this much. We know that in December at least, maybe earlier, the Chinese Communist Party came to understand the threat that was presented,” Pompeo said. “Then we watched their actions. I’ve talked about some of them—denying information to the world. We then saw that when the United States made the decision, when President Trump made the decision, to close off travel between the United States and China, we saw China squawk at that and say we shouldn’t be doing that. Even though they had locked down Wuhan, they had not locked down travel all across the world. Those are the kinds of decisions that as you stare at them it is unambiguous that it created increased risk to people who were still traveling around the world. Why? As the Chinese Communist Party knew of the risk of transmission, they were still allowing people to travel outside of China while they had locked down a major city inside of their own country. We know those all to be facts, and we know had they made a different set of decisions at the front end there would have been more time for the entire world—not just the United States but the entire world—to prepare and react to the pandemic that has now spread all across the globe.” LISTEN TO SECRETARY MIKE POMPEO ON BREITBART NEWS SATURDAY:  

Vice Media CEO Nancy Dubuc attacked the Silicon Valley Masters of the Universe in a memo to all employees sent as the company lays off 155 staffers. Dubuc’s memo says that Big Tech’s “squeeze” is becoming a “Chokehold” on the new business, as platforms are “not just taking a larger slice of the pie, but almost the whole pie.” As Vice Media slashes its newsroom staff, its chief executive officer is blaming Silicon Valley giants for destroying journalism, saying that big tech firms are strangling the news profession. “The squeeze is becoming a chokehold. Platforms are not just taking a larger slice of the pie, but almost the whole pie,” Vice CEO Nancy Dubuc wrote in a blistering memo obtained by the Hollywood Reporter. Vice Media said Friday that it is laying off 55 staffers in the U.S., plus about 100 staffers overseas in the coming weeks. The layoffs are part of a larger bloodbath to overtake the news industry in the wake of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. Buzzfeed has announced the closure of its U.K. and Australia offices, while  Quartz announced layoffs earlier this week. Numerous local newspapers have cut staff, while some major outlets including the Los Angeles Times and Gannett-owned papers have enacted furloughs and pay cuts. Vice’s announcement on Friday represents a major hit to the once invincible news brand that targeted millennials with a mix original video content, long-form reporting, and clickbait. “We grew our digital business faster than anyone at a time when we believed that as more pies were baked, we’d keep getting a slice,” Vice CEO Dubuc wrote in her memo. “Now, after many years of this, the squeeze is becoming a chokehold. Platforms are not just taking a larger slice of the pie, but almost the whole pie. And while the crescendo has been building for some time, now it is more clear than ever … 36,000+ lost jobs in journalism is enough to take your breath away.” Dubuc didn’t name specific tech companies in her memo. But the news industry has long blamed Facebook and Google for its decline, saying that the platforms have soaked up advertising dollars while benefiting from original reporting done by others. “It’s time we stand together as a media industry and address the serious issues that have slowly eroded the original promise of the Internet: a tool to bring society on more equal footing through knowledge and creativity unparalleled,” Dubuc wrote. On Friday, Vice Media’s newsroom union blasted the company’s decision to lay off staffers. “We understand that the entire news industry is hurting. We do not understand why Vice chose to lay off many of our colleagues in the middle of a global pandemic instead of exhausting all options to save these jobs,” the union said in a statement.

Amy Ford, a nurse from West Virginia, said goodbye to her children and traveled to a New York City hospital to care for coronavirus patients. “Amy has been serving the coronavirus patients around the clock. She once held the hand of an elderly patient all night long, just so the woman would not feel alone,” Trump said. “Boy, that’s something. Thank you, Amy. That’s incredible.” President Donald Trump poses for a photo with nurse Amy Ford during a presidential recognition ceremony in the Rose Garden of the White House, Friday, May 15, 2020, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) Ford spoke about her grueling experience in the hospital and her efforts to care for patients unable to see their families and loved ones. “This experience has been one of the most emotionally challenging things that I’ve ever been through, but it has made me a better person in the end,” she said. Ford told the president that she never contracted the virus, despite long hours with patients. She also offered hope to Americans who feared the virus. “There is a light at the tunnel,” she said. “We are beginning to see progress, and we’re starting to see stories of success. This virus may have initially caught our great nation off guard, but we will overcome this, and we will prevail.” The president also met New York Police Officer Spencer Garrett, who spent four weeks fighting the virus before returning to work. “After the experience with the virus, I felt compelled to help the residents of the housing development start patrolling in East Harlem, New York,” he said. “We are all in this fight together.” Trump thanked him for his efforts in New York City. “You’re my hero,” he said. The president also met with three ten-year-old Girl Scouts from a troop in Maryland who sent hundreds of boxes of Girl Scout cookies to local firefighters, doctors, and nurses, as well as sending about 200 cards to healthcare workers. One of the girls thanked the president for inviting them to the White House, noting that they were just a few of the millions of children who were working in their community: Laila Khan speaks as she stands on stage with fellow Girl Scout Troop 744 members Lauren Matney, left, and Sravya Annappareddy, center, during a presidential recognition ceremony in the Rose Garden of the White House, Friday, May 15, 2020, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) “Our message is that everyone can do something, whether it is donating cookies, adjusting to distance learning, or just helping out our parents,” she said. The president also greeted a local landlord from Arkansas who refused to accept rent checks from eleven of his small-business tenants, allowing them to stay in business. He met, too, with the cofounder of a bow tie company in West Virginia who shifted to producing free masks for medical facilities. “During this difficult time, our citizens are rising to the challenge, just as generations of Americans have done before us,” Trump concluded. “America has never faced a trial like this. We’ve never had anything like this happen. But we’re going to endure, and we’re going to thrive, and we’re going to do better than ever before.”

Thomas J. Tobin, the Catholic bishop of Providence, Rhode Island, has challenged the authority of the state to shut down the religious worship of its citizens. “I’m not an historian at all, but I wonder what our founder, Roger Williams, would have said about the power of the State to prevent religious folk from gathering for worship, even during difficult times,” Bishop Tobin tweeted early Saturday. The bishop was referencing the Baptist minister and theologian Roger Williams, founder of Providence Plantations, which became the Colony of Rhode Island. Williams was an outspoken advocate for religious freedom as well as separation of church and state and was, moreover, one of the first abolitionists. As a result of Williams’ leadership, Rhode Island became a haven for Baptists, Quakers, Jews, and other religious minorities. As Breitbart News reported, a number of U.S. churches are filing lawsuits against Democrat governors who are keeping churches closed under the assertion that the services they provide are “nonessential.” Churches and faith leaders from Oregon, California, Virginia, and Maine have already filed lawsuits claiming the governors do not have authority over churches and faith leaders to extend lockdown orders against them. “We are very concerned that churches and other places of worship are not being treated in the same manner as, say, Lowe’s, Home Depot, Target, Walmart and other large corporate stores,” said Oregon State Rep. Bill Post. “I was in my Keizer Lowe’s this past Saturday, and there were well over 1,000 people in the store at one time.” In a separate federal lawsuit in the Southern District of California, the Thomas More Society asserted that California is one of only eight states “whose response to the COVID-19 pandemic has included no accommodation for—hardly even a mention of—the religious rights of its citizens.” “After weeks of government suppression of their religious freedoms, our clients have said enough is enough,” said Charles LiMandri, special counsel for the Thomas More Society. “The First Amendment still protects their right to freely exercise their faith, even during a pandemic.” Follow @tdwilliamsrome

ROME (AP) — The Italian government is easing travel restrictions imposed due to the coronavirus pandemic, allowing people to move freely inside the region where they live as of Monday, and between regions starting June 3rd. The government decree announced early Saturday also permits international travel to and from Italy from June 3rd. Italy imposed nationwide lockdown rules in early March after it became the first country outside Asia with a major outbreak of coronavirus. More than 31,000 people have died, leaving Italy with the highest death toll after the United States and Britain. But the government led by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has gradually reopened the country as the rates of infections and deaths have fallen. Social distancing rules are being implemented in the sectors of the economy that have reopened, including factories and some businesses. Schools remain closed and crowds are not permitted, though people will be allowed to attend Mass in churches with some restrictions starting next week.  

Poland’s Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki slammed Sweden’s no-lockdown policy on the Chinese coronavirus, labelling the approach “Darwinian”. The Polish prime minister made his comments at a press conference this week on the subject of the coronavirus pandemic when he was asked if he regretted not taking the same approach as Sweden, which let many businesses remain open and did not introduce strict lockdown measures. “The world’s richest countries have started to choose which patients should receive care and which should not receive care. This is because of the lack of hospital beds, respirators, no proper equipment and no medical personnel. This so-called Swedish model, a Darwinian model, we have not even thought of introducing,” Morawiecki said, Sveriges Radio reports. Email Leaks Show Experts Slamming Swedish Govt for Not Taking Virus Seriously Enough https://t.co/iq1reoPYNB — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 22, 2020  He went on to claim that Poland had done much better than Sweden and other Western European countries in terms of coronavirus infections and deaths, with just over 860 deaths for a population of 38 million — compared to Sweden’s reported 3,500+ deaths as of Thursday, with a population around only 10 million. “We have tried and tried to save every human life and that is why we have taken such quick action,” Morawiecki added. Poland’s early action on foreign travel, quarantining incomers, locking down schools and businesses and introducing compulsory masks now appears to be reaping economic dividends, too, with retail shops re-opening and restrictions on the number of people allowed in stores at any one time being eased. SWEDEN 🇸: not to beat a dead horse, but there are many who keep shouting Sweden. I got into an on air debate about it recently. So here is the daily cases and total deaths per capita. Once again, Sweden plow-thru approach is not a success among its Scandinavian sister countries. pic.twitter.com/GYFFNHCO68 — Eric Feigl-Ding (@DrEricDing) May 15, 2020  Some have lauded the Swedish coronavirus approach, including the World Health Organization (WHO), with Dr Mike Ryan stating that the country could be a model for others to follow late last month. “I think if we are to reach a new normal, I think in many ways Sweden represents a future model… if we wish to get back to a society in which we don’t have lockdowns,” he said. However, when compared to its Scandinavian neighbours, Sweden has consistently had a much higher infection rate and a much higher death toll from the virus. Even when compared to European countries with a similar population elsewhere on the continent, such as Austria and Hungary, Sweden’s rates are much worse. Many have also made arguments that Sweden’s economy will be in much better shape during and after the pandemic but a recent European Union economic projection released earlier in the month claimed the country would see a larger reduction of GDP than countries like Denmark and Austria this year. Studies comparing consumer spending in Sweden and locked down Denmark during the pandemic found a difference of less than 5 per cent between the two, also.

Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) told Breitbart News that the $3 trillion omnibus bill passed by the House on Friday essentially “federalizes elections” to end states’ voter ID requirements and prohibitions against ballot harvesting. “We had the $3 trillion giveaway,” said Gohmert of the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act, dubbed the HEROES Act, on Friday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with host Rebecca Mansour and special guest host Dylan Gwinn. Gohmert sarcastically added, “[The bill] included really must-pass important things, like preventing states from having voter ID requirements before they can vote. We’ve got to allow more voter fraud, and the voter ID requirement is just an impediment to more voter fraud. So that was important to have in this bill that the Democrats passed today.” LISTEN:

“It’s codified ballot harvesting for the whole country,” Gohmert remarked. “So the Democrats all over the country, when they lose an election, they can go out and pick up ballots from people and say, ‘Whoops, that person didn’t really win because we’ve been able to manufacture a lot of votes that we needed to get this person defeated.'” Gohmert went on, “That will make ballot harvesting legal for the whole country, and even though the Constitution is clear … elections generally are afforded to the states and the people, but this changes the Constitution and basically federalizes the entire election process.” The House also changed its rules for voting on legislation to allow for remote voting, which Gohmert described as “unconstitutional.” Gohmert said, “Of course, the Constitution — Article 1, Section 5 — says that for each House to do business, and I’m quoting, ‘a majority of each House shall constitute a quorum to do business,’ and so if we have all 435 members of Congress, then according to that, we’ve got to have 218 present in the chamber in order to have a constitutional vote on any bill.” The House’s rule change to allow for remote voting violates the Constitution’s requirement for representatives’ physical presence on the House floor when voting on legislation, maintained Gohmert.

The House passed Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) $3 trillion, 1,815-page phase four coronavirus legislation on Friday. The House passed H.R. 6800, the Heroes Act, with 208 votes in favor of the bill and 199 votes against the measure. Before the vote, House Democrats blocked Rep. Denver Riggleman’s (R-VA) motion to recommit. The motion, if passed would attach a House Republican amendment to the Heroes Act that would prevent illegal immigrants from receiving the stimulus checks contained in the bill. The Heroes Act contains many leftist provisions. The bill would order that felons and illegal aliens be freed from prison. The bill would also allow businesses to hire illegal aliens over 33 million unemployed Americans. Breitbart News wrote a primer on the House Democrat Heroes Act. Rep. Lance Gooden (R-TX) said in a statement on Friday that the bill serves as a waste of time and will not help Americans. Gooden said: Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats have wasted our time at a moment when real leadership is needed. All this does is give them a chance to point at the Senate and whine that they haven’t gotten their way. We’ve got to get the American people back to work. We’ve got to fix unemployment insurance. We’ve got to get small business loans to the people who need them. This legislation will never accomplish those things, and everyone who voted in favor of it tonight knows that. House Republican Whip Steve Scalise slammed the bill’s bailout for fiscally irresponsible state governments, saying: But in this bill, $500 billion to bail out states who were failing prior to COVID-19. What’s not in this bill, Mr. Speaker? Money to hold China accountable for this whole mess. No money in this bill to hold China accountable. But again, what’s in this bill? Billions of dollars for people who are here illegally. Just look at this one page in the bill, just one page, two-word change that makes accessible hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars to people here illegally. It’s in the bill. House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) said on the House floor on Friday that Democrats continue to use Americans’ suffering as leverage for their progressive ends. “America is in a serious crisis — but House Democrats see it as “leverage” to pass their socialist agenda,” he said. “Republicans reject Democrats’ liberal wishlist and will continue to focus on getting Americans back to work safely and defeating this virus,” McCarthy said.

There are signs of hope in the job market after the massive layoffs of the coronavirus crisis. But a new crisis is looming in state and local governments, which are facing drastic revenue shortfalls and will be forced to cut services and jobs. Even when the private sector recovers, the public sector will lag, and will become a drag on overall economic growth. Both Republicans and Democrats in Congress are failing to take the looming public sector job crisis seriously. On the Republican side, the focus is on profligate “blue” states that mismanaged their budgets and pensions for years, and now want the rest of the country to bail them out. It is hard to have sympathy for Illinois, for example, where Democrats fought former Republican Governor Bruce Rauner’s proposed reforms. They replaced him with Democrat J. B. Pritzker, who has imposed draconian stay-at-home orders and now comes, cap in hand, to the federal taxpayer. But not every Democrat-run state has been quite as irresponsible. California has many backward policies, but former Gov. Jerry Brown did at least impose a modicum of fiscal discipline, leaving his successor, Gavin Newsom, with a surplus and a rainy-day fund. Even that will not be enough to cover the coming shortfall — and the need is real. On the Democrat side, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is playing her usual games. Rather than propose a bill that can pass with bipartisan support, she passed a $3 trillion, 1,815-page monstrosity filled with pork that has nothing to do with economic relief, and poison pills like “ballot harvesting.” When members of her own party balked, she warned them they will face the wrath of their constituents at home for not bringing them money from Washington, essentially holding them hostage. Pelosi’s cynical approach was designed to force Republicans to vote against the bill, so that she could tell the media that President Donald Trump and his party don’t care about cops, teachers, and bus drivers. Of course, if Pelosi really cared, she would have proposed a “clean” bill funding the urgent needs of state and local governments, leaving out pet projects and long-term liabilities. It would have been law by now. Republicans and Democrats need to wake up. State and local governments need a lifeline to save jobs. In addition, Congress should fund an infrastructure program that takes up the slack in the job market, providing jobs and training. Reasonable conditions should be attached. States should have to spend the money on jobs and services, not past debts. “Sanctuary cities” are a constitutional abomination and must end. But a compromise is needed. Time is running out. Joel B.

World Health Organization (W.H.O.) Director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus is “shaken” by the U.S. decision to freeze funding for the agency for not doing enough to stem the spread of the coronavirus when it first surfaced in China, Reuters reported Friday. Reuters cited named and unnamed W.H.O. insiders and other officials as the source for its report. W.H.O. is a component of the United Nations. “It has been a big blow to W.H.O. and to Tedros,” an unnamed W.H.O. official told Reuters, referring to the U.S. funding halt. “We knew how it was going to look, and he can sometimes be a bit naive about that,” another anonymous source told Reuters, referring to Tedro’s praise of China’s response to the deadly virus. “But he’s also stubborn.” An anonymous source familiar with the discussions told Reuters several W.H.O. advisers urged Tedros, the first person to run the agency without being a medical doctor, to tone down his praises for Beijing’s response to the pandemic as evidence mounted that Chinese officials had silenced whistleblowers and suppressed information about the outbreak. “When he refers to China with praise, there is always a grinding of teeth,” an unnamed European envoy who attends Tedros’s weekly briefings for diplomats of member states told Reuters. China’s Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province, is the birthplace of the Chinese coronavirus and the illness associated with it, COVID-19. Several Trump administration officials have accused China of mismanaging its response and hiding the extent of the viral outbreak during its early stages, with the help of W.H.O. Tedros lauded Beijing’s response to the coronavirus outbreak after visiting China in January of this year. Reuters noted: The [W.H.O.] advisers encouraged Tedros to use less effusive language [in praising China] out of concern about how he would be perceived externally, the person familiar with the discussions said, but the director general was adamant, in part because he wanted to ensure China’s cooperation in fighting the outbreak. On April 14, President Donald Trump announced his administration was halting funding to the W.H.O. while it conducts a 60-to-90 day review of the Beijing-influenced agency’s response to the virus. The United States is already mulling redirecting millions in W.H.O. funds to other international health organizations. Nevertheless, communication continues between the United States and the international body, according to Tedros. “We are actually in constant contact, and we work together,” Tedros told reporters on May 1 about U.S.-W.H.O. relations. Still, W.H.O. Director Tedros is “shaken” by the U.S. decision, Reuters claimed. Trump’s move has “obviously frustrated” Tedros, who believes President Trump is using the W.H.O. as a “political football.” “We’re in the middle of the fight of our lives – all of us around the world,” Michael Ryan, the top W.H.O. official, told Reuters, referring to the challenges facing the body. The W.H.O. is working on helping health systems deal with the pandemic, developing vaccines and treatments, and reopening economies, Ryan argued. “That’s a big enough task to worry about for any organization,” he declared. “I’ve got to now deal with the potential that we’ll have a significant disruption in funding in front-line essential health services in many fragile countries in the coming months.” “It’s bending the system,” the doctor and epidemiologist added, “but it’s not breaking it.” The U.S. is the W.H.O.’s top source of funding, but American officials, including President Trump, have complained that China appears to maintain more clout over the agency. Citing the organization’s figures, Reuters revealed that American taxpayers were due to contribute $533 million for the current two-year period, ending in December 2021. That is about three times the amount China is expected to provide during the same period — $187.5 million. Citing an unnamed U.S. official, Reuters revealed: Washington already has paid almost half of the $122 million of the membership dues it owed for 2020. The official added that Trump’s freeze means Washington will likely redirect the remaining $65 million in dues payments and more than $300 million in planned giving to other international organizations. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has also called for an independent review of the W.H.O’s response to COVID-19. The European Union has also reportedly proposed a resolution calling for an evaluation of the W.H.O’s response to the pandemic. The W.H.O.’s annual assembly of ministers will reportedly consider the measure next week. China has refuted criticism for its response to COVID-19, which had infected 4.5 million and killed 304,000 across the world as of Friday afternoon, the Johns Hopkins University tracker showed.

Safety protocols for returning to the workforce are more important than ubiquitous coronavirus testing to resume economic normalcy, explained Dr. Anthony Harris, associate medical director and vice president of onsite clinical operations for WorkCare, an occupational health services company. Harris discussed responses to the coronavirus outbreak in an interview on Thursday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow. Marlow asked, “Are you seeing anything that people are overemphasizing or getting way too much attention that you think should not be a focus?” Harris replied, “Yeah, I think one of the things that people are trying to rely on is testing, right? ‘We’ve got to test. We’ve got to test. We’ve got to test. We’ve got to test everybody, every day,’ and that’s not going to be the answer, right?” LISTEN:  Harris continued, “But being smart about testing, yes, we do need to test more in the U.S. Finding out who has had the disease and who have not so that we can protect those who are still vulnerable is key.” Harris added, “Until we have a vaccine, we’ll be dealing with COVID, and it’ll be something that shouldn’t alarm everyone because we have ways to help deal with it. The biggest thing to know is not to panic. It is safe to go back to work when the doors open, but we have to have things in place to help protect the workforce.” “If we don’t do something to help stem the tide of lost economic value, then we may not have anything to come back to when we talk about reopening the doors,” Harris remarked. “We have to provide ways to safely get people back and to do it quickly, and testing is only a small piece of it. The strategy on how you reopen — [including] the tools you provide help keep people safe, and education — is going to be key and far more important than just testing alone.” Safety measures such as hand-washing hygiene and social distancing are more important than widespread testing in terms of reducing the coronavirus’ spread, determined Harris. Harris explained, “If we look at testing, even in Wuhan, China, where they were knocking on doors and getting everybody out and trying to test far more than what we’re doing in the U.S., they were still only able to — in estimate — get to 41 percent of the people that were infected. So we know testing is not going to be the answer to making sure we’re back and thriving.” Breitbart News Daily broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.

House Democrats blocked a motion on Friday to prevent illegal immigrants from receiving stimulus payments included in the Democrat phase four coronavirus bill. As the House prepared to vote on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) $3 trillion, 1,815-page phase coronavirus bill, the Heroes Act, Rep. Denver Riggleman (R-VA) offered a motion to recommit. Riggleman’s motion to recommit would offer an amendment to the coronavirus bill to prevent illegal immigrants from receiving stimulus payments in the Heroes Act. The House rejected the motion to recommit, with 198 votes in favor of the motion and 209 votes against the measure. Riggleman said that the bipartisan phase three bill, the CARES Act, stipulated that illegal immigrants and noncitizens could not get the $1,200 per person stimulus checks. The Democrat Heroes Act changes this mandate. Riggleman noted that among other “progressive agenda items hidden amongst these poison pills is a provision that would change the ID requirement in the CARES Act rebate checks from Social Security number to Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).” “This switch would allow illegal immigrants and noncitizens to get checks they aren’t eligible for,” Riggleman said. “I didn’t think that a global pandemic meant it was time to stop helping American citizens who are desperate for assistance.” “Now more than ever, we need to make sure that these rebate checks go to Americans who need it,” he added. Riggleman continued: It’s time that we stand up and show Americans that we can do our jobs in Congress. Be the responsible leaders Americans elected us to be, not partisan headline grabbers, or those who think messaging bills are more important than sensible legislation for all Americans. The authors of this bill do not intend it to become law, makes a mockery of our responsibility to govern. “Enough of the messaging bills, let’s stop playing politics and start working on solutions that will help the American people,” Riggleman charged.

There is no reason why Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D) should bar real estate agents from working during the pandemic, a protester said at a demonstration in Harrisburg on Friday. “I just want to know why we can pack ourselves into Lowe’s and to Walmart. We can pack here out in the fresh air, but I can’t show a home to two people that have the money. They’ve been pre-approved by the banks. Why can’t I do that?” said Whitney Lynch, a realtor with Gold Key Real Estate. “Give me a really logical reason and I’ll shut up, but there is no logical reason. No matter how you slice it,” she told Breitbart News. Pennsylvania was the only state where real estate had been shut down, which affected her business “100 percent,” Lynch explained, adding that, when her boss tried to reopen, the Democrat governor threatened to revoke his license. She continued: I think it’s crap. You’re starving me out. I worked really hard to pass my classes, pass my test. I was on a really good roll. The market’s really well right now, really good. I was able to sell three houses before the shutdown, but now I can’t do anything. I’m not even allowed in my office. Monday, Wolf outlined a list of potential “consequences” for counties and businesses that refuse to obey his lockdown orders and begin reopening, according to Breitbart News. “Businesses should know that opening in counties that don’t abide by the law will potentially jeopardize their business liability insurance or the protections it provides,” he warned. However, Wolf later admitted that he had not urged Pennsylvania’s attorney general to take any action. “No, I have not–nor do I intend to,” he commented. Also on Monday, leaders in Lebanon, Beaver, and Lancaster counties weighed the possibility of reopening on Friday along with 13 counties Wolf authorized to move from the red to yellow phase. Beaver County Board of Commissioners Daniel Camp III said Wednesday that the county planned to reopen following an outcry from residents. “Come this Friday, we plan on opening because we’ve been getting hundreds of emails, text messages and phone calls that these business owners are on the brink of closing down,” he stated.

The number of coronavirus hospitalizations, as well as the seven-day average of new deaths and cases, have remained reasonably stable in Texas since Gov. Greg Abbott (R) allowed the state’s stay-at-home order to expire on April 30 and began a phased reopening process for non-essential businesses. Texas’s single-day number of cases and fatalities have also remained relatively steady since the stay-at-home order ended. The Democrat-allied mainstream media continues to provide doomsday scenarios for states that reopen, claiming it is premature to do so now. Despite a significant increase in testing, however, Texas has not experienced a severe spike in cases, hospitalizations, or deaths linked to the illness caused by the coronavirus, COVID-19. The number of cases tends to increase with the availability of more tests as more people test positive, but that has not been the case in Texas. Analysts consider the number of hospitalizations to be an essential measure of the severity of the ongoing outbreak, mainly because a lack of testing has skewed other metrics. The seven day average of new deaths has also remained relatively stable and has not changed much since the day before reopening, data compiled by the New York Times showed on Friday. According to Worldometer, the 1,578 coronavirus cases per one million in Texas is about one-third of the national average of 4,477 per one million. The 45 deaths per one million Texans are more than 80 percent lower than the national average of 267 fatalities per one million. Two weeks after Abbott officially ended the shutdown in Texas there were thousands of hospital beds available as of Friday, data compiled by the Harvard Global Health Institute showed. COVID-19 patients only occupied three percent of the total number of beds as of Friday. That number has stayed stable over the last two weeks, reaching a maximum of 3.4 percent, data from Johns Hopkins University, and Harvard revealed. Abbott told Breitbart News on April 18 that Texas, the world’s 10th largest economy, is “the economic engine of America” and must reopen. The interview came a day after the governor had launched a series of executive orders to begin phasing in the immediate reopening of the Texan economy ahead of schedule. On April 27, Gov. Abbott announced that he was planning to allow the state’s stay-at-home order to expire on April 30 and let businesses to begin a phased reopening the following day. The governor did allow parks to reopen and elective medical procedures to resume in the days before lifting the shutdown order. On the day before reopening, about nine percent of the tests administered in Texas came out positive, according to the COVID Tracking Project. That positive rate dropped to seven percent on Friday and has remained stable, reaching no more than an estimated eight percent since Abbott lifted the Texas shutdown mandate. Texas’s current rate is half of the national average for people testing positive, which stands at about 14 percent. According to the New York Times, there were 1,233 single-day new cases on April 30, the day before reopening. The number of daily cases increased to 1,347 on May 14, with the figures fluctuating between those two days. However, the figures appear to have leveled off, data from the Times and Johns Hopkins revealed. Since the end of the lockdown, the daily cases have not exceeded the peak of 1,475 during the quarantine. Texas did experience its second and third highest number of daily cases after the end of the lockdown — on May 13 (1,473) and May 12 (1,360), but the figure dropped back down yesterday. According to the data compiled by the Times and Johns Hopkins, the number of daily deaths has also remained relatively the same without any significant spikes since April 30. That day, Texas experienced its deadliest day (52 fatalities) since the coronavirus pandemic began. Yesterday, the daily number of fatalities reached 51, the second deadliest day. The number of daily fatalities has fluctuated between the end of the shutdown and now. However, it has not exceeded the peak number of deaths on April 30. According to Worldometer, the number of tests per one million people in Texas, at 22,387, is lower than the national average of 33,281. In Texas, the cumulative number of cases (45,198), deaths (1,272), and tests (645,992) continue to go up, Johns Hopkins data showed as of Friday evening. Overall, however, the COVID-19 outbreak in Texas appears to be stable so far since the Abbott lifted the stay-at-home order.

Dr. Dimitri Christakis knows a thing or two about children as the director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at Seattle Children’s Research Institute, including the consequences of keeping children out of a school setting for an extended period of time because of the threat of coronavirus. His latest addition to the more than 170 original research articles published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Pediatrics has a stern warning about decisions made in the wake of the virus: ‘They will hold us accountable,” Christakis wrote.  The article, published this week in the Journal, said that it will be long after the pandemic that “historians, epidemiologists, psychologists, and economists will provide extensive explanations of the damage done, mistakes made, and lessons learned.” In the meantime, decisions must be made because they can have “considerable and lasting implications.” Christakis titled his article, “School Reopening—The Pandemic Issue That Is Not Getting Its Due:” The decision to close schools was among the first action that many states took to stave the impending pandemic and was based on a strong theoretical foundation. Children are typically at greatest risk of infectious diseases, and they transmit them to each other and their families with considerable speed. Many drew parallels to the 100-year-old influenza epidemic, in which it was true that children played a central role in transmission. But in the 6 to 8 weeks since most schools in the U.S. have closed, we have gathered new evidence about both children’s risks from the virus and their likelihood of transmitting it, as noted by Esposito and Principi in this issue of JAMA Pediatrics. We know only what we know today about the benefits and harms associated with school closure. However imperfect these data are, they must inform a critical decision that many states and school districts will be making in the very near future. Notably, even as states provisionally plan on opening workplaces, most are giving no consideration to opening schools. Many have already canceled the rest of the year, and all are now considering what to do in the fall. The risks posed by delaying school openings are real and sizeable, particularly for students from low-income families. The phenomenon of summer learning loss has been well established, with children losing a mean of 1 to 3 months in varying subjects. Some estimate that there will be a 9-month to 12-month loss when children return to school in the fall, and this will only be compounded if distance learning continues. No credible scientist, learning expert, teacher, or parent believes that children aged 5 to 10 years can meaningfully engage in online learning without considerable parental involvement, which many families with low incomes are unable to provide because parents must work outside the home. Christakis said that in addition to a coronavirus task force, the government should be “convene immediately” a school closure task force and include “epidemiologists, infectious disease experts, educational scientists, and child psychologists, among others.” “They should review the state of the evidence regarding horizontal transmission among children and their families, as well as what is known about the feasibility of distance learning and the psychological implications of children continuing to stay at home,” Christakis wrote. He added that the decisions should be “developmentally framed” because “kindergarten is not the same as high school or college.”  “Using all existing and emerging data—however incomplete—they should make their best-informed recommendations to help states make this crucial decision, based on science and not politics, as soon as possible,” Christakis wrote. “We owe this to our children. Years from now, when they reflect on the pandemic, they will hold us accountable.” Follow Penny Starr on Twitter

Venezuela’s socialist regime this week announced plans to investigate scientists who have raised doubts about the country’s official infection rate and the death toll from the Chinese coronavirus, which most analysts consider to be abnormally low. In a report published this month, Venezuela’s Academy of Physical, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences argued that the regime’s figures were inconsistent with the general trend of the pandemic and that the country could see as many as 4,000 cases daily cases as early as next month. As repeatedly reported by Breitbart News, Venezuela’s official number of coronavirus cases of 445 infections and just ten deaths is astonishingly low, not just given trends in other countries, but also considering the country’s deteriorated socialist healthcare system and the vulnerability of its poverty-stricken population. Public questioning of the regime’s official figures has caused anger among senior socialist party officials. Socialist Party Vice President and Nicolás Maduro’s right-hand man Diosdado Cabello confirmed his intention to investigate scientists’ findings, as the “numbers that they use are not supported.” “This needs to be investigated,” he said on his weekly propaganda show, Con el Mazo Dando (Hitting with the Mallet) on Wednesday, adding that there is not a “single piece of evidence” the regime is not properly testing people. Clearly disturbed by the announcement, the Academy released a statement on Thursday explaining the report’s conclusions that testing should be increased and that efforts to flatten the pandemic’s curve even with a nationwide lockdown are unrealistic. “It worries us as scientists, that we are harassed and marked for a technical report intended to improve management of the pandemic,” the statement added. “The report used a mathematical model that the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine developed earlier this year.” The concern was echoed by the Venezuelan National Assembly, the country’s last legitimate federal institution, which denounced the threats against the Academy. “Providing scientific facts in an unbiased way for the well-being of our people who are suffering the worst crisis in our history, is a heroic act that deserves to be recognized by all Venezuelans,” the Assembly said in a statement. As noted by Voice of America, Venezuela’s testing system has so far relied on rapid blood tests sent by communist China, which, after initially covering up the virus, has “donated” faulty medical equipment around the world. Very few of the more reliable tests recommended by the World Health Organization, known as polymerase chain reactions (PCR), have been used due to lack of access. Currently, Venezuela’s National Institute of Hygiene has a PCR testing capacity of just 100 samples a day, a fact that has likely contributed to the supposedly low infection rate.

A mom and daughter in Osceola County, Florida, are feeling grateful after they received some unexpected help recently. When schools shut down due to the coronavirus pandemic, substitute school teacher Jamie Austera was unsure how she would provide for herself and her 17-year-old daughter, Hope, according to News 6. Austera did not have a Florida teaching certificate, so her only option was to apply for unemployment benefits, which she said turned out to be a dead end. “I can’t get through unemployment (website) I just keep trying and trying. I even applied for food stamps, Medicaid, temporary cash, everything,” she explained. Since March, News 6 has featured single parents who lost their jobs due to the health crisis which inspired residents to step up. “Saw your piece on the substitute teacher, and making ends meet. Tell us how we can help!” one viewer wrote to reporter Mike Holfeld. “I felt so bad for my fellow co-worker, I would like to donate $100 to her,” said a teacher in the Osceola school district. Thanks to their response, the news station joined with Addition Financial and created a fund called Make Ends Meet designated especially for families in need. “We’re partnering with WKMG-TV because, when it comes to helping you make ends meet, you can count on us!” the financial company said. Wednesday, an anonymous donor contacted the station and gave Austera and her daughter $2,500 to help them through the pandemic. “Oh my God. That’s enough to pay my rent for almost 3 months,” Austera commented. “It’s just incredible,” Hope added, holding back tears. “I’m sorry I’m trying to keep it together. This will help us for weeks, months.” Following the outpouring of support from the community, Austera said she was touched and promised to do the same for someone else in the future. “We really appreciate it. We will not forget it and we will definitely pay it forward when we can,” she concluded.

Illsia Novotny of Denver received an unexpected windfall after a grateful customer left a massive tip on May 9. Novotny was not even scheduled to work at Floyd’s 99 barbershop at the University of Denver on Saturday, but now she is certainly glad she did. When a gentleman walked in for one of a host of badly needed post-pandemic haircuts, Novotny greeted him and chatted about their mutual love of the Chicago Cubs. The unnamed customer went to the counter to pay. As he left, he told Novotny “Just so you know, it’s not a mistake.” The stylist only had moments to be confused before her coworkers rushed her with the news: he had left her a $2,500 tip for the trim. And the good news just kept coming: $1,000 was left for the salon’s manager, $500 for the receptionist, and $100 for each of the salon’s 18 other staff members. “I cried,” Novotny said. “I’m a single mother. It’s been rough the last few months not knowing what’s going to happen, not knowing when we might reopen so I could go back to work.” After months spent trying to make arrangements for rent and utilities, Novotny was able to use the tip to pay for June in advance. Novotny expressed her gratitude — not only for the anonymous stranger’s good will, but the community’s support in general. “Coming back and having clients, even people you don’t know, show so much love, it felt great,” she said.

Pakistani police arrested at least nine people on Thursday after a mob of over a dozen people broke into and vandalized a Chinese coronavirus ward at a Karachi hospital. The attack occurred after a coronavirus patient treated there died and doctors refused to hand over his body to family, Pakistani newspaper Dawn reported. Authorities at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center (JPMC) in Karachi, Pakistan’s largest city, had denied the 60-year-old victim’s family access to the man after he was admitted as a patient in critical condition from the Chinese coronavirus days earlier. After the man passed away on Thursday, a large mob of people gathered outside the JPMC before forcing its way into the hospital and raiding the isolation ward, according to the report. The mob managed to locate and remove the victim’s body from the hospital wing, where 37 Chinese coronavirus patients are currently being treated. The group took the victim’s body outside of the medical facility before being stopped by local law enforcement. The police arrested at least nine people following the attack on the public hospital and returned the body to the ward. Authorities say no one was injured in the raid. “The mob broke the doors, glass windows, ceiling fans, tables, computers … everything they could lay their hands on,” JPMC Executive Director Dr. Seemin Jamali told Dawn. Photos taken of the isolation ward following the raid show the reception desk’s glass window was shattered by the mob; Jamali confirmed that a receptionist was on shift at the time of the attack. In addition to the receptionist, at least eight doctors, eight nurses, two hospital attendants, two janitors, and various security staff were present at the ward when the mob attacked, according to the newspaper. JPMC isolation ward attackThis is very disturbing that doctors who are taking care of everyone in this pandemic by risking their own life still they are not safe from people. Lack of PPEs and security can cause huge loss for everyone. @SindhuSorath @SindhuWarsha pic.twitter.com/7Dks9kX7DX — Raaj Khatri (@raaajkhatri) May 14, 2020  The hospital director explained to Dawn the strict protocol followed by health authorities following the death of a coronavirus patient already in isolation at the special coronavirus ward. “When a Covid-19 [Chinese coronavirus] patient dies, the hospital administration calls the district health officer, who arranges the ghusl [Islamic ritual purification] and burial with Edhi [Pakistani welfare organization] staff. They bury the body in a far-off graveyard,” Jamali said. The JPMC chief said that the hospital may need to relax the stringent measures to prevent future upsets. “I would suggest that we rethink this policy of not allowing the family to see the deceased. They are someone’s loved one. Give the family proper hazmat suits and let them wash the body and bury them,” she proposed. “I would just request people not to ransack hospitals like this. Doctors are risking their lives to save yours…[this is] an emotionally challenging time for everyone,” Dr. Jamali added. On May 9, Pakistan lifted its nationwide coronavirus lockdown, which started in late March. Prime Minister Imran Khan announced the lockdown’s end on the same day that Pakistan recorded its highest daily increase in new Chinese coronavirus cases. At the time, Pakistani doctors voiced concern that the action was premature and warned that the lifting of the lockdown amid a surge in coronavirus cases would cause the nation’s hospitals to be overwhelmed. “We are concerned about pressure that will come on the hospitals,” Salman Kazmi, Pakistan’s Young Doctors’ Association secretary, told journalists when Khan announced the end of Pakistan’s lockdown. “It will definitely lead to an increase in the number of cases, the number of critical cases,” he added. In March, hospitals in Karachi were inundated with hundreds of patients demonstrating “flu-like symptoms” who feared they had the Chinese coronavirus. In this instance as well, local doctors warned that Pakistan’s hospitals were not equipped with enough medical supplies and staff to properly treat and address the emerging coronavirus outbreak. Karachi doctors openly admitted to Dawn that the nation’s already “struggling healthcare system” was not equipped to take on a serious pandemic. At press time on Friday, Pakistan had recorded 37,218 infections and 803 deaths from the Chinese coronavirus, although regional Pakistani authorities believe the country’s true number of coronavirus cases to be higher than reported. They cite the national government’s failure to adequately test for coronavirus and quarantine thousands of Islamic pilgrims who returned to Pakistan from Iran in recent months.

Chinese state media ridiculed U.S. allegations of wrongdoing in the coronavirus pandemic in a spate of editorials on Thursday and Friday, mocking U.S. President Donald Trump as a baby throwing a temper tantrum and repeating the Communist Party’s standard line that all questions about China’s conduct are merely attempts by other nations to distract from their own purportedly inferior responses to the coronavirus. China’s Global Times claimed people around the world think Trump is “insane” for threatening to disengage economically from China in the wake of the pandemic. Their supporting quotes all came from Chinese Communist Party (CCP) apparatchiks and the article was brimming with the usual threats of retaliation for any action against the CCP’s interests: “Again! Trump is talking nonsense.” Trump seems to be losing his mind right now. Even he has such crazy ideas of cutting ties with China, US politicians, businessmen and Americans would not allow him to do so, Xin Qiang, deputy director of the Center for US Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times. He noted that Trump is bluffing and acting tough toward China to win more support. Fox News, which has been regarded as Trump’s defender and is notorious for a lack of professionalism, is also making eye-catching news to draw attention. Jin Canrong, the associate dean of Renmin University of China’s School of International Studies in Beijing, told the Global Times on Thursday that Trump made very irresponsible and emotional remarks in the interview. “The China-US relationship is the most important bilateral relationship in the world and involves huge interests of the two countries, as well as the rest of the world. Therefore, it is not something he can cut off emotionally,” Jin said.  “If the US unilaterally cuts off ties, the American people will pay a heavier price than us, because China’s domestic market is huge and 75-80 percent of Chinese manufacturers are supplying China’s market, and the 2 to 5 percent that supply the US can also be absorbed by the domestic market,” he noted. The threats advanced by the CCP through its Global Times included ominous warnings about invading Taiwan, as well as confident predictions that American consumers would suffer more than the CCP from disengagement, which sound very similar to the entirely incorrect predictions CCP mouthpieces made before the pre-coronavirus trade war: China has nothing to be afraid of as “in the past, we didn’t solve the Taiwan question because we wanted to maintain the China-US relationship, and if the US unilaterally cuts it off, we can just reunify Taiwan immediately since the Chinese mainland has an overwhelming advantage to solve this long-standing problem.” “Trump is like a giant baby on the brink of a meltdown as he faces tremendous pressure due to massive failures that caused such a high death toll,” Shen Yi, an expert from Fudan University, told the Global Times. “It’s like someone who wants to show his guts when he passes by a cemetery in midnight. He needs to shout to give himself the courage,” he said. Shen also noted that the American companies and industries would suffer the most severe consequences, because the supply chain has been integrated with China. “The Chinese public would only take such bluffing as a joke,” Shen said, adding that there has been no US president in the history who has made such a ridiculous statement against China, not even during the Cold War. Another Global Times piece on Friday repeated the CCP’s allegations that Trump is only blaming Beijing for the coronavirus because he wants to whip up anti-Chinese racist sentiment for the 2020 election: Trump is the first US president in the modern era to suggest the country “could cut off the whole relationship” with China. His remarks were considered exceptional, and even by hawkish politicians in Washington. US lawmakers have been notorious for making radical comments about China, while the president and his administration play the role of mediator. However, there seems to be an anti-China competition underway between the House of Representatives and the White House, and also between Republicans and Democrats. Such lunacy is a clear byproduct, first and foremost, of the proverbial anxiety that the US has suffered from since China began its global ascension.  It is also a combination of envy and panic on behalf of Washington elites who recognize the substantial gap between the US and China in how both countries responded to the pandemic. And finally, Trump’s threat is linked directly to the upcoming US presidential election this November. The Trump administration’s response to COVID-19 was weak and inefficient. It seems the White House strategy is to risk it all by passing the buck to China. Trump’s behavior is a desperate attempt to safeguard against the possibility that US public opinion could turn against him due to his lack of accountability. The Trump administration routinely expresses dissatisfaction with China and has suggested decoupling from the country on multiple occasions. As the US presidential election approaches, until then, it will be of no surprise to hear more absurd ideas from Trump and his team on how China should be treated. The People’s Daily on Friday claimed American investigations of the coronavirus are threatening the “international rule of law,” with a particular emphasis on the principle of sovereign immunity, which the CCP is heavily counting on to protect it from lawsuits for its deadly malfeasance in the coronavirus pandemic: The Charter of the United Nations (UN) stipulates the principle of sovereign equality. “Equals have no sovereignty over each other,” said the Roman law. The doctrine from ancient Rome has formed the basis of state immunity in the course of history and been supported by the judicial practice of the sovereign states nowadays. A sovereign state is thus exempt from the jurisdiction of foreign national courts, a right protected by the international law rather than a “gift” given by foreign government. It should also be noted that the estoppel principle of the international law requires countries to be consistent in applying the rules. As some U.S. politicians found no legal grounds for butting in China’s anti-pandemic attempts, they didn’t simply give up. To justify their accusations against China, they intend to amend the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of the U.S., a commitment of the country to sovereign immunity. Such a move will not only impair the logic and operation of the international law, but trigger global sovereign litigation, causing chaos in the international legal system and putting a strain on international relations. The People’s Daily also hammered another point that has quickly become popular in CCP writing, claiming the discovery of earlier cases of coronavirus cases than previously suspected means the virus could not possibly have originated in a Chinese laboratory and might not have come from Wuhan at all. The most extreme of these conspiracy theories, pushed hard by certain CCP officials until they sensed no one was buying it, holds that the virus was created in an American laboratory and was either accidentally or intentionally spread to Wuhan by the U.S. military. As usual with CCP propaganda, the People’s Daily deliberately conflated the notion of the virus escaping from a lab with the idea that it was an engineered bio-weapon, using arguments against the latter to supposedly debunk the former: With the further investigation and research into the virus, the pandemic turns out to happen much earlier than people thought in many countries. Experts from the World Health Organization (WHO) made it clear that the source of the virus couldn’t be determined yet. The joint statement of 27 well-known medical experts from 8 countries recently published on The Lancet and Nature, both authoritative journals in the world, and the reports released by professionals from America, Australia and Britain have also confirmed that the virus wasn’t man-made. Faced with such facts, some Americans have already become a laughingstock for their embarrassing and untenable accusations. Despite feeble arguments, some U.S. officials still refuse to halt the farce of trying to hold China responsible and claim damages. It is evident that they are plotting to politically blackmail China through the presumption of guilt. Early cases of the virus do not disprove the notion that it came from Wuhan, either because it escaped from a laboratory or because it jumped from animals to humans. The virus could be entirely “natural” in origins but could still have been accidentally released from a lab where it was being studied. The Chinese government consistently refuses to release data and samples that could firmly establish more about the origins of the pandemic. It has a proven track record of destroying evidence about the coronavirus and refusing to allow international investigators to perform their own examinations of the outbreak area. Long before Trump made his comments about breaking off America’s relationship with China, the CCP was using tariffs, import bans, and other forms of economic blackmail to intimidate other countries out of calling for investigations.

Catherine Callahan, a Pennsylvania resident attending the shutdown protest at the state’s capitol on Friday, said she is standing up against “Commie Tommy Tom Wolf,” telling Breitbart News that the governor is “trying to turn Pennsylvania into his own makeshift Stalinist Russia” and adding that they “won’t stand for it.” “I’m here protesting Commie Tommy Tom Wolf,” Callahan told Breitbart News. “I mean he’s a communist, and everything he has demonstrated for us today just proves that he is a communist,” she said, referencing Gov. Tom Wolf’s (D) recent threats to small business owners. “Threatening to take away licenses to open your business, your liquor licenses, et cetera. He is refusing to let people run their lives and feed their families,” Callahan stated. “This is America. This is not Stalinist Russia. But he is trying to turn Pennsylvania into his own makeshift Stalinist Russia, and we won’t stand for it.” Callahan added that she believes it is safe enough for people to return to work and said the choice to wear a mask should be left to the individual — not mandated by the governor. “And if you want to wear a mask, that should be your individual right and yours alone. When it comes from the government, that makes it unconstitutional,” she said. “I have the freedom to not wear a mask,” she added. “I am not sick. I don’t know anyone who is. I don’t know anyone who knows anyone who is.”

Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) said China deliberately exported the novel coronavirus to avoid being the only country facing economic devastation via viral epidemic. She offered her remarks on Friday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Daily in an interview with host Alex Marlow. “There is a preponderance of opinion that this pandemic — this virus — originated from Wuhan,” said Cheney. “It’s also without question — it cannot be challenged — that the government of China shut down travel from Wuhan into the rest of their country while they allowed travel from Wuhan into the rest of the world. That is without question, and that alone tells you [the Chinese government] knew that they had human-to-human transmission.” Cheney continued, “They knew it was so dangerous that they didn’t want it in the rest of their country, but yet they caused it to be exported to the rest of the world, and I think that they pretty clearly did that. I’m sure they understood the economic devastation this virus was going to cause, and I think they made a very clear, calculated decision that they didn’t want to be the only country having to face that devastation.” LISTEN:  Cheney went on, “There’s no question that they exported this virus. There’s also no question that they continue to hide the truth about it. They continue to refuse to allow the kind of investigation that we need to help speed up the development of a vaccine and other things.” Democrats dismissing political focus on China’s role in the coronavirus outbreak are negligent, assessed Cheney, highlighting Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) dismissal of President Donald Trump’s attention to China as a “distraction.” Cheney said, “The notion that somehow we should not hold China accountable is just complete malpractice from anybody who wants to be in a position of leadership in this country.” Cheney concluded, “The issue of China is going to be the most challenging, most difficult, [and] most threatening issue of our time.” Breitbart News Daily broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.

House Republican Conference chairwoman Liz Cheney (R-WY) told Breitbart News Daily that she’s confident that House Democrats are “mortified” by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) saying that President Donald Trump’s anti-China stance is merely a “diversion.” Pelosi claimed on Thursday that Trump’s recent antagonism toward China merely serves as a diversion from his coronavirus response. “What the president is saying about China is interesting — it’s an interesting diversion,” Pelosi said during a briefing on Thursday. Cheney said that it is a “disgrace” for Pelosi to diminish the role China’s failure to contain the coronavirus has had on the tens of thousands of Americans that have died during the coronavirus outbreak. Cheney told Breitbart News Daily host Alex Marlow, “The Democrats consistently and … their leader Nancy Pelosi particularly — demonstrate to the American people why they can’t be trusted to lead this country. When you’ve got close to 86,000 Americans who have died because of this global pandemic that was unleashed by the Chinese government, it is just a disgrace for the Speaker of the House to say [that] holding the government of China accountable is an ‘interesting diversion.'” “I am confident there are many members of her own caucus in the House who are mortified. I know I am mortified by her on a daily basis, but I am confident, mortified in particular by what she said yesterday, because the American people know that China needs to be held accountable,” she added. Cheney charged that Pelosi’s comments could have a devastating impact for vulnerable House Democrats during the 2020 congressional elections. “Anybody who’s running for reelection this time around as a Democrat is going to have to defend what Nancy Pelosi just said,” Cheney said. “They’re going to have to explain why in the House they voted for her to be Speaker of the House when she’s so clearly unfit.” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 6:00 A.M. to 9:00 A.M.

Brian Edwards was released from MultiCare Tacoma General Hospital on Thursday after a harrowing battle with the novel coronavirus. On April 19, Tacoma, Washington, nurse Tammy Edwards’ worst nightmare came true. After weeks of battling the COVID-19 pandemic, her husband Brian was rushed to Tacoma General. “It’s terrible. When he left, I knew I couldn’t go and be with him, so I sent his phone, knowing that that would probably be the only way I got to talk to him,” Edwards remembered. But despite long odds, Brian fought his way through. Eventually, he was out of the proverbial woods, and stable enough to leave the ICU. Earlier this month, he was transferred to Puyallup’s Good Samaritan Hospital to complete his recovery. Brian’s fellow Seahawks fans raised over $20,000 through “Fanz 4 Good” to help cover his medical bills and recovery, easing the burden on both him and his wife as they rest and regain their strength in the aftermath. Family, friends, and a host of other supporters — including the Tacoma Fire Department — showed up for a joyous welcome home. “Move over, Rocky!” one sign proclaimed, “Brian and Tammy are in the house!”

Hollywood actress Lori Petty — who has starred in Orange Is the New Black, Point Break, and the critically acclaimed Tank Girl — has insulted Americans across the board by claiming that they have low IQ’s. “I believe what we have forgotten is that the average IQ in Amurrrikkka is 99,” Petty tweeted on Friday. She said that a third of Americans, including President Donald Trump, have IQ’s lower than that. “A third, plus the murder-in-charge, I guess, lower than that. So, in the house I happily stay, besides kissing y’all.” Twitter/@loripetty It remains unclear what spurred Lori Petty’s acrimonious tweet, but the actress has been shaming quarantine protestors and people who choose not to wear masks in public. She called men who don’t wear masks “dicks.” “On my walk today 90% of women were wearing masks and 30% of men were,” the actress said this week. – yup….dicks. on my walk today 90% of women were wearing masks and 30% of men were. https://t.co/ICati8IQbX — loripetty (@loripetty) May 14, 2020  The A League of Their Own star also singled out people on Venice Beach who weren’t wearing masks. “Literally less than half of the people walking in Venice Beach are wearing masks. We need you to say it louder, please. xx,” Petty said to Los Angeles mayor Garcetti. – @MayorOfLA literally less than half of the people walking in Venice Beach are wearing masks. We need you to say it louder, please. xx pic.twitter.com/JUITfU5SXw — loripetty (@loripetty) May 15, 2020  Petty recently tweeted that that Republican lawmakers have become a “death squad” because of their continued support for President  Trump and his response to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. President Trump “is unfit, unable and DGAF [doesn’t give a fuck] about you or me or your family,” she wrote in March. “And the Republicans don’t understand if they got rid of him they’d be heroes to us, not the Death Squad they have become by supporting this murderer.” The actress later deleted the tweet.

Friday on MSNBC’s “Deadline,” network national affairs analyst John Heilemann called President Donald Trump an “idiot” and a “moron.” In a clip, Trump said, “Don’t forget, we have more cases than anybody in the world, but why? Because we do more testing. When you test, you have a case. When you test, you find something is wrong with people. If we didn’t do any testing, we would have very few cases. They don’t want to write that. It’s commonsense.” Heilemann said, “The man is an idiot. Can I just say it at the start? Listening to that sound, he’s just an idiot. He’s just a moron. The idea of the president of the United States stands up and says, ‘the problem with testing is that if we test, we have more cases.’ That’s what he said. If we test, we have more cases. You know what? The testing doesn’t make the cases. The testing reveals the cases. The number of cases out there is the number of cases out there. The testing helps us know how many there are. He literally believes that the problem with testing is that it’s somehow gives us more cases, and that’s bad. It’s bad for his politics. So just the sheer idiocy of his comments.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Residents from the Altagracia neighborhood in Caracas, Venezuela, ignored the ongoing lockdown measures and took to the streets on Thursday to demand the restoration of the water supply after nearly six weeks without service. The neighborhood, located meters away from the regime’s Ministry of Communication and Information, has experienced chronic water shortages and supply failure for the past 42 days, forcing residents to collect water from a local hydrant. While waiting for their supply, residents in Altagracia chanted the word “water” in protest at the government’s failure to resolve the issue.

Denuncian que no le quieren vender gasolina a civiles. Para la hora se mantienen cerrando el paso pic.twitter.com/Mg2XUVRb6F — Daniel Murolo (@dmurolo) April 9, 2020  According to the AFP agency, quoting several NGOs, failures in the water supply are currently affecting 60 percent of the Venezuelan population, with some receiving just a supply for one hour a week. The problem is one of a plethora of factors contributing to the country’s dire humanitarian crisis, worsened by the fact that the country remains in a nationwide lockdown that has further paralyzed its already failing economy. Venezuela is a country deemed especially vulnerable to the pandemic as a result of its economic collapse, with millions of people going malnourished and without living essentials such as medicine and hygiene products. The country’s hospitals are also hopelessly incapable of managing a serious pandemic, as they are also similarly suffering from chronic shortages of medical resources such as antibiotics and basic sanitary products. In 2017, the country’s leading national newspaper, El Nacional, described the situation in Venezuelan hospitals as a “health Holocaust.”  Despite the immense vulnerability of Venezuela to a global pandemic, the country’s socialist regime has reported only a minimal number of cases. According to official data, there have been 455 cases and ten deaths as a result of the pandemic, an astonishingly low number given its predicament. This week, Venezuelan scientists expressed fear of persecution at the hands of the regime over their questioning of the official figures and warnings that the worst of the pandemic may be yet to come. “It worries us as scientists, that we are harassed and targeted for a technical report intended to improve management of the pandemic,” Venezuela’s Academy of Physical, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences said in a statement following the publishing of a report warning of a further outbreak.

Speaking Friday to Spectrum News’s 1 SoCal podcast, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) urged black Americans to “keep your ass at home” to prevent the further spread of the Chinese coronavirus. (Listen from 7:24) Partial transcript is as follows:  ALEX COHEN: A big part of keeping everybody safe right now is these orders to stay safer at home. We’re coming up on two months of this and the weather is getting warm. I think it’s safe to say people are feeling cooped up and antsy. And you did an interview recently with The Grio and you were very explicit on this. REP. MAXINE WATERS: Some people may be offended by what I’m about to say, but this is aunty Maxine and she keeps herself permission to say what’s in her heart and I want black people, my people, to keep your ass at home, and don’t be out on the street. Don’t be socializing, because in the final analysis, you’ve got to take care of yourself. A lot of people out there don’t care about you.

A 108-year-old woman in Allendale, New Jersey, might be the oldest United States citizen to beat the coronavirus. When Sylvia Goldsholl tested positive for the virus at the Allendale Community for Senior Living in March, her family was understandably worried, according to NorthJersey.com. However, once caregivers moved her to the facility’s isolation wing, Goldsholl recovered just two weeks later. “I was determined to survive,” she said. Goldsholl has now lived through two pandemics, the first being the Spanish flu in 1918 when she was just a little girl. “The Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, the deadliest in history, infected an estimated 500 million people worldwide—about one-third of the planet’s population—and killed an estimated 20 million to 50 million victims, including some 675,000 Americans,” according to History.com. “At the time, there were no effective drugs or vaccines to treat this killer flu strain. Citizens were ordered to wear masks, schools, theaters and businesses were shuttered and bodies piled up in makeshift morgues before the virus ended its deadly global march,” the website stated. Goldsholl said her family was happy she recovered from her fight with the coronavirus so quickly. “They knew that I was a wonder. I met their expectations. I represented them in a very well way,” she explained. Although the senior citizen is a few months older than a 108-year-old man in New Mexico who also overcame the virus, a reportedly 113-year-old woman in Spain who recovered from the illness has her beat by just a few years. Thursday on Twitter, Gov. Phil Murphy recognized Goldsholl and wished her all the best. Sylvia Goldscholl is 108 years old. Last month, she tested positive for #COVID19 and has beaten it.  A tremendous life, a tremendous spirit, and a tremendous show of strength. So, to you, Sylvia, we send you all our best for many more years to come. pic.twitter.com/Wds6NCc1qj — Governor Phil Murphy (@GovMurphy) May 14, 2020  Friday, the senior living facility praised its beloved resident on Facebook for staying positive during the health crisis. “Sylvia’s story has now spread from New Jersey, across the country and the globe. She’s gone ‘viral’, in a way that spreads hope, not fear. God Bless You Sylvia!” the post read.

Friday on MSNBC’s “Deadline,” network political analyst Steve Schmidt, John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign manager, argued President Donald Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic is “just plain, old-fashioned imbecility, asininity, foolishness in the extreme.” Schmidt said, “We are in a state of accelerating degeneracy in this country. We’ve never been aa country so weak as we are now, so pitied by our friends around the world, so cheered on by our adversaries as we decline. There’s no other way to put it. The response has been insane, it’s asinine.” He added, “You know, Donald Trump has stepped back from the assertion of Americans values, the defense of democracy and liberty for years. And now, when we look at this virus, we see every day just plain, old-fashioned imbecility, asininity, foolishness in the extreme coming from the podium emblazoned with the Seal of the President of the United States. And this COVID-19 virus, this is the epicenter of it — the United States of America. There are more deaths. It’s the country where you have the greatest likelihood of dying from it in the future. Our response as a country has been an embarrassment, and this moment of American weakness will take a long time if we’re able to recover from it.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

A Pennsylvania resident attending Friday’s Reopen Pennsylvania protest at the state Capitol  said Gov. Tom Wolf (D) is acting “like a dictator” and added that he has treated the U.S. Constitution like “toilet paper” during the crisis. Kim Giambrone told Breitbart News that she came to the rally to express her grievances “peacefully” with Wolf. She tried to contact the governor through a variety of methods — writing, calling, and emailing — but has yet to receive a response. He is not answering her for the “same reason he’s not answering the representatives in the Pennsylvania House and Senate,” she told Breitbart News Washington Political Editor Matthew Boyle. “He’s acting like a dictator instead of an American-voted governor. For example, our colors are red, white, and blue. He thinks our colors are red, yellow, and green.” “Furthermore, I wash my hands of tyranny,” she continued, adding that “governors can only be tyrannical if people allow them.” “Do not allow your leaders to be tyrannical,” she urged her fellow Americans. Giambrone said Wolf “absolutely” needs to address the people and their concerns. “Because it’s we the people, not we the virus. All I hear is about what the virus is going to dictate. No. We the people dictate. And we the representatives of the people dictate. We don’t have one ultimate dictator at all. And there’s way more than six feet between Americans and their unalienable rights right now. That is not right. That is not constitutional,” she continued, telling Breitbart News that Wolf has used the U.S. Constitution like “toilet paper” during the crisis. “We’re no longer known for independence or constitution hall,” she said, holding a sign reading, “ No More Pennsylvania Pretzel Logic.” “They’re closed. Now we’re known for Pennsylvania pretzel logic. That’s embarrassing to the world.” She added that leaders cannot handle the crisis like a “socialist, communist country” and blasted Wolf’s behavior. “We have economic freedoms and liberties you are taking away and threatening to permanently take away now because of a virus,” she said. “That’s tyrannical.” “Telling people they can’t say goodbye to a loved one who is dying? That’s tyrannical,” she declared. “Telling me my job is not essential means activism is absolutely essential.”

Chinese National Health Commission official Liu Dengfeng admitted on Friday that his government did indeed destroy early samples of the Wuhan coronavirus, as has long been alleged by skeptics.  Liu claimed this was done to “prevent the risk to laboratory biological safety and prevent secondary disasters caused by unidentified pathogens.” The South China Morning Post (SCMP) noted that critics such as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have criticized the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) for refusing to provide samples to the international medical community when the Wuhan outbreak began in late 2019 and for destroying those samples. Liu insisted there was nothing nefarious about the destruction: “The remarks made by some US officials were taken out of context and intended to confuse,” [Liu] said at a briefing in Beijing. When the pneumonia-like illness was first reported in Wuhan, “national-level professional institutes” were working to identify the pathogen that was causing it, Liu said. “Based on comprehensive research and expert opinion, we decided to temporarily manage the pathogen causing the pneumonia as Class II – highly pathogenic – and imposed biosafety requirements on sample collection, transport and experimental activities, as well as destroying the samples,” he said. Liu added that this was in line with China’s standard practice for handling highly pathogenic samples, which should not be done by labs that do not meet the requirements. The SCMP quickly pointed out that Liu’s statements were not accurate since it has been established by earlier reports that major Chinese virus labs were ordered to destroy their samples after correctly identifying the mysterious new disease that emerged in December as a member of the SARS family. As the New York Post summarized in February: In late December, several genomics companies tested samples from sick patients in Wuhan — the center of the coronavirus outbreak — and noticed alarming similarities between their illnesses and the 2002 SARS virus, the Sunday Times of London reported, citing Chinese business news site Caixin Global. The researchers alerted Beijing of their findings — and on Jan. 3, received a gag order from China’s National Health Commission, with instructions to destroy the samples. Rather than hunkering down to contain the virus, Wuhan officials went ahead with their annual potluck dinner for 40,000 families. The alleged cover-up continued when representatives from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Jan. 8 visited Wuhan, where officials intentionally withheld information that hospital workers had been infected by patients — a telltale sign of contagion. News of the virus’ highly contagious nature didn’t surface publicly until Jan. 20. Wuhan was locked down and a mass quarantine ordered three days later. In early May, a leaked Western intelligence document described Chinese laboratories deliberately destroying evidence that the coronavirus could be transmitted between humans, including virus samples, during the early weeks of the outbreak when the CCP was eager to conceal that dangerous information. The document described China’s actions as an “insult to international transparency.” The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) reportedly produced an analysis at roughly the same time that said China wanted to keep the rest of the world from knowing how contagious the coronavirus was because Chinese companies were frantically buying up medical supplies and protective gear from other countries, and would have encountered difficulty making those bulk purchases if the other countries understood how rapidly the virus could spread. The SCMP reported that Chinese National Health Commission officials on Friday also denied multiple statements by World Health Organization (W.H.O.) officials that they have been refused access to Wuhan and its virology institute, the lab frequently discussed as a possible source of the outbreak. “The W.H.O. has never made a request to visit a certain laboratory, so the statement that the WHO was denied a visit to the Wuhan laboratory is untrue,” said senior Chinese official Li Mingzhu. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Tuesday that the CCP is still stalling investigations into Wuhan, its notorious virus-spreading “wet markets,” and the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Eyewitnesses in China confirmed they gathered data and physical evidence from Wuhan in December that is still hidden from the world by the Chinese government, despite its constant claims of transparency and cooperation. The Chinese National Health Commission pointedly refused to answer the WSJ’s questions about this evidence, responding with CCP political boilerplate about how “the virus should not be linked to any particular country, region, or people” and all nations should “join forces and work together, rather than blaming each other and shirking responsibility.” The WSJ also noted that despite China’s denials that it has stymied W.H.O. investigations, W.H.O. officials confirmed that investigative data long promised by China still has not been delivered to the organization, and China is indeed still thwarting efforts by international investigators to visit the outbreak area in Wuhan.

President Donald Trump on Friday delivered a speech at the White House highlighting the actions of heroic American citizens during the coronavirus pandemic. The president and his staff continue to talk about the fight against the coronavirus and the effort to reopening the economy safely after lockdowns to slow the spread of the virus.

New York Democrats remain silent on Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s (D) original decision to put coronavirus patients in New York nursing homes. Cuomo instituted a controversial order in March to force nursing homes — with elderly patients who are especially vulnerable to the coronavirus — to take infected coronavirus patients from hospitals. Facing backlash from the order, as well as rising deaths in many nursing homes across the state, the Democrat governor reversed the mandate. Cuomo’s new order mandates that hospitals can only send patients to nursing homes if they have tested negative for the coronavirus. The Wall Street Journal reported that New York’s death rate related to nursing homes rose to 5,398, which serves as a significant part of New York’s total death rate. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, New York has the highest rate of coronavirus-related deaths in nursing homes in the nation. Republicans and Democrats, state lawmakers, and public health officials lambasted the order. Ron Kim, a Democrat state assemblyman whose Queens district has experienced many nursing home deaths, said, “The state has failed to protect the lives of the most vulnerable members of our community. The fact we maintained and pushed COVID-positive patients into facilities that were not equipped to handle them, it was a fatal error.” Richard Gottfried, a Democrat state assemblyman who chairs the state health committee, called for an investigation into the government’s handling of the nursing home issue. “A tough look at nursing homes and how we regulate them has been needed for decades. The Covid-19 situation has made it much more obvious and much more deadly,” Gottfried said. Breitbart News contacted New York’s congressional delegation to see what it thought of Cuomo’s original decision to force nursing homes to host coronavirus patients. All Democrats, in the House and the Senate, did not respond to Breitbart News’s request for comment. The following New York Democrats did not respond to the request for comment: Rep. Tom Reed (R-NY), the cochair of the House Problem Solvers caucus, called for an investigation into Cuomo’s controversial order. “The Governor’s uncertain and contradictory orders to nursing homes over the course of this crisis have been concerning. It is clear these orders have put the lives of our most susceptible population in harm’s way. An investigation is needed to ensure this never happens again,” Reed told Breitbart News in an exclusive comment. The New York Republican continued, contending that the governor’s revised order will put even more elderly in New York in harm’s way. “Basing public health decisions off of optics, as the Governor’s latest orders do, will only create unintended consequences and ultimately put even more members of our vulnerable elderly community in jeopardy,” Reed said. “We recently called on the Dept. of Health and Human Services to review the impact of the Governor’s reactionary directives and look forward to seeing policies put in place that ensure our seniors are safe, and any related consequences to the restarting of our hospital’s surgical services and the reopening of our economies are prevented.” Sean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News.

Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) announced at a press conference on Friday that gyms and fitness centers may reopen in the Sunshine State beginning Monday. “Today, we are going to move into, effective Monday, into a full phase one,” the governor said in Jacksonville. “I think that this is appropriate given the progress that Florida has made.” Effective Monday, gyms and fitness centers will be able to operate as individuals continue to “respect social distancing capacity.” The governor also placed an emphasis on the sanitization of machines and surfaces after use, which he noted should be happening anyway. “This is a respiratory virus that tends to attack people who have health problems or are not in good physical condition. So don’t we want people to stay in shape?” he added. Additionally, the governor said that restaurants and retail stores will be able to operate at a 50 percent capacity beginning Monday. Parks, he added, may submit reopening plans to the state. That will bring Florida into phase one, DeSantis said, noting that he is not yet prepared to reintroduce movie theaters. The governor, during the presser, explained that his administration has focused on protecting the most vulnerable, which he said was their “number one” priority from the beginning. The bulk of coronavirus fatalities are linked to nursing homes in most states, he stated, attributing that, in part, to bad policy choices. “We very early recognized this,” DeSantis said, noting that his administration required screenings for employees and vendors entering personal care facilities, required them to wear masks and gloves, and implemented restricted visitation on March 15.

Friday on ABC’s “The View,” co-host Whoopi Goldberg clashed with former Gov. Chris Christie (R-NJ) in an explosive debate over reopening the U.S. economy amid the coronavirus pandemic. Goldberg asked, “You upset a lot of people last week by saying the country needs to reopen because people are going to die no matter what. You compared it to lives lost during World War II, calling it a sacrifice for the American way of life. I’m asking since you’re suggesting that I sacrifice, who are you sacrificing? Who are you willing to give up in your family?” Christie shot back, “It’s a false choice, Whoopi. That’s what people who don’t understand what’s going on here say.” Goldberg said, “Who are you willing to sacrifice to die, Chris? You’re saying people should be willing to sacrifice family to die. Who are you willing to give up?” Christie said, “Whoopi, that’s not what I said. What I said was, lives are going to be lost inevitably in this, no matter what we do.” Goldberg pressed. “So you didn’t say some Americans have to make the ultimate sacrifice? You did not say that?” Christie said, “No. Listen, I said some Americans will make that sacrifice no matter what we do. Now we have to decide how we’re going to balance this. The balance is that there are people who are standing on food bank lines, people who are losing their homes, people who are losing their livelihood, which is leading to depression, which is leading to suicide, which is leading to addiction, which is leading to domestic violence. I saw all these things after Hurricane Sandy when people lost their homes and their livelihoods. These things happen. I said we have to balance. I also said businesses should only open at 50% capacity. People should be wearing masks. Temperatures need to be taken for people going into businesses. If we wait around for a vaccine before we open our country, we will lose hundreds of thousands of lives who are being destroyed by the epidemic’s cure as we’re doing it now. We have to balance the two. That’s what I was saying. All we’re hearing is that we have to remain shut-in. It’s destroying the economy and, as a result, people’s lives and their hope.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Appearing Friday on CNN, the network’s chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, said he is”nervous” about the United States reopening as it combats the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, saying that the issue is not being taken seriously.  A partial transcript is as follows:  JOHN BERMAN: People are actually getting sick because’s there’s a virus out there. We’re finding out it because their’s testing and as you test more, you learn about new cases, but 86,000 people haven’t been killed because we’re testing too much. […] DR. SANJAY GUPTA: No doubt. You test in order to save lives, because you can find people, who have the infection, you can isolate them and keep them from spreading this virus which we know kills people. It’s as simple as that. We don’t have a vaccine, we don’t have a super-effective therapeutic right now. We wish we did and we will one day, but I think the big question is in the interim: what do we do? What have we seen work in the past in the history of the world? What have we seen in other countries around the world right now? It’s all predicated on testing and I know you sound like a broken record after a while saying that. Yeah, we have gotten better at testing. We started way late. It makes a huge difference when you start way late because there were so many more cases that spilled out into the community as a result of waiting that late. I don’t know if we can catch up right now, but the fact is we need to do more testing. […] Again, going back to Georgia and other states, they’re opening up, but go talk to people and say how comfortable do you feel? I know we show images of people crowding bars and stuff like that, but how about moms and dads at home with their kids thinking ‘do I go out? How safe is it? Could I bring that virus home? That’s still a concern. If they could get tested and have some degree of confidence then that would make their lives a lot easier. We’re not there yet. We released guidelines yesterday that say we want to promote hand hygiene in schools, we want to wear masks as feasible, We’re not taking this seriously anymore and we’re still in the middle of it. People are declaring victory. The original draft guidelines had specifics in terms of how many tests should be on standby at businesses, how employers should make sure their employees are safe and keep their customers safe. What happened to that? We’re not taking this seriously anymore. I’m nervous. I know I’m the one truppeting the horn and I’m going to get a lot of hate mail about it but we’re not out of this by any means.

Christian groups in Pakistan accused the country’s Muslim leadership of denying religious minorities pivotal economic aid to survive the ongoing lockdown to contain the Chinese coronavirus, the Christian website Aleteia reported on Thursday. Pakistan is a Sunni Muslim-majority country with sizable Ahmadi Muslim, Christian, and Hindu minorities. Christians often come from lower castes that Muslims, relegated to poverty and arduous labor such as cleaning sewers and running kilns. Prime Minister Imran Khan declared a nationwide lockdown on March 22 to limit the spread of the Chinese coronavirus, fueling a pandemic affecting nearly every country on earth. The lockdown – widely ignored by Sunni Muslims attending mosques to observe the holy month of Ramadan – is set to end on Saturday. Khan vowed significant government aid to those no longer able to work during the lockdown. In remarks to the Christian organization Aid to the Church in Need, Cecil Shane Chaudhry, the executive director of a Catholic organization called the National Commission for Justice and Peace, said Christians were systematically excluded from receiving aid. Mosques, which have become distribution centers for food and other needs, have explicitly discouraged hungry Christians from availing themselves of the aid. Chaudhry identified an imam at a mosque in Lahore issuing an announcement explicitly stating, “There will be a ration distribution tomorrow morning for needy people but only for Muslims.” The organization head noted the policy is especially lamentable given that Christians and other religious minorities are disproportionately more likely to be impoverished. “Mr. Chaudhry gave reports of how Christians in a village near Lahore on Raiwind Road had been denied food aid and how, in a separate incident, about 100 Christian families were excluded from food distribution in Sandha Kalan village, in the Punjab’s Kasur district,” Aid to the Church in Need noted. “Although plans are being worked on, for now we do not know of [any initiatives to include] religious minority members to ensure their needs are not ignored,” Chowdhry added. Aid groups and monitor organizations have warned that Pakistan discriminates against religious minorities regarding the distribution of coronavirus aid throughout the ongoing lockdown. In April, the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) issued a statement demanding Islamabad address the humanitarian needs of the nation’s religious minorities. The commission declared itself “troubled” by the reports and urged Prime Minister Khan to “ensure that food aid from distributing organizations is shared equally with Hindus, Christians, and other religions minorities.” Some Muslims are also reportedly using the aid to attempt to force Christians to convert to Sunni Islam: In another incident involving the same organization, Christians were denied food rations. A video circulating on Facebook shows a Muslim man, named Adnan, informing a news reporter that Christians have been barred from receiving food in Karachi’s Korangi area. According to a report, a cleric named Abid Qadri, who ostensibly heads SWT’s operation in Korangi, instructed workers to give rations to Muslims only. In another video, a Christian woman confirmed that an organization, which she didn’t name, refused to give food to Christians until they recite the kalima, a declaration of Islamic faith. In late April, Pakistani police opened an investigation into the presumed suicide of a Christian woman, who witnesses said decided to end her life after being refused humanitarian aid. “Mariam Masih, a mother of three and wife of Tariq Masih, was found hanging from a ceiling fan at her house, according to a Christian rights lawyer,” a Union of Catholic Asian News (UCA) report detailed. “Rahat Austin wrote on Twitter that her starving family had been denied food distributed by the government and NGOs because they were non-Muslims.” UCA cited several examples of denial of humanitarian aid to Christians: “On April 5, more than 100 Christian families from Punjab’s Kasur district were reportedly excluded from food aid distributed by a village committee comprising Muslims. In another incident, Christians were denied food on April 2 in a village near Lahore.” Christians have told aid groups attempting to address the lack of support that they have faced significant challenges in finding food and financial resources. “Some Muslims have felt, ‘I’m doing this out of my responsibility as a Muslim. This is really intended for my fellow Muslims. For me to get the religious merit that is associated with giving to the poor, those funds should go to Muslims since it was given by a Muslim with that intent,'” a Christian man identified as Jonathon told Mission Network News. “The lockdown had me very frightened, I did not know how I could pay my rent or utility bills which my daily work enabled me to cover. I knew finding food was going to be hard but trusted God for provision – know I can drop this worry and focus on resolving other financial matters on a full belly,” Jameela Bibi, an elder woman who lost her source of income as a domestic worker during the lockdown, told the British Asian Christian Association (BACA). Bibi is among those that BACA has been able to feed with expanded efforts during the lockdown. Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.

Rory McIlroy says he wouldn’t play golf again with President Donald Trump and doubts he would even be invited after questioning his leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic. McIlroy did an hour-plus interview for the McKellar Journal podcast in which he was asked whether he regretted the February 2017 round with Trump because of criticism on social media. “I haven’t done it since … out of choice,” McIlroy said. McIlroy, the No. 1 player in the world, said three years ago he played with Trump out of respect for the office. He said on the podcast he enjoyed his day at Trump International in West Palm Beach, Florida. He says Trump was charismatic, personable and treated everyone well, from the the players in the group to the workers in the cart barn. “So I will sit here and say that day I had with him I enjoyed,” McIlroy said. “But that doesn’t mean I agree with everything — or, in fact, anything — that he says.” McIlroy continued, unprompted, by saying Trump has tried to politicize the pandemic, using as an example Trump claiming the U.S. has administered the most tests for the new coronavirus than any other nation. “Like it’s a contest,” McIlroy said. “There’s some stuff that just is terrible. It’s not the way a leader should act. There is a bit of diplomacy that you need to show, and I just don’t think he’s showing that, especially in these times.” The hosts, Scottish golf journalists Lawrence Donegan and John Huggan, asked McIlroy if he would play with Trump again. “I don’t know if he’d want to play with me again after what I just said,” McIlroy said. “I know it’s very self-serving of me to say ‘No,’ and if I don’t, then it means I’m not putting myself in position to be under scrutiny and that I’m avoiding that. “But no, I wouldn’t.” McIlroy returns to television on Sunday by teaming with Dustin Johnson in a Skins match against Rickie Fowler and Matthew Wolff, an exhibition designed to raise upward of $4 million for COVID-19 relief funds.

The show must go on. Florida is set to host the country’s first drive-in music festival. “The Road Rave” promises “a ​full festival main stage production” headlined by DJ Carnage, according to a report by Consequence os Sound. The outlet added that Carnage is calling The Road Rave “North America’s first-ever drive-in festival of the COVID era.” But the concept of drive-in events have become more popular due to the deadly Chinese coronavirus pandemic. EDM producer Marc Rebillet has set a seven-date drive-in tour. Meanwhile, the Texas Rangers plan to host several country music shows in the parking lot of their stadium. Country star Keith Urban put on a live performance at the Stardust Drive-In movie theater, about 40 miles east of Nashville, Tennessee, Thursday night for a crowd of more than 200 medical workers from Vanderbilt Health. Danish singer and songwriter Mads Langer preforms at a sold-out drive-in concert at Tangkrogen in Aarhus, Denmark on April 24, 2020. (MIKKEL BERG PEDERSEN/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images) As for The Road Rave, the date is set for June 6 at The Central Florida Fairgrounds in Orlando, Florida. Along with Carnage, the event will also feature artists Riot Ten, Blunts & Blondes, Nitti Gritti, and Gravedgr. The music festival will have a 500-car limit capacity with a minimum of six people per vehicle. The report added that food and beverages will be available via food truck and roaming golf carts, and that while people will remain in their vehicles for the event, face masks are still “heavily encouraged to be worn at all times,” and “social distancing will be heavily enforced with strict guidelines and restrictions on when attendees are allowed to safely leave their vehicle.” A portion of the ticket proceeds will go to a coronavirus relief fund dedicated to assisting vulnerable communities affected by the disease in Nicaragua.

UFC President Dana White blasted a New York Times writer during his post-fight press conference in Jacksonville. White took a stick to the “paper of record” for its criticism of the UFC’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. White has been champing at the bit to re-start his business despite the many different lockdowns across the world, and he is plainly increasingly fed up with the media’s attacks. White was asked about the  Times’  coverage in particular, and their criticism of how the UFC enforced their coronavirus protocols. White’s response was proof that he has had it. “Fuck that guy,” White said without naming the particular reporter. “Fuck that guy. You know what happened with that guy? That guy, who has never covered the sport ever before, was writing a story about Endeavor and then the UFC was one of the Endeavour, you know… and what do you think happened when this guy who, and this paper, who covered the UFC when they never covered it before? What do you think happened? The fucking story was huge. It did killer traffic. Now they’re writing stories, three a week, and their posting live results. I don’t give a shit what that guy thinks, what he has to say, or what he writes. Good for him! He’s pulling good traffic.” White also interrupted a second question about the press coverage. “I don’t give a fuck,” he said, shutting the question down flat. Dana White off the top rope on @nytimes. Enjoy: pic.twitter.com/IGifkDZbYr — Clay Travis (@ClayTravis) May 14, 2020  White was referring to an article by Times writer Kevin Draper who chastised the UFC for having “spotty” enforcement of its own coronavirus social distancing policies.

White House Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said Friday morning in an interview he believed Americans were ready to jump back into the marketplace and boost the economy as coronavirus lockdowns were loosening. “You know, there’s a sense out there, kind of a spirit culturally, you’d call it a weltanschauung, people want to come out,” Kudlow said in an interview with Fox Business host Stuart Varney. Kudlow said that the virus growth rates and infection curves were flattening and that Americans were growing more positive about leaving their homes and returning to the marketplace. “They’re ready to go, they want to be safe, we want them to be very safe, but I think the spirit of it is, ‘Let’s get going,'” he said. “And Americans are ready to move.” Kudlow, however, said that the economy was still in a “free fall” and predicted terrible economic numbers in the second quarter. But he said there were “glimmers” of economic hope such as improvements among homebuilding, trucking, and shipping. He proposed payroll tax cuts, capital gains tax cuts, and even floated the idea of lowering corporate rates for American companies returning to the United States. “I do think the country’s opening up,” he said. “I think the country is really listening to President Trump’s leadership and that’s an awfully good thing, let’s go.”

President Donald Trump said at the Rose Garden press conference on Friday that the United States will continue working speedily to develop a coronavirus vaccine but that it was time to reopen the country. “I just want to make something clear: it’s very important, vaccine or no vaccine, we’re back,” Trump said. The president recalled that America successfully went through the Spanish flu in 1913 and built an immunity to the virus. “You fight through it, and people sometimes, I guess we don’t know exactly yet, but it looks like you become immune, at least for a short while and maybe for life,” Trump said. The president also said the virus will go away eventually. “It’ll go away at some point. It will go away. It may flare up, and it may not flare up. We’ll have to see what happens, but if it doesn’t flare up, we’ll have to put out the fire,” he said. Trump said Dr. Moncef Slaoui will continue to lead the Operation Warp Speed task force with Dr. Anthony Fauci. “We’re looking for a full vaccine for everyone that wants to get it,” Trump said. “Not everyone wants to get it.” The president did not wear a mask at the Rose Garden press conference. Neither did Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar and Defense Secretary Mark Esper. Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx did wear masks. “I’ve been tested, we’ve all been tested, and we’re quite a distance away. We’re outdoors, so I told them, I gave them the option, they can wear it or not,” Trump said when CNN asked why everyone was not wearing a mask at the event. “So you can blame it on me. … I gave them the option.” Dr. Slaoui expressed optimism that the United States would be able to deliver millions of doses of the coronavirus vaccine by the end of 2020. Trump said there is “no ego” in vaccine development across the world, and even if another country developed the first vaccine, America would mobilize quickly to distribute it. The president also spoke about mobilizing the military to prepare to distribute therapeutics and diagnostics as well as a vaccine when it is available. “When a vaccine is ready, the United States government will deploy every plane, truck, and soldier required to help distribute it to the American people as quickly as possible,” he said.

Nigerian Health Minister Osagie Ehanire told reporters on Thursday to stop asking where visiting Chinese medical experts are or what they are doing. Many Nigerians are suspicious of the 15-member Chinese team, which ostensibly came to help combat the Wuhan coronavirus. The Premium Times of Nigeria described Ehanire as “exasperated” by questions about the Chinese medics during a press conference by the coronavirus task force. He stated the Chinese personnel “are not guests of the federal government, but CCECC, a construction company.” CCECC is the China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation, which stated in April that it was bringing in a team from China to help establish coronavirus testing centers, in part because the company wished to protect its investments in Nigeria.  Many Nigerians responded with skepticism to the announcement, doubting that any medical technicians sent by China could be truly independent of the Communist regime, and accusing CCECC of donating medical services to distract from corruption scandals involving Nigerian officials. Ehanire said the Chinese medics would be “providing technical support to Nigeria in its fight against COVID-19” and sharing their experience with how China “curtailed the spread of the virus,” but grew visibly frustrated when reporters asked about the location and current activities of the Chinese team. “I want to explain that first of all, I think not all of them are doctors and I heard that some of them are technicians but they are staff of CCECC,” he said. “The ministry of health is not their host, so we cannot always explain what happened to them or where they are,” he continued. Ehanire remarked that “there seems to be a lot of interest in these doctors,” but insisted they are the “staff of a company,” not official consultants for the Nigerian government. “I would be very happy if you do not ask me where they are,” he told reporters. “They are not really our guests in that sense but we have been able to learn some things from them. We shared ideas of what they did in their country in managing COVID-19.” The Chinese Communist Party has been quite eager to promote the activities of the team sent to Nigeria. China Civil Engineering Construction Corp helped Nigeria convert a local opera house into the largest makeshift hospital in its capital city of Abuja. The makeshift hospital, put into operation on Tue, has 283 beds, including 4 #ICU beds, and can be expanded to 500 beds in future pic.twitter.com/Bko0wrCHo8 — Global Times (@globaltimesnews) May 13, 2020  The Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) issued a press release in April saying it “vehemently rejected the invitation of Chinese doctors into the country in the guise of offering assistance,” arguing that the government undermined and embarrassed the NMA and its members by accepting CCECC’s assistance without consulting them, and expressing fears that Chinese visitors could spread more coronavirus infections through Nigeria.  The NMA also found it offensive that the government would import doctors from China when Nigeria had such a “large pool of general medical and specialist practitioners who are either unemployed or underemployed that could be engaged.” The Nigerian government’s coronavirus task force responded to these complaints by assuring the NMA that the visiting Chinese personnel were “public health experts,” not doctors, promising to quarantine them for 14 days on arrival, and promising they would have no contact with Nigerian coronavirus patients.

Hungary’s anti-mass migration, national conservative government may be among the first to hand back its emergency coronavirus powers, despite leftist claims its premier planned to rule “indefinitely” over the EU’s first “dictatorship”. “Prime Minister [Viktor] Orbán, speaking at a press conference in Belgrade following his meeting with Serbian president [Aleksandar] Vučić, said ‪that the government’s power to take extraordinary measures under the Coronavirus Protection Act will likely be given back to parliament at the end of May,” a Hungarian government spokesman told Breitbart London. After that happened, the Prime Minister will “give everyone a chance to apologize to Hungary for the unfair charges,'” he added, referring to repeated claims the emergency powers were actually an extraordinary power-grab by the government. Many countries around the world have taken emergency powers to curb civil liberties and circumvent the usual legislative process in order to respond to the Chinese pandemic, but the Hungarian government was “singled out for criticism” by the EU’s leading men and left-liberal commentators and likened to Adolf Hitler’s regime — while very similar or even harsher measures taken by globalist leaders such as France’s Emmanuel Macron passed largely unremarked. Hungary: Extraordinary Coronavirus Measures are Used Everywhere, But Only We Are Singled Out For Criticism https://t.co/ROeMQUPJGm — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 3, 2020  “Critics have claimed that the Orbán government was exploiting the coronavirus crisis to impose a dictatorship where parliament was suspended and the Prime Minister would rule by decree indefinitely,” the spokesman who spoke to Breitbart London recalled. “This [move to give up the emergency powers] is proof that the charges had no basis in fact and were politically motivated,” he continued, adding that, in fact, “parliament was never suspended, the emergency measures are limited to fighting the pandemic, and…  the constitution itself guaranteed that they would last only for a limited time.” “Now, the prime minister himself has clearly said they will come to an end soon,” he concluded. The Hungarian government’s supporters and sympathisers have argued that the uniquely critical commentary on its coronavirus measures — which came in spite of the EU ruling that they were legal — is motivated, as claimed above, by political considerations; namely its leading role opposing mass immigration and multiculturalism, the compulsory redistribution of migrants invited to Germany by Angela Merkel in 2015 across Europe, and the “Soros Network” of pro-migration civil society NGOs. “We are in the middle of a pandemic, and Hungary has been one of the most successful countries in defending against it,” Prime Minister Orbán said in a recent interview. “What is really worrying is that the bureaucrats in Brussels, who are paid by us, are busy attacking one of the most successful countries [against the pandemic] instead of helping the people,” he added. Absolutely admire the quality of the insults being laid down by Orban to rival politicians: "He is the type of man who comes to [a party where a pig is killed and cooked] only in time for dinner and when he buys furniture, he needs help to assemble it" https://t.co/nROykNiqFC — Oliver JJ Lane (@oliver_lane) May 15, 2020 

Critics accused Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) of bungling his response to the coronavirus pandemic as it descended upon the Sunshine State, but after weeks of scrutiny, the Florida governor’s response is standing as a national model, as the state — which boasts more than 21 million residents — outshines its blue state counterparts. DeSantis faced mounting pressure from politicians and media pundits, who warned that he waited too long to formally close his state. The governor, recognizing the unique profile of Florida, which varies vastly from region to region, largely allowed localities to determine their course of action. Critics hit him hard. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) accused President Trump of “conveying an epic level of negligence and incompetence that is costing human lives” and threw DeSantis into the mix. “And it’s not just Trump,” she said last month. “It is not just Trump. Look at DeSantis in Florida, who’s just calling for lockdowns today and Florida beaches have been packed.” While DeSantis formally issued a stay-at-home order on April 1, that order occurred after he had already taken aggressive action against travelers from coronavirus hotspots, such as New Orleans and the New York Tri-State area. He imposed screenings at high traffic airports — which proved to be successful —  and checkpoints along the Florida-Georgia border and Florida-Alabama border. He also issued a 14-day quarantine for individuals entering Florida from virus hotspots. After weeks of intense media scrutiny, Florida is outshining its blue state counterparts as DeSantis’s highly criticized coronavirus response proves to be right. This becomes even more evident when Florida is compared to a state like New York, whose governor the establishment media have heaped praise upon throughout the pandemic. Florida — which tends to have an older, more vulnerable population — had 42,038 confirmed cases of the virus and 1,875 related deaths as of Friday morning. That represents a fraction of a percent of the 21 million-plus residents in the state. New York, with a population of over 19 million — over 8 million in New York City alone— has seen an excess of 343,000 confirmed cases of the virus and 22,170 deaths, despite the implementation of draconian lockdown orders. “You look at some of the most draconian orders that have been issued in some of these states and compare Florida in terms of our hospitalizations per 100,000, in terms of our fatalities per 100,000,” DeSantis said during an April 28 meeting with the president. “I mean you go from D.C., Maryland, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, Illinois, you name it; Florida’s done better,” he continued, stressing that his remarks were not to be taken as a criticism of other states. “But everyone in the media was saying Florida was going to be like New York or Italy, and that has not happened because we understood we have a big, diverse state,” he continued, defending his tailored approach. “We understood the outbreak was not uniform throughout the state, and we had a tailored and measured approach that not only helped our numbers be way below what anyone predicted, but also did less damage to our state going forward,” he said. “I had construction going on, the road projects. We did it in a safe way, and we did it. I think, in a way that is probably more sustainable over the long term. So I think people can go back and look at all the criticism and then look now,” he added, noting that hospitals never came near capacity, nor did the state run low on ventilators. “We’ve had people in the hospital, but I’m now in a situation where I have less than 500 people in a state of 22 million on ventilators as of last night,” he said during the April 28 meeting. Even the left-leaning Politico admitted that the Florida governor’s fine-tuned approach proved to be successful. “First, let’s just come out and say it: DeSantis looks more right than those who criticized the Sunshine State’s coronavirus response,” the authors, Marc Caputo and Renuka Rayasam, noted: According to the latest Florida figures, fewer than 2,000 have died, and around 43,000 have been infected. That’s a fraction of the dire predictions made for Florida when spring breakers swarmed the beaches, and those numbers are dwarfed by similarly sized New York, which has seen 12 times more deaths and nearly eight times more infections. (Check out POLITICO’s coronavirus tracker for more.) More people reportedly died in New York nursing homes than in all of Florida. The authors even recognized what could be contributing to the polling disparity between the governors, as DeSantis appears to be faring worse than Cuomo. “But most of the difference between DeSantis and Cuomo is due to politics. DeSantis governs a politically divided state. Cuomo is a scion of Democratic royalty in a deeply Democratic state,” Politico reported, also pointing out the media’s devotion to Cuomo — a perk the Florida governor does not tend to have: Cuomo also has something else DeSantis doesn’t: a press that defers to him, one that preferred to cover “Florida Morons” at the beach (where it’s relatively hard to get infected) over New Yorkers riding cramped subway cars (where it’s easy to get infected). In fact, people can still ride the subways for most hours of the day in New York, but Miami Beach’s sands remain closed. Maybe things would be different if DeSantis had a brother who worked in cable news and interviewed him for a “sweet moment” in primetime. DeSantis has continued to hold the media accountable for the doomsday scenarios that never came to fruition. Hungry critics, again, went after the governor because he allowed localities to make their own decisions, leading to Duval County’s move to reopen its beaches. It sparked a firestorm among out-of-state media outlets. “I think apologies can be sent to the city of Jacksonville, attention Mayor [Lenny] Curry,” DeSantis said in early May. “You may want to CC the mayors of Neptune Beach, Jacksonville Beach, and Atlantic Beach. But I won’t hold my breath on that happening.” “The facts are that since this has happened, hospitalizations, ICU, rate of positivity, [patients on] ventilators — that has all declined. Those people were wrong and the folks in Duval County behaved appropriately,” he added. DeSantis recently assembled a coronavirus task force designed to guide his administration in reopening the Florida economy. Most of Florida entered the first phase on May 4, loosening restrictions on restaurants and retail capacity. He also announced that hair and nail salons may reopen, albeit with certain restrictions. On Thursday, DeSantis announced the approval of a request for Miami-Dade and Broward counties — which the virus hit particularly hard, accounting for nearly 50 percent of the state’s positive cases — to enter the first phase of reopening: Today we take an important step for South Florida. Thanks to our collaboration with local leaders including @MayorGimenez, @HolnessD9 and @mayorbermudez, I have signed an executive order granting requests from Miami-Dade and Broward to move them into Phase 1. #SafeSmartStepbyStep pic.twitter.com/uOswDnIT3R — Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) May 14, 2020  DeSantis has also attributed the state’s success to his administration’s emphasis on protecting the most vulnerable — older individuals residing in nursing homes. “Florida’s approach was to avoid introducing the disease into long-term care facilities,” he said on Wednesday. “We drew a firm red line.” The same cannot be said for blue states, New York and Pennsylvania, for example, which initially instructed nursing homes and personal care facilities to accept stable patients who had contracted the virus. The action has proven dire, particularly in Pennsylvania, as nearly 70 percent of virus deaths in the Keystone State stem from nursing homes and personal care facilities. “Florida prioritized support for long-term care facilities,” DeSantis said this week. “We took swift action to protect residents, including prohibiting COVID-positive patients from being sent back to facilities where they could infect others”: Florida prioritized support for long-term care facilities. We took swift action to protect residents, including prohibiting COVID-positive patients from being sent back to facilities where they could infect others. Thanks to CEO @SteveBahmer & @LeadingAgeFL for the partnership. pic.twitter.com/7a82nW72Ge — Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) May 13, 2020  Despite continual warnings from leftist politicians and establishment media outlets demanding more draconian measures akin to the approaches ushered in and embraced by blue state governors, DeSantis is standing firm and continually reminding critics of their failed predictions. “Clearly those doomsday predictions were not realized,” DeSantis said on Thursday. “Our hospitals actually had more capacity six weeks into the pandemic than they did before the pandemic began.” “Total COVID-positive patients in the ICU since we undertook phase one has decreased by 21%. … There were 340 people on ventilators prior to us starting phase one,” he added. “There are now 232 as of last night.”

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo finds himself engulfed in scandal as a growing number of Democrats join state Republicans in demanding an independent investigation into his controversial policies and how questionable actions may might have contributed to the catastrophic outbreak of coronavirus in New York nursing homes. More details have emerged in recent days raising major questions about potentially fatal decisions made under Cuomo’s watch as the death toll in New York’s nursing homes swells to over 5300 and continues to climb. The center of the storm surrounds a controversial March 25 directive prohibiting nursing homes from testing recovering hospital patients prior to intake. This while Cuomo’s aides reportedly quietly worked to shield nursing homes from lawsuits due to coronavirus following lobbying by industry representatives. The March 25 executive order in question stated, “[nursing homes] are prohibited from requiring a hospitalized resident who is determined medically stable to be tested for COVID-19 prior to admission or readmission.” Last week, New York suddenly disclosed more than 1,700 previously unreported deaths at nursing homes and adult care facilities. An Associate Press tally put the number of nursing home virus deaths at over 5300.  Elderly care fatalities in New York have reportedly been on the rise by an average of 20 to 25 deaths per day for several weeks. Cuomo is under more scrutiny after the New York Times revealed that his aides “quietly inserted a provision on Page 347 of New York’s final, voluminous budget bill” that provided what the newspaper characterized as “unusual legal protections” for nursing home operators. The measure, which followed intensive lobbying efforts by nursing home representatives, protected elderly care facilities from lawsuits in the event that they are accused of failing to protect residents from coronavirus. The legislation was included inside a budget that was approved by the State Legislature on April 2. In other words, after an executive order seemingly ensuring that nursing homes can continue to be filled with clients by barring testing for incoming residents, Cuomo’s aides reportedly quietly shielded those same homes from many lawsuits arising from coronavirus outbreaks. Amid the ensuing outcry, Cuomo established an inquiry under the auspices of his own health department as well as the office of New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat. That led to Republicans calling for an independent probe. Now some Democrats are joining the Republican chorus demanding an independent investigation. New York Assemblyman Ron Kim, a Democrat, savaged Cuomo on Twitter: The governor’s flip-flopping policies on nursing homes must be held accountable. First, they tried to keep the virus out by denying access. Then they tell unprepared facilities to take in #COVID19 patients. Now they are back to keeping the virus out again https://t.co/swqwUWINVk — Ron T. Kim (@rontkim) May 12, 2020  The profit-driven nursing home model was already broken way before this pandemic and everyone knew this, including @NYStateofHealth  So why would you send #COVID19 patients back to these under-equipped facilities? This was arguably the deadliest decision in American history. — Ron T. Kim (@rontkim) May 12, 2020  “It’s fine to have the Health Department and the attorney general looking at what individual nursing homes are doing. But there needs to be a professional review of not only the industry as a whole but what the Department of Health has been doing, both leading up to this situation and in the midst of this situation,” said New York Assemblyman Richard Gottfried, a Democrat. “Certainly, it would be wrong for the Department of Health to be charged with examining itself.” “The attorney general should bring in outside counsel,” said Gottfried. State Sen. Gustavo Rivera, a Democrat from the Bronx, said the State Legislature should investigate. “I strongly believe that the Legislature is one of the key entities that should look into this issue, which has devastated so many families across our state,” said Rivera, chairman of the Senate Health Committee. “It is imperative to hold public hearings as soon as possible to get to the bottom of what truly happened at our state’s nursing homes as the COVID-19 pandemic developed.” The massive number of dead prompted Cuomo earlier this week to issue a series of new regulations, including requiring staff at all nursing homes to take two virus tests per week. He also said that hospitals can no longer send coronavirus patients to nursing homes. “We’re just not going to send a person who is positive to a nursing home after hospital visit. Period. If there’s any issue, the resident must be referred to the department of health which will find alternative care,” Cuomo further explained on Sunday. An aide to Cuomo claimed the announcement was not a reversal, insisting instead it was a new policy based on the increased availability of testing and more hospital space.

White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow on Friday’s “Varney & Company” on Fox Business Network suggested “incentive-oriented torque” to restimulate the economy, which has been devastated by the coronavirus pandemic. Kudlow argued the United States is not going to spend its way out of the deficit caused by the coronavirus but floated the idea of lowering the corporate tax rate by 50% for to bring companies back home. “I want to see incentive-oriented torque for this economy,” Kudlow advised. He added, “To do that, Stu, we’re not going to spend our way out of that any more than we spent our way out of the [Great] Depression — although this is not like the Depression, this is about a virus, not about bad economic policies — but I’m just saying this: things like payroll taxes to boost take-home pay for workers, things like capital gains taxes — not just for the stock market by the way on cap gains, but we’ve got assets that have fallen 30-40%.” “Or, for example,” Kudlow continued, “we’ve learned that the offshoring should be turned into onshoring. We cannot rely as extensively as we have in the past with respect to overseas countries, including China, which still has to be held accountable. So, maybe — this is a maybe — maybe the corporate tax rate of 21% should be lowered by 50% to about 10.5% for corporations who are coming back home. Maybe that’s something to look at.” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent

Barbers and haircutters will be protesting on the capitol lawn in Michigan on Wednesday, saying they want to go back to work safely. “Operation Haircut” will take place from noon to 3:00 p.m., organizers said. “Michigan’s small business owners are patriotic and law abiding citizens, but enough is enough.  Our Governor’s actions show every day that this is no longer about the China virus. Her actions show this is now about a progressive radical agenda,” Marian Sheridan, a cofounder of the Michigan Conservative Coalition, said in a news release. “Dope shops are open, abortion mills churn on, but barber shops are, somehow, unsafe.  Show us that ‘science’ Governor!” The protest comes as Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Attorney General Dana Nessel have targeted 77-year-old Owosso barber Karl Manke, who reopened his shop after being denied unemployment. Whitmer declared barbers, salons, and hair services “nonessential” in her orders and barred them from reopening. Manke was stripped of his operating license without a hearing after Nessel failed to obtained a temporary restraining order against him. “We want him to discontinue his conduct, which we think is aiding and abetting the spread of the virus,” Nessel claimed in an interview. “Mr. Manke,” she sighed, “He’s not a hero, he’s not a patriot. A patriot is a person that fights all enemies, foreign and domestic, and does everything possible to protect his fellow countrymen and countrywomen.” “To me, Mr. Manke is doing just the opposite of that and he’s being selfish in his behavior,” the attorney general declared. “Citizens are tired of being treated like babies,” Meshawn Maddock, chair of the 11th District Republican Committee, said in the MCC release. “As adults, we know what needs to be done to stay safe.  Any citizen has the right to participate, or not participate, in Operation Haircut. Lansing elites love to tell everyone else how to live. That is not freedom. Citizens are fed up. Join us in Lansing on May 20. Get a free haircut and then let’s get Michigan back to work, before it is too late.” Organizers said volunteer haircutters will have chairs and safe equipment to provide “basic” haircuts, and are encouraging protesters to “comply with social distancing and other safe practices, such as face coverings.” Breitbart News is scheduled to report live from the event.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) is expected to announce Friday that gyms in parts of the state may reopen during the coronavirus pandemic. “I think if you do sanitation, first of all, this is a virus that if you’re in good shape, you’re probably gonna be okay. So why would we want to dissuade people from going to be in shape?” the governor said Thursday during a press briefing in Doral. DeSantis continued: So we’ll have an announcement on that tomorrow, but I think it’s really important that people have access to gym and to different exercise. The data on this is overwhelming. If you look in some of these jurisdictions, under 65 it’s like, 90 plus percent of the folks under 65 that have had fatalities have had serious conditions and many of that has been tied to obesity. So, let’s tell people to get out, do those things. That’s one of the reasons why I always promoted outdoor activity. A lot of people said ‘Oh my gosh, how could you have people golf or do this or do that.’ The fact of the matter is outdoors is our friend. You know, getting out and doing things there. The transmission is much more efficient in enclosed environments. So Florida has nice weather, We should take advantage of that. We’ve had golf courses running outside of southeast Florida the whole time. The villages, the retirement community in central Florida, they had like, record tee sheets. There’s zero people from the villages in that UF hospital in the villages right now. So clearly, you can be active and be safe. There’s no problem doing that. But we’re going to have an announcement tomorrow that’s gonna encompass the gyms. At the press briefing, the governor granted Broward and Miami-Dade counties’ requests to reopen after they prepared guidelines to begin the process as soon as Monday, according to Breitbart News. “Today, we take another important step for a very important part of the state of Florida. Some of our absolute best economic engines are in communities throughout South Florida,” DeSantis noted. Also on Thursday, Politico said the Republican governor “looks more right than those who criticized the Sunshine State’s coronavirus response,” adding that media bias was one reason he was polling worse than New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D). “Cuomo also has something else DeSantis doesn’t: a press that defers to him, one that preferred to cover ‘Florida Morons’ at the beach (where it’s relatively hard to get infected) over New Yorkers riding cramped subway cars (where it’s easy to get infected),” the bulletin concluded.

Germany is in recession, its economy having contracted by over two per cent in the first quarter of 2020, the impact of the coronavirus pandemic following years of flatlining performance. While nations worldwide are expected to take a significant beating over sanitary lockdowns throttling economies, some entered the crisis in worse condition than others, such as Germany which teetered at the edge of recession at the start of 2020. Now the Federal Statistics Office reveals the economy shrank 2.2 per cent in the first quarter the biggest three-month decline in over a decade. Germany officially went into lockdown in mid-March, towards the end of the first quarter, suggesting the next quarterly figures could show a much larger downturn. UK Economy: 13 Quarters of Growth Since EU Referendum… beating Germany, Eurozone https://t.co/mCKDJNa04a — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 12, 2019  The Associated Press reports other recent figures from a tighter period towards the end of the quarter showing perhaps more clearly the impact of the coronavirus shutdown. Factory orders fell 15.6 per cent in March, and industrial production fell 9.2 per cent, while exports fell 11.8 per cent. A similar fate is befalling the wider Eurozone, Swedish Radio reports, citing new figures from the European Union’s own Eurostat body which noted a 3.8 per cent decline in the first quarter, the largest since the EU started collecting such figures in the early 1990s. The hardest hit by Eurostat’s reckoning is France, which has had a significant 5.8 per cent wiped off its GDP this past quarter. Faring the best of the foremost nations of Europe is the United Kingdom, whose GDP was recorded by Eurostat to have fallen by two per cent. But clearly, not all nations entered the coronavirus age from the same position, nor locked down their economies to an equal degree. Sweden has taken the bold approach of barely enacting any lockdowns at all and saw a contraction of just 0.3 per cent, but their reported death toll from the virus is 100 people per million higher than the United States according to one count, for instance. As Breitbart London reported last year, the United Kingdom had run 13 consecutive quarters of growth since voting to leave the European Union in 2016. In the same timeframe, Germany was suffering economic stagnation and was sliding into what economists called a technical recession. By February of this year — long before the impacts of coronavirus had been felt in Europe — Germany’s economy was said to have “ground to a halt” in the emerging slump.

STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) — NBC’s on-air personalities are taking a pay cut through the rest of the year because of the coronavirus pandemic. NBC Sports Group President Pete Bevacqua said in a statement that the pay cuts are voluntary. “Our on-air personalities reached out to see how they could contribute to helping our company during this difficult time … It’s another reminder of the truly great team we have at NBC Sports and how we’re all working together to get through this immense challenge,” Bevacqua said. The pay cuts range from 5% to 10%. NBCUniversal executives are taking 20% pay cuts and those making more than $100,000 are seeing a 3% salary reduction. The NBC salary reductions are part of an industry trend. Last month, ESPN and Fox asked much of their top on-air talent to take 15% pay cuts through July.

The Chinese state newspaper Global Times cited “Chinese military experts” on Thursday urging Beijing to join hands with the government of Russia and demand an international probe into American biological laboratories, an effort to fuel the Communist Party conspiracy theory that the U.S. Army caused the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. The article suggested the use of international agencies like the United Nations Security Council to pressure America into giving inspectors approved by the Chinese Communist Party access to sensitive scientific sites. It is the first major proposition in English-language Chinese government media to implement measures to prove the theory the Chinese Foreign Ministry has spent months cultivating that a U.S. Army laboratory in Fort Detrick, Maryland, is the true origin of the Chinese coronavirus. The article does not specifically link demands to allow Russian and Chinese inspections of American military facilities to the coronavirus pandemic, but appears to be a response to calls from Washington for an impartial investigation into the activity at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a top biological research facility believed to be engaged in coronavirus research at the time the outbreak began. “In order to hide the fact that the U.S. is researching on biological weapons, the U.S. will not respond to an international query on its bio-labs, Chinese military experts said, adding that China and Russia could initiate an investigation of bio-labs worldwide at the UN to pressure the US,” the Global Times claimed on Thursday. The newspaper cited “Chinese analysts,” state-approved voices to echo the Communist Party agenda, who claimed, “China and Russia can initiate an international investigation of all P3 and P4 labs worldwide, including the ones run by the U.S., at the U.N. Security Council, and U.S. antiwar groups and media can also pressure Washington to be transparent on the question of its bio-labs.” One such “expert,” identified as an official at Beijing’s Renmin University, claimed that demands from China and Russia for access to American weapons research were “reasonable” and “totally different from the groundless accusations and conspiracy theories about the origin of COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus disease] made by some U.S. congressmen and politicians.” The Global Times also claimed “observers” believe that a joint Chinese-Russian effort to investigate the American military “will embarrass Washington,” as it would attract global support. The propaganda newspaper did not corroborate why the “observers” believe so. One anonymous Chinese “military expert” added that investigating the U.S. military is important because of the use of “chemical and biological weapons since the Cold War.” The Chinese Foreign Ministry did not discuss the issue during its daily press briefing on Friday. The briefing, however, was led by spokesman Zhao Lijian, the first senior Chinese Communist Party official to float the conspiracy theory that the coronavirus originated in America. Beijing has elevated Zhao’s profile since he speculated on Twitter in March, “it might be the U.S. Army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan.” Shortly after Zhao’s tweet, the Global Times identified the Maryland Army facility, which is reportedly no longer open, as the possible origin of the virus. The Chinese coronavirus pandemic originated in Wuhan, central China. The first documented cases of infection by this particular coronavirus in history were confirmed in Wuhan in November 2019, according to leaked Chinese government documents. There is no evidence of any presence of Chinese coronavirus in Maryland until months later, when travel from China and Europe, which experienced an earlier outbreak than America due to its commercial ties with China, created an epidemic in the United States. In response to the lack of evidence of any coronavirus cases in the United States until months after the outbreak occurred in Wuhan, the Chinese Foreign Ministry has attempted to attribute an illness triggered by e-cigarette use, or vaping, to the Chinese coronavirus – yet none of the vaping illness cases were found to be contagious. “The safety of biolabs in the US now poses the biggest risk to the U.S. regulatory authority,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a briefing last week. “There are also reports that soon after the closure [of the Fort Detrick laboratory], ‘E-cigarette disease’ broke out in the surroundings.” Hua was referring to a condition the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has dubbed “EVALI,” a respiratory illness that doctors have identified in people who have used vapes. There is no evidence that any patient diagnosed with EVALI has infected another person with the same disease – unlike the Chinese coronavirus, which is highly contagious and believed to spread through air droplets. Doctors do not quarantine EVALI patients. Hua did not note the suspected connection between EVALI and counterfeit e-cigarette products manufactured in China. Beijing officials began to accuse America of causing the pandemic after suspicions arose that the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a top bioweapons lab in the outbreak’s origin city, may have played a role in the outbreak. The Wuhan laboratory is believed to have been studying highly contagious coronaviruses at the time that cases of viral respiratory infections began appearing in Wuhan hospitals. Chinese officials initially claimed the outbreak originated at a Wuhan “wet market,” an open-air area where anyone can sell animal carcasses for consumption. The Communist Party then denied that this was the case and began accusing Washington of playing a role. The Global Times appears to have included Russia in its call for a probe into the unsubstantiated Maryland conspiracy theory in response to that government’s officials discouraging any investigation into China and offering Beijing support. The propaganda outlet noted that Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov attacked Washington this week for opposing a Russian- and Chinese-led effort to inspect and approve of American military development. Moscow has particularly objected to American military facilities in nearby post-Soviet states. “For almost 20 years, Russia and most other countries, including China, have been calling for a protocol on the convention that would establish a mechanism to verify and check states’ commitment not to create biological weapons. The U.S. stands almost alone against this initiative,” the Global Times quoted Lavrov as saying. Lavrov objected to calls for sanctions on China in remarks Friday. “There is the need to find the specific causes of the emergence of this virus and understand why the process of its person-to-person transmission has begun and so on,” Lavrov said, according to the Russian news agency TASS, arguing that antagonizing China would hurt this effort. “Eventually, this will be important for developing an antidote and will help secure ourselves against this threat, instead of talking that the virus emerged on a marketplace in China and that is why it is necessary to impose sanctions against that country.”

I’m not really sure what Twitch is, but I do know this — Blake Snell will wish he was never on it. He said on the social gaming site what a lot of Major League Baseball players are probably thinking. Like him, they’re anxious about risking their health by returning to play and not happy they have to take a pay cut to do so. But after a rant as ill-advised as it was tone-deaf, Snell is now the poster child for spoiled millionaire ballplayers everywhere. And, really, let’s face it. He deserves all the vitriol coming his way. “I’m not playing unless I get mine,” Snell proclaimed, saying he would sit out any resumed season if his $7 million pay is cut too much. He said other things, too, but his main point seemed to be that even a pandemic shouldn’t spoil the riches he so richly deserves. “I’m not splitting no revenue. I want all mine,” the 2018 Cy Young winner for Tampa Bay said. “Bro, y’all got to understand, too, because y’all going to be like: ‘Bro, play for the love of the game. Man, what’s wrong with you, bro? Money should not be a thing.’ Bro, I’m risking my life. What do you mean, ‘It should not be a thing?’ It 100% should be a thing.” Well, maybe not 100%, but let’s try and cut the 27-year-old Snell some slack. Maybe he’s been playing video games so much he hasn’t had time to pick up a newspaper or watch the news on TV.
He might not have seen the headlines that 36.5 million Americans have filed for unemployment in the last eight weeks, or the poll that shows 46% without jobs are worried they will not have enough food to make it through the end of the month. And maybe he didn’t peek into his bank account and notice that $286,500 has already been deposited there for this season without throwing a pitch. He’s also scheduled to get $43,210 for each game — yes, each game — of the schedule should the season resume. No, it’s not the $7 million he signed up for. But that was silly money even before the virus began spreading across the country. The bottom line is there’s going to be a new reality when sports resume and the real costs of the pandemic become known. Guarantees that players had in the past aren’t as solid anymore and it’s anyone’s guess how it all plays out economically. Without fans in the stand, MLB signaled this week it wants to split revenues with players on an 82-game season as a way of reducing the risk of big losses. That idea was essentially branded a non-starter by the players’ union, which has always been quick to dig its heels in whenever the golden goose seemed threatened. The revenue split may not fly as presented, and that’s fine. There might be better ideas that make financial sense for both the leagues and the players — and they should both feel the pain equally. But what Snell and the players’ union don’t seem to get is that they’ll have to compromise in some way if there is to be any hope of a season this year. What they also don’t seem to get is no one wants to hear any complaining about having to take smaller paychecks to make it happen. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker made that point this week, saying that while players have a right to bargain he’s disappointed they’re holding out for “very, very high salaries and payments during a time when I think everybody is sacrificing.” Pritzker walked back his comments a day later, saying players have a right to protect their health and safety. They do, and they should have an option to sit out the season with no penalty — and no pay — if they feel threatened by playing while the virus is still active. But Snell seemed to attach a price tag to his comfort level, saying he shouldn’t have to take a risk at the same time he’s taking a pay cut. And that’s just wrong, especially coming from a player who is due $39 million guaranteed over the next three years once baseball comes back. That’s money ICU nurses can never hope to make as they go about saving lives every day. It’s money not even imaginable to grocery store clerks who risk being infected every time they go to work just so we can all eat.
Go ahead, sit the season out or play if you want. But don’t whine about having to make sacrifices to do it. America is hurting too much right now to listen.

Lower prices, lower interest rates, and government aid boosted consumer sentiment in the first weeks of May, creating an unexpected rise in the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index. The index rose to 73.7 for May,  up from 71.8 in April. Economists had expected a further decline to 65. “The CARES relief checks improved consumers’ finances and widespread price discounting boosted their buying attitudes,” Richard Curtin, chief economist for the survey, said in a statement. One unexpected result from the May survey: a sharp move upward in inflation expectations. It may be that consumers seeing falling prices now and reading about a burgeoning government deficit think that prices will move higher when the economy reopens. The public’s view current economic conditions improved in May, pushing the indexes gauge of this to 83 from 74.3 in April. Consumers’ outlook for the future weakened to a six year low of 67/7 from 70.1. The survey also asked consumers to identify their top concerns about the pandemic. Those citing finances as their top concern fell to 17 percent in May from 22 percent in April, the opposite of what many expected would happen as widespread shutdowns continued and a testament to the effectiveness of the Trump administration’s programs aimed at sustaining employment. It’s also a promising sign that the economy may recover more swiftly than some grim forecasts predict. “Surprisingly, it was greater concerns about social isolation that increased, cited as the top concern by 21 percent in May up from 14 percent in April. While these shifts were quite small, they indicate the growing costs of social isolation and its potential to shift opinions about reopening the economy,” Curtin said in a statement. Health remains the top concern, with 57 percent of Americans citing it as the biggest pandemic worry. But that’s a decrease from 61 percent in April, an indication that health concerns are lifting a bit. The government reported earlier Friday that April saw the biggest drop ever for retail sales. The bounce in consumer sentiment may indicate that sales could rebound in May.

The USNS Mercy, a 1,000-bed hospital ship sent to Los Angeles to help take pressure off hospitals — which officials predicted would be overrun by Chinese coronavirus patients — is departing on Friday after treating just 77 patients. The USNS Mercy has been docked at Los Angeles Harbor since March 27, arriving just as the peak of the pandemic approached. Like the USNS Comfort, the ship was originally slated to lessen the impact on hospitals by taking on non-coronavirus patients, thereby freeing up beds in nearby hospitals anticipating a surge in coronavirus cases. The 1,000-bed hospital came fully prepared with 800 crew members “12 fully-equipped operating rooms, laboratories, a pharmacy, [and] radiological equipment … becoming the largest hospital in the city,” KTLA reported. Nonetheless, the doomsday predications never came to fruition. The Mercy ended up treating just 77 patients, according to U.S. 3rd Fleet spokesman Cmdr. John Fage. USNI News added the treatments “ranged from basic medical and surgical care to trauma care.” The last patient was discharged May 5. “However, Los Angeles hasn’t been overrun with virus cases, and so the Mercy didn’t play a huge role as a safety net,” the AP reported. “As of the end of April, the Mercy had treated a few dozen non-coronavirus patients for everything from heart and lung conditions to gastrointestinal problems,” the outlet added: “Having successfully decompressed the health care delivery system in the Los Angeles region,” the Mercy will return to its home port in San Diego, said a statement by the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services. Cal OES Director Mark Ghilarducci stated: Our work to protect public health and safety is far from done but having the Mercy and its highly-trained medical personnel stationed in the most populous region of the state was critical to our ability to respond in the first stages of the pandemic. Similarly, the USNS Comfort, the 1,000-bed hospital ship that spent a month docked at Manhattan’s Pier 90, departed April 30 after treating just 182 patients. The ship remained on standby to lessen the load on hospitals by treating non-coronavirus patients but later modified its policy, designating 500 beds to coronavirus patients in the U.S. hotspot of the Chinese virus. Despite that, the ship never came close to reaching capacity. Other areas of the country are telling similar stories — preparing for a surge that never came. A 250-bed field hospital set up by the Army in Seattle’s CenturyLink Field Event Center, for example, shut down in April after just three days. It never saw a single patient. Gov. Jay Inslee (D) said they requested the hospital “before our physical distancing strategies were fully implemented and we had considerable concerns that our hospitals would be overloaded with Covid-19 cases.” The McCormick Place field hospital in Chicago, Illinois, is also gradually reducing its presence, taking down half of its 1,000 hospital beds as medical centers in the region did not reach capacity. “State and city officials are winding down the alternate care facility they set up at McCormick Place, saying the extra space to treat patients is not needed now that the growth of COVID-19 is slowing in Illinois,” the Chicago Tribune reported.

CINCINNATI (AP) — The Reds are laying off less than 25% of their staff and reducing pay for others on June 1 in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Cincinnati made the announcement on its website Thursday. The Miami Marlins will temporarily furlough 90 to 100 baseball operations employees beginning June 1, a person familiar with the decision said a day earlier. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the Marlins didn’t comment publicly. Commissioner Rob Manfred cleared the way this month for teams to lay off or reduce the pay of managers, coaches and trainers at both the major league and minor league levels. Full-time scouts, also are covered by Uniform Employee Contracts, could be involved in cutbacks. Manfred’s move was a response to the season put on hold because of the pandemic. Cincinnati was among the majority of teams that committed to paying full-time employees through May. Other teams had different pay arrangements for staff.

HOUSTON (AP) — Former major league manager and infielder Art Howe is in intensive care in a Houston hospital with the coronavirus. The 73-year-old Howe, best known as the manager of the “Moneyball” Oakland Athletics playoff teams in the late 1990s and early 2000s, confirmed to Houston TV station KPRC 2 on Thursday night he has been dealing with the illness since first feeling symptoms of COVID-19 on May 3. Howe told the station he found out he was positive two days after being tested and tried to recover at home. He went to the hospital by ambulance on Tuesday, and remained in ICU. “Never experienced anything like it before,” Howe said, adding that he needs to go 24 hours without a fever before he can be released from the hospital. Howe spent 12 seasons in the majors as a player, primarily at second base and third base. He played for Pittsburgh (1974-75) and Houston (1976-82), but missed the 1983 season with an injury before playing two more years for St. Louis (1984-85). Howe hit .260 over his career with 43 home runs and 293 RBIs. His only postseason homer in three playoff trips came in the 1981 NL Division Series against Los Angeles. Howe began his big league managerial career with the Astros in 1989 and led them for five seasons. He took over the A’s in 1996 and managed them for seven years while winning 600 regular-season games and leading Oakland to the playoffs three times. Those teams became known for general manager Billy Beane’s then-unconventional method of using sabermetrics to evaluate players. Author Michael Lewis wrote a bestselling book on the A’s called “Moneyball,” and it was later turned into a film starring Brad Pitt as Beane and Philip Seymour Hoffman as Howe. Howe was released from his contract with the A’s after the 2002 season and became the manager of the New York Mets for two seasons. “Want to send best wishes on behalf of our entire organization to former @Mets manager Art Howe who is in a Houston hospital battling COVID-19,” Mets vice president of alumni public relations and team historian Jay Horwitz wrote on Twitter. “Never have met a nicer man.” Howe, whose managerial record is 1,129–1,137, most recently served as Texas’ bench coach during the 2007 and ’08 seasons.

House Democrats started breaking with Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) on Friday as Congress’ lower chamber prepares to vote on the $3 trillion, 1,815-page bill. Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-VA) said before the House vote: Unfortunately, many Member of Congress — including some in my own party — have decided to use this package as an opportunity to make political statements and propose a bill that goes far beyond pademic relief and has no chance at becoming law, furhter delaying the help so many need. Rep. Joe Cunningham (D-SC) said he will also vote against the $3 trillion coronavirus bill. He called the legislation “Washington politics at its worst” and “now is not the time to advance a partisan wish list or refuse to come to the negotiating table.” Both of these lawmakers represent swing districts that President Donald Trump won by more than six percentage points during the 2016 election and House Democrats flipped during the 2018 congressional elections. Republicans need to retake 17 seats to regain the House majority. Republicans urgue the legislation is toxic due to its enormous price tag and includes many provisions that do not involve coronavirus aid. One GOP strategist told Politico: People are struggling to make rent and figure out how to put enough food on the table for their kids. But what is the House Democfrats’ priority? A $3 trillion grab bag of long-time liberal priorities from marijuana to tax breaks for blue state millionaires to ‘environmental justice.’ It’s hard to illustrate better just how out of touch they are from the American people. Democrats, in contrast, believe Republicans will look silly for opposing a bill while 30 million Americans are out of work. Cunningham and Spanberger’s rebuke of Pelosi’s coronavirus bill comes as the Speaker warned Democrats against opposing the bill in a call to House Democrats on Thursday night. “If you vote against this funding for your state, then you have to go home and defend it. And if you can defend that no vote, then you’re a better politician than me,” Pelosi said. “If you vote against this and all this funding for your state, then you have to go home and defend it. And if you can defend that no vote, then you’re a better politician than me,” Speaker Pelosi told her caucus on a call last night per a Dem aide. — Alex Moe (@AlexNBCNews) May 15, 2020  Sean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News.

The House Democrats’ rule providing for the consideration of their $3 trillion, 1,815-page phase four coronavirus bill would allow House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) to recess the House until July 21. As the House will likely consider Pelosi’s coronavirus bill, the Heroes Act, House Democrats snuck a provision into today’s rule that would allow the House journal to be considered approved from May 19 through July 21. The rule reads: Section 4 of the rule provides that on any legislative day during the period from May 19, 2020, through July 21, 2020: the Journal of the proceedings of the previous day shall be considered as approved; and the Chair may at any time declare the House adjourned to meet at a date and time to be announced by the Chair in declaring the adjournment. Politico explained that the Heroes bill serves as more of a wish list for the House progressives, writing: Privately, several House Democrats concede their latest bill feels like little more than an effort to appease the most liberal members of the caucus, many of whom were chafed that their most important priorities were minimized or ignored entirely in previous coronavirus negotiations. The bill also contains many leftist provisions, such as: Pelosi’s Heroes Act represents a staggering amount of spending. Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC) noted that the bill has “70 appropriations in excess of a billion dollars each.” Norman asked rhetorically, “When you walk out of secret negotiations with an 1800 page, $3 trillion bill that thas no chance of becoming law, why is that portrayed as an accomplishment?” Sean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News.

During Friday’s “Morning Joe” on MSNBC, co-host Mika Brzezinski asked Ron Klain, who served as former President Barack Obama’s Ebola czar, if he would characterize President Donald Trump’s response and handling of the coronavirus pandemic as “negligence” or “criminal” on his part. Brzezinski noted Trump “seems to be focused on rage tweeting” and “conspiracy theories” about her husband and “Morning Joe” partner rather than acting as a leader. “I guess I would ask in terms of helping people understand how safe they are, to understand the reality of the leadership they have, how would you characterize our response so far? Negligence, avoidance, criminal? Just a severe lack of ability to process, how would you characterize the way this White House and this president is responding to this pandemic?” asked Brzezinski. Klain would not take the stance one way or the other on negligence or criminality on Trump’s part, but did question the president’s “focus” and leadership. “Well, I think it’s been focused on all the wrong things,” Klain told Brzezinski. “I think that there’s been this obsession with trying to protect the level of the stock market. That’s really what’s driven the president’s reaction to this. It’s why he spent all of January and February denying the existence of the virus or denying it was going to be serious, or saying it’d be under control.” He added, “We’ve seen a failure of leadership from start to finish here.” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent

Two migrants who arrived on the Greek island of Lesbos last week after departing Turkey have tested positive for the Wuhan coronavirus, a development that follows claims the Turks may be purposely sending infected migrants. The two migrants arrived from Turkey on the island is Lesbos in the Aegean Sea on the 6th of May and were identified as being infected with the coronavirus as part of a random check with the two migrants not being sent to the Moria migrant camp but quarantined in a special area on the island. According to a report from Greek newspaper Proto Thema, the quarantine area is located near the beach of Efthalou in the far north of the island, far from Moria which lies to the south-east of Lesbos. The boat containing the migrants contained 51 individuals overall and on Sunday another boat landed carrying 19 migrants, all of them men from Iran and Afghanistan. The passengers of the second ship will also be checked for signs of the Wuhan coronavirus and given a 14-day quarantine. WATCH: Scenes Resembling First World War as ‘Battle of Evros’ Between Greeks, Migrants, Turks Continues https://t.co/4KFpev54y4 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 25, 2020  The confirmation of migrants leaving Turkey for Greece while infected with the coronavirus comes after speculation by some in the Greek media that Turkey may be sending migrants infected with coronavirus to Greece on purpose as the infection spreads in migrant camps within Turkey. Greek journalist Lygeros Stavros made the accusation in early April saying, “everything leads to the conclusion that the Turkish state has consciously orchestrated an informal biological warfare attack against Greece,” citing an incident in which Turkish coast guard boats allegedly helped a migrant boat and were wearing medical protection suits while doing so. So far the large number of migrants who gathered at the Greek border from February until the end of March have not returned to the Greek border in significant numbers but both Greek and Turkish authorities have stated they will return en masse after the coronavirus crisis ends.

Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi’s pay package has come under fire from a group of shareholders who are questioning why his sign-on deal potentially entitles him to $100 million while employees are facing layoffs in the wake of the Chinese virus pandemic. The objections came to light this week during Uber’s shareholder meeting when CtW Investment Group, an investment firm working with some of Uber’s shareholders, drew attention to the CEO’s compensation. As reported by the Observer, CtW highlighted Khosrowshahi’s “golden hello” sign-on package when he joined Uber in 2017. Under the plan, he would receive an equity award worth $100 million if Uber’s market capitalization reaches $120 billion and stays there for more than 90 days. CtW said in a statement: “Uber’s sign-on package doesn’t encourage long-term retention and has become increasingly untenable as the company’s workers struggle to make ends meet amid the COVID-19 outbreak.” $Uber's sign-on package doesn't encourage long-term retention and has become increasingly untenable as the company’s workers struggle to make ends meet amid the #COVID19 outbreak. https://t.co/CI8voEOtf4 #corpgov #execpay — CtW Investment Group (@CtWInvGrp) May 13, 2020  Uber disclosed its plans to layoff 3,700 employees, or 14 percent of its workforce, in an SEC filing last week. The San Francisco-based company also said that CEO Khosrowshahi will forgo his base salary for the rest of the year.  Khosrowshahi had a base salary of $1 million in 2019. But like many corporate executives, Khosrowshahi could still receive compensation in other forms, including stock options and bonuses. Competitor Lyft said in April that it is laying off 982 employees, or 17 percent of its workforce, and is furloughing hundreds more due to financial pressure from the Chinese virus pandemic.

The Los Angeles street artist known as Sabo is no fan of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic and has plastered the L.A. area with posters depicting the Democrat governor as a character out of American Psycho. Sabo put up his latest street art series in Venice Beach, Hollywood, and other high-traffic destinations around L.A. County. One poster shows Gov. Newsom as the Christian Bale character from the 2000 movie American Psycho, renamed “California Psycho.” Unsavory Agents Another poster on Hollywood Boulevard near the Dolby Theatre depicts Newsom as a plastic-surgery enhanced monster named “Gruesom,” inspired by the horror movie Saw. “They want us to all wear masks,” Sabo told Breitbart News. “How fitting, because they wear them all the time.” Unsavory Agents Gov. Newsom has put the country’s most populous state on indefinite coronavirus lockdown, though some non-essential businesses have been allowed to re-open, such as malls, but only for curbside pickup. The governor hasn’t announced a date when his shelter-in-place order will lift, except to say that testing and contact tracing will be major factors. Smaller cities throughout California have pleaded the governor to allow them to re-open their economies as major metropolitan areas including L.A. and San Francisco continue in lockdown mode. L.A. County recently extended its stay-at-home order for an additional three months, until August. Unsavory Agents Unsavory Agents Sabo’s latest street art includes freedom-themed works, including a skateboarding sign in Venice Beach with the words “Come and Take It.” It harkens to a skate park in San Clemente, CA, that saw 37 tons of sand dumped in it last month by local authorities to stop skaters from using the space. Another poster mocks social distancing snitchers with a scene from the 1978 movie Invasion of the Body Snatchers, retitled Invasion of the Snitchers and featuring actor Donald Sutherland wearing a mask. The art from Sabo comes as 14,000 entertainment-related workers in Los Angeles County saw their jobs evaporate in less than two months, according to a new report from tech news outlet dot L.A. Consequently, industry experts and the major studios are already bracing for an extended round of job losses that will see tens of thousands of job cuts for entertainment-related laborers.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) announced Friday that he has extended his state’s lockdown order to June 13, unless individual areas can meet specific criteria to reopen as the United States continues to combat the deadly Chinese coronavirus pandemic. Cuomo said regions such as Central New York, North Country, Finger Lakes, Southern Tier, and Mohawk Valley may begin operations as part of the state’s Phase One reopening plan. CBS News New York reports that a region may reopen if it meets the following criteria: New York, which remains the epicenter of the U.S.’s coronavirus pandemic, has 348,192 confirmed cases and 27,617 deaths, according to data tracked by Johns Hopkins University. Meanwhile, Delaware Gov. John Carney announced Thursday lockdown restrictions on beaches and community pools will be lifted the evening of May 22 with social distancing guidelines still in place. From Friday, ice cream shops and trucks may reopen for business, the Democratic governor said. “Summer at the beach and the pool is a huge part of life for so many Delawareans,” he said in a statement. “As we ease our way into a new normal, we’re trying to find ways for Delawareans to enjoy the outdoors and the company of their families.” For out-of-state beachgoers, the mandatory 14-day quarantine period will still be active, he said, adding, residents must maintain at least 6 feet distance from others outdoors and face coverings must be worn on the boardwalk and they are encouraged at the beach. According to the Delaware Divison of Public Health, the state has recorded more than 7,200 cases of COVID-19 and 260 deaths. In New Jersey, Gov. Phil Murphy signed an Executive Order reopening beaches, boardwalks, lakes and lakeshores for Friday of the Memorial Day weekend. The UPI contributed to this report. 

Northeastern China’s Jilin City has imposed a partial lockdown after recording seven new Chinese coronavirus cases in the past 48 hours, provincial health authorities announced Wednesday. The news follows reports on Monday that leaders of nearby Shulan – like Jilin City, located in Jilin province – declared the city to be in “wartime control mode” after a dozen new coronavirus cases were recorded there last Friday, forcing the community to implement a lockdown over the weekend. Jilin City’s coronavirus outbreak has been linked to Shulan’s, which is located just 60 miles away. “The current epidemic situation in Jilin [City] is very grim and complicated, and there is a dire risk of the [corona]virus spreading farther. Thus the most rigorous action must be taken to halt the [corona]virus’s spread,” Jilin City’s deputy mayor, Gai Dongping, said at a press conference on Wednesday. Under the new measures, Jilin City’s two million residents are essentially barred from leaving the area. All residential communities, such as villages, are locked down with entry and exit monitored by authorities, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) newspaper China Daily reported. As of Wednesday, Jilin City halted all train services out of the city. According to the newspaper, on Wednesday morning “police officers were seen guarding the gate [to the train station] in hazmat suits.” All city bus services have also been suspended. As announced by Jilin province health authorities on Wednesday, the government has ordered all local pharmacies and clinics to stop selling “fever medications, antiviral drugs, and antibiotics,” in an effort to force all people with a fever to a designated hospital for a diagnosis by health officials. On Wednesday, the Chinese-language Epoch Times interviewed residents in Jilin City and Shulan who said that the outbreak there “is more severe” than the government has indicated, a statement that seems alarming, considering the provincial government has already declared Shulan to be under de facto martial law and has designated Shulan to be at the “highest risk” level for coronavirus. Shulan’s outbreak was traced to a woman who worked in the city’s police laundry. The newspaper’s Wednesday report indicates that the outbreak spread to the Shulan police bureau, where her husband also worked. “The first patient’s husband works at the police bureau. Now, the whole police bureau is closed. All officers are under quarantine,” a Shulan woman identified as Ms. Yang, who operates a messenger company near the police department, told the newspaper.

Here’s my secret plan. It’s a secret and terribly selfish, so let’s keep it between us… You see, I don’t think there will ever be a cure for the coronavirus. Color me a cynic, but I don’t see it. Did you know there’s still no cure for the epidemics of 1918 and 1969, for the Spanish and Hong Kong flus that wiped out millions? So all this talk about coronavirus vaccines and cures by the end of the year, by next year, five years from now… Not gunna happen, in my humble opinion. So here’s my plan… Because of my lovely wife’s health issues, this coronavirus scares me to death, and since I don’t believe we will ever see a cure, my only choice is to remain in quarantine until enough of the American population is infected to create herd immunity. So that’s my plan… To hold out until 60 to 70 percent of y’all are infected so my wife and I can safely resume our normal lives. Sure, that’s a mercenary plan, but it’s also a good plan, one every American should adopt who falls into the danger zone. And that’s one reason — the selfish reason — I want to see these stupid lockdowns end. You see, the sooner there’s herd immunity, the sooner I can go see Fast & Furious 9. And while I hate to be the bearer of bad news, herd immunity is probably the only way we’re going to “cure” this thing: if 60 to 70 percent of y’all catch it… So please go out and catch it — but only those with the best chance of surviving it. I’m also opposed to these lockdowns because they’re pointless. Without a cure, without a vaccine, and when you’re dealing with an infectious disease, the coronavirus is eventually going to catch up with everyone. As Dr. Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said this week — and this needs to be said out loud more often — the China Virus is going to rage “until it infects everybody it possibly can,” which means it “surely won’t slow down until it hits 60 to 70%” of the population. So there you go… In other words, eventually, because you cannot be 100 percent effective 100 percent of the time when it comes to washing your hands and disinfecting your mail and groceries, it’s going to get you. The final reason I’m opposed to these lockdowns is that once you’ve ensured the health system will not crash (a worthy goal we’ve achieved), lockdowns are not only useless when you’re dealing with an infectious disease; they’re un-American. There is no good reason to keep people locked down. We are now educated on the risks. We are educated on what can be done to diminish the risks (masks, social distancing, washing hands, losing weight), so it is loooong past time to free those who wish to be freed. What’s more, and this is just me — a college dropout thinking out loud — I’m worried that if we don’t bite the bullet and achieve herd immunity as soon as possible, more people will die in the long run. And unlike the fake news media, who all have jobs (as do I), I’m also worried about the death toll that comes from the economic devastation currently taking place: the suicides, drug and alcohol abuse, spousal and child abuse that always accompany recessions. My God, 35 million American have lost their jobs in just six weeks… And for what? The curve is bent. We know the risks, so what is the point of keeping these people locked down? What is the point of ravaging their lives just one more day? And, finally, no one — not even lockdown champions like Govs. Newsom, Whitmer, or Cuomo, not even Dr. Fauci — have been able to answer my very simple question… Without a vaccine, and with there being no risk of crashing the health system, why is it safer to open up next week, next month, or next year than it is to open up today? I keep waiting for an answer to this question, but no one has one… “BUT BUT BUT BUT PEOPLE WILL DIE!” the media’s fear-porn peddlers continue to scream as though that’s an answer… But here’s the thing… When these lockdowns end… No one will force you to end your quarantine. No one will force you to end your lockdown. No one will force you to leave your home. No one will force you to stop homeschooling your kids. No one will force you to go to the beach or to the movies or to the mall or to a restaurant. So join me. We’ll both stay home and watch Netflix until there’s herd immunity. You see, there’s nothing fascist about staying home and watching Netflix until there’s herd immunity. But there is everything fascist about insisting the government force everyone else to stay home and watch Netflix until there’s a cure, especially when, best case, you’re talking a year for a cure, but you’re probably talking never. So stop being a goddamned fascist. You and I can stay home and wait for herd immunity while everyone else runs free… That’s what you call a win-win. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

As nations big and small around the globe continue to grapple with the Chinese coronavirus, the country that gave the deadly pandemic its name claimed on Friday one month has now passed without a single fatality attributed to the disease. The National Health Commission reported just four new cases of the virus Friday, all local cross-infections in the northeastern province of Jilin where a cluster of uncertain origin has been detected in recent days. The last day the commission reported a death was on April 14, its own records show, although the dismissal of infection and fatality rates flies in contrast to Chinese Communist Party (CCP) propaganda with Chinese dictator Xi Jinping admitting last week at a leadership gathering the Wuhan virus is still a major problem. As Breitbart News reported, Xi addressed the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CCP Central Committee and included warnings against complacency that belied allegations China’s claims of zero infection are meant for credulous foreign reporters and international organizations, not Beijing’s decision-makers. Even so, now China claims just 91 people remain in treatment for COVID-19 and 623 others are in isolation for being suspected cases or for having tested positive without showing symptoms, including 11 newly detected. In total, China has reported 4,633 deaths among 82,933 cases since the virus was first detected late last year in the central city of Wuhan. China’s claim to have successfully suppressed the virus stands in miraculous contrast to the rest of the world. Global coronavirus deaths passed 300,000 on Thursday as infections approached 4.5 million, according to a Reuters tally, with the United States surffering more than a quarter of all fatalities. The United Kingdom and Italy accounted for another 10-11 percent each, while France and Spain accounted for nine percent respectively. The number of deaths linked to Chinese coronavirus in just four months is now equal to about three-quarters of the number of people who die annually from malaria, one of the world’s most deadly infectious diseases. As Beijing applauded itself and acclaimed the startling lack of fatalities, it did spare the time to offer advice to the U.S. on how to cope with the pandemic – which amounted to being more like China. As Breitbart News reported, Chinese state media on Wednesday asserted federalism, multi-party democracy, and respect for individual privacy would make it impossible for the United States to defeat the virus, since Washington cannot dictate top-down solutions for the entire country or micro-monitor American citizens the way Beijing does. China’s argument remains that if only the “weak” U.S. was structured and governed in a manner more easily recognisable by the authoritarians in the Chinese Communist Party then today it might well be free of coronavirus fatalities as well.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) – Ukraine’s human rights ombudswoman has appealed to authorities to find a solution for scores of infants born to surrogate mothers for foreign parents who are stranded because the country´s borders are closed under coronavirus restrictions. Ukraine has a thriving surrogate industry and is one of the few countries that allows the service for foreigners. Concern is high that a long border closure will place a burden on clinics and distress the parents. “About 100 children are already waiting for their parents in different centers of reproductive medicine. And if quarantine is extended, then it will not be about hundreds, but about thousands,” said ombudswoman Lyudmila Denisova. The issue attracted wide attention after Biotexcom, the country´s largest surrogate operation, posted a video showing dozens of babies in bassinets arrayed in tight rows in two large rooms of the hotel where the clinic puts up clients. The video aims to reassure absent parent that their little ones are receiving good care, showing nurses bathing and caressing them. Denisova said there are 51 babies in all at Biotexcom, 15 of them under the care of parents who were able to make it into the country before the shutdown but can´t leave. Ukraine´s restrictions are to remain in place until at least May 22. The parents are from 12 countries: China, the United States, Italy, Spain, Britain, France, Germany, Bulgaria, Romania, Austria, Mexico and Portugal. “The issue remains unresolved, but we are developing a mechanism to get out of the situation,” said Denisova, who met with Foreign Ministry representatives on Thursday. Under the proposed mechanism, foreign parents would have to write a statement addressed to Denisova´s office, which would then contact the ministry with a request to give permission to enter Ukraine. About 50 clinics that offer surrogate births operate in Ukraine. The country´s economic struggles drive many Ukrainian women to become surrogate mothers.

The Hungarian Justice Minister chastised the European Parliament (EP) in a stinging address Wednesday, insisting it has been “part of the problem” rather than a solution during the coronavirus pandemic. In her speech before the plenary assembly of the EP, Minister Judit Varga said the European Union “is facing the greatest crisis in its history” due to the coronavirus pandemic, which poses a direct threat to the lives and health of our citizens. Varga highlighted the “shock to the European economy” requiring new solutions to maintain and strengthen European competitiveness in the long run, since the “methods and solutions used in the past have manifestly failed.” The minister also lashed out at the parliament for its criticism of measures enacted by the Hungarian government to protect its citizens when it should be supporting its member states in their efforts. “Can an institution call itself European that attacks one of the Member States during the most difficult period in the fight against the epidemic, questions its measures and undermines the legitimacy of its decisions?” she asked. “This would not qualify as a standard procedure even among enemies, and it is a historic betrayal within the European family.” EU citizens expect that the European Union support the Member States with all the means at its disposal in the fight to save their lives, she stated. “The European Parliament has not been able to meet this expectation. Today, the European Parliament is not the solution, but part of the problem.” The European Parliament’s original mission was to be a place of democratic debate, respecting European values and the diversity and identity of European nations, she noted, and it has abandoned this mission in failing to listen to its members. “Today, not even the right to a fair trial is guaranteed to a Member State of the European Union,” in reference to the EU’s criticism of Hungary. “Even during the worst historical times in conceptual lawsuits, care was taken to ensure at least that the person accused was present at the trial.” Varga also laid out the exceptional measures put in place in Hungary, insisting that they “fully comply” with the rule of law and the principles of the EU. The “state of danger declared” by the Hungarian government on March 11 was extended by an the authorization of the National Assembly, but this authorization “is not unlimited either in time or in content,” she observed, and the National Assembly “may revoke the authorization at any time, even before the end of the state of danger.” “The extraordinary measures of the Government will cease to be in force when the state of danger ends,” she said. And yet, the European Parliament “falsely accused the Hungarian Government of suspending the sittings of the National Assembly,” she declared. “Unlike the European Parliament, the Hungarian National Assembly is alive and well!” Varga said Hungary has prepared and submitted a “thorough international comparative analysis” showing that the extraordinary measures introduced in Hungary “are not unique in a European comparison.” “I respectfully call on the European Commission to make their comparative analysis public, which has been promised so many times, so that we can share our knowledge in a fair constitutional dialogue,” she added. She also underscored that the extraordinary measures of the Hungarian government do not restrict the activities of the media and do not affect freedom of expression, except in taking effective action to limit “the deliberate spread of lies.” “Everything we say or do today will be judged by future generations on the basis of whether it has hindered or helped to prevent the epidemic and to get Europe back on its feet,” Varga stated. “I trust that the European Parliament, instead of its current displacement activity, will also find a way to play an adequate role in this mission,” she concluded.

On Thursday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “The Last Word,” 2020 Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden said “Trump was praising the Chinese government and downplaying the threat to the American people” and is now “trying to play this China card.” Biden stated, “Well, first of all, the president got it wrong from the beginning, absolutely missed any opportunity to get ahead of this. You know, back in January, I think it was the 27, when he was saying this — praising China and talking about it not being a problem. We had put together in our administration an office within the White House to deal with future pandemics. They had been briefed on it. They meaning the incoming administration. We had over 44, if I’m not mistaken, people from the CDC in China, in China to observe what was going on. The president brought home the vast majority of them, I think left only four in place. I kept — I wrote an article back in, I think, the 27 of January saying, we — there’s — a pandemic is coming. we should insist on being in China to see for ourselves what was happening so we could be prepared. The president said, no, no, they’re doing a great job. This — all this is going — everything is fine.” He continued, “And so, the thing that I’d be doing is resetting that pandemic office in place, number one, making sure we had the CDC, like we did in our administration, forward-based around the world, so we could see these things coming. Because there will be more coming. The truth is, Trump was praising the Chinese government and downplaying the threat to the American people as I said — as I was warning of the need to get the people into China to see what was actually going on. And the Chinese government’s word — we squandered critical time. And so, I just don’t — and now he’s trying to play this China card.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

Appearing Thursday on CNN’s Coronavirus: Facts and Fears town hall program, Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg said she hopes the Chinese coronavirus pandemic teaches others to listen to experts on climate change. "People are starting to realize that we are actually depending on science and that we need to listen to scientists and experts." -Teen activist Greta Thunberg on how people are reacting to science and what that means for the climate crisis. #CNNTownHall https://t.co/EvUEaN7gza pic.twitter.com/HLQb1AQ7ax — CNN (@CNN) May 15, 2020  A transcript is as follows:  ANDERSON COOPER: One of the things I’ve seen you talk about alone is how important it is to listen to experts and listen to science. This is a time when — you know, I wasn’t a very good science student when I was in school — but this is a time, it seems, that the global scientific community is so critically important and we’re really seeing how important it is to follow science. GRETA THUNBERG: Yes, exactly. I hope that we can see now the scientific community are stepping up and they are speaking out more than they’ve done before because, obviously, this is a crisis that requires the scientific community to speak up. It feels like science is — the role of science changing now — it’s becoming more — people are starting to realize that we are actually depending on science and that we need to listen to scientists and experts. And I really hope that stays and that also it’s for other crises like the climate crisis and the environmental crisis and that we understand that we have to listen to the scientists.

The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) reported a COVID-19 death toll of 192 on Wednesday, a peak for any 24-hour period in the state since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. On Thursday, the number of reported COVID-19 deaths in the state declined to 138, bringing the total number of COVID-19 deaths in the state to 3,928. The spike in COVID-19 deaths this week came as the state of Illinois has seen a significant increase in just two weeks in the number of COVID-19 deaths among nursing home residents as a percentage of total COVID-19 deaths in the state. That percentage jumped from 35 percent on April 24 to 48 percent on May 8. The IDPH reports nursing home deaths once a week on Fridays, so it is not currently known what percentage of the 192 COVID-19 deaths reported on Wednesday were from nursing home residents. Neither is it known whether the spike has been caused by a continuation in the increase of nursing home deaths or some other factor. On April 24, the IDPH reported 1,795 COVID-19 deaths in the state, 625 of which (35 percent) were nursing home residents. By last Friday, May 8, the total number of COVID-19 deaths in the state had jumped to 3,241, of which 1,553 (48 percent) were nursing home residents. More than half of the nursing home deaths in the state, 865, were reported in Cook County, population five million. Chicago, population 2.7 million, is the Cook County seat. The Chicago Tribune reported on the details of last week’s spike in nursing home cases and deaths in the state: More than 50 Illinois nursing homes have eclipsed double-digit coronavirus deaths as several facilities reported spikes in their number of cases and deaths in the past week, according to data released Friday by state health officials. . . This week, 18 more homes reached double-digit deaths, bringing that total to 51 facilities across the state. Twenty-two have reported more than 100 total cases, with two homes over 200. The largest increase in deaths this week came at Meadowbrook Manor of Bolingbrook, where 16 people died, bringing that home’s total deaths to 26 — the most in the state. ManorCare Hinsdale reported 13 new deaths this week and is up to 19 since the start of the pandemic. On Thursday, ProPublica Illinois reported on a cluster of coronavirus cases in a nursing home in a suburb of Chicago that arose before state officials were prepared to respond proactively: Since mid-April, 75 of the nursing home’s 91 residents and 37 of its 120 workers have tested positive for the virus. Twenty-four residents have died from COVID-19, the most recent on Monday, according to Bria of Geneva and the coroner’s office in Kane County, where the facility is located. While other Illinois nursing homes may have seen larger overall numbers of cases and deaths, almost none have experienced an outbreak on the scale of the one here, with more than two-thirds of the residents infected with the virus and one-fourth killed by it. The situation at Bria of Geneva illustrates the price of insufficient and delayed testing and how a lag in public reporting of cases and deaths in nursing homes obscured the breadth of a crisis that has disproportionately hit the state’s vulnerable elderly population. The first resident at Bria of Geneva tested positive April 17. At the time, Illinois public health officials had instructed nursing homes that they did not need to test everyone when there were positive cases. That guidance changed soon after, when state officials acknowledged that more testing was needed in nursing homes to identify asymptomatic residents and staff members and prevent large outbreaks. Still, it took another week for Bria to obtain enough supplies to do widespread testing. Breitbart News conducted an analysis of the data reported by the Illinois Department of Health on Wednesday on the 192 deaths and calculated that, among the 174 deaths that day for whom the Illinois Department of Health provided age and gender data, the average age of death was 76.1 years, slightly higher than the national average of 75 years. Notably, as Table 1 below indicates, 67 percent of those who died of COVID-19 in Illinois on May 13 were over the age of 70. Table 1 As Breitbart News reported this week, the governors of New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania — all Democrats — have come under fire for adopting policies early on in the pandemic that required nursing homes to admit patients who tested positive for COVID-19. Some governors in other states specifically prohibited patients that tested positive for COVID-19 from being admitted to nursing homes. Early in the pandemic, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, did not adopt a policy specifically prohibiting nursing homes from admitting patients who tested positive for COVID-19. That failure to establish a policy left the decision of admitting or turning away a COVID-19 patient up to the management of the local nursing home facility. The website of the law firm Levine and Perconti reports the details: CMS is deferring to states’ decisions on admission of patients with COVID-19. Some states have mandated that facilities accept these patients. Other states have barred facilities from admitting them. Many states, like Illinois, have issued no guidance at all; that coupled with the absence of federal regulation essentially means that decisions about admission of COVID-19-positive patients are being made at the facility level. The current Long Term Care Facilities Guidance published by the IDPH provides these guidelines to operators of nursing homes for dealing with their residents who have tested positive for COVID-19: If patients have been screened and their testing is POSITIVE for COVID-19 OR if patients have signs/symptoms of a respiratory viral infection: Any resident identified with symptoms of fever and lower respiratory illness (cough, shortness of breath, sore throat) should be immediately placed in both Contact and Droplet transmission-based precautions. The isolation should be implemented by the healthcare member who discovers the symptoms pending a physician order. Residents with confirmed COVID-19 or displaying respiratory symptoms should receive all services in room with door closed (meals, physical and occupational therapy, activities, and personal hygiene, etc.) Symptomatic residents should only leave their room as required for medical procedures not available on site (i.e., dialysis, medical specialist appointment, and critical testing not available at the facility). If the resident is to leave room for these purposes the shortest route should be utilized and the immediate are/route to the exit/treatment areas should be cleared of all residents and unnecessary staff. Gov. Pritzker came under severe criticism when it was reported that his wife left the state of Illinois to stay at the family’s horse ranch in Florida. Pritzker has also been criticized for his refusal to reopen the state and relax heavy-handed safer-at-home orders that continue to shut down “nonessential” businesses.

Thursday on MSNBC’s “The Last Word,” former Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams said, given the coronavirus pandemic, all Americans should be eligible to vote by mail in November. Abrams said, “Whether you’re thinking about what happened in Georgia in 2018 when thousands were denied the right to be heard or what we saw happen in Wisconsin, 52 people at last count contracted COVID because they were forced to cast their ballot in person. We know vote by mail is the safest and most accessible way of making sure every American can be heard on November 3. The reality is it’s safe. That there is no fraud of any consequence. In fact, in every single state that has used vote by mail regularly, Oregon for the last 20 years, the number of people who committed fraud is negligible.” She continued, “What is more telling, they don’t want the voices of people suffering from COVID-19 suffering from a collapsed economy and suffering from the crowdedness of Donald Trump, they don’t want their voices heard at the ballot. But what we can do through the heroes package is ensure that everyone in America who wants to vote by mail can do so so we can also create accessible spaces for people to vote early and in-person on the day of. Because if you’re disabled or homeless, if you’ve been displaced by COVID, if you have language barriers and if you’re Native American, we need you to be able to go into the polling places and make sure there is enough space to meet the CDC guidelines. You got to get as many people as possible to vote by mail. Every state can do it. We simply have to invest in it and put in the guardrails to make it possible for every American eligible to vote.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Joe Biden says the coronavirus outbreak is “a chance” to alter the U.S. economy. On Thursday, “Good Luck America” published part two of its interview with the Democrat frontrunner for president. “We have to come out of this godawful situation and build an economy that’s fair to everybody,” Biden said. He claimed on the Snapchat show that “young people are afraid right now” and they’re graduating unable to work and pay off their debts due to the economic crash. “We have a chance to institutionally change the way this economy functions once we get by this godawful pandemic,” Biden told Peter Hamby. His idea to “rebuild the economy” is “every new highway is green,” and said there should be tax credits for constructing “green buildings.” Biden proposed creating a “Public Health Corps.,” where 100,000 young people would “track and trace,” presumably referring to coronavirus contact tracing programs. He said “prejudice within our system” is the cause for black and Hispanics being more likely to catch the virus. In part one of the interview, Biden botched Andrew Yang’s name. “The latest episode of Here’s the Deal podcast with Andrew Young,” he said, as a picture of Andrew Yang appeared on the screen. Andrew Young was mayor of Atlanta in the 1980s. “We’re trying to get better with it,” Biden said of using the Internet, adding he “can’t wait” to get off his back porch.

ROME — Italy has enacted a series of detailed regulations for beach lifeguards as the country slowly emerges from total lockdown, including a ban on mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to prevent coronavirus contagion. Amidst the countless minuscule regulations decreed by the Italian government over every aspect of human activity, an entire set of rules specifically for lifeguards in Italy has been drafted as the nation prepares to cautiously reopen its beaches. To ascertain whether a victim is still breathing, the regulations state, the rescuer will have to “evaluate respiration only by looking at the victim’s chest in search of normal respiratory activity, but without bringing his face close to that of the person being rescued.” If required, lifeguards are to perform CPR on victims but only using chest compressions without accompanying ventilation. They are told to evaluate a person’s state of consciousness “by calling, shaking and stimulating the injured person without approaching his face frontally.” The new rules also stipulate that a lifeguard should only swim out to assist a swimmer in trouble as a last resort, having first exhausted other methods such as life rings and other apparatuses. If forced into physical contact with a swimmer, lifeguards are told to bring them to shore using a hold that does not expose them to the swimmer’s face. Italian media welcomed the new restrictions with gentle derision, noting that given the self-imposed difficulties in sea rescues, the government should go all the way and outlaw drowning. Lifeguards themselves were less circumspect in their criticism of the new norms. “I find it absurd,” said Marco Maielli, president of the Life Guard Costa Ovest cooperative, which coordinates the lifeguard rescue activities on the coast of Marina di Castagneto Carducci. “The first cause of drowning is asphyxiation. Without clearing the airways, it is useless to restart the heart: the first minutes are decisive.” Follow @tdwilliamsrome.

An American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) lawsuit is seeking the release of inmates in the Dallas County, Texas Jail considered “vulnerable” to contracting the Chinese coronavirus — a suit that could result in the release of a high-profile accused illegal alien serial killer from Kenya. Billy Chemirmir, 47-years-old, is facing the death penalty for two elderly women he allegedly murdered, 81-year-old Lu Thi Harris in March 2018 and 91-year-old Phyllis Payne in 2016. In criminal court, prosecutors say Chemirmir is responsible for at least 14 murders of elderly Americans in the Dallas area. In civil lawsuits, Chemirmir has been accused of an additional eight murders of elderly Americans. Prosecutors say Chemirmir would smother his victims to death and steal property off them. Chermirmir’s alleged victims include: Breitbart News exclusively reported that Chemirmir first arrived in the U.S. on a B-2 tourist visa in July 2003. Though Chemirmir was supposed to only temporarily be in the U.S., he overstayed his visa and became an illegal alien who was eligible for deportation. Rather than being deported, Chemirmir was able to use a loophole in the nation’s legal immigration system, allowing him to obtain a green card after marrying an American citizen. In November 2007, Chemirmir was approved for a green card. Chemirmir had a criminal record, Breitbart News exclusively learned, including convictions for drunk driving, trespassing, assault, and obstructing a police officer. Chemirmir is currently being held on an $11.6 million bail in the Dallas County Jail and his trial date is set for April 2021. The ACLU, partially funded by billionaire George Soros, has filed a class-action lawsuit against Dallas County officials demanding the release of all inmates in the Dallas County Jail who are “over 50 and those who are most vulnerable to contracting the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.” The lawsuit is requesting that as many Dallas County Jail inmates are released as possible until the facility is in full compliance with six-feet social distancing guidelines. “The legal team is asking the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas to immediately remove medically-vulnerable people from harm’s way, and to ensure that the jail is required to adopt sufficient public health protocols, such as regular testing, physical distancing, free access to soap and masks, and sufficient sanitation supplies for anyone inside the jail,” ACLU officials wrote in a statement about the lawsuit. The lawsuit asks that inmates, regardless of their class of suspected criminality, be released so long as they are not considered “a serious risk of flight or danger to others that no other conditions can mitigate.” In other states with similar standards, accused murderers have been offered release from jail. The lawsuit has been filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division. The case number is 3:20-cv-00832-E. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

A group of U.S. Navy veterans in Kansas City, Missouri, are stepping out to raise money for families struggling during the coronavirus pandemic. When 85-year-old Ernie Martel heard recently that Della Lamb Community Services needed help supporting community members during the health crisis, he called up several of his friends, according to KCTV. Together, Martel, 99-year-old Harold Gosseen, and 78-year-old Don Varney pledged to walk one mile a day to raise money for the organization. “We just want to give back, we’ve been blessed all these years,” said Martel. Since the beginning of the 20th century, Della Lamb’s mission has been to help its community members “meet the challenges of education, employment, and self-sufficiency in an ever-changing world,” according to its website. Every morning, the “Three Musketeers,” as the veterans called themselves, do five laps around the senior living facility, which equals a mile. The men said they would continue as long as there was a need during the pandemic. “If it’s over in December we will quit in December, if it’s over next year, good Lord willing, we will still [be] here and walking next year,” Martel commented. Monday, the senior living facility praised the veterans for their efforts. “Our local residents here at Tiffany Springs Senior Living are not only young at heart but their hearts are huge,” the facility wrote on Facebook. So far, the veterans have raised $1,690 for Della Lamb. “Please support them to fulfill their vision by making a donation as they walk their way to helping those in KC achieve their full potential,” the post continued. “No donation is too small, and none is too big. For $2.25 they can feed one child one meal a day,” Martel explained. When asked how much money he and his friends hoped to raise, the veteran jokingly said one million dollars. “But that’s impossible. But whatever it takes, you know,” he concluded.

Hollywood actress and left-wing activist Alyssa Milano on Thursday accused President Donald Trump of purposely trying to get Americans killed following the release of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) guidelines to reopening as the United States combats the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. “The covid-19 “guidelines” that were released by the CDC/Trump administration can only mean one thing—he’s purposely trying to get people killed,” Milano mused in a tweet, sharing an article with a draft of the guidelines. The covid-19 “guidelines” that were released by the CDC/Trump administration can only mean one thing—he’s purposely trying to get people killed.https://t.co/BptJbs8jmF — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) May 14, 2020  Earlier Thursday, the CDC published six one-page “decision tool” documents using graphics to instruct organizations, such as offices, schools, and public transit on how to restart operations. The documents did not include guidance for faith-based facilities like churches and synagogues. “The CDC drafted the reopening guidance more than a month ago and it was initially shelved by the administration,” The Associated Press purported last week. Milano is the latest celebrity to accused President Trump of lacking concern for the number of deaths caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Appearing Tuesday on BBC’s Newsnight, Hollywood A-lister Robert De Niro attacked President Trump’s handling of the crisis, calling him a “lunatic” with no regard for how many people die of the illness. “It’s like Shakespearean the whole thing. You’ve got a lunatic saying things that people are trying to dance around. Whereas, at one point, and they are doing this in the hearings a little more, trying to say tactically that this is what will happen. Fauci is doing that. It’s appalling. He wants to be reelected. He doesn’t even care about how many people die,” said De Niro. Earlier Thursday, ABC’s The View co-host Joy Behar made such point as she lambasted the president for saying he wants children to make a swift return to school. “Let’s see, do I listen to an immunologist and scientist, or do I listen to someone who suggests I inject myself with Lysol? Listen, I wonder if he’s sending Baron to school, by the way?” asked Behar. “I mean, that would be an interesting thing to ask. You know, we all know he’s a liar, and he only cares about being re-elected, not how many people will die. So we do not listen to anything he says, subject number one.” Singer and actress Barbra Streisand echoed De Niro and Behar’s claims, writing on Twitter that President Trump is a “saboteur” of the country’s public health. “What has happened to the Republican Party? They say nothing while Trump silences the CDC recommendations and contradicts Dr Fauci by saying his science based answer is “not acceptable.” People are dying because of this failure of the GOP to follow medical science,” wrote Streisand.

Phyliss Shepherd’s family found unexpected joy when she defied all prognoses and recovered from the novel coronavirus. Shepherd, 82, has been in a nursing facility for about a year, suffering from dementia. But when she became one of many worldwide victims of the novel coronavirus global pandemic — officially classified “COVID-19” by the World Health Organization — the outlook was not good. Her family was told she should be moved into hospice care in order to make her comfortable before the end of her life. Then something changed. Shepherd’s family rushed to her window when they got the news, hoping for the chance to say goodbye. What they saw shocked them — and gave them hope. “We got a call Wednesday, was a week ago, that they wanted her in hospice. They said you might want to come to see her the next day,” remembered her son, Ricky Shepherd. “So we all came the next day, expecting the worst. And when we got here she was alert, talking to us. Making jokes,” he said.  How do you feel? Well, I feel alright, until I see y’all,” she said with a laugh. Ricky said if she is joking, she is feeling okay. “Well, you look good,” he replied. “I know,” she laughed. Even the staff said they could tell she would pull through when they saw a familiar “spark” return to her eyes. “Humor and the Lord, that’s what carries us through everything. That’s how she’s raised us,” said Ricky. Darcy Watson, Vice President of Operations for Westbury Administrative Services, explained that the battle against the global coronavirus pandemic has been difficult. “Nursing homes cannot do the one single thing that has proven to be the preventative measure for contracting this disease which is social distance,” she told local CBS affiliate KENS 5. “Despite issuing each resident an N-95, the virus unleashed its fury and we had a hard time getting ahead of it before we lost some of our beloved. We’ve begun to compare ourselves to a cruise ship that’s boarded with the most vulnerable and compromised of passengers.” Facing a PPE (Personal Protective Equipment, e.g. face masks) shortage, the staff put in their own money to buy $8 N95 masks for the residents. Now, they are seeing the fruits of their time, money, and effort. The nursing home threw a parade for the 55 residents that beat the bug and plan to host a party to celebrate when the threat is finally over. For Phyliss Shepherd and her family, this is an unexpectedly joyous step toward that end. Shepherd’s husband, Harold, credited another source for the win: “It was an answered prayer, definitely an answered prayer,” he said.

On Thursday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “Special Report,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) stated that there is “a high likelihood” the Senate will pass another stimulus bill and he anticipates having to do so. McConnell said, “[W]e do anticipate having to act again at some point.” He added that the Senate must “verify how we’ve done so far” with previous bills it has passed. McConnell later said, “I think that the president and Senate Republican majorities will be on the same page when we get to the point where we need to do another bill.” And “The president and Senate Republicans are going to be in the same place. We will let you know when we think the time is right to begin to move again. I think there’s a high likelihood we’ll do another bill. … I think we all believe that another bill probably is going to be necessary.” He further stated that he isn’t ready to give a certain date when another bill will be introduced. McConnell also dismissed the House’s bill as an unsalvageable “1,800-page liberal wishlist.” He reiterated that liability protections will be a “red line” for any stimulus bill.

While more than 33 million Americans file for unemployment due to the Chinese coronavirus crisis, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is issuing a new rule allowing foreign workers on expiring H-2B visas to stay in the United States to take blue-collar jobs. Every year, U.S. employers are allowed to import 66,000 low-skilled H-2B foreign visa workers to take nonagricultural, seasonal jobs. For some time, the H-2B visa program has been used by businesses to bring in cheaper foreign workers and has contributed to blue-collar Americans having their wages undercut. On Thursday, DHS issued a new rule at the behest of the business lobby that allows U.S. employers to keep foreign workers with expiring H-2B visas in the country to take American jobs. Under standard guidelines, H-2B foreign visa workers would have to return to their native countries for at least three months before applying for another H-2B visa. The new rule, though, will allow foreign workers with expiring H-2B visas to stay in the U.S. so long as they are hired by eligible employers to take American jobs. Employers will also be allowed to rehire their existing H-2B foreign visa workers without those workers having to ever return to their native countries. The rule, according to Roll Call, will last through May 15, 2023. This is the second time in the midst of mass unemployment that DHS, the State Department, and the Agriculture Department have pushed to keep foreign visa workers in the U.S. to take American jobs. In late March, as Breitbart News reported, the three federal agencies joined forces to fast-track H-2B foreign visa workers and H-2A foreign farm workers into the U.S. by issuing a series of visa waivers. The policy is similar to that of former President George W. Bush’s waivers issued after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. DHS officials have previously confirmed that newly arriving foreign workers on the H-2B and H-2A visa programs are not being tested for the coronavirus. Only those exhibiting symptoms upon their arrival are tested for the virus. Last month, President Trump signed an executive order halting the issuance of some employment-based green card categories. The categories account for less than ten percent of all legal immigration to the U.S., where about 1.2 million green cards are given to foreign nationals and another million visas are issued to foreign workers annually. Now, GOP lawmakers like Senators Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Josh Hawley, as well as Congressmen Paul Gosar (R-AZ) and Lance Gooden (R-TX) are urging Trump to expand the order to halt foreign visa worker programs while unemployment of Americans is expected to climb beyond 33 million.

Politico noted in its nightly bulletin Thursday that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis “looks more right than those who criticized” his response to the coronavirus pandemic, and that media bias is one of the reasons he is polling worse than other governors. The Beltway publication, which often leans left, offered a sober look at DeSantis’s performance — and the media’s slant (original emphasis and links): First, let’s just come out and say it: DeSantis looks more right than those who criticized the Sunshine State’s coronavirus response. According to the latest Florida figures, fewer than 2,000 have died, and around 43,000 have been infected. That’s a fraction of the dire predictions made for Florida when spring breakers swarmed the beaches, and those numbers are dwarfed by similarly sized New York, which has seen 12 times more deaths and nearly eight times more infections. (Check out POLITICO’s coronavirus tracker for more.) More people reportedly died in New York nursing homes than in all of Florida. The polling disparity: DeSantis is actually polling worse than Cuomo in their respective states, and the Florida press is wondering why. Part of that is style. Cuomo has a smooth delivery, a deep and calming voice and an attitude that projects he can answer any question. DeSantis sometimes comes across as peevish and defensive, has made a misstatement or two and was mocked for struggling to put on a mask. But most of the difference between DeSantis and Cuomo is due to politics. DeSantis governs a politically divided state. Cuomo is a scion of Democratic royalty in a deeply Democratic state. Yes, there’s media bias, too. Cuomo also has something else DeSantis doesn’t: a press that defers to him, one that preferred to cover “Florida Morons” at the beach (where it’s relatively hard to get infected) over New Yorkers riding cramped subway cars (where it’s easy to get infected). In fact, people can still ride the subways for most hours of the day in New York, but Miami Beach’s sands remain closed. Maybe things would be different if DeSantis had a brother who worked in cable news and interviewed him for a “sweet moment” in primetime. The authors of the bulletin, Marc Caputo and Renuka Rayasam, also say that DeSantis cannot take all the credit, because he allowed local government to take the lead. They also criticize the state’s inefficient unemployment insurance system, though they also note that DeSantis inherited it, and “is trying to get it fixed quickly.” The White House press corps repeatedly badgered President Donald Trump about DeSantis in the early days of the pandemic, when the Florida governor was one of the few who waited before he shut his state’s economy down.

Pennsylvania State Sen. Scott Martin (R) aim at Gov. Tom Wolf (D) over his threats to counties and business owners contemplating reopening without his explicit permission, blasting the “draconian” lockdown imposed by the governor. Wolf last week allowed 24 of the 67 counties in the state to move from the ultra-restrictive red phase — barring all non-life essential businesses from operating — to the yellow phase, which loosens restrictions. Thirteen additional counties are permitted to move into the yellow phase on Friday, leaving over two dozen counties remaining under lockdown to June 4, unless Wolf grants them an exception to reopen beforehand. Wolf’s decisions have caused frustration among citizens and local leaders, who contend that he is not basing his decisions on solid criteria. Residents of Beaver County, for instance, say they should be included in Friday’s reopening, as over two-thirds of coronavirus cases in the county, 509 of 364, are connected to nursing home facilities. What is more, almost all of the county’s virus deaths, 71 of 78, are tied to nursing homes. Wolf has since threatened counties and business owners who have weighed reopening without his permission, warning that the state could revoke licenses and withhold federal stimulus dollars from non-compliant counties. “The threatening and the name-calling after the counties started to push back a little was really uncalled for,” Sen. Martin of Lancaster said during an appearance on Fox & Friends, referencing Wolf’s claim that leaders who want to move forward are committing a “cowardly act.” “The way the federal CARES Act was established, counties with over half a million people got a direct allocation from the federal government, so Lancaster County, where I’m from, they got theirs,” he said, adding that other Pennsylvania counties will likely be “relying on these funds in response to COVID-19 that the federal government sent.” “So it would be historic for a governor to put things into a federal-related program,” he said. “I question whether he has the ability to do that.” “So does he mean he’s going to cut funding for other vital programs that the state provides for?” he asked. “Human services, abused kids, kids with developmental disabilities.” Martin also said Pennsylvania had “one of the most draconian lockdowns of all the states,” blasting Wolf for shutting down “mom and pop businesses.” “As a matter of fact, we had the only state that didn’t allow real estate to occur,” he said, mentioning the controversy related to the state’s shadowy business waiver program. “Plus, he created an arbitrary waiver process where he gave about 6,100 of hand-chosen businesses across many industries the ability to continue to operate while shutting down the vast majority of our economy,” Martin added. Lancaster County officials are weighing the possibility of moving ahead with reopening, in violation of Wolf’s orders, as are officials in Beaver County and Lebanon. Columbia County commissioners sent a letter to the governor on Wednesday, informing him of their intention to begin reopening on Friday.

Delta Air Lines is retiring its Boeing Co. 777 jumbo jets and replacing them with Airbus SE aircraft — another victim of the coronavirus. The aircraft will be taken out of service by the end of the year, the airline said on Thursday. “The retirement will accelerate the airline’s strategy to simplify and modernize its fleet, while continuing to operate newer, more cost-efficient aircraft,” Delta said in the MarketWatch report. “Delta will continue flying its fleet of long-haul, next-generation Airbus A350-900s, which burn 21 percent less fuel per seat than the 777s they will replace, the airline said,” MarketWatch reported. Boeing was already in turmoil before the virus after the grounding of its 737 Max aircraft after two fatal crashes that killed more than 300 people over a relatively short period of time. MarketWatch reported on Delta’s coronavirus challenge: Like its peers around the world, Delta has responded to the economic devastation caused by the coronavirus by cutting capacity and costs, furloughing employees, and parking aircraft and considering early aircraft retirements to reduce its operational complexity and cost. Delta said Thursday it has parked more than 650 mainline and regional aircraft to match the decimated demand. Despite the reduction in international passenger air travel, Delta’s 777 fleet had been busy. Since late April, the “workhorse” plane “has flown dozens of trips from Chicago and Los Angeles to Frankfurt to deliver mail to U.S. military troops abroad; operated between the U.S. and Asia to deliver thousands of pounds of critical, life-saving supplies to aid in the COVID-19 response; and carried thousands of U.S. citizens back to the U.S. from Sydney, Mumbai, Manila and other cities around the world,” the company said. CNBC reported on Delta’s CEO Ed Bastian’s memo on the development: CEO Ed Bastian said in a staff memo that the airline aims to eliminate its daily cash burn by the end of the year as the pandemic’s toll on air travel continues. Delta shares were down more than 3 percent in midmorning trading, more sharply than the S&P 500′s 1percent drop. The Atlanta-based airline said it has halved its daily cash burn to $50 million a day this month, as planned, by cutting flights and reducing other expenses. “Our principal financial goal for 2020 is to reduce our cash burn to zero by the end of the year, which will mean, for the next two to three years, a smaller network, fleet and operation in response to substantially reduced customer demand,” Bastian’s memo said.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) on Thursday claimed President Donald Trump has taken a harder line against Communist China in an effort to divert attention from possible wrongdoing by his administration in response to the Wuhan virus pandemic. “What the president is saying about China is interesting — it’s an interesting diversion,” Pelosi said in a press briefing on Capitol Hill.  Pelosi made the remark as she lashed out at President Trump and congressional Republicans, who oppose the House Democrats $3 trillion stimulus package. The 1,815-page Heroes Act bill includes various progressive provisions, as Breitbart News reported: As Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC) pointed out, the bill has “70 appropriations in excess of a billion dollars each.” “When you walk out of secret negotiations with an 1800 page, $3 trillion bill that thas no chance of becoming law, why is that portrayed as an accomplishment?” Norman asked, rhetorically. Today's proposal by @SpeakerPelsoi has over 70 appropriations in excess of a billion dollars each. When you walk out of secret negotiations with an 1800 page, $3 trillion bill that has no chance of becoming law, why is that portrayed as an accomplishment? pic.twitter.com/VzEm9tLS9t — Rep. Ralph Norman (@RepRalphNorman) May 12, 2020  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has repeatedly expressed that the bill has no chance of passing the upper chamber. McConnell singled out what he called “the cherry on top” — provisions helping legal marijuana businesses. Hours earlier, McConnell called Pelosi’s package a “totally unserious effort” to address the coronavirus pandemic. He said Democrats had put out a “seasonal catalog of left-wing oddities and called it a coronavirus relief bill.” Congress has approved nearly $3 trillion in recent weeks to address the country’s twin economic and health crises, including money for coronavirus testing. Republicans have expressed worries about burgeoning budget deficits and said lawmakers should evaluate how the initial dollars are being spent before moving fresh legislation. They also want to see whether the economy begins to recover as some states begin easing restrictions that have kept many businesses shuttered. Friday’s House vote will come as 36 million Americans have applied for unemployment benefits since the virus hit the U.S. In addition, 1.4 million people in the U.S. have had confirmed cases of the virus and more than 85,000 have died. The Associated Press contributed to this report. 

With the warm-weather state of Florida already open for business, the University of Florida has offered its facilities for pro sports looking for a place to play. Florida Athletic Director Scott Stricklin jumped in to offer his university’s facilities after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said that all professional sports are welcome in the Sunshine State, ESPN reported. “I’ve already spoke with some of our colleges, like the University of Florida,” DeSantis said in an appearance on Thursday. “They got a great football stadium, the Swamp, that’s not used on Sundays. So, if an NFL team needs a place to land, we could work that out too.” Stricklin sad he “reached out” to the governor’s office to remind him that the University of Florida has world class facilities. “Our priority is the well-being of Gator student-athletes, staff and fans, and we are working toward the day when we can once again engage with those groups safely on campus,” Strickln said in his statement on Thursday. “Following Governor DeSantis’ comment yesterday inviting other pro teams to participate in our state, I reached out to remind him that UF and Gainesville have world class health care facilities, an iconic football stadium, a state-of-the-art basketball arena and a brand-new baseball ballpark within two hours of cities with professional franchises. We’ve been receiving excellent guidance from our state and health care officials, and when those groups believe it is safe to host college and pro sporting events in Florida, we will be prepared to do so.” The school, though, remains closed to in-person classes, and the school’s sports programs are still on hold for now. However, with the state beginning its phase one re-opening process, that is expected to change soon. Follow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston.

Homeless men slept crowded in a shelter hallway Tuesday after being transferred from subway stations as part of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s plan to get them help. The single men’s intake at the Bellevue Men’s Shelter became “overrun” and many of the homeless would not get into a bed after being forced off the trains, a police officer with the Department of Homeless Services told the New York Post. The situation caused tension because there was no room to spread out, the anonymous officer explained, adding, “As you can see, this is not social distancing,” referencing the photo of the scene. More photos reportedly showed squalid conditions with people sleeping on the trash-strewn floor, nearly all of whom were not wearing masks. However, de Blasio praised officials Tuesday for getting the homeless off the streets and into shelters where he claimed the majority were “accepting help.” The crowded conditions were a result of the city being forced to close the trains for cleaning every morning between one and five a.m., according to the Post. “If the first week is any indication this is a game changer. I think it could fundamentally change the future of homelessness in the city for the better,” de Blasio said. However, it remained unclear whether some of the 1,258 homeless people who went from the subway into a shelter recently were possibly going in and out of the system repeatedly, the outlet noted. Following his order for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) to come up with a cleaning plan, Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) said in April that essential workers should not have to worry about riding the train during the pandemic. “Respect the essential workers. That is disgusting what is happening on those subway cars. It’s disrespectful to the essential workers who need to ride the subway system. … They deserve better, they will have better,” he said. Thursday, mayor’s office spokesman Avery Cohen called the situation at Bellevue Men’s Shelter “absolutely unacceptable,” adding that the photos did “not accurately reflect the quality of our outreach work.” “We immediately addressed the situation, providing a bed for all those in the picture, and conducted an investigation to ensure it does not happen again,” he concluded.

President Donald Trump is extending border rules barring the entry of people who might be carrying China’s coronavirus disease, according to the New York Times. The rule is likely to block nearly all blue-collar illegal migration from poor southern nations, especially if China’s disease sparks a mass migration toward U.S. jobs and healthcare. The rule was first set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on March 21 for 30 days. It was extended on April 20, the NYT said, adding: [A] new order under review by several government agencies is intended to extend the restrictions indefinitely. Once issued by Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the director of the C.D.C., the border restrictions would stay in effect until he decides the virus no longer poses a threat. … “I am extending the duration of the order until I determine that the danger of further introduction of Covid-19 into the United States has ceased to be a danger to the public health,” a copy of the draft order obtained by The New York Times reads. While C.D.C. officials will review the dangers posed by the virus to the American public every 30 days, the new order essentially means that the border will be closed to immigrants until Mr. Redfield explicitly says otherwise — not the other way around. The report was welcomed by Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies. He said, via Twitter:
“Border Patrol arrests of aliens with the Wuhan coronavirus make clear the logic and need for CBP to continue to exercise its Title 42 public health authority. As long as you have to stay home, smugglers and migrants should, too.”  Combined with the economic turmoil caused by the coronavirus crash and reforms border enforcement, the rule has almost completely ended cross-border asylum efforts. The Washington Post reported May 13: However, migrants and the cartel-backed coyotes are reviving efforts to sneak migrants through the border zone. “Laredo Sector Border Patrol agents disrupted a human smuggling attempt involving 25 migrants in a tractor-trailer rig. The interdiction occurred at the Interstate 35 checkpoint located between Laredo and San Antonio, Texas,” Breitbart News reported May 15. The curbs will help prevent migrants from taking some of the jobs needed by millions of unemployed Americans. However, Trump’s administration has yet to curb the inflow of white-collar migrants. On April 22, Trump announced that his agency deputies would review the wide variety of visa worker programs. These programs allow businesses to keep a population of roughly 1.5 million foreign contractors in white-collar jobs, and at least 400,000 migrants in seasonal blue-collar and pink-collar jobs. Public opinion has shifted strongly against mass migration, so a bipartisan front of #AllofUScare billionaires is using Christian & patriotic themes to help preserve their supply of wage-cutting workers & rent-raising consumers. https://t.co/dHO5CSD7IK — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) May 1, 2020 

Lauren Witzke, a Republican candidate for Senate in the Delaware race against Democrat Chris Coons, is partnering with Glory City Fellowship Church in Delmar, Delaware, on Sunday in defiance of the state’s continued lockdown order, which deems churches non-essential businesses during the coronavirus outbreak. Joy Hill, a native of Delaware, is pastor of the church. “Pastor Hill has graciously decided to open her church to Christians in Delaware who have been denied their right to worship God freely due to the COVID-19 pandemic,” Witzke told Breitbart News. “We are grateful that she has bravely stepped forward to stand up for God-fearing Delawareans and our campaign is excited to worship with her this Sunday.” “America was told that the shutdowns were meant to ‘flatten the curve,’” Witzke said. “But now, radical left governors like [Delaware’s] John Carney and others around the country are using COVID-19 as a means of political control.” “The Witzke campaign, unlike Senator Chris Coons, will not sit idly by while the government deprives Americans of their most basic rights, and we look forward to leading the charge in reopening places of worship and businesses in Delaware and across America,” Witzke told Breitbart News. “I am opening my church because I see a downward spiral to our economy and communities,” Hill told Breitbart News. “As a pastor I have a responsibility to lead my congregation by example and in a way that I feel best serves them and their families.” “Delaware has been closed since the middle of March and Pastors have abided by the mandates of our Governor,” Hill said. “Now it is nearing the end of May and there are no plans or directives to reopen our churches.” “The First amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees us the right to worship without goverment interference,” Hill said. “As Governor Carney establishes new regulations and restrictions such as ‘Contact Tracers,’ I feel the citizens of Delaware must begin to push back and react in a manner that forces our government to remember we hired them.”   “Many individuals in our communities rely on churches and ministries for economic help, for counseling, and personal interaction that cannot be achieved via live stream services,” Hill said. “I am not willing to continue to be deprived of my rights or allow the double standards that we are experiencing to continue.” “If you are a Delawarean who has been deprived of your God-given right to worship, join us this Sunday to exercise your First Amendment rights and show the government that you won’t be subject its tyrannical overreach,” Witzke wrote on the church’s Facebook page.  The service will be held from 10:30 a.m. to noon on Sunday at the church, located at 36270 Old Stage Road, Delmar, Delaware.

Institutes of higher education are in the business of educating, but California community colleges are focused on suing the federal government for not providing money to students attending these schools who are not citizens but are protected from deportation for being in the country illegally through the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). Close to a million DACA recipients — or “dreamers” as open borders advocates have dubbed them — attend these colleges and deserve money from the government, according to the Los Angeles Times: California Community Colleges Chancellor Eloy Ortiz Oakley and the system’s Board of Governors filed suit this week in U.S. District Court in San Francisco against the Department of Education and Secretary Betsy DeVos over eligibility restrictions placed on the use of federal aid money for students, arguing that the restrictions are unconstitutional. “The Department of Education ignored the intent of the CARES Act to give local colleges discretion to aid students most affected by the pandemic, and instead has arbitrarily excluded as many as 800,000 community college students,” Oakley said in a statement. The CARES Act, approved by Congress March 27, set aside $14 billion for higher education relief. At least half of the money must go directly to students in the form of emergency grants. Guidance from the Department of Education said that only students who are eligible for federal financial aid can get assistance, which leaves out DACA recipients, “students without high school diplomas; students enrolled in non-credit programs; and students who fail to maintain satisfactory academic progress.” The Times reported that that the number of students with those statuses numbers 500,000, including 70,000 “undocumented students.” The school system argued that those left out include veterans, students with disabilities, and students training to be healthcare workers and first responders, according to the chancellor’s office. “Many students who may be most in need of relief will be deprived of assistance during this public health crisis,” the lawsuit claimed. “Congress provided higher education institutions with unfettered flexibility to distribute the relief to affected students as they deemed appropriate, imposing no eligibility limitations,” it said. “There is no persuasive legal support for the proposition that Congress intended the CARES Act to create an entitlement for DACA recipients and others who are otherwise ineligible for federal public benefits,” Angela Morabito, a spokeswoman for the Department of Education, said in a statement. “The CARES Act clearly ties eligibility for this funding to Title IV eligibility… it is absurd that special interests want the department to fabricate a basis to send U.S. taxpayer money to non-citizens, especially given how many American students are in need of this emergency relief.” Kevin Wallsten, a political science professor at Cal State Long Beach who studies policymaking, said in the Times report that the suit might be difficult to win because of the “tremendous deference” given to federal agencies implementing congressional laws. Meanwhile, while institutes of higher education are trying to get money for students, some wealthy universities have yet to return money received from the CARES Act, including Columbia University, as Breitbart News reported: Columbia University has yet to announce whether it will accept $12.8 million in federal coronavirus relief that it is eligible for under the CARES Act despite its $11 billion endowment. Several other Ivy League institutions, including Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, have already announced that they will reject federal funding following pressure from President Donald Trump and the general public. According to a report by the Daily Pennsylvanian, Columbia University has yet to reject $12.8 million in federal funding that they are eligible for under the CARES Act, a coronavirus relief program passed by Congress in March.

UFC commentator and podcaster Joe Rogan, said he is thinking of fleeing to Texas as California lawmakers continue to crush the state’s economy with coronavirus lockdowns. Rogan, who is an avowed liberal and supported Socialist Senator Bernie Sanders for president, declared that California has become so restrictive of freedom and commerce that it is “no longer a good place to live.” During his Wednesday podcast, Rogan told viewers that he really is thinking of moving to the Lone Star State. “I might move to Texas,” he said. “Here’s the thing. If California continues to be this restrictive, I don’t know if this is a good place to live. First of all, it’s extremely expensive. The taxes here are ridiculous. And if they really say that we can’t do stand-up [comedy] until 2022 or some shit like that, I might jet. I’m not kidding. “If they won’t let us do the [Comedy] Store, but we could do stand-up other places, why would we stay here?” he said. About a minute and a half into the clip, Rogan called comedian Bryan Callen who railed against L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti’s absurd lockdowns. Callen wondered “how do we fight” against Garcetti’s outrageous decision to close L.A. through July and maybe into August. “Who is deciding that, some health official based on what data?” Callen said. “This is what happens when politicians are doing this for our, quote, unquote ‘for our own good.’ We live in a country where my government doesn’t represent me. I have no recourse here.” Rogan added that the coronavirus policies coming out of Los Angeles simply make no logical sense whatsoever. The two also noted that it makes no sense to shut down the entire state when the coronavirus primarily affects people over 80 years of age. “The average age that people die from this disease is older than the average age people die, ” Rogan said.  Rogan’s comments echo that of Barstool Sports chief Dave Portnoy who recent posted a social media video ripping the lockdowns that he says are now hurting the country more than they are helping. In a blog post about Rogan’s podcast, Portnoy insisted that the coronavirus policies have become dangerous. “As every day goes by it seems like people are more and more confused and things not only continually change, but also do a complete 180,” Portnoy wrote on Thursday. “‘Travel restrictions to China are bullshit’ to ‘don’t leave your house until August’. ‘It’s not worse than the flu’ to ‘it’s a global pandemic’. ‘Don’t bother with masks, they won’t help you that much’ to ‘If you go outside without a mask you’ll be arrested’. And all of these things are coming from the same people.” Follow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston.

President Donald Trump wants to add one billion medical masks into the national stockpile, according to a senior administration official. The national stockpile once had 100 million N-95 masks, according to an official, but was depleted after the H1-N1 virus hit during the Obama administration. The stockpile only had 13 million masks in storage when the coronavirus hit the United States in January. “It was severely depleted after H1-N1, never replenished,” an official said, and added, “We have an aspiration to eventually have a billion of those.” The White House plans to work with the Department of Defense, FEMA, and the Department of Health and Human Services to increase the amount of personal protective equipment, masks, and gowns, as well as critical care drugs, testing supplies, and ventilators for any future medical emergency. “We’re going to have a much more robust, more capable, and less vulnerable strategic national stockpile,” an official said. The administration will also work to strengthen and improve supply chains. The new stockpile would not only prepare for a possible future resurgence of the coronavirus or any other respiratory disease. It would also drive additional manufacturing in the United States to fuel the American economic comeback. “The more we stimulate the domestic supply and bring the supply into America the more that industry and the people will have the masks and protective equipment they need to return to work,” an official said.

A policy-focused Democrat-led House panel, in a move described as unprecedented by the chairwoman, allowed a witness, federal vaccine specialist Dr. Rick Bright who claims to be a whistleblower, to bring a lawyer to counsel him during his testimony Thursday against U.S. President Donald Trump’s response to the novel coronavirus pandemic. “I think this is the first time,” Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA), the chairwoman of the House Energy and Commerce’s Subcommittee on Health holding the hearing, conceded, later adding, “We have another first here.” Eshoo claimed she had no idea his lawyer would accompany Dr. Bright during his testimony until Thursday morning. “When Dr. Bright came in this morning with his attorney, she requested a microphone. So as a courtesy, I’ve extended the microphone Now, she’s not a witness … we are not going to ask her questions. She’s simply accompanying her client.” Dr. Bright brought Debra Katz, the lawyer who became known for representing Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when she testified against the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh with claims of sexual assault. Kavanaugh’s accuser Ford first went to Chairwoman Eshoo with the sexual misconduct allegations. Although the Democrat leadership of the House panel argued that Katz was not a witness, the lawyer interjected when lawmakers questioned Dr. Bright, directing him on what to answer and sometimes even answering for him. The lawyer’s presence made the event look like the failed impeachment hearings to remove Trump from office. Republicans argued that the House Energy and Commerce’s Subcommittee on Oversight & Investigations (O&I) is the proper venue for a witness to bring their counsel, not the policy-focused panel holding the hearing. Rep. Greg Walden from Oregon, the top Republican on the full House Energy and Commerce Committee, noted that it was unorthodox for a witness to bring a lawyer to a non-O&I hearing. Walden convinced the chairwoman to follow some of the O&I protocols for when a witness brings a counsel, including having the lawyer identified herself, something that the Democrats were seemingly not planning to do. At the beginning of the hearing, there was no nameplate identifying Katz at the witness table. Unlike what is done at O&I when a whistleblower testifies, Chairwoman Eshoo refused to swear the witness in. “All witnesses know that it’s illegal to lie to congress and in our subcommittee, unlike O&I — they’re the only subcommittee that, I mean, it’s a practice, it’s a tradition, but we don’t swear people in,” she said. Earlier during the hearing, Walden told the chairwoman: It is extraordinarily unusual to have a government witness, a private individual, with private counsel at the witness table and with a microphone. And so I’m just trying to get s clarification for future precedence-setting from the committee. Chairwoman Eshoo acknowledged that a witness bringing a lawyer to a non-O&I hearing is unprecedented. Democrats and Dr. Bright himself acknowledged he was not testifying in his whistleblower capacity, but as a federal employee expressing his personal views, not those of HHS. Rep. Walden stressed that allowing a witness to bring his or her lawyer to policy hearing set a precedent. “The witness is not here in his whistleblower capacity,” Walden said, later adding, “We just don’t do this type of activity at this and the other policy committee.” Dr. Bright has come forward as a so-called whistleblower claiming he was demoted for exposing U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) practices that posed public-health risk during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. He has hired anti-Kavanaugh Katz and Lisa Banks to help him make his case. Republicans accused the Democrat chairwoman of scheduling the hearing before Dr. Bright filed a whistleblower complaint last week. The GOP lawmakers said they learned of the hearing from a tweet. The U.S. Office of Special Counsel has reportedly determined there were “reasonable grounds” to believe the Bright’s ouster was retaliatory and recommended that he be allowed to remain at his job until a probe is complete. HHS is reportedly reviewing the office’s determination. Before his demotion, Dr. Bright served as the director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) at HHS. He is now a National Institutes of Health (NIH) senior adviser. NIH is also an HHS component.

Chinese state media on Wednesday asserted that federalism, multi-party democracy, and respect for individual privacy would make it impossible for the United States to defeat the Wuhan coronavirus, since Washington cannot dictate top-down solutions for the entire country or micro-monitor American citizens the way Beijing does. The Global Times made the usual effort to stir up partisan divisions and blame the U.S. for trying to “pass the buck to China” instead of agreeing to forget where the coronavirus came from before getting to the meat of its argument, which was that Americans are paying a steep price for not being obedient drones governed by an absolute central authority: The epidemic fight must be a people’s war, but the Americans have not been fully mobilized to fight the coronavirus with science. It has taken a long and bumpy road for Americans to wear masks despite being such a simple thing. Only very recently were White House staffers ordered to wear masks. However, Washington’s attempt to politically mobilize the society hasn’t stopped for a moment. It’s working every minute to make supporting forced resumption of work a political correctness. The US government keeps telling its people not to be afraid of the epidemic, to go back to work and smear China. How can such a US defeat the virus? The number of deaths in the country has exceeded 82,000, and will soon surpass the iconic mark of 100,000. But the US hasn’t formed a unified fight against the epidemic within the country, nor is there a consistent strategy. The last round of social distancing measures only alleviated the epidemic. The US rushed to resume work and production without establishing a strong capability to track the infected. Constrained by the federal system, the US is weak in coordinating actions nationwide. The deformed party politics has further hindered the formation of a united epidemic fight. The US epidemic response has failed to match its scientific strength and superior public health conditions. It is fighting a chaotic battle, costing a lot while gaining little and ordinary people have become the biggest victims. Unfortunately, the most prevalent thing within the US now is to shirk responsibility and pass the buck to China. The world’s sole superpower is degenerating. The only way to “Make America Great Again” is to rebuild the spirit of science, which should start with subduing the novel coronavirus with science itself. What will defeat the virus is scientific prevention and control. The virus knows no borders; it will launch fatal attacks against countries with weaker defenses. China’s “blame the victim” efforts to shame other countries out of complaining about the virus China sent them is not much of a charm offensive, but it does give Chinese Communist Party (CCP) propaganda writers an easy script to stick to.  As for the worship of holy science as the antidote to political dissent, it demonstrates once again that the CCP is a keen student of American left-wing rhetoric and mainstream media coverage. Of course, it would never occur to a Communist that the reason American medicine is so vastly superior to their own — to the point where they had to steal every technological innovation of the past three decades through massive hacking and intellectual property theft campaigns — is precisely because the spirit of dissent, the urge to challenge consensus and unsettle dogmatic conclusions, nourishes scientific progress. As too many people in the Western world forget, science is about questions and technology is about answers. Contract tracing to contain the pandemic is not impossible under a federalist system with respect for individual dignity. NPR reported last week that 44 states and the District of Columbia have concrete plans to expand their contract tracing task forces, with over 66,000 workers expected to be on the job when the plans are fully implemented.  Some of those states noted their contact tracing workforces could be considerably larger because county health departments can only estimate their staffing levels and some have medical staffers who work on tracing in addition to their primary duties. Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has deployed 500 staffers to help with state and local tracing programs and is planning to send out another 650. Plans have been discussed to create a massive federal contract tracing agency to supplement and coordinate state efforts.

A New Jersey man who knew first-hand how important it is to stay connected with relatives started collecting iPads to enable the elderly in care homes and hospitals to see their families. Wildwood Crest, New Jersey, resident John Lynch recently had to say his farewell to his 92-year-old father — who died of a non-coronavirus related illness — over FaceTime. Because Lynch’s father was in a memory care unit in Atlanta, he could not visit him in person before his death, CBS News reported. “In the memory of my father, Hugh Lynch, I want to help people in the hospitals communicate with their family members,” he said. After Lynch learned that some nurses used their personal cell phones to connect patients with their families, Lynch was inspired to help others who have faced similar situations. Lynch’s charity, Lunch with Lynch Foundation — which normally focuses on providing learning experiences for children and providing assistance for families dealing with life-threatening illnesses — is now making it its mission to donate iPads to health care facilities where patients cannot see their families in person. More than 60 iPads have been collected through Operation Connection: The iPad Project so far. The first 20 iPads went to Cape May County Medical Center, and the remaining 40 will be distributed to Cape May County nursing homes and other facilities across the country. The foundation is still accepting new or gently-used iPads as well as cash donations. “Our families have told us how important it is and how much they really appreciate the opportunity to see their loved ones and talk to them,” said Tom Piratzky, executive director of the Cape Regional Foundation.

President Donald Trump on Thursday visited a medical supply company in Pennsylvania, but he also had a message for the state’s governor. “We have to get your governor of Pennsylvania to start opening up a little bit,” Trump said. “You have areas of Pennsylvania that are barely affected and they want to keep them closed. You can’t do that.” The president spoke as many Republicans in the state are in open rebellion over Democrat Gov. Tom Wolf’s lockdowns as a result of the coronavirus. The president spoke to workers after visiting the Owens & Minor, Inc. Distribution Center, a 137-year-old American medical equipment distributor in Allentown, Pennsylvania. The president was not spotted wearing a mask, although he maintained social distancing from workers in the plant who wore masks. The president also boasted that the United States had just completed its ten millionth coronavirus test, boasting that they were leading the world in testing. “Could be that testing is, frankly, overrated, maybe it is overrated,” Trump said, but added that the country was producing the “best in the world.” He said that his critics and the media repeatedly demanded more testing, refusing to give him credit for producing record levels of testing. Some of the workers also laughed after Trump mocked the media, pointing them out in the back. “They don’t want to talk about it,” Trump said. “They are a disaster, but that’s ok. The people understand, and that’s all that really matters when you get down to it.” The president announced that he would continue adding medical supplies to the national stockpile, even after meeting the needs of the country for the coronavirus. He said former President Barack Obama’s administration left the stockpile empty after the H1N1 virus. The president also mocked “Sleepy Joe Biden for flubbing his description of the H1N1 virus, as “N1H1.” “You know who says that right?” Trump asked. “N1H1, who says that? Sleepy Joe Biden.” The president also spoke about the importance of manufacturing medical products in the United States. “The final step in rebuilding the stockpile is to bring critical manufacturing permanently back to America,” Trump said. “Wouldn’t that be nice?” He criticized previous American leaders for gutting manufacturing in the United States, making it difficult to get enough medical supplies to handle the pandemic. “Globalists, they want the globe to do well, but they don’t care about us, now we want everybody to do well but we have to take care of America first,” Trump said. Trump said that the virus was worse than the flu, commenting that he lost five people that he knew to the sickness. “They’re gone,” he said. “Terrible, terrible thing.”

Japanese Health Ministry found a 20-percent decrease in the number of suicides between April 2020 and April 2019, it revealed this week – a notable decline, particularly given that suicide hotlines report struggles to cope with demand. Japanese officials announced on Thursday that it would begin easing mobility restrictions set in place to contain the Chinese coronavirus, currently threatening the populations of nearly every nation on earth. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declared a state of emergency on April 7, set to expire on May 31, but announced this week that the rate of transmission was not as severe as expected, allowing the resumption of some business activity. At press time, Japan has documented 16,049 cases of coronavirus and 678 deaths. Unlike many other nations, including the United States, Japan did not institute a total ban on business and other activity, but did shut down its schools and give local governments discretion to shut down high-risk activity in densely populated areas. Tokyo’s TBS broadcaster reported that the Japanese government logged 1,455 suicides during April 2020, as opposed to 1,814 suicides during the same month of 2019, or about a 20-percent drop – the largest drop in five years. TBS posited that the stay-at-home recommendations and closed schools eliminated stressors on those struggling with mental health that would have otherwise triggered self-destructive activity, among them workplace pressures, bullying, and commutes. The Guardian, reporting on the numbers, noted that young adults not having to go to school may have prevented them from being exposed to bullying that may have inspired suicide. “The start of the academic year, in April in Japan, is a particularly stressful time for some, but its postponement due to the pandemic may have saved lives, at least temporarily,” the U.K. newspaper reported, citing a former official at the Japanese Federation of Inochi no Denwa, a coalition of suicide prevention organizations with a nationwide presence. “School is a pressure for some young people, but this April there is no such pressure,” Yukio Saito, the Federation of Inochi-no-Denwa former official, told the newspaper. “At home with their families, they feel safe.” The decline came as something of a surprise given the volume that suicide prevention agencies reported of demand from the general public. Japan’s Kyodo News reported on Thursday that the nation’s Inochi no Denwa, the suicide hotlines, are “struggling to manage the flood of calls they are receiving from people with coronavirus-linked health or financial concerns while also trying to ensure their all-important counselors remain virus-free.” “Many callers divulged fears about their job security due to business closures or a sharp fall in customer numbers, while others said they had suicidal thoughts after family members became infected with the virus,” Kyodo noted. One of the busiest Inochi no Denwa told Kyodo that as many as 80 percent of the calls they are currently receiving are related to Chinese coronavirus stress. As part of a larger trend, the decline in the national suicide rate in April reflects decreasing numbers documented in the past several years. Japan has one of the highest suicide rates in the world. In 2017, the Japanese Health Ministry published a survey finding that as many as one in four Japanese citizens had contemplated suicide. Women were likelier to admit contemplating suicide, but men were more likely to attempt it. This year, however, the Japanese government revealed that 2019 was the tenth straight in year in which it documented a decline in total suicides nationwide. In January, the government reported a 0.7-percent drop in the number of suicides per 100,000 people between 2018 and 2019. While the progress was encouraging to the government, those who operate suicide prevention groups noted that much work remained to be done. “The fact that 20,000 people still die by suicide a year is a very unusual situation and is nothing to be optimistic about,” Yasuyuki Shimizu of the Tokyo suicide-prevention nonprofit Lifelink told UPI. “Municipalities should do more to help their residents live their lives, and the government should support such policies more robustly.” Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.

An attendee of Thursday’s Reopen Minnesota protest outside of the governor’s mansion said he does not have an income due to the extended shutdown orders and said it is time to allow Americans to make “adult decisions,” adding, “It’s not healthy for me to be at home.” “I’m here today because I believe we need to open up Minnesota. I believe it’s safe for people to start working. We can make adult decisions,” the attendee told Breitbart News, explaining that he does not trust the media’s or government’s reporting on coronavirus tallies and adding that the media has done a “horrible” job reporting on the health and economic crisis. “They’re not on the people’s side,” he said of the media. “I’m not scared and don’t think anybody else should be. If they are, stay home. If they’re not, let’s open up. If they need help, I’ll help. Everybody’s at a different level,” he said, adding that mom and pop shops may need help to make their facilities safer. “You got to let people know we’ll help,” he said, explaining that the shutdown has affected him personally. “I need a job. I’m a bartender. I was working when this ended,” he said, adding, “If no one’s opening, I don’t get money.” “I don’t have income right now. I went through my $1,200. I had money saved up but that goes pretty fast. I was working before, so yeah. I want to start working,” he continued. “It’s not healthy for me to stay home.” “Open up. We know, we’re not going to play your political games,” the protester said in a message to Gov. Tim Walz (D). “This is bigger than Gov. Walz  and the next election,” he added. “This is changing the tide and freedoms in our county.” Walz on Wednesday announced “Stay Safe MN,” which allows some aspects of the state’s economy to reopen while keeping others shut down for the time being. Retail stores, for instance, can operate at a 50 percent capacity, but the order leaves restrictions on bars, restaurants, theaters, and hair salons in place. However, salons and restaurants could begin reopening as soon as June 1, the governor indicated. The order also allows individuals to gather in groups of ten or less. “The stay-at-home order is expiring and the dials are turning, but that doesn’t mean we are carefree and can return to the way things were,” Walz said. “It means we have to stay safe, take care, care for our own health, and care for our neighbor,” he added.

Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar on Thursday publicly criticized vaccine official Dr. Rick Bright for complaining to House Democrats about President Trump’s failure to prepare for the coronavirus pandemic. “Everything he’s complaining about was achieved. Everything he talks about was done,” Azar said, noting that Bright was echoing merely officials talking about the need for ventilators, a “Manhattan project for vaccines,” and acquiring personal protection equipment. Azar criticized Bright on Thursday as he left the White House for a trip with Trump to visit a Pennsylvania medical equipment distribution business. He noted that Bright was now complaining instead of working on the Operation Warp Speed project to develop a coronavirus vaccine. “Whose job was it to actually lead the development of vaccines?” Azar asked. “Dr. Bright. So while we’re launching Operation Warp Speed, he’s not showing up for work to be part of that.” Azar said that Bright was only repeating the same advice that everyone in the administration was proposing as the coronavirus hit the United States. “This is like somebody who was in a choir and is now trying to say he was a soloist back then,” he said. “What he was saying is what every single member of this administration was saying.” Azar said that Dr. Bright signed the application for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorization of the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat coronavirus, despite his complaints. “Literally he’s the sponsor of it,” Azar said. “His allegations do not hold water.” Trump also dismissed Bright’s House testimony on Thursday. “I’ll tell you what, to me, he’s nothing more than a really disgruntled, unhappy person,” Trump said, adding that he never met the doctor. “I don’t know him. I never met. I don’t want to meet him, but I watched him, and he looks like an angry, disgruntled employee who, frankly, according to some people, didn’t do a very good job.”

A RealClear Opinion Research poll released Thursday found 40 percent of families are more likely to choose to homeschool their children or engage in virtual learning once the coronavirus pandemic subsides. The survey asked parents, “Are you more or less likely to enroll your son or daughter in a homeschool, neighborhood homeschool co-op, or virtual school once the lockdowns are over?” Of the 626 parents who responded, 40.8 percent said they were “more likely” to do so, while 31.1 percent replied they were “less likely.” With political party as a factor, 45.7 percent of parents who said they would be “more likely” to homeschool identified as Democrat, while 42.3 percent identified as Republican. Among those parents who said they were “more likely” to homeschool, 36.3 percent were white, 50.4 percent were black, 38.2 percent were Hispanic, and 53.8 percent were Asian. NEW NATIONAL POLL:  40% of Families More Likely to Homeschool After Lockdowns End #SchoolChoice #Homeschool #EducationFreedom https://t.co/o5AsKGulh4 — American Federation for Children (@SchoolChoiceNow) May 14, 2020  The survey also questioned 2,122 registered voters on the issue of whether parents should be able to use tax dollars designated for education for the schooling of their choice. Among the respondents, 64 percent said they support that idea, including 59 percent of Democrats, 75.2 percent of Republicans, and 60.2 percent of Independents. Of the parents who said they support the concept of school choice, 64.4 percent were white, 67.6 percent were black, 63.4 percent were Hispanic, and 55.5 percent were Asian. Results of the poll appeared on the website of the American Federation for Children (AFC), which promotes school choice. U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was chairwoman of AFC prior to her nomination by President Donald Trump. John Schilling, president of AFC, said in a statement: Every single family with kids in school has been incredibly disrupted by the lockdowns. With 55 million students no longer in their normal educational setting, families are clearly considering new options and many are seeing the benefits of homeschooling and virtual schooling. Policymakers should note that there is a strong desire to have these and other educational options available to families, with both strong support for the general concept of school choice and even stronger support for a specific federal proposal, Education Freedom Scholarships. Schilling added many families are also seeing “the inadequacies of school districts that are too inflexible.” “Moreover, policymakers owe it to the taxpayers who are footing the $800 billion K-12 education bill to maximize their investment by ensuring every child has access to a quality education and outcomes are improved across the board,” he said. The poll was conducted April 18-21 and has a +/- 2.31 percent margin of error.

Fox News on Wednesday cited a study that found the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has jailed almost 500 people since the beginning of 2020 for talking about the Wuhan coronavirus.  The “crimes” committed by these political prisoners ranged from criticism of how the CCP handled the virus outbreak to innocuous observations that the funeral homes in Wuhan have exceptionally long lines these days. The censorship report noted by Fox News was published last week by the U.S.-based China Digital Times (CDT), which included both world-famous outrages like the muzzling of Wuhan doctors Li Wenliang and Ai Fen and lesser-known arrests of citizen journalists and ordinary people who might be described as Internet randos in the United States: According to statistics gathered by netizens, from January 1 to April 4, the national mourning period, there were 484 cases of individuals charged with crimes related to speaking out about the coronavirus. For example, a female lawyer in Henan was punished by the Lawyers Association for reposting an article entitled “Long Lines Outside Wuhan Funeral Home,” and retired Beijing University of Science and Technology lecturer Chen Zhaozhi was arrested. Ren Zhiqiang, who last month described Xi Jinping as a “clown who stripped naked and insisted on continuing being emperor,” is presently undergoing review and investigation by the Beijing Xicheng District Disciplinary Commission for serious violations of the law and disciplinary code. Following in the footsteps of Li Wenliang, another Hubei doctor was punished for “inappropriate speech.” Renowned science writer Dr. Yu Xiangdong received an official, red letter-headed written admonishment that mentioned him by name. Dr. Yu’s actionably inappropriate speech was described by the censors as “cold and sarcastic humor which resulted in serious negative consequences.” Some of the coronavirus censorship arrests occurred in the hot spots of CCP oppression, such as Hong Kong and Xinjiang province, home of the Uyghur Muslims, but CDT noted that “constant oppression of personal freedoms has unconsciously become a part of everyday life.” “Even entertainment shows that have nothing to do with politics are being rigorously scrutinized and censored for political content,” the report noted. Among the topics most likely to get Chinese subjects arrested by the speech police are listed the names of coronavirus victims, posts that dispute the official totals of infected and dead, first-hand accounts of the situation in Wuhan during the worst months of the epidemic, and posts that complain about oppressive censorship. Referring to someone who has already been censored or arrested is evidently a good way to capture the CCP’s baleful attention. Fox News described one of the most recent censorship arrests, a constitutional lawyer named Zhang Xuezhong who dared to criticize how the CCP responded to the coronavirus outbreak: In his letter posted on WeChat, Zhang Xuezhong, 43, said China’s absence of nonstate media and the prevention of medical experts from providing advice to the public showed that “the government’s long-term tight control society and people has almost completely destroyed the organization and self-help capabilities of Chinese society.” He denounced China’s government as backward and said “the outbreak and spread of the COVID-19 epidemic is a good illustration of the problem.” “The best way to fight for freedom of expression is for everyone to speak as if we already have freedom of speech,” Zhang wrote on the WeChat post alongside the letter. Zhang called for the drafting of a new constitution that would respect “modern political principles” instead of the primitive tyranny currently governing China — a reform that would implicitly dethrone the current despot, Xi Jinping, and his court. The day after he began circulating his trenchant open letter to Communist officials, three police cars arrived at his home in Shanghai to haul him away.  The South China Morning Post reported that he was released on Monday after “questioning” and has not responded to requests for comment about his arrest, although he did post a message on WeChat thanking his friends for their concern and saying he needed to get some rest.

Jersey Shore beaches will reopen in time for Memorial Day weekend, Gov. Phil Murphy (D) announced on Thursday. “The Jersey Shore will be open in time for Memorial Day Weekend, with social distancing guidelines in place,” the governor announced. “The Shore is central to our Jersey identity and we want to ensure that families can safely enjoy it this summer”: #BREAKING: Gov. Phil Murphy says the #JerseyShore will be open in time for Memorial Day Weekend, with social distancing guidelines in place — News12NJ (@News12NJ) May 14, 2020  Murphy said they “want everyone to have fun” but also to remain safe. In order to do both, the amount of beachgoers will be restricted and social distancing will be extended to beaches. New Jersey beaches must establish capacity limitations, allowing local leaders to determine the methods. They will also need to enforce social distancing measures, prohibit contact sports and “organized events,” and implement proper and regular sanitization, per the governor’s outlines: NEW…Governor announces plan to open beaches for Memorial Day weekend. pic.twitter.com/BpuOivU2WK — Kurt Siegelin (@kurtsiegelin) May 14, 2020  The order will allow shower pavilions, changing areas, and restrooms to open, but they “must be regularly and properly cleaned.” He is also directing the opening of restroom facilities at parks, but with strict sanitization requirements. Boardwalk restaurants will only be able to operate for take out or delivery, “but the rides, arcades, games, and other draws must remain closed,” the governor continued. That includes playgrounds and visitor centers, but Murphy stressed that the closures are only temporary. “This is not a life-sentence here. We could have dramatically different reality a month from today,” he said. Murphy added that officials are not ordering visitors to wear masks, but they “highly recommend” people to wear a face covering. The order goes into effect Friday, May 22.

The White House on Thursday said there were currently no preparations to put House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) into power should both President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence get infected with the coronavirus. “You know that’s not even something we’re addressing. We’re keeping the president healthy. We’re keeping the vice president healthy; and they are healthy at this moment, and they will continue to be,” White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said when asked by reporters at the White House about the presidential line of succession. Leftists have long fantasized about a “President Nancy Pelosi” if Trump and Pence were impeached. But as the third government official in the line of succession, Pelosi would take the lead in the unlikely scenario that both Pence and Trump were killed or incapacitated by the coronavirus. But McEnany did not seriously entertain the idea repeatedly proposed by reporters in the White House driveway on Thursday. “The president’s healthy. The vice president’s healthy, and I think that’s something all reporters should be celebrating and the American people as well,” McEnany said.

Pennsylvania counties are weighing the possibility of reopening on Friday despite Gov. Tom Wolf’s (D) threats. Several county leaders across Pennsylvania have been in talks to defy the governor’s order and charge ahead with reopening without the governor’s permission. The discussions drew a pointed response from Wolf, who on Monday threatened both counties and business owners who would dare reopen in violation of his decrees. “To those politicians who decide to cave in to this coronavirus, they need to understand the consequences of their cowardly act,” Wolf said, warning that he would withhold federal stimulus discretionary funding from counties operating outside of his orders. He also said the state could revoke health department certificates, liquor licenses, and certificates of occupancy from businesses that follow suit. Leaders of three counties — Lebanon, Beaver, and Lancaster — are weighing the possibility of forging ahead and reopening on Friday, alongside the 13 counties Wolf formally authorized to move from red to yellow. Lebanon officials indicated on Monday that they were planning to move ahead, but the final vote to do so is scheduled for Friday. Commissioners in Lancaster and Beaver counties have also indicated that they support moving ahead, but according to PennLive, “it was still unclear whether they were going to take a formal action or, without that, what effect their statements would have”: The last pockets of resistance Wednesday were in Lebanon and Lancaster, two south central counties that have new case rates still well in excess of the administration’s threshold for starting to reopen, and Beaver County on the Ohio line, which is the only county in western Pennsylvania that is not scheduled to move to yellow by Friday under the governor’s plan. The two Lebanon County commissioners supporting a Friday reopening said only businesses that wanted to take part would need to do so, knowing that they could face some consequences from the state, including losing liquor licenses or other state-required certifications. But they said they wanted to give their constituents that right. “Many people are saying they can’t go on living off their credit line, skipping meals and waiting in lines for food,” Lebanon County Chairman Bob Phillips said, adding that “mom and pop shops” should be given the same opportunities as giant retailers. “Come this Friday, we plan on opening because we’ve been getting hundreds of emails, text messages and phone calls that these business owners are on the brink of closing down,” Beaver County Board of Commissioners Daniel Camp III said on Wednesday. Lebanon reported 849 cases of the coronavirus and related 19 deaths as of Thursday morning. Lancaster had 2,325 cases and 172 deaths — 150 of those deaths stemming from nursing homes. Over two-thirds of coronavirus cases in Beaver County, 509 of 364, stem from nursing homes, including employees of such facilities. Seventy-one of the 78 reported virus deaths in the county also stem from nursing homes. Wolf’s threats appeared to cause some county leaders to back down. Commissioners of Pennsylvania’s capital county Dauphin decided on Wednesday to refrain from moving to the yellow phase of reopening on Friday, instead voting to create a task force designed to formulate a plan to reopen the local economy. Similarly, leaders of Pennsylvania’s Susquehanna County, while frustrated with Wolf’s orders, are refraining from reopening in defiance of the governor’s orders, contending that they must operate within the law. “To be effective, it has to be legal. We just can’t do things to defy,” Susquehanna County Commissioner Alan Hall said, according to Fox 56. However, the threats did little to stop Columbia County officials, who passed a resolution to bring the county into the yellow phase of reopening, beginning on Friday. “We don’t want to be rogue. We do not. But we’re also hearing the passionate pleas from our business community,”  Columbia County commissioner Chris Young said. “They’re saying, ‘I need to get back to work.'” The resolution reads in part: We trust our business owners and citizens to make the right decision for their individual circumstances. The Resolution we Commissioners passed today requires in no way for any “Non-Life-Sustaining” business to open its doors for business. Neither does our Resolution require our citizens to patronize such business. Rather, we Commissioners believe strongly that our businesses and citizens have the requisite common sense to determine what is best for themselves. This is not a mandate. Commissioners also blasted Wolf over the potential of retaliation, adding that it would be “out of character” and “disrespectful to the great people of Columbia County” to rip licenses away from business owners.

Federal agents questioned Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) in recent days over her husband’s decision to sell stock ahead of the coronavirus outbreak. Feinstein, a senior Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, confirmed on Thursday that she had spoken “voluntarily” with agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) regarding that matter, according to Politico. The California Democrat also purportedly handed over documents to federal agents to indicate she had “no involvement” in her husband’s decision to sell off between $500,000 to $1 million in a biotech company, Allogene Therapeutics, this past January. The sale, which coincided with the stock trading at its 2020 low, came shortly before the market tumbled because of the coronavirus pandemic. Feinstein’s admission came on the same day that Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) temporarily stepped down as chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee because of an ongoing investigation into his own unloading of stock in February. Burr, who is not only facing a Department of Justice (DOJ) probe, but one from the Securities and Exchange Commission as well, made the announcement after the FBI seized his cell phone on Wednesday at his Washington, DC, home. Law enforcement officials are supposedly attempting to establish a timeline of when the senator decided to sell upwards of $1.72 million in stock this past February. At the time, Burr was receiving nearly daily briefings from the Senate Intelligence Committee on the coronavirus threat, and there is speculation he may have acted on information privy only to members of his panel. Even more troubling is that Burr’s brother-in-law, a political appointee of President Donald Trump, also dumped upwards of $280,000 in stock on the same day as the senator. Unlike Burr, who unloaded stock mainly in travel and hospitality companies that were hardest hit due to the coronavirus travel restrictions, Feinstein’s former shares in Allogene have since increased in value. It remains unclear if the DOJ has opened an investigation into Feinstein and her husband for the sale.

Everyone wants college football to return in the fall. Though, some are willing to do more than others to make that happen. During an appearance on Pro Football Talk, West Virginia University President Gordon Gee made a bold prediction and pledge regarding the college football season. “We are going to play football in the fall, I really do believe that,” Gee said. “Even if I have to suit up.” Gee, 76, will likely not have to don helmet and cleats. Though it’s reassuring that he believes actual athletes will be doing so. “We’re going to do it based on what is safe, what is healthy for our fans, what is healthy for our student-athletes,” Gee asserted. “But I do believe that we will play football.” Much of what will determine whether college football goes on, will come down to fall classes. If classes are in session, then the games should resume. If not, then the NCAA further opens themselves up to the accurate charge that their Division I student-athletes are much more athlete, than student. Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn

Commissioners of Pennsylvania’s Columbia County sent a letter to Gov. Tom Wolf (D) on Wednesday, informing him of the county’s decision to begin reopening on Friday despite his threats. “As the duly elected Commissioners of Columbia County, this letter will serve to inform you of our intention to move from the Red Phase to the Yellow Phase of your COVID-19 Phased Reopening Plan, effective May 15, 2020,” the commissioners wrote in the letter. The red phase, under Wolf’s reopening plan, bars non-life essential businesses from operating. He has since extended that order to June 4. Columbia County has not been included in the two batches of counties Wolf has authorized to move into the yellow phase, which slowly eases restrictions, allowing some businesses to reopen, albeit with certain restrictions. Columbia County commissioners told the governor that citizens have “responded in good faith and good intention” to the implementation of the original stay-at-home order and noted that hospitals and healthcare providers do not lack the capacity or equipment needed to treat coronavirus patients moving forward. “We Commissioners have seen firsthand how our citizens have responded to this crisis in an educated and diligent fashion. We have heard the pleas of our citizens who desire to safely re-open their businesses and safely return to work,” they said. They continued, stressing that the resolution is not a mandate but a measure giving business owners the freedom to choose to operate: We trust our business owners and citizens to make the right decision for their individual circumstances. The Resolution we Commissioners passed today requires in no way for any “Non-Life-Sustaining” business to open its doors for business. Neither does our Resolution require our citizens to patronize such business. Rather, we Commissioners believe strongly that our businesses and citizens have the requisite common sense to determine what is best for themselves. This is not a mandate. The commissioners acknowledged this week’s threat from Wolf — who warned that the state could revoke licenses from businesses that open in violation of his orders — stating that it would be “disrespectful” to the people of Columbia County if he were to pursue such action: Lastly, if you, as Governor, want to use the heavy hand of your authority and Office to attack Columbia County, her businesses and citizens through the use Commonwealth Agencies, such as the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board, we believe that to be out of character for you and disrespectful to the great people of Columbia County. “We didn’t want to do what we did today,” Democrat Columbia County Commissioner David Kovach said of the board’s decision. “But we felt we needed to make a statement.” “We don’t want to be rogue. We do not,” Commissioner Chris Young said. “But we’re also hearing the passionate pleas from our business community. They’re saying, ‘I need to get back to work.'” According to Fox 29, the resolution comes with a minor exception. If Wolf allows Columbia County to lawfully move into the next phase of reopening next week, Friday, May 22, they will “retract their decision and go back to red until that date.” “Regardless, the county will at least be in the ‘yellow phase’ for a few hours until Gov. Wolf speaks,” the outlet added. Columbia County had 330 cases of the coronavirus and 28 related deaths as of Thursday morning, according to the state’s health department data. However, over one-third of those cases are tied to nursing home residents (94) and employees (31), and all but four the county’s virus deaths — 24 of 28 — are connected to nursing homes. Three more Pennsylvania counties — Lancaster, Lebanon, and Beaver — are considering reopening their counties on Friday as well.

The chairman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) urged members of his party to blame President Donald Trump if public schools fail as they reopen in the fall. A report at Education Week noted Tom Perez condemned Trump and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos during a virtual conference Wednesday the DNC hosted, which focused on education in Michigan. According to the report, Perez said Democrats should place the blame on Trump, not state or local school officials if schools either not reopen or struggle to resume normal operations. Education Week asked Perez “why Trump should shoulder primary responsibility if schools struggle, given that state and local leaders have more direct power over K-12 education”: [H]e countered that the impact of the president’s failure to properly address the pandemic in January and February was “impossible to overstate.” Without a strong testing and tracing system, he said, schools ultimately would not be able to pick up where they left off. According to the report, Perez rejected the notion that “if we are unable to open up our schools again, it’s somehow a failure locally when you’ve had this abject failure of the federal government to lead.” “For this president, the buck stops anywhere but him,” he said. In a press release about the virtual conference, the DNC said Trump has threatened to cut billions of dollars in public school funding and has attacked public schools through DeVos’s school choice agenda. “We need an education secretary that actually believes in public education, and Betsy DeVos has undermined public education,” Perez said in a statement. “It’s the federal government that needs to lead on a pandemic, and when you have abject failure of the president of the United States in January and February to take this crisis seriously… he did not deal with it.” Politico reported the DNC is planning continued campaign efforts in other battleground states that will include representatives of teachers and students who will say they have been negatively affected by the Trump administration. An education department spokeswoman responded to a memo the DNC distributed with talking points that claim DeVos has undermined public schools in America. According to Politico, Angela Morabito referred to the memo as “a pathetic, misleading and plainly false attack.” “Secretary DeVos has moved with unprecedented speed to help America’s students and teachers,” she said, adding that the secretary began helping students without waiting for Congress to act with its CARES legislation, and, once it did so, distributed the funding “with maximum flexibility.”

A World War II veteran in Portland, Oregon, is raising money in a unique way to help his neighbors during the coronavirus pandemic. When 99-year-old Bud Lewis heard how so many families were struggling to get by during the health crisis, he got an idea, according to Fox 12. Before his 100th birthday on August 8, Lewis planned to walk 100 laps around the track at Duniway Park to raise funds for the Portland Police Bureau’s Sunshine Division. For nearly 100 years, the nonprofit organization Lewis called “the love of my life” has offered food and clothing to people in need. “I’m just here doing what I can to help Sunshine Division help thousands of people that they help at this time of crisis and it’s a fun thing to do for me. I keep busy doing this and seeing wonderful friends and that’s the gist of it. It’s an honor for me to do this, thank you,” he said. For a long time, Portland residents have referred to the veteran and former policeman as “an ageless icon.” “After serving in the South Pacific with the 41st Infantry Division during World War II, he became a Portland Police Officer, where he was eventually promoted to Commander of the Sunshine Division, which he served for ten years,” the Portland Police Bureau’s website read. When his mission is completed, Lewis will have walked a total of 25 miles. Tuesday, the Portland Police shared a photo of the beloved veteran on its Twitter page as he put in some time on the track: Bud Lewis to Walk 100 Laps before his 100th Birthday in Support of Sunshine Division (Photo) https://t.co/ALzgY5DGxu pic.twitter.com/SwsSgikH3K — Portland Police (@PortlandPolice) May 12, 2020  Lewis said the health crisis is a unique time for people to reach out and meet each other’s needs. “I see what I am doing now as both seizing an opportunity to help further Sunshine Division’s efforts and do something to celebrate my 100th birthday in a significant way. It’s kind of like putting the frosting on the cake of my years,” he concluded.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) approved the request for Miami-Dade and Broward counties to reopen at a press conference in Doral on Thursday. “Today, we take another important step for a very important part of the state of Florida. Some of our absolute best economic engines are in communities throughout South Florida,” the governor said according to WSVN. Both counties had been waiting for a response as officials prepared guidelines for reopening as soon as Monday, the report noted. DeSantis continued: And so we have been consulting with Mayor Gimenez here in Miami-Dade, Mayor Dale Holness in Broward, the administrators in both counties and other local officials to plot a way forward. And so today, I’ll be signing, or I have signed, an executive order that grants the request from both Miami-Dade and Broward to move them into phase one of the reopening for the state of Florida. Wednesday, Miami-Dade released a draft of its reopening guidelines that included rules for hotels, restaurants, retailers, and personal grooming businesses. “Under Mayor Carlos Gimenez’s plan, restaurants would operate at no more than 50% capacity. Miami-Dade beaches, hotels, bars, nightclubs, concert venues and movie theaters would remain closed in the initial reopening phase,” the WSVN report noted. May 1, DeSantis pushed back against the media’s claim that Florida would be the “next New York” regarding the coronavirus pandemic, according to Breitbart News. “We need to focus on facts and not fear. I think that there’s been a lot that’s been done to try to promote fear,” the governor explained. “They said Florida was going to be just like New York or an ‘Uber Italy’ when it came to hospitalizations and fatalities. This was wrong. It’s time to focus on the facts and follow a safe, smart and step-by-step plan for recovery,” he continued. May 4, DeSantis suggested members of the news media should apologize to mayors in Duval County for criticizing their decisions to reopen some beaches in April even with social distancing rules in place, Breitbart News reported. “I think apologies can be sent to the city of Jacksonville attention Mayor [Lenny] Curry. You may want to CC the mayors of Neptune Beach, Jacksonville Beach and Atlantic Beach. But I won’t hold my breath on that happening,” he concluded.

The Senate must “improve” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) leftist coronavirus bill, expanding it even further, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) said in a statement on Thursday. This week, Pelosi introduced a $3 trillion, 1,815-page coronavirus bill filled with a host of leftist wishlist items, from ballot harvesting and vote-by-mail to “environmental justice” grants. Although Sanders thanked the speaker for “recognizing the enormity of the crisis we’re facing” and proposing to “increase funding for state and local governments, provide hazard pay for essential works and save the Postal Service,” he does not believe the measure goes far enough. “In my view, however, the Senate must improve this legislation if we are to adequately address the two most urgent needs facing working families right now: health care and economic security,” Sanders said, outlining his proposals: The coronavirus pandemic has made it clear that everyone in America must receive the health care they need regardless of income, including the tens of millions who have lost their employer-provided insurance. Instead of subsidizing COBRA — which would be a massive giveaway to the health insurance industry — I believe Medicare must be empowered to pay all of the health care bills of the uninsured and under-insured until this crisis is over. This approach will provide coverage to all of our people in a much more cost-effective way. “Second, if we are to avoid another Great Depression, it is absolutely imperative that every worker in this country continues to receive a paycheck and benefits. In my view, a modest extension in the Employee Retention Tax Credit is not the same as guaranteeing the paychecks of workers and will not provide security for working people. Any legislation in the Senate to address the economic crisis must include a provision to guarantee 100 percent of the paychecks of workers up to $90,000 a year. This is what is being done successfully in many European countries and what should be done here. Sanders also said the Senate should “substantially expand” emergency cash relief to individuals, increasing the payment from $1,200 to $2,000 per month “for every American until this crisis is over.” “This unprecedented crisis demands an unprecedented legislative response,” Sanders concluded. “I look forward to working with my colleagues in improving and expanding the House bill before it is considered in the Senate.” The House is expected to vote on Pelosi’s multitrillion-dollar proposal on Friday, even though Congressional Progressive Caucus cochairs Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) and Mark Pocan (D-WI) want to wait until next week to allow for discussions. However, they did not threaten to sink the bill if it is not postponed. As Breitbart News detailed, Pelosi’s latest relief proposal, the Heroes Act, contains a host of leftist agenda items, including the establishment of vote-by-mail for the November election: The plan would mandate mail-in voting during times of national emergencies, thus mailing ballots to every registered voter despite severe issues with the nation’s voter rolls. Since the 2012 election, for example, about 28.4 million mail-in ballots have gone missing. Also included in the plan is the legalization of ballot harvesting, allowing political operatives to collect and deliver as many ballots as they want so long as they are not paid based on the number of ballots they deliver. This loophole still allows these operatives to be paid. The plan guts voter ID requirements and witness signature requirements for mail-in voting. For instance, states would be effectively banned from requiring an ID from a registered voter requesting an absentee ballot. The Democrat-penned measure also allots $1 million to the National Science Foundation “to study the spread of coronavirus-related ‘disinformation,'” $10 million to the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), and “$10 million fo the National Endowment for the Humanities.” U.S. jobless claims have risen to 36.5 million since the start of the pandemic eight weeks ago.

The NFL may not have any fans in their stadiums this year, but that’s reportedly not going to stop Fox from making it sound like they are there. Fox lead play-by-play man Joe Buck told Andy Cohen of Sirius XM radio, it’s “pretty much a done deal” that his network will pipe fake crowd noise into stadiums if fans are not in attendance.  Not only that, Buck also says that virtual fans will be used to make the stadium appear full. Of course, everyone will know that the stadium isn’t full and that the crowd noise is not real, but Fox is determined to create the illusion. It’s unknown whether the virtual fans will be impartial, or if they will support the home team. All told, it’s a pretty dumb idea. Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn

Chinese communist leaders “intentionally concealed the severity” of the coronavirus from the world in early January, Department of Homeland Security intelligence said. But according to Barbra Streisand, “Trump is a saboteur of our public health.” That’s the latest line of attack from the left-wing pop icon and apparent virology expert, who let lose a lecture full of feign concern on Thursday, asking “What has happened to the Republican Party” and declaring Americans are dying because the GOP ignores medical science. “What has happened to the Republican Party? They say nothing while Trump silences the CDC recommendations and contradicts Dr Fauci by saying his science based answer is ‘not acceptable.’ People are dying because of this failure of the GOP to follow medical science.” What has happened to the Republican Party? They say nothing while Trump silences the CDC recommendations and contradicts Dr Fauci by saying his science based answer is “not acceptable.” People are dying because of this failure of the GOP to follow medical science. — Barbra Streisand (@BarbraStreisand) May 14, 2020  The political rant continued an hour later, with the Grammy-winner saying “The CDC was once the world’s premier public health organization. In a competent Administration, the organization would be at the forefront in this pandemic. Now the White House refuses to even release the CDC guidelines for reopening the country.” Trump is a saboteur of our public health. https://t.co/OOo92E1C5v — Barbra Streisand (@BarbraStreisand) May 14, 2020  It was exactly one month ago that Barbra Streisand was calling for national unity as the country confronts the Chinese coronavirus. And, of course, it was just 24 hours earlier that she was blaming President Trump for the deaths of Americans killed by the Wuhan coronavirus. As far as Barbra Streisand’s wild assertions that Trump and Republicans are ignoring CDC and health expert opinions, Dr. Anthony Fauci told Congress and the world this week that “There is certainly not a confrontational relationship between me and the president.” “As I have mentioned many times, I give advice and opinion based on evidence-based scientific information,” Fauci said, adding that the president “hears that. He respects it.” What’s more? “I have given him my honest answers rooted in data and science,” said Dr. Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). “He has listened respectively to those … incorporating that into his decision making.” Jerome Hudson is Breitbart News Entertainment Editor and author of the bestselling book 50 Things They Don’t Want You to Know. Order your copy today.

Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) is temporarily stepping aside as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee amid a Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation into his decision to unload upwards of $1.72 million in stock ahead of the coronavirus outbreak. Burr, who is facing not only a DOJ probe, but also one by the Securities and Exchange Commission, informed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) this morning of his decision to relinquish his committee gavel temporarily due to ongoing controversy. “We agreed that this decision would be in the best interests of the committee and will be effective at the end of the day tomorrow,” McConnell said in a statement Thursday. Although it is unclear who will replace Burr at the helm of the Intelligence Committee, on Thursday, Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-SD) floated the idea of Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) as the panel’s next most senior member, Sen. Jim Risch (R-ID), was already chairing the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), a senior member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, was questioned by federal agents in recent days over her husband’s decision to sell stock ahead of the outbreak, according to NBC News. The decision to step down comes one day after Burr was served a warrant at his Washington, DC, residence by federal agents, according to the Los Angeles Times. Law enforcement officials purportedly seized Burr’s cell phone in hopes of establishing a communications timeline between the senator and his stockbroker as they probe into his decision to unload hundreds of thousands of dollars in stock this past February. Burr, who at the time was receiving nearly daily briefings by the Senate Intelligence Committee on the coronavirus threat, netted between $628,000 and $1.72 million. The senator’s sale, which came less than a week before the stock market tumbled because of the virus, has sparked questions of insider trading, especially as most of the shares he sold were in travel and hospitality companies, such as Wyndham Hotels and Resorts and Hilton, which were hard hit due to coronavirus travel restrictions. Perhaps more troubling is that Burr’s brother-in-law, a political appointee of President Donald Trump, also dumped upwards of $280,000 in stock on the same day as the senator. Given the fact pattern, many speculate Burr may have acted on insider information privy only to his committee to protect his and his family’s assets. If true, Burr could be found in violation of the STOCK Act, which prohibits the use of non-public information for lawmakers’ private profit. Even before Burr opted to step down from his chairmanship, the senator’s political standing had already taken a hit. Not only has he drawn criticism from both sides of the political aisle, but recent polling indicates a majority of his North Carolina constituents believe he should resign over the matter. The political pressure culminating was evidenced on Thursday when Burr’s seatmate, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), t0ld a local North Carolina radio station he owed everyone an “explanation” for his conduct.

Wednesday on SiriusXM’s “The Joe Madison Show,” former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper argued that President Donald Trump would use the Michael Flynn case as a distraction from his administration’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. While discussing Trump dubbing the unmasking controversy “Obamagate,” host Joe Madison asked, “So how do you think this will end? Will this just be a news item, or are we, and I think I know the answer to this, or is this going to be an ongoing political issue that’s going to be used by the administration?” Clapper said, “Well, I expect it will be, you know, right up until the election. I mean, this will be a narrative that the current administration will pursue. And of course, it also serves as a distraction from COVID-19.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) on Wednesday declared that President Trump does not care about the Americans who have died as a result of the Chinese coronavirus and proclaimed that his true desire to reopen the economy is rooted in holding “his white power pep rallies.” “Trump doesn’t care about the 80,000+ people who’ve died from #Coronavirus!” Waters exclaimed. “He only wants to open up the economy so he can go back to having his white power pep rallies! The death & economic devastation we are facing is b/c Trump failed to act early & called #COVID19 a HOAX!” she added: Trump doesn’t care about the 80,000+ people who’ve died from #Coronavirus! He only wants to open up the economy so he can go back to having his white power pep rallies! The death & economic devastation we are facing is b/c Trump failed to act early & called #COVID19 a HOAX! — Maxine Waters (@RepMaxineWaters) May 14, 2020  Despite Waters’ assertion, Trump never referred to the virus as a “hoax.” The left-wing talking point was birthed following a February rally in Charleston, South Carolina. The president told the crowd that Democrats were “politicizing the coronavirus” — an assertion that has proven to be true in recent weeks, given the Democrats’ repeated attempts to pack party agenda items in coronavirus relief measures. Trump added that Democrats’ desire to blame him is the “new hoax” — not the virus itself. “One of my people came up to me and said, ‘Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia. That didn’t work out too well. They couldn’t do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything,” Trump told the crowd. “They tried it over and over. They’ve been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning. They lost, it’s all turning. Think of it, and this is their new hoax’” Trump added. Waters’ remarks come as Americans across the country demand their leaders to reopen the economy so they can return to work and resume their livelihoods. Jobless claims now stand at roughly 36.5 million since the start of the pandemic. However, some leaders, like Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D), are remaining obstinate, while other governors, like Georgia’s Gov. Brian Kemp (R), are allowing their states to slowly return to normal. Waters said during a Monday appearance on Spectrum News 1’s Inside the Issues that Americans participating in Reopen America protests “should be ashamed of themselves.” President Trump told Fox Business’s Maria Bartiromo on Thursday that some Democrats want the economy to remain shut down to boost their chances of defeating him in November. “I think it’s a political thing,” Trump said. “The people that want to see the right thing happen, they agree with me. We have to get our country open,” the president continued. “You know, if it was up to some people let’s keep it closed for a long time … and watch the United States go down the tubes. Not gonna happen. Never gonna happen on my watch,” he added. Conservative talk radio legend Rush Limbaugh floated the same idea, telling listeners this week that the “American left and the Democrat Party is going to do its best to keep this economy shut down, to extend and expand that shutdown — and blow up their own country’s jobs — just to ensure that Trump loses.” “The economic activity that will happen from the red states going back to work, the blue state governors are gonna try to cancel it out by keeping their people at home,” Limbaugh predicted. “They’re gonna wreck the economy,” he added. “Their objective is to wreck the economy and get rid of Trump.”

Hollywood is seeing a wave of staff reductions from the corporate suites to the theme park turnstiles as entertainment giants including the Walt Disney Co. and Endeavor implement layoffs and furloughs in response to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. Just how bad is the carnage? In Los Angeles County alone, 14,000 entertainment-related workers saw their jobs evaporate in less than two months, according to a new report from tech news outlet dot.LA. Meanwhile, Tinseltown could see even more bloodshed in the second quarter, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Endeavor — the largest Hollywood talent agency, as well as a studio — recently said that it will lay off or furlough up to a third of its staff. Disney has furloughed more than 100,000 employees worldwide, mostly in the company’s parks division. Hollywood has been hit on multiple fronts, including the closure of cinemas and the suspension of live sports, which is usually a cash cow for broadcasters. The L.A. office of Fox Sports Productions saw 3,595 people temporarily laid off at the end of April, according to dot.LA. Some of the biggest job losses have come from the production sector, which consists of below-the-line crew members who typically toil year round on crowded movie and TV sets. Hollywood’s trade unions have seen their members idle without work as soundstages around the country remain empty. Breitbart News reported last week that Hollywood studios are currently working on ways to make sets safe when production ultimately resumes. While no major studio has yet to announce a timetable, one source told Breitbart that U.S. production may resume in June at the earliest. But L.A. County’s decision to prolong its stay-at-home order for an additional three months is only creating more uncertainty. Tyler Perry recently announced that his Atlanta studio will resume limited production in July. Countries including New Zealand, Poland, the Czech Republic have also announced that shooting can resume. The Hollywood Reporter noted that individual studios are remaining vague about potential future layoffs. But some executives have spoken about coronavirus-related cost savings.
ViacomCBS has indicated that it will take more cost-cutting steps in addition to the ones already realized from the re-merger of Viacom and CBS. Chief financial officer Christina Spade said the company was “taking additional cost-cutting actions and implementing initiatives to reduce discretionary expenses” amid the pandemic. “We are learning from this crisis and finding ways that we can operate more efficiently,” she said during a recent earnings call. Meanwhile, Disney has begun the gradual process of re-opening its theme parks and resorts. Disney Springs in Orlando is set to partially re-open on May 20, though the adjacent Walt Disney World remains closed. Shanghai Disney Resort recently opened again with visitors required to take special precautions, including social distancing and masks. Follow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg. Have a tip?

The coronavirus has been devastating for restaurants across America, forcing many to be reduced to takeout service only and others shutting down altogether. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, eating and drinking establishments lost 5.5 million jobs in April, not including a half million jobs lost in March. “Eating and drinking places are the primary component of the total restaurant and foodservice industry, which prior the coronavirus outbreak employed 12 million out of the total restaurant and foodservice workforce of 15.6 million,” a report from the National Restaurant Association said. Now, as states around the country are slowly opening up, restaurants are putting plans in place to see if they will be among the coronavirus survivors.  Here is a sampling of restaurant news across the country: Virginia As Breitbart News reported, a popular Virginia destination is reopening after the coronavirus shutdown and visitors who come to eat at the Inn at Little Washington will share the space with mid-century mannequin diners seated to implement social distancing. Town and Country magazine reported on the creative comeback: Chef and proprietor Patrick O’Connell, a James Beard award-winner, is conceptualizing these intricate scenes to comply with capacity regulations, implemented in light of the coronavirus pandemic. The Inn is working with two local businesses to stage the tables. For authenticity, Signature Theatre, a Tony-award winning non-profit professional theater company, will help create the scenes and Design Foundry, team of carpenters, painters, designers, fabricators, will facilitate construction. The mannequin-filled reopening also comes alongside a new menu. O’Connell is still working out the details, but we know it will feature the restaurant’s signature whimsy. Even before the mannequins, the Inn was known for its irreverent take on dining, from its cheese specialist with a mooing cow cart, speaking exclusively in puns, to the dining room dress code: no wet bikinis. California Restaurants in California have to reopen following the very restrictive guidelines that Gov. Gavin Newsom put in place. “Dine-in restaurants, brewpubs, breweries, bars, pubs, craft distilleries, and wineries that provide sit-down meals should follow the restaurant guidance below and should continue to encourage takeout and delivery service whenever possible,” the guidelines said. Law360 reported on pushback against the restrictions: In April, a group of California companies sued state and county officials in federal court, demanding they overturn orders closing nonessential businesses in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19. California-incorporated companies including restaurants and tourism services argued in their complaint that the coronavirus-related “shelter in place” orders violate their constitutional rights and will drive them out of business. Fearing the havoc that is already crippling the state’s economy, the businesses’ mass action challenges the orders as an infringement on their civil rights and liberties under the U.S. and state constitutions. Florida Florida is one of the states that is embracing reopening safely to get small businesses back on board, including restaurants. The Tampa Bay Times reported on some of the restaurants and how they are handling the post-lockdown scenario: At Big John’s Alabama Bar-B-Que in East Tampa this week, a steady lunchtime crowd stood in line outside the 52-year-old establishment as a masked employee took orders behind a plastic-screened walk-up window. It’s a now-familiar ritual after nearly two months of life in the coronavirus pandemic. Although Gov. Ron DeSantis’ proposal to gradually reopen the state allows restaurants to serve customers inside at 25 percent of maximum capacity, and the city has encouraged restaurants to set up outdoor seating in parking lots, the family-owned business preferred a wait-and-see attitude. “Just like we cook our barbecue, we’re going to take our time,” said Corey Miller, grandson of the founders who helps run the restaurant. Texas Texas is another state that is working hard to get back to pre-virus operations. One restaurant owner said that his property is “cleaner than a hospital.” The Killeen Daily Herald reported on what restaurants are up to after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott relaxed restriction on dining establishments: According to Abbott’s May 27 directive, restaurants have been permitted to open at 25 percent capacity for dining room services, as many continue to provide curbside, drive through and delivery options. Locally owned Little Italy, on South Fort Hood Street in Killeen, served its first customers on May 1, after a deep cleaning in the week prior, according to general manager Gary Revel Jr. “We took the whole place apart and cleaned it from top to bottom,” Revel said. “We used the best products you could buy—we joke, ‘this restaurant is cleaner than a hospital.’” Christina Kocher, general manager of Rosa’s Cafe, said the restaurant was cleaned thoroughly and daily cleansing efforts include coronavirus protocol. “Those include the company providing masks that have to be worn at all times — having them to have the masks on before they walk into building — and gloves to all our employees.” Kocher said. “Having a timer set for everyone to wash their hands and change their gloves and when it is necessary.” “Kocher said everyone has their temperature screened before they clock in for their shift, and they are also asked a series of questions about how they are feeling and if they have been experiencing particular symptoms associated with COVID-19,” the Herald reported. “Anyone who experiences symptoms or doesn’t pass the temperature check is asked to see a doctor — and required to bring a note from their physician before returning to work, Kocher said.” “For our guests, we are providing extra sanitizing areas in the store,” Kocher said, including door handles, tables, chairs, bathrooms, drink stations, and condiment areas being sanitized every 15 minutes. Indiana Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb is reopening the state, including restaurants, with most restaurants operating at 50 percent capacity. The local ABC affiliate reported on the developments in the state. “Radius, a restaurant in Porter County closed down back in March. Nearly two months later, owner Chris Pavlou was happy to see his customers dining in again,” ABC reported. “Today has been great,” Pavlou said. We have a lot of regulars that are excited to be here,” he said. “We got the place ready for social distancing. We have our masks and the employees are wearing them, and we are being very sanitary.” The customers will not be required to wear masks, Pavlou said. “We feel a little cooped up,” said Nathan Walker, a customer  said in the ABC report. “We got appetizers, soup and we ate like we had not eaten in seven weeks.” “The Rosewood Family Restaurant in Portage had to close down completely for two months,” ABC reported. “The restaurant is now wiping down menus and keeping patrons as far apart as they can.” “We’re just glad to be back,” Maggie Karakozis, owner of Rosewood family restaurant, said. “Wanna welcome everybody back and hopefully we’re gonna get back to I know it’s a new normal but some sort of a new normal.” Arizona Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey relaxed restrictions in the state so that some restaurants can now offer dine-in services, including large chains and mom and pop operations. Diners will be separated to conform with social distancing requirements and only parties of 10 or fewer will be seated. “Our goal is not to be busy for the first week,” said Phoenix-based restaurant owner Sam Fox. “Our goal is to make sure we have our procedures in place, our employees are feeling safe. We really want to get this right the first time.” The Eagle reported on what restaurants are putting into place in the state: Fox, the founder of Fox Restaurant Concepts with a variety of the brands around Arizona and the country, said 11 stores opened Monday in four markets. Flower Child locations in Atlanta, Phoenix and Tucson are open, along with The Henry and Dough Bird. He plans to follow with several Culinary Dropout and Zinburger locations in the coming days. Restaurant owners described a variety of steps they’re taking to ensure customers and workers feel safe, from separating tables to providing masks, gloves and health screenings for employees when they arrive. In a Flower Child restaurant in the Phoenix neighborhood of Arcadia, the usually crowded restaurant had many tables missing. Some of the others were marked as reserved to maintain distance between customers. A handful of people dined on salads, bowls or entrees, but most of the food went as takeout. “We’re just excited to be back up and running and to be able to do the thing we know best, and that’s to make food, see family get-togethers and be able to interact with the public again,” said Frank Lara, vice president of operations for Chompies, where plastic screens have been installed between booths. “The Downtown Diner in Flagstaff reopened Monday after being closed since late March,” the Eagle reported. “Dine-in customers were offered packaged plastic utensils, to-go boxes, and to-go cups with lids and straws. But General Manager Mark Gent said some opted for traditional dishes, silverware and mugs.” “People are pretty bold,” he said. “I think people are ready to get that little sense of normality back.” Follow Penny Starr on Twitter.

Over 60 percent of deaths linked to the Chinese coronavirus in Moscow are not being recorded as official coronavirus deaths, local health officials revealed on Wednesday. Moscow, which is the epicenter of the country’s coronavirus outbreak, has recorded a surprisingly low mortality rate compared to other capital cities, with allegedly just 1,232 deaths out of 126,004 infections as of Wednesday. However, experts have cast doubt on the numbers in part because Russia is only counting the deaths of coronavirus-positive patients toward its total if doctors can confirm the virus played a direct role in their death. “Over 60 percent of deaths occurred from obvious alternate causes, such as vascular accidents, stage four malignant diseases, leukemia, systemic diseases linked to organ failure and other incurable deadly diseases,” Moscow’s Health Department said in a statement Wednesday, adding that it is “incorrect to compare monthly death rates.” Officials last month reported 639 deaths caused directly as a result of coronavirus and approximately 1,597 deaths of people testing positive for the virus, but allegedly dying of other causes. The government statement, which sought to refute claims of under-reporting, continued: Of the total number of deaths in April 2020, 639 are people whose cause of death is coronavirus infection and its complications, most often pneumonia. It should be emphasized that the pathological autopsy of the dead with suspected coronavirus in Russia and Moscow is carried out in 100 percent of cases, unlike most other countries. Therefore, post-mortem diagnoses and causes of death recorded in Moscow are ultimately extremely accurate, and mortality data is completely open. Preliminary data published by the Moscow Times has indicated a 20 percent rise in fatalities across the city’s hospitals compared with the average April death toll over the past decade. Last week, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin announced an extension of citywide lockdown and warned that the real number of Chinese coronavirus cases could be three times that of the official figures. With the number of infected last week documented at around 100,000, Sobyanin estimated that around 300,000 residents, equivalent to around 2.5 percent of the city’s population, have contracted the virus. Questions over if people have died from or merely with the coronavirus go to the very heart of the debate about the severity of the pandemic. Those who believe the threat is exaggerated generally argue that a majority of recorded deaths are of people who died infected but killed by a more serious health condition. Lockdown proponents often claim that the coronavirus is responsible for many more deaths than are being officially recorded, as the infection can turn the symptoms of other diseases deadly when they would have otherwise been manageable. Many medical professionals in Russia have complained about a lack of resources, particularly personal protective equipment (PPE), and many have chosen to quit their jobs. Three doctors opposed to the Kremlin’s approach have also fallen out of windows in mysterious circumstances. Two separate fires at hospitals reportedly caused by malfunctioning ventilators killed six people. Follow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.

Though I’m never exactly sure what I’m going to be doing at 8pm on a Thursday evening – Drinking gin? Rolling a cigarette? Looking for owls or bats or swallows? – there’s one thing I know for certain that I shan’t be doing. Every Thursday evening, without fail, for the entirety of the coronavirus pandemic, I have very carefully avoided participating in the deranged, sinister and near-compulsory practice of standing outside my house and clapping ‘Our NHS’. I say ‘near-compulsory’ because I know that in towns and cities entire streets come out for their ritual applause, like clockwork, every Thursday night. Neighbours quickly notice if you don’t participate. It marks you down as a dangerous ingrate who deserves to be shunned. The fact that you don’t care about the NHS or the heroism of its workers means you really don’t deserve to be treated by the NHS should you ever fall ill, as you thoroughly deserve to do for being such an ungrateful bastard. While I am full of respect for those doctors and nurses who are working hard and sometimes risking their lives by exposing themselves to the powerful viral load which could trigger a particularly bad bout of Covid-19, I still don’t think people should be clapped for doing their job – especially in a climate like the one now where even to have a job is a privilege rather cause for special sympathy. Even less so do I believe that any applause should be directed towards the useless bureaucrats who suck up so much of the healthcare budget. Most of the National Health Service is a giant, sclerotic, wasteful bureaucracy and I’m certainly not going to clap that. There are two main reasons, though, why I’m not going to join in the ritual applause for the NHS. The first is this one: NHS Climate Change Manager £44k.#ClapForTheNHS #FFS pic.twitter.com/JIIGcMO9zd — Marcher (@MarcherLord1) May 14, 2020  That, in case you can’t read it, is a recruitment ad for one of the thousands of non-jobs in the NHS the taxpayer has to support. In this case, a hospital in North East England is offering a salary of up to £44,000 a year, plus benefits, for an ‘exciting new post’ designed to ‘fully integrate sustainability’ into a Newcastle hospital and ‘fast-track the delivery of low-carbon sustainable healthcare services.’ Not a single life will be saved as a result of this non-job. Not a single health outcome improved. Yet still, whether we like it or not, British taxpayers are forced to pay for this nonsense. The system urgently needs reform, not unquestioning adoration. And the second reason is that I am not subject to the Chinese or North Korean regimes. Having everyone clap the NHS puts this creaky, socialistic healthcare system on a pedestal not dissimilar to the one occupied by Communist dictators like Kim Jong Un or President Xi of China. This puts it beyond criticism, and therefore any reasonable hope of improvement. This is a bad thing. More worryingly, this outbreak of clapping appears to be a direct copy of a practice initially instituted in Wuhan, China. Here is an example of state-coerced clapping, dancing and rooftop chants in China. "It's all fake!" Chinese people said in protests against the Communist propaganda and lies that came out of Wuhan earlier this year — and yet the state-coerced clapping, dancing and rooftop chants were closely copied without irony in the UK and Europe. https://t.co/y2fb6sjtvG — Aidan Hartley (@TheHorseCure) May 10, 2020  Here we are copying it in the UK "Clapped off our ward as she heads on her way." Wuhan clapping propaganda. https://t.co/TAL2CMakYq — Aidan Hartley (@TheHorseCure) May 10, 2020  It is not British. Ritual, compulsory applause is what Commie regimes from Stalin’s Soviet Union to Castro’s Cuba to Xi’s China do. In the free West, we are better than this.

The Prime Minister is being lobbied by colleagues to resist the temptation to ramp up taxation to pay off the huge extra spending incurred for coronavirus aid, arguing the familiar principles of the Laffer Curve. At least one senior colleague of Prime Minister Boris Johnson has cautioned against the perhaps obvious approach to higher government debt, with hundreds of billions of sterling more of deficit expected this year. By increasing taxes — and a wide range of further grabs by the government are reportedly being explored — the much-needed revitalisation of the economy could be strangled in the cradle. While the proportion of wealth taken would rise, the argument goes, the damage to the overall wealth potential of the nation is so great, rising the overall tax take actually stagnates or falls. The unnamed cabinet number quoted by British newspaper The Times articulated the point: “It is completely the wrong approach; it would entrench the downturn… We should be looking at policies that open up the economy — we will need fiscal stimulus. Taxes need to be lower rather than higher.” The principle that there is an optimal level of taxation in any given nation, beyond which point returns for the exchequer progressively falls away as the economy is strangled or offshored, was famously illustrated by American economist Art Laffer. The Laffer Curve is deeply controversial among left-wing economists, who tend to argue for ever-higher taxation. That pressure for tax rises from the left is also being brought to bear on the Prime Minister through the theoretically impartial civil service, according to Daily Telegraph editor Allister Heath. Recording the potential coronavirus has created — so the left perceives — to change the UK economy into one of high state control and taxation in the newspaper, which has a close relationship to the ruling Conservative party, Heath notes: Johnson wasn’t elected to turn Britain into a self-governing Brownite utopia. This must be a Tory government or else it will fail. If they have any sense of their own survival, of their self-worth, of the veracity of their core values, the answer from the Government, the Tory party and Right-leaning voters to all of these Left-wing, statist proposals needs to be unequivocal: over our dead bodies. This crisis will not be used to undo 2016 and 2019, destroy the centre-Right and turn Britain into the kind of country that Keir Starmer and Ed Miliband dream to live in, they must insist. There will be no massive tax hikes and no war on wealth. This is not a transformational moment for the welfare state: furlough was a necessary evil in a once-in-50-years emergency, not the new normal each time the business cycle turns. As Breitbart London’s James Delingpole noted Wednesday, there are plenty of government vanity projects ripe for the block before the taxman even considers putting his hand into the nation’s pocket again, among them the billions spent on foreign aid, the new HS2 railway, and costly carbon-neutral programmes.

President Donald Trump said in an interview Thursday he is already mobilizing the military to help distribute a coronavirus vaccine as soon as it is developed. “Our military is now being mobilized so at the end of the year we’re going to be able to give it to a lot of people very, very rapidly,” the president said in an interview with Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo, which aired on Thursday morning. The president said that distributing the vaccine would be a “massive job” and that he would move quickly to get it distributed. “Unless you’re mobilized and ready, you’re not going to be able to do it for a long time. So we’re starting now,” he said. President Trump predicted a vaccine would become available by the end of 2020, and manufacturers are already mobilizing the production of millions of doses of potential vaccine candidates while they are tested. The president has also set an “Operation Warp Speed “task force goal of getting 100 million vaccine doses available in the fall, with 300 million doses by January.

Disney World’s highly anticipated reopening next week will include masks for guests and employees, temperature checks, and plexiglass dividers installed at registers. The theme park has been closed since mid-March due to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. The partial reopening kicks off on May 20 with Disney Springs opening up to the public. The rest of the Orlando will remain closed, according to the Hollywood Reporter. All guests and employees will be required to wear masks — which Disney World will provide — and guests will have their temperatures checked at the door. Park employees will be required to check for coronavirus symptoms at home before their shifts, with Disney providing them thermometers. The company said there will be no discipline for employees that miss work due to a potential illness.

(Joe Raedle/Getty Images) Moreover, any park employee who becomes infected with the virus will be paid for up to two weeks to quarantine, according to Eric Clinton, the president of the labor union UNITE HERE. The Reporter report added that when it comes to making purchases, guests will have to swipe their own cards, as they are no longer allowed to hand them to employees, who will be separated from the guests by plexiglass dividers. There will also be custodians stationed at “high-touch” areas. More than 100,000 Disney World employees had been furloughed due to the Wuhan coronavirus. Now, some of them will be able to get back to work. “Some are anxious to get back because the unemployment system [in Florida] is completely broken,” said Clinton to the Hollywood Reporter. Clinton added that employees have a “mixed bag of emotions” with regards to reopening the theme park. The report added that Disney has developed new global training for park employees to inform them about health and safety amid the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. Clinton added that UNITE HERE will also be involved in Disney’s new monthly safety meetings.

New York City’s health commissioner rejected an urgent request by the New York Police Department (NYPD) for 500,000 surgical masks as the coronavirus crisis surged, telling a high-ranking police official, “I don’t give two rats’ asses about your cops,” according to a report. Dr. Oxiris Barbot made the heartless comment during a brief phone conversation with NYPD Chief Terence Monahan, the New York Post reported. Monahan asked Barbot for 500,000 masks, while Barbot was only willing to give him 50,000. “I don’t give two rats’ asses about your cops,” Barbot said, according to sources. “I need them for others.” The conversation took place as more cops were calling out sick with symptoms of coronavirus, but before the NYPD had suffered any casualties from the deadly virus. Although masks do not prevent wearers from being infected with the coronavirus, they can prevent people already sick with the virus from spreading it to others. The NYPD has recorded 5,490 coronavirus cases among its 55,000 police force and civilian workers, with 41 deaths, according to data released Wednesday evening. In the wake of Barbot’s comments, NYPD officials discovered that the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene had a stash of masks, ventilators, and other personal protective equipment (PPE) stored in a New Jersey warehouse. The department made its case to City Hall, which granted the NYPD 250,000 surgical masks. The federal Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) also supplied the NYPD with PPE suits and disinfectant. Police unions called for Barbot’s firing in the wake of her comments, calling her remarks “despicable and unforgivable”: Despicable and unforgivable. Dr. Barbot should be forced to look in the eye of every police family who lost a hero to this virus. Look them in the eye and tell them they aren’t worth a rat’s ass.https://t.co/i7vYHTjfAf — NYC PBA (@NYCPBA) May 14, 2020  “Dr. Barbot should be forced to look in the eye of every police family who lost a hero to this virus. Look them in the eye and tell them they aren’t worth a rat’s a–,” the Police Benevolent Association tweeted. FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: SBA President calls for the firing of Dr.Oxiris Barbot, Commissioner of NYC Dept of Health pic.twitter.com/RSBLqkU5aZ — SBA (@SBANYPD) May 14, 2020  “I am not surprised by such vile words coming from an appointee of Mayor de Blasio, whose disdain for law enforcement is legendary,” Sergeants Benevolent Association President Ed Mullins said in a statement. “But Dr. Barbot’s comments make it clear she has no personal or professional regard for the police. The primary concern of a medical professional in such an important position should be the safety of all people, and her attitude places police officers in great jeopardy and makes her unfit for the job,” the statement continued. The city’s Department of Health issued the following statement in response to the report: Dr. Barbot and Chief [Terence] Monahan have a good working relationship. During the height of COVID, while our hospitals were battling to keep patients alive, there was a heated exchange between the two where things were said out of frustration but no harm was wished on anyone. “The Commissioner apologized for her contribution to the exchange, the apology was accepted and agreement was arrived between the two to ensure that respirators were delivered to members of the force,” the statement continued.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Sen. Richard Burr stepped aside as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday after the FBI served a search warrant for his phone as part of an ongoing insider-trading investigation tied to the coronavirus pandemic. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced the move, saying he and Burr had agreed it was in the Senate’s best interests. FBI officials showed up at Burr’s home with the warrant on Wednesday, marking a significant escalation into the Justice Department’s investigation into whether Burr broke the law with a well-timed sale of stocks before the coronavirus caused markets to plummet, The Justice Department declined to comment. His attorney did not respond to phone and email messages, but said last month that the law is clear that any senator can participate in stock market trading based on public information “as Sen. Burr did.”

Thursday on ABC’s “The View,” co-host Joy Behar accused President Donald Trump of not caring about Americans’ deaths due to the coronavirus pandemic. During a discussion of children returning to school, Behar said, “Let’s see, do I listen to an immunologist and scientist, or do I listen to someone who suggests I inject myself with Lysol? Listen, I wonder if he’s sending Baron to school, by the way? I mean, that would be an interesting thing to ask. You know, we all know he’s a liar, and he only cares about being re-elected, not how many people will die. So we do not listen to anything he says, subject number one.” She added, “Now, 164 kids have gotten sick in 15 states, as you pointed out, in New York I think three from a corona-related disease. It is particularly sinful to send black children back to school without adequate testing or without a vaccine because we now know that the black community is being impacted by this disease more than Caucasians, and there must be a very important reason. I mean, there are some ideas floating around, but at the moment, we don’t know what it is, so the jury is still out on that. So it’s dangerous for black children. So let me just point out that the White House now has 50% incorrect testing, so the tests are not working. There’s a lot of stuff that needs to be discussed before he’s ready to send my grandson back to school.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

E-commerce giant Amazon will reportedly stop paying its warehouse workers an extra $2 per hour at the end of this month. One Amazon employee called the move “disgraceful,” claiming, “It just shows how very little regard Amazon has for its overworked employees.” Business Insider reports that e-commerce giant Amazon plans to stop paying warehouse workers an extra $2 per hour at the end of the month after raising workers wages beginning in March to compensate them for coming into work during the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic. Dave Clark, Amazon’s senior vice president of worldwide operations told Recode: “We’re going to do one more extension on it and push it out until the end of the month.” The $2 raise has been in effect since mid-March alongside increased overtime pay and was originally planned to run until the end of April but was extended by the company. One Amazon warehouse worker told Business Insider: “I feel like it’s too soon,” they added, “I had to find this out through news outlets. I do understand the economy is reopening, but the demand has not decreased and if anyone expects things to go back to normal anytime soon, it would be unrealistic. I believe that it should be extended into the month of June, so that they can have a better grasp of our new normal as we watch the economy recover.” Another warehouse employee referred to the decision as “disgraceful,” stating: “Staff put themselves at risk every day. Also with the harsh regime and difficult targets the workers more than deserve the pay rise permanently. It just shows how very little regard Amazon has for its overworked employees.” Amazon also cut a policy that allowed workers to take unlimited amounts of unpaid time off in order to allow workers to stay home if they felt unsafe coming to work during the pandemic. One Amazon employee told the Guardian: “Now they’re forcing people to go to work because if you run out of unpaid time off, that’s it, you’re fired.” Amazon told Business Insider that its pay incentives for employees since the beginning of the pandemic have reached nearly $800 million. The firm also expects to spend $4 billion on increased wages, personal protective equipment, and increased cleaning of its facilities. Christy Hoffman, the general secretary for the internal workers’ union UNI Global Union commented on Amazon’s decision to cut the $2 pay increase to Business Insider, stating: “Amazon’s announcement to end hazard pay shows yet again that the tech giant won’t act in the best interest of workers unless pushed. “It is the same attitude that has already motivated workers to strike, take the company to court and demand respect on the job. As the deadly coronavirus outbreak continues, Amazon should put workers first and pay a premium for their labor.” Read more at Business Insider here.

In a video posting on Wednesday, Dave Portnoy, the founder of Barstool Sports, slammed the hysteria over the coronavirus and wondered when “flattening the curve” became “finding the curve.” Portnoy posted a video to Twitter on Wednesday slamming the mission creep seen from the beginning of the coronavirus crisis to where we have gotten since. Originally, Portnoy pointed out, the nation instituted lockdowns to “flatten the curve” to keep hospitals from being overrun with coronavirus cases. But, suddenly, the sports blog operator said, the policies have morphed into becoming some sort of permanent lockdown until a “cure” for coronavirus is found. A cure, Portnoy reminds his viewers, “is not a guarantee.” Portnoy started his video saying, “Dr. Fauci… gets in front of the Senate, he’s like ‘we re-open the country too quick, everybody’s dead.’ Where did that come from? And the L.A. Mayor, ‘we’re not opening the city until we find a cure’? What? Find a cure? Who says we’re going to find a cure?” Watch: NSFW Emergency Press Conference – When Did Flattening The Curve Turn Into Finding The Cure pic.twitter.com/ZaSTxL6Tuc — Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) May 14, 2020  “We haven’t found a cure to cancer,” Portnoy added. “It took AIDS twenty years, and whatever, do we even have a cure? So, the economy is just shut down?” Portnoy noted that when the crisis first started the medical advisers said that we needed to make sure there were hospital beds for a possible influx of patients. But “we are there” and that goal has been met, the sports blogger said. “We’re doing what you asked,” Portnoy said of those who want the country on lockdown, “but now you’re changing the rules,” he exclaimed. Portnoy’s main concern, though, was how these lockdowns are now causing more harm than good by destroying the entire U.S. economy. “Imagine working for a year, five years, ten years, two decades, grinding your fingers to the bone to build a business,” Portnoy ranted, “people have jobs and have worked their whole fucking life to put food on the table, to create a happy living. They’re just going to go out of business? They’re going to just wake up whenever this thing ends, whenever the mayors say ‘Oh, you can go back to work,’ work to what? Your company is going to be out of business.” Portnoy said that we have come to a point where people need to be able to make intelligent choices. They need to be able to choose how they will protect themselves from the virus, but also make a choice on how to protect their livelihoods. “If I’ve dedicated 20 years of my life [to my business],” Portnoy said, “I don’t want to start over. I’ll fucking deal with corona. You can’t just make everyone stay inside and basically start over. It’s insane.” Portnoy insisted that shutting down the whole country for this virus is the wrong move. “At least we have a chance if we go out with corona, like Switzerland and those places that just let it roll. We have NO chance if we don’t let people outside. This country’s going to be done-zo. No one’s going to have jobs, no one’s going to have businesses. It’s going to be done. It’s over. Let me roll the dice and play with corona. At least give me the choice. That’s all we want.” Follow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston.

Democrats declined to require Dr. Rick Bright, the “whistleblower” who appeared before the House on Thursday, to testify under oath as he told a subcommittee that the Trump administration had not responded adequately to the coronavirus pandemic. Bright, the former director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), was reassigned last month to a position at the National Institutes of Health. He claimed he was a victim of retaliation for his opposition to President Donald Trump’s support for the use of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and zinc to treat coronavirus patients. However, plans to remove Bright were reportedly in the works before the coronavirus pandemic, as he was accused of “incompetence and insubordination.” Politico also reported that Bright had written in support of hydroxychloroquine. Bright, who has failed to show up for work at his new job, immediately hired attorney Debra Katz, who represented Christine Blasey Ford in 2018 during Democrats’ effort to stop the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. At the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health hearing, Ranking Member Rep. Dr. Michael Burgess (R-TX) noted that this was only the first hearing the committee was holding on the pandemic, five months after it first began.  Rep. Greg Walden (R-OR) noted that Katz was seated at the table next to Dr. Bright with a microphone, calling the arrangement “extraordinarily unusual” for a government witness to be testifying along with a private attorney. Rep. Larry Bucshon (R-IN) raised a parliamentary objection, noting that Dr. Bright was not testifying under oath. “[If] he’s … not under oath, if we get into whistleblower allegations, how can we be sure the witness is telling the truth under oath if they’re not under oath, and if they’re not under oath, then how can you talk about the whistleblower complaints in a fair and equitable manner?” he asked. Committee chair Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA) declined to place Dr. Bright under oath before his testimony, but noted that “all witnesses know that it is illegal to lie to Congress.” Dr. Bright’s opening statement consisted largely of criticisms and concerns about the Trump administration’s policy response to the pandemic. He praised experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci, a member of President Trump’s coronavirus task force. Joel B.

ROME — Pope Francis has asked people of all religions to join in prayer on Thursday, appealing to God for an end to the coronavirus pandemic. “Men and women of every religious confession, today we unite in prayer and penance to ask for the grace of healing from this pandemic,” the pope said during the celebration of morning Mass on Thursday. The pope was reiterating a call by the Vatican-sponsored Higher Committee of Human Fraternity for a common day of prayer and fasting, insisting that the world is “facing a great danger that threatens the lives of millions of people around the world due to the growing spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.” The Higher Committee of Human Fraternity began as a Muslim-Catholic association born from a 2019 meeting in Abu Dhabi between Pope Francis and the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar to sign the Document on Human Fraternity. The committee “aspires to undertake complex challenges facing communities of all faiths, with an approach of openness, learning and dialogue,” its website states. In its call to prayer, the committee invites believers of the world of any and all faiths to make Thursday May 14 “a day for fasting, prayers, and supplications for the good of all humanity.” “Each one, from wherever they are and according to the teachings of their religion, faith, or sect, should implore God to lift this pandemic off us and the entire world, to rescue us all from this adversity,” the text states, “to inspire scientists to find a cure that can turn back this disease, and to save the whole world from the health, economic, and human repercussions of this serious pandemic.” “While we reaffirm the role of medicine and scientific research in fighting this pandemic, we should not forget to seek refuge in God, the All-Creator, as we face such severe crisis [sic],” the message reads. “Therefore, we call on all peoples around the world to do good deeds, observe fast, pray, and make devout supplications to God Almighty to end this pandemic,” it says. Religious leaders and peoples around the world are invited to “together beseech God Almighty to safeguard the entire world, to help us overcome this pandemic, to restore security, stability, healthiness, and prosperity, so that, after this pandemic is over, our world will become a better place for humanity and fraternity than ever before.” Follow @tdwilliamsrome

According to a recent report, the increased number of employees working from home due to the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic has led to more workplace surveillance by employers. Employees report being instructed to install “tattleware’ monitoring programs on their computers tracking mouse movements and keystrokes, as well as smartphone apps to track their movements during working hours. NPR reports that employees are facing increased surveillance from employers as many firms transition to remote working setups. NPR uses the example of a 25-year-old e-commerce worker who was reportedly instructed to install tracking apps on their computer as a condition of continued employment. The e-commerce worker and their colleagues were instructed to install software called Hubstaff on their personal computers in order to track their mouse movements and keyboard strokes and record the website that they visited. They were also told to install an app called Sheets on their phone to keep tabs on their location during work hours. The worker told NPR: “There are five of us. And we always came to work. We always came on time. There was no reason to start location-tracking us.” The worker spoke to NPR on the condition of anonymity as they feared they could lose their job. Another worker at a small company in Minnesota was instructed by their employer to install a software called Time Doctor which downloads videos of employees’ screens while they work, it can also take a photo of the employee via their webcam every ten minutes. “If you’re idle for a few minutes, if you go to the bathroom or whatever, a pop-up will come up and it’ll say, ‘You have 60 seconds to start working again or we’re going to pause your time,’ ” the employee said. The employee added: “I just feel like crap. I feel like I’m not trusted. I feel ashamed of myself. My co-workers were really, really upset. But everyone was too afraid to say anything.” Critics have called this software “tattleware” but the developers of these apps disagree. Brad Miller, who runs the Connecticut-based company Awareness Technologies commented: “If you’re not working or doing something wrong, then I guess it will tattle on you, but I don’t think that’s really how companies that are buying [the software] think of it as.” Since the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak, Miller stated that Awareness Technologies’ business has tripled. “Are they generally active on programs and websites that I would consider productive like Excel, PowerPoint, Word, email, as opposed to YouTube or Facebook?” Miller asked. “That’s primarily what our customers are looking to know.” Read more at NPR here.

Tampa Bay Rays ace pitcher Blake Snell is no fan of the idea of playing high-risk baseball for less money. In fact, when it comes to the question of risking infection while playing under MLB’s proposed revenue sharing model, Snell says: “It’s just not worth it.” Snell outlined his position in a video post to social media on Monday. “Y’all gotta understand, man, for me to go — for me to take a pay cut is not happening, because the risk is through the roof,” Snell explained on his Twitch channel. “It’s a shorter season, less pay. “No, I gotta get my money. I’m not playing unless I get mine, OK? And that’s just the way it is for me. Like, I’m sorry you guys think differently, but the risk is way the hell higher and the amount of money I’m making is way lower. Why would I think about doing that?” Major League Baseball is proposing a 50-50 revenue split with the players, as opposed to the prorated deal that the players accepted six weeks ago. The revenue split is something new to baseball, which is the country’s only major sports league without a salary cap. That portion of the owner’s proposal is expected to be immediately rejected by the players. Despite saying he “love[s] baseball to death,” Snell doesn’t see the high-risk/lower reward offer from MLB as being worth it. “Bro, I’m risking my life,” Snell said. “What do you mean it should not be a thing? It should 100% be a thing. If I’m gonna play, I should be getting the money I signed to be getting paid. I should not be getting half of what I’m getting paid because the season’s cut in half, on top of a 33% cut of the half that’s already there — so I’m really getting, like, 25%. “On top of that, it’s getting taxed. So imagine how much I’m actually making to play, you know what I’m saying?” In a text message to the Tampa Bay Times, Snell addressed how some might perceive his comments as greedy. “I mean honestly it’s just scary to risk my life to get Covid-19 as well as not knowing and spreading it to the others,” Snell wrote.. “I just want everyone to be healthy and get back to our normal lives cause I know I miss mine!” Snell has a five-year deal with the Rays worth $50 million.

The Chinese government propaganda newspaper Global Times “exclusively” reported on Thursday that the Communist Party is looking into sanctions against American officials supporting lawsuits against Beijing for causing the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. Among those listed as potential targets of sanctions are the attorney general of Missouri – the first state to sue the Chinese Communist Party in U.S. court over the pandemic – Eric Schmitt; Senators Josh Hawley (R-MO), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), and Tom Cotton (R-AR); and Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-TX), among others. The Global Times cited “sources close to the matter,” without elaborating, and did not offer any timeline for potential sanctions. It suggested that among the potential sanctions against those mentioned could be bans to travel into China, which would include nominally autonomous regions like Hong Kong, and economic sanctions against doing business with China. One of the Global Times‘ many Communist Party-approved “experts” asserted in the newspaper’s report that China “should impose countermeasures that could make them feel the pain.” The newspaper claimed that Beijing is not currently seeking to similarly punish the many other governments entertaining lawsuits against the Communist Party for hiding the contagious nature of the Chinese coronavirus and censoring pivotal safety information in a manner that scientists have concluded led to the regional outbreak in Wuhan, central China, turning into a pandemic. Countries like Nigeria, Italy, and Egypt are currently entertaining lawsuits against China over the pandemic. “China is extremely dissatisfied with the abuse of litigation by the US against China over the COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] epidemic and mulling punitive countermeasures against US individuals, entities and state officials such as Missouri’s attorney general Eric Schmitt,” the Global Times claimed. “At least four U.S. Congress lawmakers and two entities will be put onto China’s sanction list, according to analysts.” The newspaper did not identify the four lawmakers, instead speculating separately from the claims by “sources” that a significant number of members of Congress may be targets of sanctions because of their calls for justice on the part of the victims of the Chinese coronavirus: Those Republicans who have been harshly criticizing China and inflaming this “holding China accountable” political farce will face severe consequences. […] Josh Hawley – a Missouri Republican – who came up with the “Justice for Victims of COVID-19 Act” in mid-April which would take away China’s sovereign immunity and permit US citizens to sue the Chinese government for downplaying COVID-19 information. Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton and Texas Republican Dan Crenshaw also introduced legislation that would allow Americans to sue China over the coronavirus. A day later, Republican Chris Smith of New Jersey proposed the likewise bill to strip China of its sovereign immunity and allow Americans to sue the Chinese government, according to his official website. Republican Jim Banks also joined the blame game in condemning the Chinese government’s handling of the epidemic outbreak. The Times also identified “GOP Senator Marsha Blackburn from Tennessee, Martha McSally from Arizona and Lance Gooden of Texas … [and] Jim Holzapfel, Greg McGuckin and John Catalano” as potential targets. The propaganda outlet did not specify what the “sources” claimed the consequences for these public officials will be for challenging the Communist Party. It turned instead to its “experts,” who noted that Missouri, in particular, engages in a high volume of trade with China that Beijing could easily cut off. “China was the third-largest export destination for Missouri, after the UK and Canada, for goods and services in 2019 worth $1.1 billion and $775 million, respectively. Some of the top goods exported to China included oilseeds and grains, meat products, and medicine,” the Global Times noted. An “expert” also suggested that China must “find out what the business ties are between those officials or their families with China,” referring to those in defense of lawsuits against China for its role in causing the pandemic. In a separate article, in part an interview with an anonymous “international relations observer in Beijing,” the Global Times accuses the American officials in question of “picking quarrels.” “Picking quarrels and provoking trouble” is a discrete crime in China, one typically used to silence peaceful dissidents, religious people, or others the Communist Party deems a threat. The anonymous “observer” expressed concern that, if American public servants are successful in suing China over the pandemic, this will send a signal to the world that other affected nations may also receive redress for what they have suffered due to the Communist Party’s negligence. “China has to fight back, as some U.S. politicians show no sign of stopping to fabricate nasty rumors while continuing their gangster-like and cruel tactics to pressure China. If this madness continues, more countries are likely to join the shameless US blame game,” the “observer” said. The threat of explicit action against individuals who believe the Communist Party is to blame for the severity of the pandemic – not an accusation that China genetically engineered the virus or deliberately released it, only that its actions after identifying the virus made the situation far worse than it could have been – is an escalation from previous reports in the Party newspaper. In April, the Global Times was merely threatening to allow similar lawsuits against the United States for the HIV/AIDS epidemic of the 1980s. The Times alleged that HIV originated in the United States, which is not a scientific fact, and that Washington exacerbated its spread at the time. “If the US really acts that way [allows lawsuits against China], it would open a Pandora’s box and result in the collapse of the world’s sovereignty immunity system,” the Global Times asserted. “It would mean anyone could sue the US government in their own countries – an AIDS patient could sue it for compensation, for example.” The state of Missouri sued the Chinese Communist Party in April, citing various concealing actions as having exacerbated the crisis. Among them were the widespread arrests of doctors in Wuhan who shared information on how to protect oneself from contagious diseases in January. Dr. Li Wenliang has become a martyr in anti-communist circles after being detained and forced to sign a humiliating apology statement for sharing information with other doctors on social media, urging them to wash their hands and use protective gear after treating patients with what he correctly believed was a contagious viral illness. Li allegedly died of coronavirus infection in February. Chinese dictator Xi Jinping also urged the World Health Organization to conceal evidence that the new virus was contagious and delay declaring the outbreak a pandemic, according to a report in the German newspaper Der Spiegel last week. “What we know is that the Chinese government engaged in a campaign of deceit and deception, of misrepresentations, of malfeasance in really critical weeks — in the months of December and January when they were aware this disease could be transmitted human to human,” Attorney General Eric Schmitt said in April. “And valuable time was lost all the while they were hoarding quality PPE. China went from being a net exporter of PPE to being a net importer of PPE during this time. It was really avoidable. This could have been prevented.” The Communist Party’s actions “have been injurious to—and have significantly interfered with—the lives, health, and safety of substantial numbers of Missouri residents, ruining lives and damaging the public order and economy of the State of Missouri,” the lawsuit itself asserted. To override the principle of sovereign immunity, which bans lawsuits against state entities, Missouri attorneys contend that the Communist Party is a separate entity from the government of China. Missouri Senator Hawley has been supportive of the lawsuit and has urged government exceptions to sovereign immunity for more of them. “We ought to allow individuals and states to sue Beijing. We should wave their sovereign immunity. That’s just the immunity every government gets in U.S. courts. China shouldn’t get it right now,” Hawley said in an interview this month. “We didn’t give the 9/11 hijackers immunity after the 9/11 massacre. We shouldn’t be giving Beijing immunity after what they have done to this country.” Sen. Blackburn and Rep. Gooden are sponsoring a bill in Congress that would create legal exceptions to sovereign immunity for China. “The Chinese Communist Party has repeatedly demonstrated its willingness to lie to the world about this deadly and costly outbreak. … We cannot rely on the Chinese government to be honest, which means we cannot afford to accept the narrative the CCP wants us to believe,” the two lawmakers wrote in an opinion article last month. “If we grow to understand how the COVID-19 crisis escalated from a regional outbreak into a global tragedy, we may be able to prevent the disastrous consequences of future pandemics. By unleashing the investigatory power of our legal system, we can discover the truth, prepare for the future, and ensure the people get the answers they deserve.”  Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.

MSNBC “Morning Joe” host Joe Scarborough on Thursday slammed President Donald Trump for “bouncing back and forth” on what he says about the coronavirus pandemic. Scarborough pointed to a poll showing 36% of Americans believe what Trump has to say about the pandemic. He then called on family members of the 36% to keep household appliances such as blenders away from them. “[H]ere is a man who has been bouncing back and forth from saying that there’s nothing to worry about, this is going to all go away, it’s just one person coming in from China, it is only 11 people coming in, it is only 15 people, it’s going to be down to zero, it’s all going away in April,” Scarborough outlined. “He’s been saying this for months. And then one day, he’ll go, ‘Well, you know, 2 million people could die, so we’re going to shut down.'” “He bounces back and forth, and back and forth, and back and forth,” he continued. “There’s no consistency, which is why Donald Trump only has 36% of Americans who believe anything he says about this pandemic. And by the way, those 36% of Americans, I ask friends and loved ones to keep household appliances like blenders out of their reach. We don’t want them to lose any fingers, don’t want them to lose any hands. Keep blenders and other sharp devices away from them — basic household tools. These people could probably put out an eye with a screwdriver. … Please don’t let them play with blenders.” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent

As Mexican health officials discuss returning to a “new normal,” the country continues to see dramatic increases in cases of Coronavirus (COVID-19). The spikes come despite official accusations and admissions of manipulated statistics. During a nightly news conference, Mexico’s Undersecretary of Health Hugo Lopez Gatell and staff presented a total of 40,186 confirmed cases and 4,220 fatalities since the pandemic first arrived. Al 13 de mayo de 2020 hay 40,186 casos confirmados, 9,378 confirmados activos y 24,856 sospechosos por #COVID19. Se han registrado 83,455 negativos, 4,220 defunciones confirmadas, 318 defunciones sospechosas y fueron estudiadas 148,497 personas. 1/3 pic.twitter.com/hiAmLRKjbl — Hugo López-Gatell Ramírez (@HLGatell) May 14, 2020  Lopez Gatell was harshly criticized for undercounting the true scope of the pandemic and performing limited tests. So far, Mexican federal health officials have only conducted 148,497 tests. Lopez Gatell previously admitted that federal figures only account for government hospitals. The discrepancies led several states like Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon, and others to release their own which can show almost twice as many patients. This week, the chief nursing officer for Mexico’s government health system announced she tested positive and was going into isolation. Chief Fabiana Zepeda Arias previously spoke out about the public harassment of nurses and medical staff. Me encuentro en aislamiento, ya que di positivo a COVID19.

The Philippine government ordered an investigation into a birthday party held for Manila’s police chief amid a ban on large gatherings in the capital meant to curb the spread of the Chinese coronavirus, Reuters reported on Wednesday. On May 8, the Manila police department posted photos of the birthday celebration to its official Facebook page. The photos soon went viral across Philippine social media, drawing criticism from the public for the blatant defiance of government quarantine mandates currently in place in Metro Manila during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. On Wednesday, the Philippines National Police Chief and Justice Minister ordered separate investigations into the incident, according to the report. Under the Sinas-Gamboa Law, birthday parties are again allowed, if you are chief of Metro Manila police. pic.twitter.com/XgZhyOoMCM — Tonyo Cruz (@tonyocruz) May 13, 2020  Photos of the celebration show Debold Sinas, chief of the National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO), gathered with dozens of fellow officers. Some people in the photos are not wearing masks, and nearly all are shown sitting and standing close to one another, with no attempt at physical distancing seemingly made. Beer cans are pictured on tables at the party, defying a current ban on liquor during the coronavirus lockdown. A live music band was also shown performing. The Philippine Star reported the party was held at the NCRPO headquarters in Metro Manila. “It was never my intention to disobey existing protocols relative to the implementation of the enhanced community quarantine,” Sinas said in a statement, according to Reuters. On May 1, a Metro Manila police officer beat a man with a stick for allegedly violating coronavirus quarantine mandates by not wearing a sanitary face mask outdoors. The man was forcibly arrested in an incident caught on video by witnesses, who shared the footage with local news outlets. The use of excessive force was widely condemned by the Philippine public. On Tuesday, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte extended a lockdown of the greater Manila area until May 31. Manila’s lockdown began on March 16, making it among the longest coronavirus quarantines in the world. The quarantine measures were enacted in an effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The strict mandates have restricted people’s movement to an extreme degree and shut down most businesses in Metro Manila, the world’s most densely populated urban center. On April 1, President Duterte told law enforcement they should “shoot to kill” if they encounter coronavirus quarantine violators. The order revived concerns that police could enforce martial law during the lockdown, which many Filipinos have feared since the strict “enhanced community quarantine” was first announced in March. On Wednesday, the NCRPO restricted Philippine news outlet Rappler’s coverage after the website published a story about Sinas’s birthday party, including several photos of the gathering. According to the news site, the NCRPO’s public information officer, Britz Estadilla, removed Rambo Talabong, Rappler’s reporter covering the Philippine National Police (PNP), from the official NCRPO Viber (messaging app) group channel on Wednesday. Rappler accused the national police of restricting its coverage and condemned the move as “an attack on press freedom and the right to free speech.” The news site has been the target of government scorn for its coverage of Duterte’s administration in the past, with the president ordering the arrest of Rappler founder Maria Ressa multiple times. Ressa was charged for allegedly violating Philippine laws prohibiting the management of a domestic media company by a foreign entity, which she denies. At press time on Wednesday, the Philippines had recorded 11,618 infections and 772 deaths from the Chinese coronavirus.

New claims for unemployment benefits fell to 2.98 million last week, data from the Department of Labor showed Thursday. That brings new unemployment claims, a proxy for layoffs, since the coronavirus pandemic began to claim jobs eight weeks ago to around 36.5 million. Economists had been expecting 2.7 million for weekly claims. The prior week was initially reported at 3.169 million and was revised up by 7,000 in this week’s report. Claims hit a record 6.87 million for the week of March 28. Each subsequent week has seen claims decline. The higher than expected number of claims, however, may point toward a new surge in job losses as shutdowns, social distancing, and stay-at-home orders have hurt businesses and weighed on demand for workers. Continuing claims, those made after an initial application, rose to 22.8 million for the week ended May 2, an increase of 456,000 from the previous week. Those are reported with a one-week lag. The federal government has been shipping in an extra $600 a week to state unemployment benefits, making the program much more generous. Many workers can now earn more on unemployment than they did when they had a job. These super-sized benefits, however, are set to run out in July. Last week the government said the U.S. unemployment rate soared to 14.7 percent, the highest since the Great Depression. The new claims numbers may be undercounting the toll the coronavirus and lockdowns have exacted on the U.S. labor market. Many states have ha problems processing the large amount of claims.  

More than twenty Conservative parliamentarians have written to Boris Johnson’s trade secretary urging action to reduce Britain’s “dangerous” dependence on China, after a report revealed the country relies on the Communist-led dictatorship for many vital supplies. A report by the Henry Jackson Society found that Britain relies on China for the supply of some 71 “critical goods” — including pharmaceutical products necessary to manufacture antibiotics and anti-viral drugs, as well as well as important chemical and electronics, according to The Times. Tory backbenchers including former party leader Iain Duncan Smith and former Cabinet ministers David Davis and Owen Paterson have in consequence signed a letter addressed to Liz Truss, Secretary of State for International Trade, urging an annual audit of the countries supplying such vital trade, and action with like-minded democracies such as the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand to counteract the outsized influence of the Chinese Communist Party in world trade. ‘Operation Kowtow’ — Ex-PM May’s Top Adviser Admits UK Submission to ‘Brutal’ Chinese Regime was ‘Naive’ https://t.co/yEy5IhxOmR — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 21, 2020  “Those that govern us need to wake up to the new reality and stop clinging to a future consigned to history,” warned Bob Seely, a Conservative MP and Armed Forces veteran who sits on the Commons Select Committee for Foreign Affairs and previously served multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, in a Times Red Box article. The parliamentarian said he had “written to the International Trade minister to suggest that the government tell parliament annually about the extent of our trade dependency on others, especially authoritarian powers” — but the government is often very much opposed to transparency in this area. For instance, Breitbart London tried for over a year to get Her Majesty’s Treasury to reveal how much government debt is owed to different foreign governments, sovereign wealth funds, and so on under the Freedom of Information Act — but officials steadfastly insisted that they did not hold this information. The Information Commissioner agreed on appeal that this was likely not correct, and that the government would almost certainly hold such information at least for national security purposes — but ultimately did not take action to try and make HM Treasury disclose the information. Along with 22 other MPs I’ve written to @trussliz @tradegovuk today, to make sure our trade policy with China is consistent with our strategic interests 🇳 pic.twitter.com/faxcX19VEd — Damian Collins (@DamianCollins) May 14, 2020  “[T]rade is strategic. It is clear that the UK is dangerously laissez-faire, especially in relation to China’s mercantilist communism, where trade is used as a strategic geopolitical objective,” Mr Seely explained, suggesting that it “cannot be right that in more than 200 categories of goods, many of which have strategic implications, we are heavily dependent on an authoritarian regime.” “I am relaxed about China supplying 83 per cent of Christmas lights… but there are many areas where dependence on China — medicines and advanced telecomms to name but two — is dangerous,” he added. In their Breaking the China Chain report, the Henry Jackson Society found the United Kingdom suffers from “high levels of dependency within critical sectors”. It reports: Within the medical sector, the UK is dependent on China for a series of goods. Among these are phenylacetic acid (96%) a chemical used in a series of drugs… Britain is also dependent upon China for imports of chloramphenicol (88%), an antibiotic; acetylsalicylic acid (61%), aspirin; azelaic acid (58%), used in skin medicines; aniline and similar amine-function-compounds (95%), used in paracetamol; phosphonates (57%), used in anti-viral medicines; hydantoin (55%), and anthraquinone (53%). It is also dependent on China for its supply of steel sanitary ware (51%) and copper sanitary ware (70%). In addition, the UK is dependent on China for a series of goods with important industrial applications, including stud-link chain (85%), steel-capped boots (63%), safety glass (61%), barium carbonate (57%), artificial corundum (56%), steel grinding balls (55%), magnets of all types (52%), and magnesium (50%). Likewise, the UK is highly dependent on China for television receivers and decoders (83%), laptops (68%), and mobile phones (61%). Looking at solutions to dependency on China, the report suggested “negative decoupling” — placing tariffs or bans on Chinese goods in strategic industries, “positive decoupling” — encouraging domestic strategic industries, and “cooperative decoupling” — Western nations doing those things together.

Just when you think the corrupt media cannot possibly move the coronavirus goalposts any further, ABC’s Jonathan Karl launches those posts into the outer reaches of space with the stupidest, most anti-science goal ever conceived. Get this… America’s testing infrastructure will not be acceptable to the fake news media until everyone is tested every freakin’ day they go to work. Oh, and President Trump accepted the premise. During his Monday evening briefing at the White House Rose Garden, for whatever reason, Trump once again allowed the fake news media to ask him questions … and things ended exactly as they always do when Trump invites the fake media to ask him questions: another dysfunctional disaster, a train wreck that failed to serve the country in any positive or informative way. Trump had hoped to use the briefing to rightfully brag on America’s impressive testing capacity, a hope he himself ensured would turn to shit by inviting the same group of media assholes he always invites, and here is just one of the results… ABC’s Jonathan Karl: Your staff, your senior staff, as you just referenced, is able to get tested every day; when will it be that Americans across the country will be able to get tested every day as they go back to work? President Trump: Very soon; really, very soon. Trump went on to talk about how far testing has come in just two months, which is, like I said, impressive, but here was that lunatic Karl’s follow up… Karl: Should people be told to go back to work until they have that assurance that they and their co-workers are able to get tests — which we’re still not there. Trump: We’re leaving that up to the governors, as  you know. What kind of madness are these two talking about? Testing every worker every day they go to work??? Let me repeat that for emphasis… Every American worker must be tested at the beginning of every work day. That’s around 150 million tests per day … per day! That’s around a billion tests per week … per week! That’s not only an impossibility, it’s anti-science; a goal so ignorant, so stupefyingly stupid, it could only come from a national political reporter (who apparently doesn’t wear his virtue-signaling mask when he thinks no one’s looking). Let me begin by saying I love this country. I love this country so much that once marrying anything you want to marry becomes legal during the first term of the Kamala Harris presidency, I intend to gay-marry this country. But as awesome the future Mrs. America Nolte is, she cannot effectively and reliably test 150 million people per day. No one can effectively and reliably complete a billion tests a week, four billion a month, 50 billion year… We just can’t. What are we going to do, put one of those little machines in every workplace…? In every office? In every factory, book store, Pizza Hut, construction site, convenience store, post office, and Starbucks break lounge? Along with one of those machines, will there be a government-trained medical professional at every location to ensure the test is run correctly? This simply cannot be done. Of course we test everyone every day at the White House. We’re talking about the president and vice president of the United States;  the entire executive-level of the federal government is in and out of there. But does this mean we need to do the same at every Costco, real estate office, and fast food joint in the country? Can’t you just see a hundred guys lined up every morning at a construction site for the Five-Minute Test. There are five five-minute machines available, so instead of taking 500 minutes to get through the line, it only takes 100 minutes, and everything is perfectly sterile and gloves are changed after every test and this is the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard. Even if you believe it should be that way, it doesn’t matter: it simply cannot be effectively done. But that’s the standard the fake media are going to set because they know it’s an impossible standard and under no circumstance can Trump ever be allowed to succeed. Which begs the question… Why in the name of all that’s holy is Trump accepting the premise and ensuring everyone that  “very soon” the United States of America will reliably complete 150 million coronavirus tests a day? As far as the science… This is not good science. Forget the fact it can’t be done. Even if we could do it,  you are talking about trillions and trillions of dollars being spent on something totally unnecessary. Think about it… Other than a few meat processing plants where things are now under control, we’re not hearing about any devastating outbreaks or waves of infections and hospitalizations at all those places of business that have remained in operation throughout this pandemic. America’s Walmarts and take-out restaurants and pharmacies and other essential companies have figured it out, have managed to stay open and relatively healthy without everyone being tested every single day. If the post office and Costco and your local gas station are able to march on without testing every worker every day, why can’t the rest of us? And now I’m going to say something that the delicate among you might wish to avoid… Ready? Okay, here we go… That facts of life are this: It might take until the end of this year, it might take until the end of next year, it might take ten years, but as I have been saying for more than a month now, and as Dr. Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, has just had the courage to say out loud, the China Virus is going to rage “until it infects everybody it possibly can,” which means it “surely won’t slow down until it hits 60 to 70%” of the population. And do you want to know why it will rage until about 200 to 250 million of Americans are infected…? Because that’s the percentage of the population required to achieve herd immunity. Oh, and there’s another reason why… There’s no cure for the coronavirus, and if past is prologue, there never will be. Did you know we still have no cure for the Spanish Flu of 1918, an epidemic that wiped out 50 to 100 million worldwide and more than a half-million Americans. Did you know there’s still no cure for the Hong Kong flu, a virus that killed up to three million worldwide and 100,000 Americans in 1968? In both cases, the virus eventually stopped being lethal, or at least became less lethal, by way of herd immunity, the virus mutating, or a combination of both. Right now, Osterholm figures that not even 20 percent of the country has been infected with the coronavirus, which means we have a long way to go. This is an infectious disease. That means that unless you’re perfect with your mask, your hand washing,  and disinfecting your mail and groceries 100 percent of time, eventually it’s going to get you… It’s going to get all of us… Testing will not save us. Testing is not a cure. All testing can do is ensure we get ahead of a major outbreak before it overwhelms our health care system, which is a worthy goal, but we don’t have to complete 150 million tests a day to achieve that worthy goal, we probably don’t have to complete one percent of 150 million tests a day to achieve that worthy goal It’s all so stupid. Everything’s so stupid. But do you want to know what’s really stupid? You can have and spread the coronavirus while still testing negative for the virus. It’s called a false negative, it’s a real problem, and do we really want all our employees running around with a false sense of security after testing negative? So riddle me this testing fanatics… If we’re all going to eventually be infected anyway, what’s the point? If the tests aren’t going to catch everyone, what’s the point? I mean, other than to set an absurd standard that can never be achieved as a means to make Rapey Joe Biden president?  Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.

The traditionally left-wing Australian Workers’ Union (AWU) has put partisan politics to one side and joined calls for China’s efforts at global supremecy to be defeated. It wants a “trade NATO” bloc powerful enough to take on “China’s preferred approach of bilateral bullying” as a preferred means of keeping free trade a reality. AWU National Secretary Daniel Walton has sent a letter to Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison urging him to not capitulate to the Communist state’s threats of trade retaliation over the coronavirus pandemic, telling the conservative coalition leader the union is backing him. “The integrity of Australia’s trading regime is paramount to sovereignty,” Walton wrote. “We note with concern the pressure being placed upon the Australian government with respect to the integrity of its trade regime.” <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> The letter comes after after China targeted Australia’s beef and barley producers this week before threatening to cut off Australia’s $63 billion iron ore export pipeline to Beijing following the Morrison Government’s calls for an international inquiry into the origins of the deadly coronavirus. The AWU, which was founded in the 1880s and has over 100,000 members,  says Australia must stand firm against the Chinese government. “Australia should resist any attempts to be bullied,” Walton’s letter continued, as News.com reports. “It is critical the Australian ­government holds its nerve against such pressure and enforces its international and domestic rights.” The AWU show of public support for the Australian government came within hours of China slapping an import ban on four Australian abattoirs in an escalation of Beijing’s warning of a widening consumer boycott in retaliation for Canberra’s push for an independent coronavirus probe. China Warns Australia: Drop Coronavirus Probe or Pay an Economic Price https://t.co/V54exGJuOT — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 27, 2020  Earlier this week China also flagged plans to slap an 80 percent tariff on Australian barley, bringing the trade to its knees. Australia however is not alone in its fight against China. As Breitbart news reported, a bipartisan U.S. Congress group has slammed China for threatening punitive economic sanctions against any country that opposes it. The 27 senators and House of Representatives members said China had made “deeply disturbing” threats against long-term ally Australia and the U.S. will stand with the Aussies against China’s bullying.

The UK economy is heading for the ‘recession to end all recessions’ with GDP predicted to plunge by nearly one third this quarter — the worst crash in 300 years. According to Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak — quoted in the Mail — it is ‘very likely’ that the UK is already in the middle of a ‘significant recession’. No shit, Sunak! Traditionally the duty of the Chancellor of the Exchequer is to act as a brake on the otherwise limitless spending aspirations of his government. Not this Chancellor, though. Instead, he appears to imagine that he has discovered a magic money tree and has announced that he will use its fruit to sprinkle free cash on the British population till at least as late as October. That’s how long, he announced this week, he intends to go on paying the so-called ‘furlough’, whereby a significant chunk of the working population — seven and a half million and counting — can remain in lockdown but have 80 per cent of their salaries covered by the government, up to a maximum of £2,500 a month, in order to preserve their jobs for when the economy recovers. Can anyone see what the problem is here? It’s quite an obvious one and I’m quite surprised that Sunak — with his PPE degree from Oxford and his stint at Goldman Sachs — can’t see it. Answer: magic money trees don’t exist. They are a figment of the imagination of socialist economists. A government can only spend what it takes in taxes, what it borrows, or what it pretends to conjure from thin air by debasing the currency through processes like quantitative easing. None of that money that Rishi Sunak is splashing around like a drunken sailor on shore leave is his money or even the government’s money: every last penny of it is either your money — or the money belonging to all those future generations who are going to be on the hook for Sunak’s profligacy for many decades to come. When governments borrow on as epic a scale as Sunak inevitably must, it takes generations for the money to be paid back. For example, it wasn’t until 31st December 2006 that Britain paid out the last instalment on the £21 billion it had borrowed to pay for World War II. That £21 billion — obviously, it would be considerably more if adjusted for inflation — sounds like peanuts when set against Sunak’s current spending plans. Just the furlough scheme alone is costing £8 billion a month. According to the Telegraph, a confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis estimates the total cost could be as high as £300 billion. In the worst-case scenario they quote, it could be as much as £1.19 trillion over five years. Where is that extra money going to come from? The options being discussed, according to the Telegraph, range from tax rises — including an increase in VAT — to a public sector pay freeze. What doesn’t appear to be on the table, oddly, is the pointless, environmentally destructive £100 billion-plus HS2 project. Nor has the government made any mention of its biggest white elephant project of all — its mission to make Britain Net-Zero by 2050. Treasury analysts are also increasingly worried that instead of having a ‘V-shaped’ recovery — where the economy bounces back quickly — Britain is more likely to have an ‘L-shaped’ one where everything stagnates. But it’s hardly surprising that this is a likely proposition when a) Boris is keeping Britain on near-endless lockdown (despite increasing evidence that it will make little difference to Coronavirus’s trajectory) and b) the government is continuing to pretend that it is green business as usual. No government which took the impending economic disaster seriously would be wasting scare resources on Net Zero nonsense: artificially driving up the cost of energy by embracing renewables just makes business less competitive and the cost of living more expensive. Britain is heading for economic disaster. And what’s most depressing is that this disaster is almost entirely of this allegedly Conservative government’s making. The Chancellor could have saved billions by keeping furlough repayments low — giving people an added incentive to get back to work rather than cowering at home cushioned by the Nanny State. He should also — as a member of the Quadrumvirate currently running Britain — have the voice that demanded, insisted, that the lockdown was unsustainable. “If you want to destroy the economy, fine,” he should have said to Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and Dominic Raab, “But not in my name, you don’t. I’m resigning.” It would have been the only right and principled thing for a Chancellor to do in this unparalleled display of governmental stupidity. Rishi Sunak has failed the test. Children as yet unborn will be paying for his cowardice and his profligacy, for many years to come. At least people born after 1945 still servicing Britain’s war debts knew that the money had gone to the good cause of defeating Nazi Germany and Japan. But what exactly is the point of all this money we’re squandering on the lockdown and the broken public healthcare system? And will anyone ever take the rap if and when the public inquiry discovers that it was all a massive waste?

(AFP) — BuzzFeed said on Thursday that it would be shuttering part of its loss-making news operations in Britain and Australia, as it scales back global ambitions to cut costs. “For economic and strategic reasons, we are going to focus on news that hits big in the United States during this difficult period,” a company spokesperson said. Many news outlets have been hard-hit by the coronavirus pandemic, with plummeting advertising revenues and already struggling operations pushed deeper into the red. Ten staff in Britain and four in Australia will be furloughed, in a move that is expected to become permanent. The company will no longer cover local news in the two countries, but said: “In the UK, we still plan on retaining some employees who are focused on news with a global audience — social news, celebrity, and investigations.” The four Australian posts were “no longer essential during this time of sharply limited resources,” the company added. “Ax falls quickly at BuzzFeed and Huffpost!” Headline, New York Post.

She lauded her staff’s work to “tackle important and often under-covered beats like abortion, LGBTQ rights, Indigenous affairs, immigration and internet culture.” “I’ve always been grateful for that & very proud of our work.” BuzzFeed asks Obama: Why did you nominate a STRAIGHT WHITE MALE to the Supreme Court? https://t.co/HPxt36L2N3 — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) May 16, 2016  More cost-cutting measures are expected, including in the United States, where “workshare programs” are being touted as a way of avoiding furloughs. “Those options need to meet our savings goals, be legally and logistically workable, and allow us to keep producing kinetic, powerful journalism,” BuzzFeed said. This year “news will spend about $10 million more than it takes in,” it added.

Illegal migrants quarantined aboard the Moby Zaza ferry after landing in Italy to stop the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus are estimated to be costing taxpayers over 4,000 euros per month each. The ferry, which is to be placed two or three miles offshore from the Sicilian town of Porto Empedocle after around a month of pleas by the mayor of Lampedusa Salvatore Martello, houses around 250 people at a time including 35 medical staff to aid the migrants who will be made to engage in quarantine measures in order to make sure they do not have or spread the Chinese virus. Operations aboard the vessel are expected to begin next Monday but the true costs of renting the ship were not revealed until Alessandro Pagano, a member of Matteo Salvini’s League, revealed that the government had given upwards of a million euros to the Moby Line company to rent the ferry from them, Il Giornale reports. Cargo Vessel Unloads Migrants in Sicily As Migrant Route Numbers Rise https://t.co/HU6nenHUmJ — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 10, 2020  “The Moby Line company will receive between the €900,000 and €1.2 million: the sum of €4,210 per month for illegal immigrants embarked,” he said. “We are not talking about a third-hand dinghy, but of a ship equipped with a self-service restaurant, pizzeria, ice cream parlour,  pub with special wine assortment, play area and video room, double or quadruple cabins with services and even luxury suites. All this while Italian families and businesses are on their knees due to the serious economic crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic,” he added. Italy has seen a new surge in illegal migrant arrivals in recent weeks despite the Wuhan coronavirus lockdown measures put in place by the government of Prime minister Giuseppe Conte. The island of Lampedusa has once again seen hundreds of new arrivals which threaten to overwhelm the small island community and Italian police in the north of the country have complained that Slovenian police and border guards have allowed migrants to cross into Italy as well.

The odds the House Democrats’ proposal of $3 trillion in additional funding for projects deemed to be coronavirus-related unveiled by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) earlier this week ever becomes law are slim to none. Some have speculated Pelosi’s motivations are political, which according to Rep. Mike Rogers (R-AL), is the case but it is not necessarily tied to election politics. During an interview that aired on Huntsville, AL radio’s WVNN on Wednesday, Rogers, the ranking Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee, said Pelosi’s purpose was likely self-preservation. “This is more about Nancy Pelosi keeping her position than worrying about energizing the base,” Rogers said. “I’m sure the socialist wing of the Democrat conference believes that this is what they have to do to energize their base. But we’re in a global pandemic. We have people out there who are scared to death about how they are going to keep feeding their family if they’re going to get their job back, what the future holds — if they’re going to get sick and die. And she is fooling with kind of silliness. This is nothing but socialist propaganda.” Rogers questioned the timing of Pelosi’s political gesture, which comes during the coronavirus pandemic. “For her to bring it to the floor — keep in mind, again I think the socialist members of the Democrat Party, they believe in this stuff, and they believe if we get this out there, the American people will cheer and vote for them in November and try to give them more members in the Senate,” he said. “But you know, Nancy Pelosi has been doing this a long time. She knows that the House is only half of the Congress and the White House has got to sign this bill. And she knows that this is going nowhere.” “I’m just disappointed as a seasoned veteran legislator who is in the most powerful position in the House that she is allowing herself to be pushed into wasting our time and delaying action for the American people who need help, for this partisan exercise. Very disappointing.” Rogers also reacted to Republican Mike Garcia’s win in California’s 25th congressional district and Republican State Sen. Tom Tiffany’s win in Wisconsin’s seventh congressional district a night earlier, which he said bodes well for the GOP’s 2020 outlook. “This was an outstanding sign,” he said. “You know, there have been five open seats before this, and all of them have gone Republican. But this seat in California was held by a Democrat — a young lady who got in trouble and had to resign. This is a seat that Hillary Clinton won big. In fact, the Democrats won it last time — won it by nine points. There are more registered Democrats in the seat than there are registered Republicans. Our candidate won it by a wide margin.” “Also, the seat up in Wisconsin was not a give-me,” Rogers added. “A Republican was in it before, but it was a swing district. We won that decidedly. These are both great indicators about November. I think as more people see what Nancy Pelosi is doing with the House — not just this silly bill, this socialist piece of legislation — but the things they’ve been trying to advance for the year before this under her speakership, are perfect examples of why they don’t need to be in charge.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor

Michael Pillsbury, one of America’s leading experts on China, said Tuesday that it was then-Vice President Joe Biden who stopped U.S. Navy patrols from challenging China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea, in one example of how he would be weak on China if elected president. “He’s particularly unaware of military threats. One of the worst things I’ve seen him do … is when he was vice president, Obama wanted to have Navy patrols in the South China Sea. Biden stopped them for four years — would not challenge Chinese claims in the South China Sea,” Pillsbury said during a live streamed Trump campaign event. “So you might think Obama is pretty bad towards China, not quite — he wants to fight China for environmental reasons, global pollution and so forth. Biden is different than Obama, he’s softer and even more vulnerable to Chinese stories and Chinese lies. I’m really worried about him,” he said. During the Obama administration, the Navy ceased patrols through the strategically important body of water between 2012 and 2015 out of concern for upsetting China. During that time, China built artificial islands on land features in the South China Sea and placed weapons systems on them, despite promising the Obama administration that it would not. As first reported by Breitbart News, in the early months of the Trump administration, it authorized a plan to push back on China’s excessive claims in the South China Sea. Pillsbury has served in intelligence and defense roles in every administration since Nixon and authored the 2015 book The Hundred-Year Marathon: China’s Secret Strategy to Replace America as the Global Superpower. Pillsbury also said Biden is part of the “globalist elite” who has long-standing views that China is not a threat to the U.S., as illustrated when he famously dismissed China as a threat at a campaign event. “China is going to eat our lunch? Come on, man,” Biden said at an event in Iowa City, Iowa, in May 2019, a week after he announced his candidacy for president. Pillsbury said Biden’s comment showed that he believes China is weak. “When he says ‘C’mon man,’ they’re not going to eat our lunch — he just doesn’t believe it,” he said “That’s simply against the facts. Now there are some people still who think that China is going to collapse soon and he’s part of that group of globalists.” He said that even Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) was stronger on China, and when he dropped out, the Chinese were “ecstatic.” “The Chinese really were ecstatic. Like, ‘Now our guy is running for president,'” Pillsbury said. Former Trump Deputy National Security Adviser K.T. McFarland, who also spoke at the campaign event, echoed Pillsbury’s comments. She said she was in Beijing in November 2019, meeting with senior leadership of the Chinese government, in every single meeting she had, “the assumption was Joe Biden was going to win.” She said when they were told that Trump could very well be reelected, “they were horrified, because they thought their guy was Joe Biden, they greased the skids, all they need is another five years and they’re going to replace the United States and Joe Biden is going to help them do it.” “The Chinese think they bought Joe Biden, and they think they own Joe Biden,” she said. “He’s their favorite,” Pillsbury added. Pillsbury said even some of Biden’s own campaign advisers on China who are China hawks — those who believe in a hardline against China — say they cannot get through to Biden. “I know a lot of Joe Biden’s advisers — they publish articles. There’s at least four of them that are very anti-China. They’re hawks on China. They hint to me and others they can’t get through to Joe Biden. His personal views on China are so strong that they can’t get him to do the right thing,” he said. “We’re stuck with what are Biden’s personal views on China, including the role of his family … There’s a strange phenomenon where Biden seems to be personally committed to helping China and the United Nations,” he said. Pillsbury and McFarland also addressed Biden’s son Hunter Biden flying aboard Air Force Two with the vice president on a trip to Beijing in December 2013 and ten days later securing a deal with Chinese investors in a fund that he was involved in. “President Trump has pointed out, correctly I think, that almost nobody can — in a Western company environment — can go into China and raise a million dollars. It’s just impossible. You can’t even repatriate your profits for American companies in China,” Pillsbury said. “All this is part of the China trade talks and why the tariffs were put on. In the case of Joe Biden’s son Hunter, he kind of goes into China, I think for the first time, on Air Force Two with his father, stays about ten days, and miraculously, President Trump says, walks out with a billion dollars committed to kind of a mutual fund he set up,” he said. “At the minimum, it looks very bad. And as President Trump says, it’s a miracle to stroll into China and come out with a billion dollars. Nobody else can do that, not even Goldman Sachs,” Pillsbury added. Pillsbury said another problem with Biden is that he has a “deep commitment to the United Nations and the whole U.N. system” that would prevent him from ever taking a step like Trump when he suspended U.S. taxpayer funds for the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) for being slow to warn the world of the severity of the coronavirus pandemic. Pillsbury said that when Biden “hears something like the World Health Organization says this, he has kind of a blind obedience.” He added: This is the so-called liberal world order that he stood for for the last 50 years. So obviously what President Trump did to stand up to the W.H.O. and say, “This is false” then began to hold up money for their annual budget, then to mock them and say China pays $40 million dollars, we pay $400 million dollars — all this is something Joe Biden could not do. It would be against the very principle he stands for, that the United Nations is above the United States in terms of sovereignty. He simply would not challenge the World Health Organization. “He’s part of what is called the ‘globalist elite’ or the ‘Washington establishment.’ It’s the very group that Donald Trump ran against — the ‘so-called swamp,'” Pillsbury added. “President Trump deserves credit for standing up to China while maintaining channels of communication with the Chinese,” he said. Pillsbury said Trump has kept tariffs on China, despite the belief that he canceled tariffs in order to get a trade deal with China. “He kept the tariffs — 25 percent for almost $400 billion dollars of Chinese exports to us. So he’s making money from the Chinese while our farmers are compensated. And frankly, recently, the Chinese have begun to open up to American beef, and pork and poultry, which they haven’t done before. Obama just couldn’t get it done. So Trump is fighting back,” he said. “A Biden victory would really mean the end. Biden himself has said he does not support these tariffs; he’s kind of a free trader, a globalist and that’s the danger right there … of a Biden presidency,” he said. McFarland said a vote for Biden would be a vote for a 21st Century run by China. “Their intention is to replace the United States as the leading economic power, military power, diplomatic power, economic power, technology superstar power, and they have every intention of doing it,” she said, “Joe Biden is asleep at the wheel, and in the next four years, the Chinese plan to achieve that objective. And so if you elect Joe Biden, what are you doing? You’re basically electing a 21st Century that’s going to be run by the Chinese,” she said.

Agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) seized Sen. Richard Burr’s (R-NC) cellphone on Wednesday as part of an ongoing investigation into the lawmaker’s decision to unload upwards of $1.72 million in stock ahead of the Coronavirus outbreak. Burr, who serves as chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, was reportedly served a warrant for his cellphone at his Washington, D.C., residence on Wednesday, according to the Los Angeles Times. Law enforcement officials purportedly seized the phone in order to examine any communication the senator may have had with his stockbroker over the past few months. “Such a warrant being served on a sitting U.S. senator would require approval from the highest ranks of the Justice Department and is a step that would not be taken lightly,” the Times noted. The seizure is the first significant development since the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission announced last month they were investigating the Republican lawmaker for possible insider trading. Burr drew the attention of lawmakers after it was revealed he sold off thousands of dollars worth of stock on February 13—less than a week before the stock market sharply dropped because of the coronavirus pandemic. Most of the shares were in companies  like Wyndham Hotels and Resorts and Hilton that took an especially hard hit as coronavirus travel restrictions went into place. Burr’s timely decision to sell netted him between $628,000 and $1.72 million. More troubling is that Burr’s decision to sell came as his committee was receiving daily briefings on the threat posed by the virus. As such, many speculate the senator may have acted on insider information to protect his assets. If true, Burr could be found in violation of the STOCK Act, which prohibits the use of non-public information for private profit by lawmakers. The FBI’s seizure of Burr’s phone comes only days after it was reported that his brother-in-law, a political appointee of President Donald Trump, dumped upwards of $280,000 in stock on the same day as the senator.

A popular Virginia restaurant is reopening after the coronavirus shutdown, and visitors who come to eat at the Inn at Little Washington will share the space with mid-century mannequin diners seated to implement social distancing. The Inn at Little Washington, which will start taking reservations on May 29, is complying with Gov. Ralph Northam’s reopening regulations to have only a 50 percent capacity at all restaurants.  While some restaurants will be eliminating tables to put distance between patrons, the Inn, which has three Michelin stars, is using artistic settings at each mannequin-occupied table to portray scenes from the 1940s, from one man on bended knee proposing to his sweetheart, to couples on dates and businessmen seeming to be making a deal. Town and Country Magazine reported on the creative comeback:  Chef and proprietor Patrick O’Connell, a James Beard award-winner, is conceptualizing these intricate scenes to comply with capacity regulations, implemented in light of the coronavirus pandemic. The Inn is working with two local businesses to stage the tables. For authenticity, Signature Theatre, a Tony-award winning non-profit professional theater company, will help create the scenes and Design Foundry, team of carpenters, painters, designers, fabricators, will facilitate construction. The mannequin-filled reopening also comes alongside a new menu. O’Connell is still working out the details, but we know it will feature the restaurant’s signature whimsy. Even before the mannequins, the Inn was known for its irreverent take on dining, from its cheese specialist with a mooing cow cart, speaking exclusively in puns, to the dining room dress code: no wet bikinis. the latest episode of "are you living in a dystopia"  The Inn at Little Washington Thinks Mannequins Will Make Social Distancing Less Awkward https://t.co/PvrjtTeh50 via @Eater_DC — Christian Vasquez (@chrismvasq) May 13, 2020  “O’Connell says that Washington, Virginia—where the Inn is located—currently has no Covid-19 cases that he knows of,” the Washingtonian reported. “Despite the fact that many guests are coming from the DC area, he hopes to keep it that way. His staff is conducting deep cleanings involving infrared light. And he has created custom-made masks bearing Marilyn Monroe smiles and George Washington chins.” “I think it would do people a world of good to reduce their anxiety level when they come out to a place which is still unaffected, because if you watch your television, you think that there isn’t such a place under a bubble,” O’Connell said in the Washingtonian report.

The head of the Venezuelan National Assembly’s indigenous people’s committee asserted on Tuesday that the socialist regime of dictator Nicolás Maduro had left indigenous Venezuelans in “total abandon,” with no resources to fight the Chinese coronavirus. Gladys Guaipo, the president of the Permanent Commission of Indigenous Peoples at the federal lawmaking body, also accused the Maduro regime of not counting indigenous people afflicted with the Chinese coronavirus in the official statistics of those infected and killed by the pandemic. Venezuela claims hundreds of cases of Chinese coronavirus in the country but only ten deaths at press time, a significantly lower number of cases than those documented in neighboring countries like Colombia and Brazil. Given the dilapidated state of the Venezuelan universal health care system – where pharmacies have suffered chronic shortages of over 90 percent of medications considered vital for a functional medical system since 2016 – many experts believe the number of coronavirus cases in the nation is much higher than the Maduro regime claims it to be. The National Assembly is the last Venezuelan institution made up of legitimately elected officials. Maduro himself is no longer legally president, having completed his last term in January 2019. As he controls the armed forces, however, he has successfully managed to keep President Juan Guaidó from exercising any authority in the nation. “The grave situation caused by the COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] pandemic is affecting our indigenous peoples,” Guaipo said in a statement on Tuesday. “This is in addition to the absence of medical assistance to these populations [that are] in total abandon, which presumes a systematic violation of human rights.” “The coronavirus is causing deaths among our Venezuelan Warao brothers and they are not including in national statistics,” Guaipo denounced. The Warao people are native to northeast Venezuela. Guaipo said that the group had confirmed 40 cases of Chinese coronavirus among their population exiled in Brazil. Near the Brazilian Amazonian city of Manaus, Guaipo also said that Venezuelans on the border were seeing an increase in suspected cases, but that they “do not have the tools necessary to detect asymptomatic cases … among the indigenous and take social distancing measures according to W.H.O. [World Health Organization] protocol.” Liborio Guarulla, the anti-socialist, indigenous former governor of Venezuela’s Amazonas state, made a similar declaration on Twitter. Amazonas is the nation’s southernmost state, far from the home of the Warao. Guarulla identifies as part of the Baniwa ethnic group. “With [coronavirus] and without a hospital. The official news of four cases of coronavirus in San Carlos de Río Negro [Amazonas] could announce a tragedy,” Guarulla wrote on Twitter on Monday. “This is a population without a hospital … they are majority elderly.” Guarulla also noted that extracting the ill to a less remote location could be “dangerous,” though he did not elaborate. CON COVID-19 Y SIN HOSPITAL. La noticia oficial de 4 casos de coronavirus en San Carlos de Río Negro puede anunciar una tragedia: 1. Es una población sin hospital ni dotación.2. Su población es mayormente de ancianos 3. Trasladar los enfermos para Pto Ayacucho es peligroso. pic.twitter.com/hJ4PP4uGF5 — Liborio Guarulla (@LiborioGuarulla) May 11, 2020  Venezuela’s indigenous communities have for years faced an onslaught of socialist violence, largely at the hands of gangs seeking to exploit natural oil and mineral resource in the country. Maduro has expanded the scope of illicit mining in regions like Amazonas, plundering gold resources and leaving behind an environmental catastrophe. “The Maduro regime has used state enterprises and security forces to legitimize otherwise criminal mineral extraction, collaborating with criminal groups to mine, process, and transport minerals,” the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) explained in a report last month. “Though Southern Venezuela is home to 34 indigenous communities who have long been involved in environmental preservation, they were not consulted before the Maduro regime implemented public policies to promote mining in the region.” Last week, indigenous activists denounced the murder of two members of the Yekuana ethnic community, identified as Cristian Flores and Franke Sarmiento, and a third unidentified person at the hands of armed groups operating illicitly in indigenous territory. Observers online noted the release of videos showing members of the National Liberation Army (ELN), a Colombian Marxist terrorist organization, in Venezuelan indigenous territory. 3. Los propios Yekuana nos hicieron llegar esta foto del ELN operando en las zona, para garantizar la “seguridad” de las balsas que operan en el Río Caura. Y hoy provocan la #MasacreEnElCaura pic.twitter.com/S5MNquBJ27 — Americo De Grazia (@AmericoDeGrazia) May 7, 2020  The Organization of American States (OAS) issued remarks in April urging the Maduro regime to stop allowing human rights abuses against indigenous Venezuelans. “We demand that the Venezuelan regime cease the violation of the human rights of its indigenous peoples, who protest for not having access to clean water, food, and the medical assistance necessary to confront the [Chinese coronavirus] crisis,” OAS chief Luis Almagro said in a statement on Twitter. At the time, Almagro was responding to the violent repression of a protest by members of the Wayuú indigenous community demanding access to food and water. The Maduro regime claims to be an ally to indigenous Venezuelans. The regime has distributed propaganda claiming to be deeply involved in coronavirus response in Amazonas state, contrary to what those present in the state assert is happening. The regime’s official public defender, Alfredo Ruíz, claimed on Tuesday that Maduro had recently dispatched officials from Ruíz’s office to fight coronavirus in Amazonas state; it is unclear what the office of the public defender, a legal agency, could do to help with a medical crisis. Ruíz’s remarks were featured in the Spanish edition of Xinhua, the Chinese Communist Party news agency. The Maduro regime claims at press time 423 confirmed Chinese coronavirus cases and ten deaths.

In a 4-3 decision, the Wisconsin Supreme Court struck down the Gov. Tony Evers’ administration’s stay-at-home order. The ruling “essentially reopens the state, lifting caps on the size of gatherings, allowing people to travel as they please and allowing shuttered businesses to reopen, including bars and restaurants,” the Associated Press reported. Health secretary Andrea Palm had issued the order, and the court found she didn’t have the authority to do so. “Rule-making exists precisely to ensure that kind of controlling, subjective judgement asserted by one unelected official, Palm, is not imposed in Wisconsin,” Chief Justice Patience Roggensack wrote in the majority opinion. Former Gov. Scott Walker praised the court’s decision in a statement to Breitbart News. “The Wisconsin Supreme Court upheld the law,” he said. “The rule of law must be upheld – even in emergencies. I am honored to have appointed two of the Justices in the majority on the 4 – 3 decision.” The decision allows schools to remain closed, and local governments can create their own restrictions. Dane County, home of liberal Madison, was quick to do just that. Public Health Officer Janel Heinrich took Evers’ orders limiting gatherings and enacted them at the local level. Evers, meanwhile, “reacted angrily” to the ruling, according to the AP. “Today, Republican legislators convinced four members of the state Supreme Court to throw the state into chaos,” Evers said. “They have provided no plan. There’s no question among anybody that people are going to get sick. Republicans own that chaos.” He added, “In the meantime, we’re going to have 72 counties doing their own thing.” “I can’t believe there’s a state in the nation with this type of chaos.” Walker called for the state to reopen nearly three weeks ago during an interview with Breitbart News. “I get the fear that people hav, but there’s also a lot of frustration. People don’t know what to believe, what the facts are. It keeps changing all the time,” he said in late April. Walker said he believes it’s time to reopen the state and he has encouraged businesses to come up with a plan to “safely” reopen. “Not as a requirement of government, but I think to get employees back” is going to be a challenge, he said. “I think this is one of those where the private sector, in many cases, knows better,” Walker said, adding if workers and customers don’t feel safe, “it doesn’t matter what date you say you’re going to reopen, it’s not going to happen.” “Let’s stop suspending common sense,” he said.

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti (D) announced Wednesday evening that residents must wear masks when leaving their homes as part of the city’s ongoing effort to combat the deadly Chinese coronavirus pandemic. “And as long as you’re not doing a solitary activity or with your own household, put that mask on,” Garcetti said. “Always now.” The new requirement “will help us get more freedoms, open up more parts of our city,” added the mayor. Small children and some disabled individuals are exempt from the order. We’re requiring all Angelenos to wear face coverings when they leave the house. There are exceptions in place for small children or those with disabilities. pic.twitter.com/j7ecKiYQ4e — MayorOfLA (@MayorOfLA) May 14, 2020  People inside businesses and on public transportation are already required to wear masks. Garcetti’s announcement comes as Los Angeles County’s stay-home order is likely to be extended by three months, Public Health Director Dr. Barbara Ferrer said Tuesday. Speaking to ABC Good Morning America, Garcetti said Los Angeles won’t fully reopen until there is a “cure” for the coronavirus, which has infected 33,180 people in the city and killed 1,613, according to data tracked by Johns Hopkins University. “We’ve never been fully closed, we’ll never be completely open until we have a cure. But I do believe that we can take steps, but monitor those numbers, listen to the scientists and the medical professionals, and make the tough calls even when there’s criticism,” he told host George Stephanopoulos. Earlier Wednesday, several Los Angeles area beaches reopened with restrictions such as social distancing of six feet and masks. Beachgoers are prohibited from social gatherings and suntanning.

A study shows that the number of children getting routine vaccines to protect them from dangerous diseases has dramatically declined in the wake of the coronavirus. Authors from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other health institutions used vaccine ordering data through the Vaccines for Children Program, which provides government-purchased vaccines to about 50 percent of children in United States. The CDC’s Vaccine Tracking System and Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) vaccine administration data also was incorporated. The study compared orders for the period from Jan. 7 through April 21 this year to the same period last year. “On March 24, CDC posted guidance emphasizing the importance of routine well child care and immunization, particularly for children aged [less than] 24 months, when many childhood vaccines are recommended,” the CDC report states. The website reported on the study: The findings suggest childhood vaccination efforts nearly ground to a halt between March 13 — when the national emergency was declared — and April 19. There was a 2.5 million-dose decline in orders of regular childhood vaccines — not counting influenza vaccines — and a 250,000-dose decline in vaccines containing measles protection in that period, the authors reported. Doctors and public health experts have worried that a vast number of regular health care needs — including preventive care interventions like vaccinations — have gone unmet in the past few months as people shy away from interacting with a health system that has, at least in some places, been overwhelmed by caring for Covid-19 patients. Pediatricians in particular have been concerned that children may be missing critical vaccinations, which the new data confirm has happened. “Routine immunizations in young children are critical to maintain during the pandemic,” Kathryn Edwards, a pediatrician and scientific director of the Vanderbilt Vaccine Research Program in Nashville, Tennessee, said in the Stat report. “The usual childhood diseases are still around and we need to protect our children from them.” “I think that didn’t happen,” Paul Offit, a pediatrician and vaccines expert at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said in the Stat report. “I think there were a number of practices that didn’t do that because they were too scared. And so this is the result. You have this dramatic decline.” Neither Edwards nor Offit was involved in this study, the Stat report said. “The identified declines in routine pediatric vaccine ordering and doses administered might indicate that U.S. children and their communities face increased risks for outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases,” the study authors wrote.

Republican congressmen complained on Wednesday that the first deed by the recently established Democrat-led House Select Coronavirus Subcommittee was to “beat up” on blue-collar workers rather than China’s contribution to the spread of the lethal virus across the world. Communist China is the birthplace of the illness associated with the new coronavirus (COVID-19) that is plaguing the world. During the first hearing by the House coronavirus panel, the top Republican on the subcommittee and Minority House Whip, Steve Scalise from Louisiana, declared: The very first action, though, of this subcommittee was not to help people get back to work. In fact, the very first action of this subcommittee was to attack hard-working, blue-collar Americans. … Attacking blue-collar workers is not what we should be doing. We should be helping workers in America get back to work. We really should be holding China accountable for what they did, and unfortunately, that is not happening. That’s not what’s going on with this committee, and that’s a real concern, Mr. Chairman. None of the Democrats on the House Oversight and Reform Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus refuted the Republican assertions. Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-SC), the chairman of the subcommittee, defended his decision not to focus on China. Republicans also lambasted the leaders of the “bipartisan” panel for not letting them call any witnesses to testify on Wednesday. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), the ranking member of the full House Oversight and Reform Committee, blasted the panel as a partisan “political” ploy “designed to go after the president.” Congressman Scalise acknowledged that all seven Democrats on the subcommittee sent a letter “harassing” companies that employ blue-collar workers across the country. The Democrats demanded that they return the money they received from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), a cornerstone of the $2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. On May 8, Democrats on the panel gloated about sending the same letter to several companies, arguing that they were “large, public corporations” that must “immediately return taxpayer funds that Congress intended for small businesses struggling to survive during the coronavirus crisis.” Jordan said Reps. Conor Lamb (D-PA) and Tim Ryan (D-OH) pushed back on their Democrat colleagues sending one of the letters to a company that employs people in their states — Universal Stainless & Alloy Products, Inc. The Ohio Republican was outraged that the first act of the subcommittee was to “beat up” on blue-collar workers, rather than China. Scalise noted that the companies that received the letters “did everything that they were told to do.” “They were told to keep the workers on the payroll and that PPP was there to help those very companies. And in fact, every member of the committee that signed the letter harassing those companies voted for the [CARES] bill,” he said. The letters targeted some companies that employ steelworkers, truck drivers, and welders. “These are the very people we were trying to help, and in fact, they’re right now living in fear because … if [their employers] had to return the money today after they followed all the rules that we all voted for, they would have to lay off hundreds of workers each,” Scalise said. Rep. Mark Green (R-TN) also criticized the House panel’s first move. “Instead of attacking American businesses by further taking the PPP loans, we should be looking at China,” Green declared. “Their role in this. From day one, China’s lies and deceptions have severely hampered the global response.” There are already eight mechanisms within Congress to conduct oversight of the bills passed to combat the coronavirus and the crisis caused by the disease, Jordan and Green noted. Trump administration officials have accused Communist China of mismanaging its response and hiding the extent of the outbreak within its borders during the early stages of the pandemic, with the help of the Beijing-influenced World Health Organization (WHO).

The Michigan Attorney General attacked 77-year-old Owosso barber Karl Manke on Wednesday, saying he is “not a patriot” for ignoring Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s shutdown order. Attorney General Dana Nessel said she has “no plans” to arrest Manke after she stripped him of his operating license on Tuesday. WATCH:  AG @dananessel says she doesn't plan on arresting Owosso Barber Karl Manke, but she does have a message for him and his supporters.  "He's not a hero. He's not a patriot."  MORE ⤵️ pic.twitter.com/nhbUcwnzWK — Mikenzie Frost (@MikenzieFrost) May 13, 2020  Earlier in the week, Nessel failed to obtain a temporary restraining order against the elderly barber. “We’re not looking to throw people in jail,” she said, adding it was “a last resort.” She never said she wouldn’t, though. “We want him to discontinue his conduct, which we think is aiding and abetting the spread of the virus,” Nessel claimed. “Mr. Manke,” she sighed, “He’s not a hero, he’s not a patriot. A patriot is a person that fights all enemies, foreign and domestic, and does everything possible to protect his fellow countrymen and countrywomen.” “To me, Mr. Manke is doing just the opposite of that and he’s being selfish in his behavior,” the AG declared. Nessel blamed Manke for “allowing the virus to spread,” despite providing no evidence to back up the claim. Because hair cutting, salons, and spas require close contact, “they’re not one of the first industries we’re looking at to reengage in,” Nessel said. “So I’m very concerned about his customers, and I’m concerned about him,” she claimed. She wondered how much Manke and his clients have spread the virus around the state. “I hope we don’t see an uptick in Owosso and his community just based on his behavior at his one particular business,” Nessel said.

Michigan state police are “monitoring all of the conversations” of protesters planning to descend on the capitol Thursday, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer told reporters. Whitmer was first asked about what “proof” she has that protesters had spread the virus around the state after previous demonstrations. “I saw one report— I don’t have proof. I’m not following everybody home and taking their temperatures and watching them for two weeks,” she said. Whitmer claimed to see a lot of activists “touching each other” at protests. She said a group analyzed cell phone data and concluded that it “translates to where we’re seeing hot spots in rural parts of Michigan.” “I don’t know the group, I’ve not vetted the data, I can’t vouch for it,” she admitted. Whitmer was then asked if she “wants to see” the Michigan State Police ticket protesters who are violating social distancing orders. “I think the Michigan State Police is monitoring all of the conversations around this event tomorrow – that they are prepared and are working with the attorney general,” she said. She said they are prepared to ticket protesters “if there’s reason to do it.” “I’m hopeful they don’t have reason to,” Whitmer said. Kyle Olson is a reporter for Breitbart News.

More than 100 inmates freed from New York’s Rikers Island prison complex over fears of the Chinese coronavirus spreading have since been rearrested for crimes, new details reveal. New York City Police Department (NYPD) sources told the New York Post that many inmates freed from Rikers Island following release orders by Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) have ended up right back in police custody. The city’s spike in burglaries, police said, is a direct result of the mass release of nearly 1,700 inmates from prisons and jails, the Post reported: The roughly 110 inmates have accounted for 190 arrests since the pandemic took hold of the Big Apple, according to police. [Emphasis added] Of those arrests, 45 — or roughly one-quarter — were for burglaries, helping drive the 43-percent spike in break-ins over the last month, according to NYPD data. [Emphasis added] Police sources believe the number of recidivists — which accounted for about 7 percent of the 1,500 released in March — doesn’t paint the whole picture, because hundreds more inmates have been released since. [Emphasis added] One particular case noted by the Post‘s Craig McCarthy is that of Jerard Iamunno who was released on March 25 after pleading guilty to drug crimes and grand larceny. About a month after his release, Iamunno was arrested for robbing a 59-year-old man in Harlem at knifepoint. In total, Iamunno is a twice-convicted felon and has 11 convictions for misdemeanors. Another suspect, which the Post reports is responsible for about 18 burglaries in Manhattan South during the city’s coronavirus lockdown, is Terrance Brown. With 20 arrests under his belt, Brown was arrested for the recent break-ins but was immediately released thanks to Cuomo’s bail reform laws. At the beginning of the year, Cuomo implemented bail reform laws that eliminated bail for suspects accused of second-degree manslaughter, aggravated vehicular assault, third-degree assault, promoting an obscene sexual performance by a child, criminally negligent homicide, aggravated vehicular homicide, and about 100 other crimes. In March, NYPD officials said that in the first 58 days of the year, close to 500 suspects who would have been kept locked up in jail if not for the new bail reform laws had been rearrested for committing an additional 846 crimes. Nearly 300 of these crimes included murder, rape, robbery, felony assault, burglary, grand larceny, and grand larceny auto. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

At around the time New York’s state health department under Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued a directive prohibiting nursing homes from testing recovering coronavirus patients prior to admission, Florida under Gov. Ron DeSantis issued its own executive order strictly regulating incoming patients to protect those facilities from the epidemic. About a month and a half later, the differences are staggering. The latest tallies show that in Florida 745 residents and staff at long-term care facilities across the state have died from coronavirus although the numbers continue to rise in the state and nationwide. This compared to New York’s 5,300 dead in nursing homes. Florida has one of the nation’s largest elderly populations and is more populous than New York. The Sunshine State hosts over 4,400 nursing homes and assisted living facilities containing over 151,000 residents. Cuomo is facing increasing criticism as the state’s elderly care facilities have been devastated by coronavirus. And he’s been forced in recent days to reverse a controversial March 25 directive requiring nursing homes to take recovering coronavirus patients. The March 25 executive order in question stated “[nursing homes] are prohibited from requiring a hospitalized resident who is determined medically stable to be tested for COVID-19 prior to admission or readmission.” Last week, New York disclosed more than 1,700 previously unreported deaths at nursing homes and adult care facilities. An Associate Press tally put the number of nursing home virus deaths at over 5,300.  Elderly care fatalities in New York have reportedly been on the rise by an average of 20 to 25 deaths per day for several weeks. The massive number of dead prompted Cuomo this week to issue a series of new regulations, including requiring staff at all nursing homes to take two virus tests per week. “We’re just not going to send a person who is positive to a nursing home after hospital visit. Period. If there’s any issue, the resident must be referred to the department of health which will find alternative care,” Cuomo further explained on Sunday. New York Republican Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, a Congressional candidate, is demanding an independent federal inquiry into the March 25 executive order, saying she doesn’t have faith in Cuomo’s own inquiry with NY Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat. Malliotakis stated on Fox News: On March 24th, Gov. Cuomo said, ‘My mother is not expendable, your mother is not expendable’ and yet the very next day he signed an executive order mandating nursing homes – where our most vulnerable mothers and our most vulnerable fathers reside – to accept COVID positive patients. There are 5,000 residents of nursing homes or patients that have been put into nursing homes that have died, which account for 25 percent of the deaths in the state of New York and 30 percent of the deaths in the community that I represent. A full ten days before the scandalous New York order or nursing homes, Florida’s Division of Emergency Management on March 15 issued its own executive order tightly regulating entry into nursing homes, including strict rules of admission for staff and incoming patients. The Florida agency’s coordinator, who was designated by DeSantis as the state’s coordinating officer for the pandemic, issued a March 15 mandate that prohibited entry into nursing homes except for a narrow list. The executive order entirely banned entry to those on the narrow list, including staff and facility residents, if they meet any of the following criteria: On March 18, Florida also imposed a universal rule mandating face masks in nursing homes. And it later established Coronavirus-dedicated nursing homes. Emmett Reed, executive director of the Florida Health Care Association, applauded DeSantis for “always seeming to be a step ahead,” including with the early directives on restricting access to nursing homes. Florida acted early to protect seniors in long-term care facilities by prohibiting hospitals from sending COVID-positive residents back to those facilities.  Thank you to Emmett Reed from the @FHCA for pointing out that this saved lives. pic.twitter.com/UckLCe91th — Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) May 13, 2020  Like states nationwide, Florida’s nursing homes have seen a higher percentage of mortality rates from a virus that preys on the elderly and those with preexisting conditions. As deaths at nursing homes rise in Florida and nationwide, DeSantis is acting alongside White House calls for residents and staff at elderly care facilities to be regularly tested. The Florida Agency for Health Care Administration has issued two emergency rules mandating all nursing homes to grant access to the Florida Department of Health for infection prevention and control. Actions include mandating virus testing for all facility employees. Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

The number of Americans avoiding small gatherings is dropping as millions of citizens urge federal, state, and local officials to reopen the economy, a Gallup poll released this week revealed. While Gallup’s survey showed that the majority of Americans are continuing to avoid committing social distancing faux pas, such as attending small gatherings, the percentage has declined over the past month. Almost three-fourths of Americans, 74 percent, indicated that they have avoided small gatherings in the last week, but that reflects a ten-point drop from the results taken in late March, where 84 percent indicated that they had avoided such gatherings. “The decline in the percentage avoiding small gatherings has been accompanied by a similar increase in the percentage saying they haven’t considered doing so, from 9% to 17%,” Gallup found. The survey also showed that Republicans are less likely than Democrats to avoid small gatherings: Compared with their peaks in late-March, the 74% of independents and 60% of Republicans avoiding small gatherings are both down by double digits. The drop is particularly steep among Republicans whose 16- percentage-point decline in avoiding small gatherings nearly brings them back to the level they reported in Gallup’s first measure, in mid-March. Democrats have always been the most likely to avoid small gatherings while Republicans have been the least likely, but the 26-point gap between them is the widest yet. Independents have consistently fallen somewhere in between. Additionally, one in six Americans have indicated that they have visited someone else’s home in the past 24 hours. “Sixteen percent of U.S. adults last week said they had visited someone else’s home or apartment, an uptick from the 11% to 13% figures Gallup has recorded since March,” the survey found. The results come as Americans urge their leaders to reopen the economy. While some states have taken more aggressive measures than others, some officials, like Pennsylvania’s Gov. Tom Wolf (D), have faced immense backlash for threatening localities and business owners that are moving to reopen in violation of his orders.

Churches across the country are filing lawsuits against Democrat governors who are not including them among the “essential” services that may immediately “reopen” as states move away from their coronavirus lockdown environments. Oregon, California, Virginia, and Maine churches and faith leaders have filed lawsuits claiming the governors do not have authority to extend, indefinitely, stay-at-home orders against them. Failure to consider the churches as essential as liquor and box stores, they assert, amounts to discrimination and a violation of their First Amendment rights. In Oregon, three Republican lawmakers have joined a lawsuit filed by ten churches and more than a dozen faith leaders on May 6 against Gov. Kate Brown (D), demanding they be permitted to reopen their houses of worship. Willamette Week reported Monday State Sen. Dennis Linthicum and State Reps. Bill Post and Mike Nearman signed on as petitioners. “We are very concerned that churches and other places of worship are not being treated in the same manner as, say, Lowe’s, Home Depot, Target, Walmart and other large corporate stores,” Post said. “I was in my Keizer Lowe’s this past Saturday, and there were well over 1,000 people in the store at one time.” The lawsuit notes, according to the Baker City Herald, that because Brown has not convened the state legislature since declaring a state of emergency on March 8, further emergency orders are unconstitutional. “Because governor failed to avail herself of the constitutionally prescribed procedure, her initial executive order declaring the public health emergency, issued on March 8, 2020, terminated by operation of law on April 7, 2020, and all subsequent executive orders implementing or extending the original order are legally null and void,” the lawsuit states. “She’s giving herself powers to infringe on constitutional liberties in perpetuity,” said Ray D. Hacke of the Pacific Justice Institute in Salem, which represents the churches and the individuals. “And she can’t do that.” A Christian congregation in Chula Vista, California, and its pastor have also filed a federal lawsuit against Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) and other officials, claiming the coronavirus stay-at-home orders are unconstitutional. The Thomas More Society filed the civil rights lawsuit Monday in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, asserting: California is one of only eight states whose response to the COVID-19 pandemic has included no accommodation for—hardly even a mention of—the religious rights of its citizens. Now, with the pandemic stabilizing, California has moved from “Stage 1” to “Stage 2.” In the first part of Stage 2, beginning on Friday, May 8, retail and manufacturing may begin reopening—but not places of worship. “The Governor continues to shutter synagogues and churches with no end in sight,” said Charles LiMandri, special counsel for the Thomas More Society and partner at LiMandri & Jonna LLP. “After weeks of government suppression of their religious freedoms, our clients have said enough is enough,” he added. “The First Amendment still protects their right to freely exercise their faith, even during a pandemic.” Lighthouse Fellowship Church on Chincoteague Island in Virginia has also filed a reply legal memorandum in the federal lawsuit against Gov. Ralph Northam (D) for violating the religious freedom of churchgoers on Palm Sunday. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia had previously denied the church’s motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction without a hearing. Liberty Counsel represents the church, which especially provides outreach to drug addicts, the mentally ill, and the poor. Police officers entered the church on Palm Sunday and issued a summons to the pastor, informing him all members of the congregation would receive a summons if the church held service on Easter Sunday. The case also drew a statement of interest from the U.S. Department of Justice. “We must balance the First Amendment with protecting the health and welfare of people, but picking an arbitrary number of 10 people for every church is not the answer,” said Mat Staver, Liberty Counsel chairman. “Governor Ralph Northam has clearly discriminated against Lighthouse Fellowship Church which does not have internet and cannot flip a switch to broadcast online,” he added. “Pastor Wilson protected the health and safety of the 16 people. Yet because the church had six more people than the 10 allowed by the governor, the pastor is being criminally charged. This unequal treatment of churches is insane.” Liberty Counsel also represents Calvary Chapel of Bangor, Maine, which filed an appeal to the U.S. District Court after it denied a temporary restraining order against Gov. Janet Mills (D) for banning in-person and stay-in-your-car church services. Mills has allowed liquor stores, marijuana dispensaries, and big box stores to be considered as “essential” entities that may accommodate gatherings of people without threat of arrest. Liberty Counsel noted in a press statement: The Maine State Police, acting under the direction of Governor Mills’ orders, have publicly declared that they would enforce the orders and have threatened to impose criminal sanctions on those found in violation of them, including any gathering for worship, regardless of whether the church meets or exceeds the state social distancing and hygiene guidelines. The criminal penalty is up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine for violating her executive orders. “The state has no authority to dictate the form or manner of worship for every church or house of worship,” Staver said. “This discrimination reeks of government control and violates the First Amendment.”

The use of face masks is “absolutely fundamental” to controlling the spread of the coronavirus, according to Dr. William Schaffner, M.D., a professor of medicine at the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University and the medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. “The face mask is absolutely fundamental to controlling this infection,” Schaffner told SiriusXM host Rebecca Mansour on Tuesday’s edition of Breitbart News Tonight. LISTEN:  Schaffner explained that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) changed its original guidance against face masks after learning that the coronavirus is easily transmitted by asymptomatic spreaders. “Why did they change their recommendations about wearing masks? They changed it because they discovered that there could be many people who are infected with this virus who don’t get sick, but can nonetheless transmit the virus. They can be stealth spreaders,” Schaffner said. “If we’re trying to interrupt the spread of this virus, there are only a couple of things we can do,” he explained. “Number one, put a mask on everybody, because here I am, feeling perfectly well speaking with you, but I could be infected. So, if we were within three feet of each other having this conversation, the only way you can be protected then, even though I’m healthy, is for me to wear a mask. Of course, I don’t know if you’re infected either. So you better wear a mask so I’m protected. So that’s the reason everybody should be wearing a mask.” “The next thing is the six-foot rule, as it were, the eleventh commandment, thou shalt not get closer than six feet with anybody,” Schaffner quipped. “The reason for that is, most of the transmission of this virus occurs within that six feet.” When it comes to reopening the country, “the trick is to do this carefully and slowly,” said Schaffner. “What do I mean, ‘carefully’? Let’s open up, but all wear masks. Let’s open up and keep distance from each other. Let’s not go out to crowded events at the present time. We can’t go back to the way it was. Time marches on. We’re going to a new normal.” A 2012 epidemiological study provided evidence that wearing face masks significantly reduce the transmission of influenza-like illnesses, Schaffner noted. “There’s actually one study like that done by Dr. Arnold Monto at the University of Michigan School of Public Health among students, and obviously he couldn’t enforce the wearing of the face mask day in and day out, but he did have one group of students wear face masks generally during the flu season and another group not. And influenza-like illness was substantially less in the face mask group than in the non-face mask group,” Schaffner said. Schaffner noted that the subjects of the study used “a simple surgical face mask, not the cumbersome tight N95 respirators.” All manner of face masks are effective in reducing the transmission of influenza-like illnesses, he explained. “Masks, no matter what they are — bandanas, homemade masks, even the rather fragile-looking surgical masks — are really rather effective in preventing any infection you may have from going to someone else,” he said. Schaffner again reminded listeners that the main reason for wearing a mask is to prevent the spread of the virus by asymptomatic carriers. “I wear a mask to protect you. You wear a mask to protect me,” he said. Mansour inquired about the issue of “excess deaths” and how COVID-19 is determined to be a cause of death among persons with comorbidities. “The ‘excess death’ concept was established with the influenza,” explained Schaffner. “We know approximately by season how many people die of which illnesses, and then during influenza season you get a big spike in deaths that go up due to pneumonia and influenza, and then the curve comes down again as influenza goes away, but there’s no dip below the curve. You see, if influenza had killed people in advance — they were so chronically ill — of when they normally would have died, then after the epidemic there would have been people who had been carried away earlier, so the death rate would have gone down.” Schaffner continued, “This is a little complicated. So those deaths are called ‘excess deaths,’ and like with COVID, there’s been an increase in unexpected deaths if you look at them statistically, and they’re called the excess. Those are the excess unexpected deaths likely caused by COVID or certainly influenced by COVID.” Schaffner added, “There are a lot of people in the country who have chronic underlying illnesses of the liver, or the kidney, [or] had diabetes. Along comes COVID, and it pushes them over the edge as they’re in the hospital. The doctors can see that their liver function, their kidney function, [or] their diabetes went way out of whack because of the COVID infection. The doctor might just write down ‘death due to liver disease’ because the patient was already predisposed to die, because he had such impaired organ function already.” “If you look at it from a public health perspective, it’s clear that many people with these illnesses in other seasons of the year would have continued to survive,” Schaffner explained. “Then either you put in influenza — or now you put in COVID — and all of a sudden a lot of these people are dying of these illnesses, clearly pushed over the edge, so to speak, by COVID or by influenza. And so that’s why these deaths are called ‘excess.'” Schaffer went on, “These infectious agents come into our communities and — oh, terrible word — ‘harvest’ the people who are most fail who are already impaired, are chronically ill, and they are carried away by COVID or influenza. These are people that we always term as the most vulnerable. They’re the people we’re most concerned about when these infections come into our communities.” Mansour asked about the accuracy of death count estimates attributed to COVID-19. “The [death] numbers come from the diagnoses that the attending physicians make on death certificates,” Schaffner said. “And those death certificate diagnoses vary in specificity. If the doctor knew that the person had a positive COVID test, they likely would have written down ‘COVID,’ but not necessarily, because the end of life might have been due to pneumonia and the doctor might have just chosen to write down ‘pneumonia,’ or ‘sepsis,’ or some other diagnosis.” A person’s cause of death cannot always be precisely determined, explained Schaffner. He concurred with Dr. Anthony Fauci’s appraisal that the number of deaths attributable to COVID-19 is likely higher than John Hopkins University’s estimate of 80,000. “Death certificate diagnoses are not as precise as the public would be led to believe,” Schaffner noted, “and just as Dr. Fauci said, particularly early in the epidemic when there wasn’t a lot of testing, people died of pneumonia or influenza-like illnesses that couldn’t be diagnosed as COVID.” Schaffner concluded, “I agree with Dr. Fauci. I don’t know how many more deaths were caused by COVID, but surely more were, and I think every infectious disease doctor in the country would agree with that.” Breitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.

Residents of Wuhan, China, the city where the worldwide coronavirus pandemic began, are worried that the virus is back despite constant assurances from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) that it was all but eradicated.  After a month of claiming absolutely zero infections, the city’s epidemic control center on Monday abruptly ordered every one of its 11 million residents to get tested, even though the latest outbreak is supposedly centered on a single residential compound and involves only a handful of patients. Radio Free Asia (RFA) spoke to some Wuhanites on Tuesday who did not seem confident that the virus was only hitting one neighborhood in the immense city: Wuhan resident Shen Boyang said many in the city now fear a second wave of infections. “It may be spreading widely again,” Shen said. “Regarding the test program, I will only comply if it is at the government’s expense and not my own.” “People in Wuhan are all talking about a resurgence of the epidemic; I heard that five cases were also confirmed in Shandi district,” he said. A second Wuhan resident said two suspected cases had also been reported at Dongmin residential compound, where officials were disinfecting the entire area. Thousands of people have been flocking to hospitals in the city to line up for tests, but at their own expense, sources in the city said. A third Wuhan resident, Fang Peng, said the details of the new testing scheme have yet to emerge. “We were also looking at this document yesterday,” Fang said. “It doesn’t say how many people will be tested, nor who will pay for it.” Mr. Fang dismissed the official report of only one confirmed case from the Changqing residential area, plus a few “asymptomatic” coronavirus-positive individuals who are not included in the official tally of infections.  “You can’t believe what they say, because the actual numbers they report are subject to the internal processes of the Party,” he sighed. According to Chinese state media, every neighborhood in Wuhan was instructed to come up with a plan for testing all of its residents within ten days. “About three to five million residents have been tested and proved healthy, and thus Wuhan is capable to test the remaining 6 to 8 million in 10 days,” claimed a biologist from Wuhan University, while other local officials — and numerous worried civilians posting on Chinese social media — expressed doubts that testing every inhabitant of the area would be possible in such a short time frame. Wuhan officials claim the last confirmed coronavirus infection in the city was logged on April 3.

Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser, on Wednesday, extended her stay-at-home order aimed at stemming the spread of coronavirus by three weeks to June 8, citing contact tracing capacity issues, and the absence of a 14-day decrease in the community spread, among other reasons. The mayor told reporters on Wednesday, Today, we will extend the District’s stay-at-home order through Monday, June 8. I should note that based on the data, I can revise this order at any time to reflect a phased reopening, if the data suggests that we can do that. (THREAD) Today, I issued Mayor’s Order 2020-066 to extend the District’s public emergency and public health emergency and continue to require individuals to stay home through June 8, 2020. pic.twitter.com/gLXTDUHANR — Mayor Muriel Bowser #StayHomeDC (@MayorBowser) May 13, 2020  Based on the data, I can revise this order at any time to reflect a phased reopening. We will, until such time, extend to June 8, 2020. #StayHomeDC https://t.co/FDTtPUjRC7 pic.twitter.com/D9rZpDyPK2 — Mayor Muriel Bowser #StayHomeDC (@MayorBowser) May 13, 2020  The original measure was due to expire on Friday. Bowser also said she prolonged D.C.’s lockdown because the District has not yet seen a transmission rate under one for three days. Transmission rate refers to how many new infections come from each coronavirus case. Bowser’s decision to extend the lockdown in D.C. came as the number of daily new coronavirus cases has begun to drop along with community spread and the rate of transmission, the District’s own data show. Some projections have also predicted that although testing numbers will continue to improve in the next few weeks, the number of estimated infections (including unconfirmed mild and asymptomatic cases) will go down along with daily deaths and the use of hospital beds. “As of Wednesday, the District is in a four-day decrease in community spread. In addition, the rate of transmission has been below one for two days, according to Bowser,” the Patch noted. D.C.’s goal is for the transmission rate to be below one for three days. It is also aiming for a 14-day decrease in the community spread. Referring to contact tracing issues in the capital, the Patch added: The District’s goal is to be able to contact trace any new case within one day and their close contacts within two days. Currently, D.C. Health can contact trace for its priority populations — essential workers, at-risk healthcare personnel, etc. — and their close contacts, so it still needs to build out its testing capacity in order to handle the surge of new cases. “This is the piece that will help us ensure that we won’t have widespread community transmissions when we see those new infections,” Bowser proclaimed, referring to contact tracing. The mayor also acknowledged that the District is already able to test areas essential to a phased reopening, including symptomatic individuals, at-risk healthcare personnel, essential workers, and close contacts of new cases. Nevertheless, she added: We still, however, don’t think we’re testing all of the people who need to be tested in those four groups. We continue to reach out to people, making everybody aware of the testing locations and that those tests are free and that we’ll continue to do that. On Tuesday, Adm. Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), told a Senate panel that the Trump administration would be able to meet all U.S. testing needs for May and June. D.C. also has more than enough beds to treat the current number of coronavirus cases, the District’s data show. It also appears to have an adequate number of beds to deal with an expected surge of cases with a phased reopening. “We have been very confident about the number of beds at area hospitals that are part of our surge capacity,” Bowser declared. “Without a surge, the District needs to have its healthcare capacity at less than 80 percent over seven days. The District’s current healthcare occupancy is at 76 percent and it has been under 80 percent for 14 days,” the Patch noted. The cumulative number of cases and deaths in D.C. do continue to rise. D.C. marked its highest single-day number of coronavirus cases on May 1 (335 cases) and its second-highest on May 8 (245), but the figures have steadily dropped since. The District’s number of deaths per one million residents, at 476, is also higher than the national average of 252 per one million people, Worldometer reported. Furthermore, the number of cases per one million residents in D.C., at 9,189, is more than double the national average of 4,256 cases per one million people. The positive rate (over 20 percent) of the total number of tests that health officials have administered in D.C. is also higher than the national average of about 14 percent, according to the COVID Tracking Project. However, more people are testing negative (24,565) than positive (6,485) in the nation’s capital. To begin reopening, D.C. needs “fourteen days of consistent downward trend in coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and/or the percentage of tests that come back positive,” the local CBS-affiliated TV station WUSA9 reported. “It’s the same criteria included in the White House’s ‘Opening Up America Again’ plan,” it added. “It’s based in part on the coronavirus’ up-to-14-day incubation period.” Based on the criteria highlighted in the White House guidelines, the nation’s capital is not yet ready to reopen, particularly given the absence of a 14-day downward trend in cases. As of Wednesday, coronavirus had infected 6,584 people and killed 350, according to data from the capital’s health department.

In the days of social distancing where most teachers see their students through virtual learning, one teacher is going above and beyond to see each of his students outside their homes. Bill McAllister, a teacher at Big Shanty Elementary School in Kennesaw, Georgia, had not seen his students in person since March 16. “I knew my kids were at home missing school and everybody else, so I thought why don’t I just run through their neighborhoods and give them a smile, pick up their day a little bit,” McAllister told Fox 5 Atlanta. But his route to get to each student took meticulous planning. “I had to figure out where everybody lived and figure out the most advantageous route to get from one place to another,” said McAllister. His route takes him a total of 50 miles in all, and he goes at a pace of six to eight miles per day. Mia Strickland, one of his students, smiled when she received a visit from McAllister. “To me, it’s pretty awesome, just the other day I was thinking about him,” said Strickland. If nobody is home, McAllister tapes a special note to the family’s mailbox. “Sorry I missed you, hope you are doing well,” one of the notes reads. McAllister also uses his per-mile runs to donate to food-insecure households who are missing meals. “One of the things that was on my mind is that there are kids with parents not working and they’re food insecure, so I decided I was going to make a per-mile donation to MUST Ministries,” said McAllister. McAllister said as others learned about his good deeds, he encouraged them to donate to the charity as well.

NEW YORK (AP) — Rapper and activist Common went into quarantine concerned about incarcerated people he has met during visits to jails, prisons and juvenile detention centers around the U.S. and who aren’t able to maintain social distance or adopt rigorous hygiene routines to prevent the spread of COVID-19. “It’s a troubling time for them,” Common said, “because they are the people who usually are overlooked.” On Wednesday, his criminal justice reform organization Imagine Justice launched a campaign with dozens of advocacy and activist groups calling attention to the threat that the coronavirus pandemic poses on millions of men, women and youths who are incarcerated in the U.S. Watch below:   The campaign, dubbed #WeMatterToo, is urging authorities to immediately release people who have served the vast majority of their sentences, especially if they have underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk of severe illness or death from COVID-19. Although state and local correctional institutions have already released thousands of people from confinement due to the pandemic, supporters of the campaign also want governments to pay for testing and housing for inmates after they are released. Common said he also hopes to create greater public awareness about what happens inside the nation’s jails and prisons and the impact that has on society. “We all have unanswered questions about the pandemic,” the Grammy and Academy Award winning rapper said. “But being in prison adds new levels to that questioning, because of the way that people have been treated in prison.” Join me, @ImaginexJustice and 70+ organizations today as we launch #WeMatterToo to help our people who are incarcerated in our nation's jails, prisons and detention centers.

Take action today at https://t.co/giXS6pLkX1. https://t.co/Hc6oNAHyFB — MoveOn (@MoveOn) May 13, 2020  We're proud to stand with @Common and his team at @ImaginexJustice in their efforts to dramatically reduce jail populations and save lives during the #COVID19 crisis. Please watch and share this powerful, important film.#WeMatterToo #AnswerTheirCall @REFORM https://t.co/t4Vw90f3nd — Van Jones (@VanJones68) May 13, 2020  A two-minute video for the campaign features the voices of inmates who say jail officials are not providing protective equipment or requiring social distancing and have not regularly sanitized shower facilities. The video, shared with The Associated Press ahead of the campaign’s launch, does not identify the inmates or where they are imprisoned. COVID-19 outbreaks in jails and prisons around the country have caused alarm among advocates, who say inadequate mitigation protocol threatens both the lives of incarcerated people and correctional officers. Last month, the U.S. Bureau of Prisons released data that showed more than 70% of people in federal custody tested for COVID-19 were positive. Similarly dire outbreaks have been reported in a handful of state-run correctional systems. In Common’s hometown of Chicago, where the Cook County Jail is one of the nation’s largest jails, a federal judge last month ordered officials to ensure social distancing among the 4,000 people in custody. As of Tuesday, 161 inmates and 81 correctional officers were positive for COVID-19, according to the sheriff’s department. Many more inmates have tested positive but recovered. Seven inmates who have tested positive have died. Guaranteeing prisoners’ safety during the pandemic is an issue of humanity, not politics, said Sam Lewis, executive director of the California-based Anti-Recidivism Coalition, one of nearly 65 partner organizations in the #WeMatterToo campaign. “People have made mistakes that put them in jail,” said Lewis, a former life prisoner. “But that does not mean they should just die in those places. Accountability is not a death sentence.” Before the pandemic, Common’s Imagine Justice group organized regular in-person visits to correctional facilities. Since the pandemic, visitation has been cut off or is severely limited at many facilities. “Some of the strongest people I’ve ever met are in prison,” Common said. “I believe we can come out of this greater than we were before.”

Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg will headline CNN’s weekly town hall event on the coronavirus, which will also feature two Obama administration appointees. Greta Thunberg, 17, isn’t a physician or a public policy official. It remains unclear how her climate activism is relevant to the discussion about the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, though she is sure to be a ratings draw. CNN announced Wednesday that Coronavirus: Facts and Fears will also feature former Centers for Disease Control Director Richard Besser and former Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. Both served under President Barack Obama and both have been highly critical of President Donald Trump’s response to the Wuhan pandemic. The town hall on Thursday at 8 p.m. ET will be hosted by Anderson Cooper and Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Former acting CDC director Richard Besser, former HHS secretary Kathleen Sebelius and activist Greta Thunberg join @AndersonCooper & @DrSanjayGupta for a live #CNNTownHall. Coronavirus – Facts and Fears, Thursday at 8 p.m. ET pic.twitter.com/I4FrXgwaL6 — CNN (@CNN) May 13, 2020  CNN’s selection of Greta Thunberg as an apparent authority on the coronavirus has left more than a few people baffled, with some people wondering on social media if the network had mistakenly run an article from The Onion. Donald Trump Jr. quipped that the 17-year-old activist must now be a “world renowned infectious disease specialist.” Greta Thunberg having a remarkable career already in that as a teenager she’s now a world renowned infectious disease specialist and epidemiologist AND a leading scientific voice when it comes to global climate policy.Just wow so impressive. https://t.co/398T4wXDry — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) May 13, 2020  A CNN spokeswoman didn’t respond to a request for comment about why Thunberg was included on the panel. Thunberg has repeatedly blasted the U.S. for its environmental record. She has also insulted Trump, telling the BBC that talking to him would be a waste of her time. “Honestly, I don’t think I would have said anything. Because obviously he’s not listening to scientists and experts, so why would he listen to me?” she said. “So I probably wouldn’t have said anything, I wouldn’t have wasted my time.” During her highly publicized climate change protests, Thunberg has criticized the United States and Trump but has gone easy on China’s environmental record as the world’s largest polluter and producer of greenhouse gases. Sebelius has slammed the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak. “We basically wasted two months,” she recently told the Associated Press. Besser has also criticized the Trump administration for its guidelines on relaxing social distancing. “There are things that are clearly missing in there in terms of the need to have widespread testing capability available, the importance of contact tracing the importance of providing resources to individuals, to allow them to isolate or to quarantine,” he told Newsweek. Previous panelists on CNN’s Coronavirus: Facts and Fears include Dr. Anthony Fauci, former Vice President Al Gore, and filmmaker Spike Lee. Follow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg. Have a tip?

Sen. Mike Braun (R-IN) told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview on Wednesday that the media and Democrat obsession with Dr. Anthony Fauci “shows what’s wrong” with Washington, DC. Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), an ophthalmologist, said during a hearing on Tuesday that Dr. Athony Fauci is not the “end all” authority on the coronavirus response. Fauci said recently that if the country reopens too soon during the coronavirus outbreak, it will bring “needless suffering and death.” Paul, as well as Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC), said that many parts of the country are ready to reopen and that the federal government has relied too much on Fauci as the single source for the coronavirus response. Braun said that the reliance on Fauci as the primary source for the coronavirus response is symbolic for what is wrong with Washington, DC. He told Breitbart News, “I think that it shows what is wrong with this place over decades where you have had liberal politicians, many so-called conservatives, end up rolling over and allowing the bureaucracy to get that strong.” Braun continued, “I was glad when Rand brought that up. I took and made the same point that the FDA and the CDC about their SNAFUs, costing us 40 days on getting testing. Of course, the Democrats harp on that all the time, and thank goodness President Trump had an atmosphere in a place that was not going to let the people that have made government not work and control the shots. The fact that he was there to engender the efforts in the private sector to get busy on testing, therapeutics, and vaccine are going to make this a whole lot quicker in terms of getting this in the rearview mirror.” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) unveiled her $3 trillion, 1,815-page phase four coronavirus bill on Tuesday. The bill contains many leftist provisions that Politico wrote is more of a “policy wishlist” for Democrats and progressives. Braun contended that Pelosi and House Democrats frequently move to exploit crises. “I think that was politically irresponsible. She did the same thing, delaying phase three from Sunday to a Wednesday back in late March,” Braun said. “They view any crisis like this, as an opportunity to roll out not only what’s related to a crisis but enhancements of what stuff they’ve been talking about for decades. It’s a nonstarter.” Sean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter @SeanMoran3.

Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson has ordered the cancellation of a Travis McCready concert scheduled for Friday, saying that the performance at TempleLive in Fort Smith would violate state health guidelines. The planned acoustic performance had drawn national attention as popular pressure mounts for states to loosen stay-at-home restrictions and allow businesses to open their doors. The live music industry has seen cancellations across the board as major pop stars have halted tours. State health guidelines have also forced  concert venues to shut down. Gov. Hutchinson (R) said in a news conference Tuesday that concert would come three days before the state allows indoor venues to hold events with 50 people or fewer. McCready’s  event was expected to draw more about 250 ticketholders.  “You can’t just arbitrarily determine when the restrictions are lifted. That is something that is done based on a public health requirement,” Gov. Hutchinson told reporters on Tuesday. The governor also said the venue failed to submit a plan to the state’s health department. “Clearly, it is three days before we determined it was an appropriate time to open up to a limited capacity in some of those informal venues, and even if you’re going to have 250 people at a venue, you still have to have a specific plan that would be approved by the Department of Health,” Gov. Hutchinson said. “None of that was done in this case. It’s out of time.” He said the state will order the venue to cancel the event. “In terms of the concert, there will be a cease-and-desist order that will be issued by the Department of Health directing that the concert not take place.” McCready’s concert was expected to require attendees to wear masks and to maintain social distancing. It would also reduced the capacity of the TempleLive venue, which normally seats more than 1,000 people, by more than three-quarters. But the precautions failed to sway Arkansas’ Gov. Hutchinson. So far, TempleLive has not officially said whether or not the concert has been canceled. Follow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg. Have a tip? Contact me at dng@breitbart.com

Economists are increasingly pessimistic about the impact of the coronavirus on the U.S. economy but remain convinced that the economy will snap back in the second half of the year. A survey by the Wall Street Journal found that economists think unemployment will rise to 17 percent in June. A month ago, the survey found economists expected unemployment to hit 13 percent in June–a forecast that fell short of the 14.7 percent we hit in April. The survey also found that economists expect gross domestic product to contract 6.6 percent this year, measured from the fourth quarter of 2019. That significantly lower than the 4.9 percent forecast a month ago. But 85 percent of economists say the economy will begin to grow again in the second half of the year. In fact, they’ve upgraded their view for third-quarter growth to an 8.5 percent annualized rate from 6.2 percent a month ago. The fourth quarter is expected to see growth at a 6.7 percent rate, essentially unchanged from the month-ago survey.    

Pennsylvania officials suddenly revoked a number of business waivers after critics demanded transparency from Gov. Tom Wolf (D) regarding the criteria used in granting exemptions to “non-life essential” businesses, allowing them to operate during his stringent lockdown orders, PennLive revealed on Wednesday. Wolf, alongside Health Secretary Rachel Levine, shut down all non-life essential businesses in mid-March, but the governor followed up with a short-lived waiver program, which allowed nonessential businesses to apply for the right to operate, even under the lockdown orders. Secrecy shrouded what amounted to a shadowy process, piquing the interest of GOP lawmakers, who subpoenaed additional information regarding the criteria used to determine which businesses could operate and which had to remain closed. The Department of Community and Economic Development did not provide explicit details, instead releasing a list Friday containing the businesses that were granted requests, totaling 6,123. Several business owners have indicated they received a waiver, which the government officials suddenly revoked without warning — an action that appeared to occur right before the administration’s release of the list of recipients. “Just hours before the administration disclosed the first details about which businesses received waivers, state officials were still revoking exemptions without explanation, according to several interviews with business owners,” PennLive reported. Tiffany Kuhn was one of those individuals. She received an email from Wolf’s administration Thursday evening, informing her that her waiver — allowing her to operate her mobile notary business — had been rescinded. She suspected that the decision had something to do with a complaint from a competitor. “My first thought was, someone turned on me,” she said. Spotlight PA also found that other businesses appeared to receive similar emails on Thursday evening, while others received the news the following day. Officials granted Micah Durling, who owns a photography business, a waiver March 25, allowing him to operate his business. However, they ultimately revoked the waiver: The Lancaster County company, which he owns with his wife, specializes in pictures for real estate listings. The couple had adjusted to a new way of working: wearing gloves and masks, wiping down their equipment after shoots, and only taking pictures when no one was home. Then, on Monday afternoon, they received an email from the state, abruptly revoking the waiver without explanation. The reversal came a few days after a competitor who had not received a waiver began asking about the discrepancy, Durling said. “It was crushing,” he told Spotlight PA. “This frankly blindsided us.” The department attributed the decisions to “a quality control review process,” which resulted in officials revoking exemptions for 69 businesses previously awarded the waivers. “During that process, which is ongoing, we are rescinding waivers that were issued in error or do not meet the appropriate criteria,” Casey Smith, a spokesperson for the Department of Community and Economic Development, said, according to PennLive. Smith’s explanation has done little to satisfy critics, as the administration has yet to release the criteria officials used to determine eligibility. Pennsylvania attorney Wally Zimolong filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of the businesses that were denied the waiver and told Breitbart News on Saturday that the administration’s release of the list “only makes it worse.” He explained that some businesses that were denied waivers happened to be “identical” to businesses located just miles away. “These were competitors,” he told Breitbart News. Wolf and his administration have yet to address the discrepancies or provide the details of the criteria used in the controversial business waiver process. All the while, Wolf is keeping several counties in the most restrictive red phase of reopening, barring nonessential business operations. Wolf has extended his stringent lockdown orders — for counties remaining in the red phase — to June 4.

Much of the media coverage of the coronavirus pandemic has been focused on the number of cases of those who have been infected with COVID-19 and its associated hospitalizations and deaths, but several studies are raising concerns about the effects of business lockdowns and social distancing on mental health. A study published at JAMA Psychiatry in April noted that while social distancing practices have helped to “fundamentally reduce human contact” and, as a result, the spread of the coronavirus, “the potential for adverse outcomes on suicide risk is high” as a secondary consequence of lockdowns and other avoidance policies that ultimately produce greater social isolation. Researchers Mark Reger, Ph.D., and associates urged consideration of how the economic and emotional risk factors that accompany social distancing practices have an impact on those vulnerable to anxiety, depression, and even suicide risk. The authors pointed out that economic recessions generally yield higher rates of suicide whenever they occur. The state, business, and school closures associated with the coronavirus, however, coupled with significant stock market losses, may all be contributing to a “perfect storm” that proves to be associated with higher rates of suicide in the United States in the future. The study pointed to multiple byproducts of the social distancing practices, implemented to keep people physically safer, that may be associated with higher levels of mental health risks, including economic stress; social isolation; decreased access to religious communities; and national anxiety created by media coverage of the coronavirus. A study at The Lancet found that longer periods of quarantine are associated with poorer mental health outcomes. Samantha Brooks, Ph.D., and associates stated that while social isolation may help to reduce the spread of the virus, it is also “often associated with a negative psychological effect”: During the period of quarantine this negative psychological effect is unsurprising, yet the evidence that a psychological effect of quarantine can still be detected months or years later — albeit from a small number of studies — is more troubling and suggests the need to ensure that effective mitigation measures are put in place as part of the quarantine planning process. “Evidence from elsewhere also emphasises the importance of authorities adhering to their own recommended length of quarantine, and not extending it,” the authors asserted. In another study from Just Facts, researchers Andrew Glen, Ph.D., and James Agresti, president of Just Facts, found anxiety from reactions to coronavirus practices are likely to destroy “at least seven times more years of human life than can possibly be saved by lockdowns to control the spread of the disease.” Moreover, the researchers found the “total loss of life from all societal responses to this disease is likely to be more than 90 times greater than prevented by the lockdowns.” The authors reviewed a comprehensive range of data, including reactions to “stay-at-home orders, business shutdowns, media exaggerations, and legitimate concerns about the virus.” Of all the studies reviewed, the lowest nationwide measure of people who have experienced psychological harm from reactions to the Chinese virus was the 19 percent of adults the Kaiser Family Foundation found in March to have reported a “major impact” on their mental health. The Just Facts researchers stated that, based on the Kaiser study, “at least 16.8 percent of 255,200,373 adults in the United States — or 42,873,663 people — have suffered major mental harm from responses to COVID-19.” Psychiatrist Dr. Joseph Damore Jr. reviewed the Just Facts study, and concluded, according to the study, “This research is engaging and thoroughly answers the question about the cure being worse than the disease.”

A new poll published this week revealed that one in six high school students say that their plans for college have changed as a result of the Chinese virus pandemic. Some students plan to take a “gap year,” delaying their college plans for a year. According to a report by PBS, the Chinese virus pandemic has changed college plans for a significant amount of American high schoolers. A recent poll suggested that one in six high schoolers have changed their college plans as a result of the ongoing pandemic. Writing for Forbes, Eric Brotman told students that the pandemic presents an opportunity for them to take a “gap year.” Brotman says that deferring their college plans for a year might allow them to gain practical experience in a field that is relevant to their future career. “This is a good time to find a part- or full-time job to save money for college expenses,” Brotman wrote. “If you can find an opening within the field you’re interested in — like assisting at a doctor’s office, law practice or engineering firm — you’ll get to learn more about the industry while earning some cash and making meaningful connections for the future.” Richard Garrett, chief research officer at Eduventures, argued, however, that traditional options for students that opt for a “gap year” may be inaccessible due to the pandemic. “If you’re an 18- or 19-year-old, your alternatives are pretty limited,” Garrett said. “Your job prospects are very much curtailed. Your ability to travel and volunteer [is] very, very much curtailed.” The Wall Street Journal reported this week that more students are considering a “gap year” despite restrictions on travel, internship opportunities, and volunteer work. The report noted that various internship programs have modified their offerings to accommodate students in the age of coronavirus. Stay tuned to Breitbart News for more updates on this story.

Appearing Wednesday on ABC’s Good Morning America, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti (D) said his city won’t fully reopen until there is a cure for the Chinese coronavirus. Garcetti’s remarks come after Los Angeles county’s top public health official predicted its stay-at-home order will remain in place for an additional three months.  A partial transcript is as follows:  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Do you have a sense of where you are going to be in September? We did see that news this morning that California State University System is saying they’re not going to have classes on campus. What are you expecting in Los Angeles and for your schools? ERIC GARCETTI: Sure. I hope for our K-12 schools that we will have some sense of opening, but it won’t be in the way that we’ve known school in the past. It might be fewer days a week, it might be staggered, because we have to maintain that physical distance and we have to make sure for our vulnerable children, some of them won’t be able to go back to school for some time. Look, we have to tell the hard truths and protect our people. At the same time, we take steps forward. For instance, this past weekend, we opened up our trails, we have retail for curbside pickup, we’ll see that expanded, even some active recreation on our beaches this weekend. Those are important. We’ve never been fully closed, we’ll never be completely open until we have a cure. But I do believe that we can take steps, but monitor those numbers, listen to the scientists and the medical professionals, and make the tough calls even when there’s criticism.

Cal State announced this week that it plans to keep classes online for the fall semester over fears of a second outbreak of the Chinese virus. Cal State is the first large university system in the United States to announce that its campus will remain closed for the fall semester. Its 23 campuses and 500,000 students will not be back on campus in 2020. According to a report by the New York Times, California State University’s campuses will remain closed for the remainder of the calendar year over concerns that the Chinese virus pandemic will continue into the fall. Cal State Chancellor Timothy P. White said that it is impractical to reopen its 23 campuses in the age of coronavirus. According to White, Cal State’s campus swell to a population of 500,000 during the academic year. White said it would be “irresponsible” to reopen the campus before a coronavirus vaccine has been made available to the public. “Our university, when open without restrictions and fully in person, as is the traditional norm of the past, is a place where over 500,000 people come together in close and vibrant proximity with each other on a daily basis,” White said. “That approach, sadly, just isn’t in the cards now.” Many universities and colleges have already announced plans to reopen for the fall semester. Purdue University, North Carolina State, and Michigan State are amongst the institutions that have already announced plans to reopen their campuses for the fall semester. Terry W. Hartle, senior vice president of the American Council on Education, said that Cal State’s decision will impact the plans adopted by other universities and colleges for the fall semester. “Cal State is an extraordinarily large and important university system and an awful lot of other institutions will watch this development carefully,” Hartle said in a comment. Stay tuned to Breitbart News for more campus updates.

Governor Ron DeSantis has a simple message for sports leagues who can’t practice or play in their home states due to the coronavirus: Come to Florida. In a Wednesday press conference in Tallahassee, DeSantis made it clear that if athletic organizations couldn’t operate in their home states, Florida would “find a place for you.” Watch: NEW: Pro sports teams from any city are welcome to play in Florida, Gov. DeSantis says. “We know that it can be done safely,” the governor says. pic.twitter.com/oQBZsgKV0j — Andy Slater (@AndySlater) May 13, 2020  The pitch to sports leagues and commissioners comes on the heels of a report on Tuesday, which said that Los Angeles County in California will be maintain stay-at-home restrictions through the month of July. The UFC held, from what all accounts was a wildly successful UFC 249 event in Jacksonville last weekend. The UFC became the first sports organization to hold a major, live sporting event televised in the country in two months. DeSantis’ has made Florida the face of the return of sports, in many respects. In April, DeSantis made World Wrestling Entertainment an essential business, in order to allow the WWE to continue to show live events and productions in the state. In addition, one of the proposed plans for restarting the NBA season, centers on keeping players at Orlando’s Walt Disney World Resort. “DeSantis started reopening most parts of Florida last week after the coronavirus shutdown, allowing restaurants and retail to renew operations under certain conditions,” Bloomberg reported. “So far, the reopening has excluded Miami-Dade and Broward counties, the hardest hit and most populous regions, but those counties may reopen as soon as next week.” The UFC will hold a UFC Fight Night event in Jacksonville on Wednesday night.

A 12-year-old girl from New Jersey donated all of her birthday money to feed health care workers such as nurses and first responders on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic. Brianna Geer, of Garfield, took the money her parents would have spent on a party or gifts and put it towards the grassroots group Strangers Helping Strangers. This group purchases meals for health care workers in hospitals and nursing homes and delivers groceries to homebound city residents, North Jersey.com reported. “We would have thrown a party, so she asked that the money that would have been spent on the party we weren’t having could be used to help that organization,” Amanda, Brianna’s mother, said. “We posted the fundraiser on Facebook asking for donations instead of gifts.” The fundraiser generated around $300, which Brianna’s parents matched. So Brianna and her family wound up donating $600 and two vans’ filled with groceries in honor of Brianna’s birthday. Brianna enjoyed a drive-by parade and received a proclamation in her name from the city in recognition of her efforts. But that was just the beginning of Brianna’s charitable efforts. She, along with her mother, donated personal protective equipment (PPE) to medical workers at Valley Hospital on Monday evening. Brianna also used her money to buy playing cards and puzzle books for the Paramus Veterans Memorial Home. Other people who have had birthdays that fall during the pandemic also looked for ways to donate their gifts to charitable causes. A Milwaukee, Wisconsin, attorney created a GoFundMe account on his birthday to raise money for struggling restaurants that were shut down during the coronavirus crisis. His fundraiser generated more than $30,000.

No Kid Hungry, a charity working to feed needy children, has declined a $200,000 donation from rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine because of his criminal record and glorification of the drugs and gang lifestyle. The rapper announced his intentions to make the donation to the charity after reports broke that he made up to two million dollars immediately after the release of his latest song, “GOOBA.” TMZ reported that the rapper intended to donate ten percent of his earning to charities to help with the coronavirus response. “During this pandemic I understand we have nurses and frontline hero’s who risk there life daily to save others. But NEVER forget the children & Families who depend on OUR PUBLIC schools for daily meals and nutritions to keep our future leaders growing to their best potential,” 6ix9ine told his followers in an Instagram post, Yahoo Entertainment reported. “To every influencer out there REMEMBER if you are blessed GOD gave you that blessing not just for YOU but also TO HELP OTHERS.”     DESCRIBE ME IN ONE WORD  A post shared by  IM BACK AND THEY MAD (@6ix9ine) on May 9, 2020 at 9:55am PDT But the charity had other ideas. In a statement, No Kid Hungry declined any such donation. “We are grateful for Mr. Hernandez’s generous offer to donate to No Kid Hungry, but we have informed his representatives that we have declined this donation,” the charity said on Tuesday. “As a child-focused campaign, it is our policy to decline funding from donors whose activities do not align with our mission and values.” 6ix9ine furiously responded that the charity was “taking food out” of the mouths of kids. In a post he later deleted, the “FEFE” rapper said that the charity would “rather take food out the mouth of these innocent children I never seen something so cruel.” The New York City rapper has a long rap sheet from his days in the gang Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods. In 2019, for instance, 6ix9ine, born Daniel Hernandez, pleaded guilty to a group of gang robberies and shootings and then agreed to testify against his former gang mates. He was sentenced to two years in that case. He was already on probation for a 2018 case of use of a child for a sexual performance. He was released from prison early and is under house arrest after his lawyers argued that his case of asthma made him vulnerable to the coronavirus.

Pennsylvania’s Health Secretary Rachel Levine moved his 95-year-old mother from a nursing home during the coronavirus pandemic despite his department’s guidance instructing nursing homes to readmit “stable” patients who contracted the coronavirus — a move critics say led to the stark reality of most virus deaths in the state stemming from those facilities. “My mother requested, and my sister and I as her children complied to move her to another location during the Covid-19 outbreak,” Levine, the nation’s first openly transgender public health secretary, explained. “My mother is 95 years old. She is very intelligent and more than competent to make her own decisions.” “Many in Harrisburg wondered what kind of message it sends — when a close relative of the person tasked with overseeing those types of facilities doesn’t choose to stay in one,” ABC27 reported. Levine, the state’s health secretary, has been under tremendous fire over the Pennsylvania Department of Health’s initial guidance, instructing nursing care facilities to readmit patients who were treated for the coronavirus and in “stable” condition, attributing the decision to leaving hospital beds open for an influx of virus patients. The guidance stated: Nursing care facilities must continue to accept new admissions and receive readmissions for current residents who have been discharged from the hospital who are stable to alleviate the increasing burden in the acute care settings. This may include stable patients who have had the COVID-19 virus. Nursing homes in the state have been ravaged by the virus, with over two-thirds of the state’s overall coronavirus deaths stemming from individuals at nursing homes or personal care facilities. Despite issuing such a directive, Levine removed his own mother from a personal care home during the pandemic. Nearly 70 percent of the state’s coronavirus fatalities, 2,611 of 3,806, have stemmed from such facilities, the state’s health department data shows. Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro has opened criminal investigations into some of the nursing homes and will hold “nursing facilities and caretakers criminally accountable if they fail to properly provide care to our loved ones.” Levine has seen nothing but support from Gov.

A new poll reports that 65 percent of college students are willing to return to campus this fall without a vaccine for the Chinese virus. Only 31 percent of respondents said that they would prefer to resume classes virtually if a vaccine is not available by the beginning of the fall semester. According to a report by Axios, a new poll found that the majority of college students are willing to return to campus this fall without a vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus. Although 65 percent of respondents said that they would return to campus before the introduction of a vaccine, 31 percent said that they would prefer to resume online classes in the fall. Four percent of respondents said that they would withdraw from their university or college if a vaccine is not available the fall. The report suggests that online class sessions are less productive for students. Nearly half of respondents said that they attended class less often and a majority of students said that they were too distracted to learn. “The desire to attend classes in person comes as students report that the virtual education experience is full of pitfalls: 45% say they attend class less often and more than 70% say they’re distracted by their phone, computer and things going on at home,” the report reads. University and college administrators around the nation are concerned about the financial impact that the ongoing Chinese virus pandemic will have on their institution’s bottom line. American universities and colleges were eligible for approximately $14 billion in federal coronavirus relief under the CARES Act. Breitbart News reported in April that Harvard, Yale, Princeton that they would reject millions of dollars in federal coronavirus relief grants. Other wealthy institutions, such as Columbia University, faced criticism in April over their decision to accept federal aid.

Solstice Studios has set an ambitious theater release date of July 1st for their upcoming Russell Crowe thriller, Unhinged, in what will likely be the first major film released in the wake of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. According to Deadline, producers initially intended to release the film in September but have decided to move the date up as a result of the nationwide closure of movie theaters. “When we green lit this film, I probably figured that July 4th weekend and Christmas would be the two least likely slots,” Solstice CEO Mark Gill told the entertainment outlet. “We were sitting on September 4 and then COVID-19 happened, and A Quiet Place 2 moved out of its original slot and landed on our date.” “When you are in a speedboat and a giant ship is coming at you, you better move out of the way,” he continued. “We looked at the rest of the year, fall/winter and spring 2021. The release schedule was already crowded, and when you add all the films that have been delayed, it made it [sic] think that maybe we go sooner.”  The film’s description reads as follows: Academy Award-winner Russell Crowe stars in Unhinged, a psychological thriller that takes something we’ve all experienced–road rage–to an unpredictable and terrifying conclusion. Rachel (Caren Pistorius) is running late getting to work when she crosses paths with a stranger (Crowe) at a traffic light. Soon, Rachel finds herself and everyone she loves the target of a man who feels invisible and is looking to make one last mark upon the world by teaching her a series of deadly lessons. What follows is a dangerous game of cat and mouse that proves you never know who you’re driving next to. The thriller will likely serve as a test of the appetite of Americans to return to movie theaters, with many faced to way the risk of contagion due to the proximity of seating. The production company recently took a survey of 1000 people which found that the majority would be happy to watch a film at the theatre. AMC Theaters and Regal Cinemas, the two largest theater chains in the United States, are still closed. However, Gill insisted that they will not go through with “anything that isn’t safe and expert-guided.” “The first call was to John Fithian at NATO, whose organization is in touch with state public services departments, and if they had said you can’t open theaters, we would have said forget it,” he insisted. The film’s release is likely to coincide with the reopening of theaters worldwide, as many countries attempt to return to some level of normality following months of lockdown. The governments of Australia, China, The Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Hong Kong, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and Taiwan have all announced plans in the near future.

ROME (AP) — The 20 teams in Serie A agreed Wednesday to resume competition on June 13 in empty stadiums. The date is subject to approval by the Italian government, however. “With regard to the restart of sporting activity, it has been indicated, with respect to the decisions of the government and in compliance with the medical protocols to protect the players and staff, the date of June 13 for the resumption of the league,” the league’s governing body said in a statement. Earlier, Sports Minister Vincenzo Spadafora said full team training will restart on May 18 after a revised medical protocol was approved amid the coronavirus pandemic. The clubs have already resumed training on an individual basis. Players and backroom staff will be closely monitored and tested and if one person tests positive for COVID-19, the whole club will have to go into quarantine for two weeks. Serie A has been suspended since March 9, when the government ordered a nationwide lockdown. There are 12 rounds remaining in Serie A, plus four matches that were postponed from the 25th round. Also, the Italian Cup is in the semifinal stage.

Actor and director Tyler Perry is planning to re-start film production for Sistas and The Oval at his massive Atlanta, Georgia, studio in July, which will include testing for the Chinese coronavirus and quarantining in on set housing for the cast and crew. Tyler Perry has come up with a plan to reopen his film studio in Atlanta and get back to work, according to a report by Deadline, which added that upon arrival, the stars and crew will be tested for the Wuhan virus and quarantined in their rooms for four hours while they wait for their test results. And while most of the shows’ cast and crew are located in the Atlanta area, those being flown in from Los Angeles and New York will only be able to board Perry’s private plane after they test negative for the coronavirus. From there, the cast and crew will be tested another four times over the two and a half weeks they’ll be in Atlanta for the shoot. Danai Gurira in The Walking Dead (Jackson Lee Davis/AMC, 2010)  Caleb McLaughlin, Sadie Sink, Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, and Noah Schnapp in Stranger Things (Netflix, 2016) The report added that everyone, including Perry, will remain isolated on the 330-acre lot of Tyler Perry Studios for the entire duration of the shoot, and that the cast and crew will be provided housing on the lot. In recent years, Tyler Perry Studios has been the production home to hit shows like The Walking Dead and Netflix’s Stranger Things.  Sistas is set to begin filming on July 8, with The Oval going beginning filming on its second season on July 28. Perry told Deadline that he has been in communication with Hollywood unions that have been working to set guidelines for production in the new era of the coronavirus — which originated from the city of Wuhan in the communist country of China. The report added that Perry’s rules for safely operating a film studio likely goes above and beyond the unions’ recommended protocols. Perry added that he would only resume production if every cast member was comfortable with it.

Over 200,000 people have fled rising violence between the Hema and Lendu tribes in the Democratic Republic of Congo’s (DRC) northeastern Ituri Province over the past two months, Voice of America (VOA) reported this week, citing U.N. data. According to the U.N. Refugee Agency, 1.2 million people have been displaced by interethnic violence in Ituri province alone, with 5 million people in total forced to move in the DRC due to tribal hostility. The Lendu-Hema conflict has been documented for decades and is responsible for Africa’s single largest displaced persons crisis, according to the report. Ituri province is rich in natural resources such as oil and gold, causing the two tribes native to the region to fight over valuable territory. According to the U.N.’s report, the number of attacks between the Lendu and Hema has increased in recent months, tracing back to December of last year when a “government-led military operation against various armed groups” caused regional tensions to escalate. Over the past 60 days, the U.N. says its monitors have reported at least 3,000 human rights violations in Ituri Province’s Djugu territory, largely occupied by the Hema. On average, the monitors record 50 attacks per day. “Displaced people have reported acts of extreme violence with at least 274 civilians killed with weapons such as machetes. More than 140 women were raped and almost 8,000 houses set on fire. The vast majority of those displaced are women and children, many of whom are now living under crowded circumstances with host families from the community,” United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) spokesman Charlie Yaxley told VOA. “That, in turn, is also making the social distancing required to prevent the spread of COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] extremely difficult as we see many people living inside shelters … and, this again places them vulnerable to possible further attacks, vulnerable to the elements and with little protection in terms of preventing the spread of COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus],” Yaxley added. Access to Ituri province’s Djugu and Mahagi territories has been largely restricted due to the increased violence according to the report, blocking access for the U.N. and private aid workers trying to reach people that need assistance. The U.N. says that the DRC has received just 18 percent of its $154 million aid package from the agency so far, adding to the difficulty of helping the displaced population. In March, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) said the DRC’s healthcare system was “on life support” following nearly two years of battle against the country’s most recent Ebola virus outbreak. First detected in August 2018, the latest Ebola outbreak has been concentrated in the northeast of DRC, in the neighboring Ituri and North Kivu provinces. The most recent Ebola outbreak is the DRC’s worst ever, and is the world’s second-largest on record. DRC health authorities had expected to declare the latest Ebola outbreak officially over in early March, following the discharge of the last known Ebola patient. However, on April 10, a new case was recorded in the city of Beni, located in North Kivu province, which borders Ituri Province. Since then, six additional cases have been documented in the same region. Half of DRC’s medical facilities lack basic sanitation and clean water, according to UNICEF. In general, most DRC hospitals have operated without sufficient medical supplies and equipment for years, meaning the nation’s healthcare system is poorly equipped to treat the growing number of coronavirus cases in the country.

Rio Grande Valley Border Patrol agents arrested two alleged drug smugglers. One of the Mexican nationals tested positive for COVID-19 and has alleged ties to a cartel, officials stated. Rio Grande City Station Border Patrol agents patrolling near Escobares, Texas, on May 8, encountered two drug smuggling suspects after they illegally crossed from Mexico. One tested positive for Coronavirus after being taken into custody. Officials said the man also has ties to a cartel. The agents arrested the two Mexican men as part of a drug smuggling case. After transporting them to the Rio Grande City Border Patrol station, one complained of migraine pain. The agents transported him to a local hospital where he tested positive for COVID-19, officials reported. The second Mexican national was asymptomatic and returned to Mexico under Coronavirus protection protocols. “Our border security efforts are vital in containing the spread of COVID-19 and protecting the American people during this health pandemic. These measures are working,” CBP Acting Commissioner Mark Morgan said in a written statement. “Our Border Patrol agents risk their lives every day and, in this case, they did their jobs and ensured these smugglers could not successfully enter the United States.” “Think about the alternative: potentially endless exposure and spread of the virus to innocent Americans with likely disastrous consequences from unscrupulous smugglers,” Morgan stated. “This is yet another example of why COVID-19 policies are so critical to the health and safety of the American people.” Officials said the Mexican national who tested positive for COVID-19 had been arrested by Border Patrol agents on three previous occasions since late 2018. He will remain in quarantine for observation until he is returned to Mexico. During the enforcement action, the agents also seized 200 .50 caliber rounds of ammunition. The agents turned the ammo over to the Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms, and Explosives. “All agents, contract staff, and personnel who had contact with the subject were evaluated and found to have low to minimal exposure,” Rio Grande Valley Sector officials said in a written statement. “Per CBP policy, they were directed to follow CDC guidelines for monitoring and quarantine if necessary. No individual has shown any adverse signs or symptoms.” This is the second illegal immigrant to test positive after being arrested for illegally entering the United States. In late April, El Centro Sector Border Patrol agents arrested an Indian national near Calexico, California. The man was traveling with a group of Mexican males, Breitbart Texas reported. “On Thursday, April 23, a U.S. Border Patrol agent apprehended three Mexican nationals and one Indian national suspected of having illegally crossed the border along the U.S.-Mexico border near Calexico, California. The three Mexican nationals were rapidly returned to Mexico under Title 42 USC 265, and the Indian national was transported to a USBP facility for processing,” Morgan said in a written statement on Monday. After the initial processing of the Indian national, officials referred the man for medical evaluation after he displayed flu-like symptoms, CBP officials reported. Medical staff tested the 31-year-old man for the Coronavirus and the test came back positive for COVID-19. “The potential for the introduction and spread of COVID-19 in CBP stations and processing centers presents a danger to migrants, our frontline agents and officers, and the American people. Our agents and officers continue to protect our country from this invisible enemy, risking their own lives for the health of our nation,” Commissioner Morgan said at the time. “This is precisely the reason the CDC has given CBP the authority to rapidly return individuals that could potentially be infected with COVID-19.” “Can you imagine if we were navigating this pandemic during this time last year, when we had more than 20,000 migrants in our custody?” the commissioner continued. “It would have overwhelmed our processing centers and stations, and crippled the healthcare system along the border.” During the human smuggling process from South Asia, migrants are frequently moved through multiple countries and kept in stash houses during the weeks-long journey to the U.S. southern border, Border Patrol officials repeatedly tell Breitbart Texas in interviews.

The United Kingdom is practically alone in not limiting or monitoring international arrivals during the coronavirus pandemic but when challenged on this oversight the Home Secretary abrogated her own responsibility, insisting the decision had instead been taken by the scientists, apparently absolving the government from having to defend its record. Speaking on British television Wednesday morning, Home Secretary Priti Patel was asked by Good Morning Britain host Lorraine Kelly about the situation at the nation’s unguarded borders, which have frequently compared unfavourably of late to the domestic lockdown where resident Britons have been placed under police-enforced curfew. Kelly told the minister: “you say social distancing is here to say, but we’ve got this ludicrous situation in our airports right now which seems utterly bizarre, mind-boggling… there’s no checks, no tests, the safety of airport workers is paramount. People could be bringing coronavirus in from countries like America, Asia, parts of Africa, and we’re not testing them and we don’t seem to be doing anything about this. It seems utterly bizarre.” Just 273 out of 18.1m People Entering UK Before Lockdown Were Quarantined https://t.co/6WfwRkGo4j — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 5, 2020  Giving the cabinet’s standard reply, that the democratically elected government was no longer making decisions on how to run the country, but apparently wholly outsourcing that to appointed scientists, Mrs Patel attempted to shrug off any responsibility for having to answer the question. The Home Secretary said: “you mentioned temperature checks, and testing  and things of that nature. We are guided by the science, and the science has told us that would not work.” Patel also attempted to claim the government had taken proactive in protecting the government from incoming travellers in the early days of the outbreak. The Home Secretary said: “…that’s not fully accurate, Lorraine. “There is a lot of things that have taken place over recent months. “You’ve got to remember, at the beginning of the year when coronavirus became more prevalent around the world… we were asking people to self-isolate in January, February, and March, people that were coming into the UK.” While it is technically true that the UK government ordered a number of travellers arriving into the United Kingdom into quarantine, and who received a vast amount of press attention at the time, it was subsequently revealed the actual volume of people involved was extremely small. In fact, as Breitbart London reported last week, in the three months running up to the nationwide lockdown being announced, of the known 18.1 million people who arrived at British shores, just 273 were formally quarantined, meaning 99.998% were not. The Home Secretary also defended her record by claiming arrival numbers were down by 99% compared to this time last year. This again is true, but no thanks to the British government, which has done nothing to constrict new arrivals, but rather is down to other countries closing their own borders. Remarking amazement at the British government’s lax attitude to border control in a time of pandemic, epidemiologist Professor Gabriel Scally said in April: “The UK is an outlier… It is very hard to understand why it persists in having this open borders policy. It is most peculiar.” Mrs Patel said border checks and quarantines for arrivals were on their way, and she had been working on such proposals in her department. Why controlling the United Kingdom’s borders in the future was supported by “the science” and not doing so during the early height of the pandemic was not, is unclear.

The governors of New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania are under fire for controversial nursing home policy decisions that critics say fueled coronavirus deaths in those facilities. On March 25, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) ordered nursing homes to accept patients who tested positive for COVID-19, as the New York Post reported: An executive at the unnamed Queens nursing home says that the facility was coronavirus-free until Gov. Andrew Cuomo forced facilities in the state to accept coronavirus patients on March 25. In Pennsylvania, the Bucks County Courier Times reported: On March 29, as Pennsylvania, New York and other states began ordering nursing homes to admit medically stable residents infected with the coronavirus, national trade groups warned it could unnecessarily cost more lives. The health directives put “frail and older adults who reside in nursing homes at risk” and would “result in more people going to the hospital and more deaths,” the American Health Care Association and affiliates said at the time. A month later, it appears government officials should have heeded the dire call to pursue different pandemic emergency plans. Then on April 6, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy followed Cuomo’s lead and ordered New Jersey nursing homes to accept patients who tested positive for COVID-19, as NorthJersey.com reported: New Jersey nursing homes cannot bar coronavirus patients from being admitted into their facilities, a new state policy designed to make room at hospitals already stressed from a growing surge of critically ill patients. Though not all 50 states are currently providing complete data, a huge percentage of the 83,231 COVID-19 deaths in the United States, as of 5 p.m. eastern on Tuesday, May 12, were among residents of nursing homes and long-term care facilities. The Henry J. Kaiser Foundation has assembled nursing home/long-term care facility COVID-19 mortality data from the 33 states that report that data, and calculates that, as of May 7, nursing home and long term care facility residents accounted for 38 percent of the COVID-19 deaths in those states. The percentage of coronavirus deaths from nursing homes appears to be increasing as the pandemic drags on. Table 1 below shows a summary of the ten states with the highest number of nursing home/long-term care facility COVID-19 deaths, as of May 7. (States not reporting COVID-19 deaths in long term care facilities in the Kaiser Family Foundation report as of May 7, 2020 include Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. ) In New York, where Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s political star was rising nationally as recently as last month, the shocking revelations of his decisions to force nursing homes to take in patients who tested positive for COVID-19 appear to not only have burst that political bubble for Cuomo, but more ominously they appear to be the driving force in the surge of nursing home COVID-19 deaths, as the New York Post reported on April 23. On Sunday, Gov. Cuomo reversed that controversial order, as NY1 reported: Governor Cuomo is effectively reversing a much-criticized policy directive that was sending seniors treated for COVID-19 back into nursing homes. A March 25th order from the state Department of Health required all nursing homes to readmit seniors who left to be treated for coronavirus at a hospital.. Critics said that policy led to more than 5,000 deaths in nursing homes, which are regulated by the state. In New Jersey, Gov. Phil Murphy’s handling of nursing homes has come under fire for additional decisions by some who say the long term care facility regulatory control bill he signed last year was too “watered-down” to address what become the coronavirus pandemic, as Politico reported on Monday: Almost a year after a 2018 adenovirus outbreak killed 11 children at a long-term care facility in northern New Jersey, Gov. Phil Murphy signed legislation requiring every such facility in the state to develop outbreak response plans to prevent future tragedies. . . Six sources with direct knowledge of the bill’s drafting in 2019 say the state Health Department — worried about its limited resources — objected to a requirement that all of the plans be submitted for state vetting. Lawmakers reworked the legislation to limit the mandate to less than two dozen sites. Now, 11 months after the bill was sent to Murphy’s desk, nearly 4,900 deaths have been linked to coronavirus cases at 500-plus facilities across New Jersey — more than half of all the fatalities in the state and one of the worst outbreaks in the nation. In Pennsylvania, Morning Call reported Gov. Tom Wolf has been criticized for inattention to nursing homes: The escalating tragedy in Pennsylvania nursing and personal care homes, which have more than two-thirds of the state’s coronavirus deaths, has prompted lawmakers to point fingers at the Wolf administration. “There is no excuse for what is going on, OK?” said Chester County state Sen. Andrew Dinniman, who like Gov. Tom Wolf is a Democrat. “The Department of Health has failed our nursing homes.” Dinniman’s comments came Wednesday. On Thursday, state Sen. Judy Ward and other Republican senators said the administration failed to pay enough attention to nursing homes and their highly vulnerable residents when the virus first arrived in the U.S. The percentage of coronavirus deaths from residents of nursing homes varies by state, ranging from 19 percent in Nevada to 81 percent in Minnesota. In Massachusetts it is 60 percent. On March 25 Worldometers reported there were 775 COVID-19 deaths in the United States. New York State had the most COVID-19 deaths of any state in the country, 271, or 35 percent of the country’s total at the time. Rounding out the top ten states for reported number of COVID-19 deaths on March 25 were Washington with 123, California with 51, Louisiana with 46, New Jersey with 44, Georgia with 38, Michigan with 24, Florida with 20, Illinois with 16, and three states were tied for the tenth spot with 12 deaths each: Connecticut, Texas, and Indiana. As of 5 p.m. eastern time on Tuesday May 12 there are 83,231 COVID-19 deaths in the United States. New York State still has the most COVID-19 deaths of any state in the country, with 27,166, or 32 percent of the country’s total. Georgia, Washington, Texas, and Indiana are no longer in the top ten states for COVID-19 deaths, but Pennsylvania and Massachusetts now are, as Table 2 below indicates: New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania are not the only states where governors have come under criticism for nursing home decisions that backfired, but they are the highest profile due to the high number of total COVID-19 deaths and the high number of COVID-19 deaths among nursing home residents.

Senator Bill Cassidy (R-LA) on Wednesday blasted the House Democrats’ $3 trillion coronavirus relief package, which he labeled as “garbage.” Cassidy told Fox News Channel’s “America’s Newsroom” the bill, which was deemed dead on arrival by the GOP-majority Senate, was an attempt by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) to “fulfill a left-wing agenda.” “I think it doesn’t pass the laugh test,” Cassidy said. “Clearly, she went to her committee chairs, she said, ‘Give me that which you think maybe we can get in here, a starting point for a negotiation so we will look reasonable when we retreat from it.’ On the other hand, it is socking it to the American people, cynically saying we’re here to help you, but rather instead trying to fulfill a left-wing agenda. It is … garbage.” Cassidy acknowledged more aid will likely be needed, but pushed back against including the Democrats’ “wish list.” “Clearly, some aid is going to be needed going further,” he advised. “The longer the crisis lasts, the more likely aid is going to be needed. That said, we shouldn’t kind of mash it together with the wish list and discredit the true need As people are attempting to sneak in an agenda, cynically saying this is about need but really it’s about an agenda. We need to stick with the need.” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent

Wednesday on ABC’s “The View,” Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI) declared the “racist and misogynistic” lockdown protesters opposing her order were “calling for violence.” Whitmer said, “Well, I do think that the fact of the matter is these protests, you know, in a perverse way make it likelier that we’re going to have to stay in a stay-at-home posture. The whole point of them supposedly is they don’t want to be doing that, and that’s why I’m asking that everyone with a platform call on people to do the right thing. You know, these have been really political rallies where people come with Confederate flags and Nazi symbolism and calling for violence. This is not appropriate in a global pandemic, but it’s certainly not an exercise of democratic principles where we have free speech. This is calls to violence. This is racist and misogynistic, and I ask that everyone who has a platform uses it to call on people to observe the best practices by the CDC, and to stop encouraging this behavior because it only makes it that much more precarious for us to try to reengage our economy which is what everyone says they want us to be able to do.” When asked about threats to her, Whitmer said, “Well, I would be not truthful if I said it didn’t bother me. It certainly does. I’m fortunate that the Michigan State Police is an incredibly talented professional organization that oversees the security of myself and my family and I’m grateful for that, but the fact of the matter is the Michigan capitol is one of the few capitols in the country where people can come with bearing arms, and what we saw last week and what we anticipate seeing tomorrow is those arms being used to intimidate others, being brandished in a way that is to strike fear into others, and that is not legal activity. So this is a terribly concerning development in that we have legislators who are showing up to work wearing bulletproof vests. That is disenfranchising thousands of people in our state if their legislator doesn’t feel safe to go to work and do what their job is. No one should stand in our way of doing our jobs. I respect people’s right to dissent, but that does not extend to endangering other people’s lives and we take it very seriously.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN) told Breitbart News that the coronavirus relief package House Democrats unveiled yesterday is a “grab bag special interest giveaway to their base” with “free cash for illegal immigrants.” “Immediately, it’s a non-tarter for me and so many other House conservatives,” Banks said in an interview on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with host Rebecca Mansour and special guest host John Binder. Banks noted that the Democrats’ $3 trillion proposal, known as the HEROES Act, exceeds the total of the three previous coronavirus relief bills. “This is taking everything else that we’ve done, adding it up together, and this bill alone surpasses — at three trillion dollars — all of the other three-plus aid packages that we passed before,” Banks said. “At the end of the day, this is a Democrat grab bag special interest giveaway to their base supporters. Not a single Republican had any input at all into this massive spending deal.” LISTEN:  Breitbart News reported, “House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) unveiled her $3 trillion phase four coronavirus bill on Tuesday that serves as a “policy wishlist” for Democrats and progressives.” “At a time of mass unemployment — more than 33 million Americans unemployed, right now — one of the provisions in the Democrats’ House bill relief package — if you can even really call it that — is basically a provision that makes sure illegal aliens are no longer deported,” observed Binder. “It actually gives a carve out to businesses, incentivizing businesses to hire illegal aliens over unemployed Americans, and promises that businesses will not be prosecuted for hiring illegal aliens during the crisis.” Binder added, “We have mass unemployment, and and the knee-jerk reaction of the left is, ‘Let’s import more foreign workers.'” Banks replied, “If you didn’t think it was bad enough that they slipped free cash for illegal immigrants into this bill, then keep reading. This bill overturns some of the restrictions on the former bills to allow for bailouts to Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest abortion provider. It bails out the U.S. Postal Service with $25 billion dollars. It gives $3.6 billion to help states do all mail-in and ballots which are designed to help Democrats on election day rather than maintain fair elections nationally.” Banks continued, “It bails out blue states like Illinois and forces taxpayers in fiscally responsible states like Indiana to pay for it, and that’s just shameful. It’s wrong. This bill is designed to help Democrats and to give bailouts to blue states.” Binder asked about the bill’s “jailbreak provisions.” Breitbart News reported that the bill mandates the release of federal inmates, as well as local convicts and illegal aliens, from jail if a court categorizes them as “non-violent” offenders.” “Why is the initial response to release people from prison when all other Americans are being told they can’t leave their homes?” inquired Binder. Banks replied, “On its face, this is an attempt by Democrats to placate their base, whether it’s early release for prisoners, or bailouts for blue states, or what this bill does to remove the the SALT deduction cap that we got rid of in the tax cut bill a few years ago. “This bill would give tax cuts to really rich people in  the coastal elite states like California and New York,” Banks added.  “This bill is designed to be a talking point for Democrats to go back to their base and say, ‘Look what we try to get done for you.'” Democrats are pursuing political optics for their base, Banks determined. “[Democrats] are not naive,” Banks stated. “They know this bill goes nowhere once they pass it in the House. It’s dead on arrival in the Senate, and there’s no way this president is never gonna sign name to a bill like this.” “This is what Democrats would do if they did get control. This is what Democrats can ask if they win the Senate. This is what Democrats would pass if Joe Biden is the president. That’s why it’s dangerous. While today it’s a talking point tomorrow, it could very well become reality if we let Democrats win in this November election.” Banks recalled Rahm Emanuel’s maxim: “Never let a crisis go to waste.” “This is how Democrats operate,” concluded Banks. “They are seizing this moment to advocate for issues that placate their Democrat base, and that’s all this is. It’s a wish list.  ‘Give me more taxpayer dollars for Planned Parenthood, give me more free cash for illegal immigrants.’ They filled this bill with all the pork they could imagine.” Breitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.

ROME — The Vatican newspaper L’Osservatore Romano announced Wednesday that migrants are the “true victims” of the coronavirus pandemic and yet they have disappeared from the news. “Migrants are the true victims of the pandemic: up until a few months ago they were considered the emergency, but now they have disappeared from the news,” the newspaper tweeted Wednesday. #13maggio I #migranti sono le vere vittime della #pandemia: fino a pochi mesi fa erano considerati l’emergenza, ora invece sono scomparsi dalle cronache. Ne parla Roberto Cetera in un articolo intitolato “I dimenticati della pandemia”. Sul quotidiano di oggi pomeriggio@bobcetera — L’Osservatore Romano (@oss_romano) May 13, 2020  The tweet was referencing an article by Roberto Cetera titled “The Forgotten Ones of the Pandemic,” published in Thursday’s issue of the paper. “Three months ago, immigrants were improperly considered the emergency,” the article begins. “Then when a real emergency landed to shake up the peaceful lives of many of us, they were not simply downgraded, they were disappeared. We are speaking about migrants, the invisible, forgotten, anonymous victims of the pandemic.” In his article, Mr. Cetera cites at length Bishop Guerino Di Tora, president of Migrantes, a Church-run pastoral foundation headquartered in Rome dealing with matters of immigration. “The pandemic has put us in a position to do without their services, and we have gotten rid of them, as we do with waste,” Bishop Di Tora declares. “The main problem we see is the loss of the jobs of many migrants, in the agricultural sector, but especially in the area of family services and care for the elderly,” the bishop insists. “It is not just a question of restrictions on mobility, which in theory have never been applicable for care-givers and domestic workers,” he notes. “Rather, to avoid any possible risk of contagion from outside, many families have decided to do without their help.” Migrants wearing face masks to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, board an airplane bound for Britain at the Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport in Athens, on Monday, May 11, 2020. Sixteen asylum-seeking minors and 34 migrants were relocated as part of a migrant reunification plan agreed between the two countries. (AP Photo/Thanassis Stavrakis) “Worse still,” he adds, “many domestic workers are paid under the table and the fear of many employers was that if their workers were caught at the stop checks and declared the address of the place of work where they were headed, they could have run the risk of being denounced to the INPS [social security], so they were let go overnight, without any compensation.” “Perhaps the situation is even worse in agriculture, in the harvesting of tomatoes and seasonal produce, because in the widespread situations of exploitation and gang masters, a new threat is added: ‘either you accept the little bit that we give you or you leave,’” the bishop said. “The blackmail works especially in the case of undocumented workers, who obviously do not benefit from any of the forms of economic support launched by the government for this phase of the emergency.” Follow @tdwilliamsrome

Few games on the 2020 college football schedule sparked more interest than the highly anticipated matchup between the USC Trojans and the Alabama Crimson Tide. Well, it appears those anticipations need to be reevaluated. According to a report from FS1’s Colin Cowherd, the game between the Tide and the Trojans “isn’t happening.” “Told by two people I trust — USC v Alabama isn’t happening,” Cowherd said. “Trojans can’t even practice in LA potentially for several months. This is why Bama already talking to other possible opponents. “Not official but understood,” Cowherd concluded. “The game’s currently scheduled for Sept. 5 at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas … but with the Pac-12’s home schools’ states still imposing some of the most strict stay-at-home orders in the nation … the game is in serious jeopardy,” TMZ Sports reports. On Tuesday, it was reported that stay-at-home orders for Los Angles County – home to both USC and UCLA – would be extended all the way through July. With conditions like that in place, it’s fair to speculate whether any Los Angeles-based schools will be able to play football this year at all. However, despite the stay-at-home orders, USC Athletic Director Mike Bohn said on Tuesday that the Trojans “have every intention of playing our game against Alabama.” “I’d like to remind all our fans that this is an uncertain time and there will be much disinformation,” Bohn said. “We continue to explore every model for the 2020 football season.” Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn

The Depression-era dream of a chicken in every pot got easier to achieve in April. But if you were hoping for a roast instead, it is going to cost you. The Department of Labor’s Producer Price Index showed that overall prices fell by far more than expected, dropping 1.3 percent in April. The Producer Price index measures prices received by businesses at intermediate and final stages of production and sales rather than the prices paid by consumers, which is measured by the Consumer Price Index. Over time, the two indexes tend to follow the same trajectory. Now both are showing strong deflationary signals. The details of the producer index contain even more surprises, showing just how much the coronavirus has disrupted economic activity in the United States. Start with food. The price of beef and veal jumped 12.6 percent in April, while the price of chickens dropped 8.4 percent. The price of fresh eggs soared 31.8 percent. So maybe opt for a grapefruit for breakfast instead: the price of fresh fruit dropped 10.5 percent. Dairy products fell 4.4 percent Prices for passenger cars and light trucks also declined. Rental car prices fell by 20.5 percent. Recreational vehicles and campers actually held their ground but margins for those selling them crashed 15.1 percent. On-site business spending has obviously crashed. Communications equipment prices fell three-tenths of a percentage point, as did office and store equipment. Electronic components and equipment dropped 1.4 percent. Commercial furnishings prices fell six-tenths. Home furniture prices, on the other hand, rose three-tenths, suggesting higher demand for furniture from Americans sheltering at home. Household appliance prices rose 0.6 percent. Computer prices were flat, resisting the overall direction of prices. Margins for retailers rose 5.1 percent. This likely indicates a rise in demand from workers upgrading their home computers and software to accommodate working from home. Wall Street is not getting wealthy from the coronavirus. Brokerage and investment services prices fell 7.4 percent. Portfolio management prices declined 12 percent. Life insurance was flat. Management consulting prices declined 3.2 percent. Demand for dental care is likely falling, as evienced by a price decline of 0.3 percent. Prices for x-ray type equipment fell one-tenth of a percentage point. Hospital outpatient care prices fell by nine-tenths of a percentage point while in-patient prices rose by five-tenths.    

Less than a week after China’s state-run China Daily censored a column written by a group of European ambassadors, less than three months after three of its correspondents were ejected from Beijing over an op-ed the regime didn’t like, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) handed over an op-ed page to Xie Feng, commissioner of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong.  Xie used the WSJ’s editorial space to repeat China’s political narrative of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. The European ambassadors saw the English-language version of their op-ed edited, without their consent, to remove an oblique reference to the “outbreak of the coronavirus in China.” The Chinese-language version was censored in its entirety. The Chinese Foreign Ministry, on the other hand, was given free reign in the WSJ to praise China, castigate those who demand a full investigation of the virus’ origins, and claim efforts to hold the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) accountable are preventing the world from coming together to fight the disease. Among the many bitter ironies of Xie’s op-ed is that he comes very close to making the same statement that got the European ambassadors censored by his tyrannical government: “In early 2020, caught in the Covid-19 outbreak, Wuhan, a transport hub of 11 million people in China’s Hubei province, locked itself down for 76 days. Making tremendous sacrifice against all the odds, it created a strong first line of defense for China and the world.”  The Europeans did not even mention the city of Wuhan. The CCP is evidently nervous about people noticing that it seeks to use the pandemic it unleashed to expand its political and economic influence because its WSJ piece took pains to deny that it wishes to do exactly that. Of course, Beijing cannot help it if people around the world notice that its cooked books and endless obfuscations make Chinese Communism look so superior to free-market democracy that they want to give authoritarianism a try: While China never intends to export its system or model, its efficiency, spirit and sense of responsibility in the lifesaving battle against Covid-19 should be obvious. But some have started rumors that the coronavirus was produced synthetically in China. Social media amplifies these falsehoods. Tasuku Honjo, a Japanese Nobel Laureate from Kyoto University, was forced to issue a public statement denying that he had claimed the virus had been “manufactured in China.” Some American politicians touted evidence—none of which has been produced—that the novel virus originated in a Wuhan laboratory. But even the Trump administration’s own scientists, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, have dismissed such theories. Identifying the virus’s origin is a serious scientific issue. It is up to scientists to research and draw evidence-based conclusions. Politicians shouldn’t meddle in the process, much less stigmatize others. Beijing is aggressively blocking every attempt to organize a fair international investigation of the coronavirus, even from organizations that are notoriously solicitous of the CCP’s feelings, like the World Health Organization (W.H.O.).  No sooner had the Foreign Ministry’s article gone live at the WSJ than China slapped 80 percent tariffs on Australian barley and banned beef imports to punish the Aussies for daring to demand a probe into the origins of the Wuhan virus. Xie did his best to muddy the waters and credit China for discovering the virus and warning the world about the threat it posed, sweeping the CCP’s endless lies and obfuscations about the virus under the rug. He also pushed the latest CCP propaganda line that hassling China about the origins of the virus could make fighting the pandemic more difficult because it will scare people away from reporting it: Outbreaks have occurred world-wide, and there is dispute about where the virus first appeared. A pneumonia of unknown origin with flulike symptoms was seen in some countries in late 2019. According to recent research by University College London’s Genetics Institute, the pandemic may have started sometime between Oct. 6 and Dec 11. A growing number of countries have found that their assumed “patient zero” had not traveled to China and that the local dominant strains of the virus are different from those in China. China was the first to spot and report the outbreak, identify the pathogen, and share its genome sequence with the World Health Organization and the rest of the world. Yet China has been accused of coverups and delays and put in the dock. At the same time, those who failed to test, report and act in a timely fashion are passing judgment on others. Isn’t it a bit ironic? As the timeline changes and possible cases are discovered in other countries that predate those found in China, some are anxious to shift the blame instead of reflecting on their own failures in the virus’s early days. Was it because they lacked the techniques, or perhaps a sense of responsibility? Could there have been any undercounting or even coverup? Should a country be labeled as the origin of the virus, held accountable and made to pay for others’ inept responses simply because it was the first to report what it found? If so, what country will be willing to test people and honestly report the findings in the future? Among the many problems with this argument is that China and the world’s other authoritarian regimes are already lying with mad abandon about their coronavirus outbreaks. Iran, Syria, North Korea, and every other despotism have been slow to admit outbreaks and quick to cover up the full extent of infections and deaths. Iranian doctors are reaching out to foreign media organizations to charge the regime in Tehran with risking their lives and murdering their colleagues by lying about the epidemic. It is not unreasonable to wonder if every dictator in the world got the idea they could lie about the coronavirus to mitigate its political damage by watching Beijing get away with it. “Fighting Covid-19 should be everyone’s first concern. The enemy is the virus. Scapegoating China will neither make up for the time that has been lost, nor save the lives that are at risk. We are teammates in this battle, not rivals,” Xie wrote in his conclusion, a declaration that would come as news to the Australians this morning.  Communist China does not seem interested in treating Taiwan, author of the world’s best coronavirus response plan, as a “teammate,” either, unless constant threats of lethal violence are the epitome of team spirit.

Thieves in Manchester, England raided a coronavirus charity supply depot, stealing an estimated £10,000 worth donated items meant to be delivered to vulnerable people during the crisis. Essential items such as food, diapers, and even children’s suncream were stolen during the robbery over the bank holiday weekend. The supplies had been gathered through donations to the Covaid-19 appeal charity that aims to help the less fortunate residents of the city. The chair of the Greater Manchester Mayor’s Charity, Tim Heatley said that it was a “real kick in the teeth” when the charity workers opened the depot on Monday to discover that it was “ransacked”. “We’ve been working 24/7 with our staff and volunteers and when we saw that there was a bank holiday coming up we thought it would great opportunity to have a bit of a break,” Heatley told the Evening Standard. “Whilst it was closed for a couple of days we think a very organised gang of thieves broke in and systematically removed boxes of produce and equipment,” he said. Heatley lamented that the criminals targeted high priced items in the robbery, saying that they were “clever” in that they went after products that were easy to re-sell. “We’re hopeful that with the generosity of the Manchester public and businesses we will be able to get back to where we were,” he concluded. Oxygen Thieves: Criminals Steal Crucial Gas Canisters from Hospital https://t.co/7IvoGMGpMT — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 24, 2020  While crime overall has slumped in the UK during the national lockdown, thieves have used the crisis as an opportunity to profit by reselling items at inflated rates on the black market. Last week, in the Manchester suburb of Salford, thieves stole 80,000 PPE masks meant to go to frontline medical staff and care homes for the elderly. The gang targeted high-quality n95 respirator worth an estimated £166,000 — while leaving lower value items behind. “This is a particularly sickening crime when you consider that the PPE was intended for the NHS and for care home workers and at a time when we are trying to protect the NHS and one another against one common enemy in Covid-19,” said Det Insp Chris Mannion. “Clearly there’s an open market there and there’s any number of ways that these people can sell on the goods stolen from here,” Mannion said. Similar coronavirus thefts have occurred across the European continent, with thieves stealing 50,000 surgical masks from a hospital storage facility in Cologne, Germany in March.

Police in Zimbabwe have arrested more than 26,000 people over the past two months for violating lockdown restrictions imposed in response to the Chinese coronavirus outbreak, police revealed this week. The figures were announced in a statement from the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) on Monday where they urged members of the public to continue abiding by lockdown and social distancing measures. They are also arresting and fining individuals caught in public without wearing a mask. “A total of 26,398 people have so far been arrested for violating the national lockdown regulations mainly for unnecessary movements,” the statement read. “We urge the public to stay at home, save for those who have been exempted to provide essential services like medical, mining, and retail sectors.” They added that there are many people are ignoring regulations and going about their lives and activities as normal. “There are still those who are conducting businesses without exemptions,” they continued. “Some are still engaging in unsanctioned gatherings which include conducting church services, parties, and drinking beer during the night. Some are still operating shebeens.” Under the current rules, Zimbabweans are only allowed to go out for groceries or other essential activities within a five-kilometer radius of their home. “Replenishing of supplies should be done at the nearest shops or within a five-kilometer radius and gathering for the purpose of consuming alcohol at shopping or private residents is illegal,” the ZRP added. “The police will arrest all those who violate the law.” Police in Zimbabwe are notoriously corrupt. Last month, local media reported that officers were soliciting bribes at coronavirus checkpoints, regardless of whether people were following the necessary regulations. Given the extreme poverty across the once-prosperous African nation caused almost entirely by the late socialist dictator Robert Mugabe and his successor Emerson Mnangagwa, it is of little surprise that people are not abiding by the lockdown measures. With most Zimbabweans living day to day, the new rules have made it almost impossible for millions of workers to maintain a steady income. As a result, many people are facing extreme hunger and plummeting living conditions in a country already infamous for widespread food shortages and poor standards of living. Zimbabwe is one of many African nations to have close links with China, with the two countries sharing the same “anti-imperialist” vision of general hostility to the West. However, many Zimbabwean people have expressed suspicion of the several coronavirus aid packages sent by Beijing in an attempt to reduce the global backlash against the Chinese Communist Party. Poor countries around the world are all struggling under the pressure of the effective closure of their economies. Over recent weeks, the United Nations has warned that the economic devastation caused by lockdown measures may kill more people than the disease itself. “Lockdowns and economic recession are expected to lead to a major loss of income among the working poor,” David Beasley, the executive director of the U.N.’s World Food Program, said in a briefing last month. “In a worst-case scenario, we could be looking at famine in about three dozen countries, and in fact, in ten of these countries, we already have more than one million people per country who are on the verge of starvation. In many places, human suffering is the heavy price of conflict,” he continued. Follow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com

Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó invited ambassadors from the Scandinavian countries to a meeting after their foreign ministers signed a letter slamming Hungary’s Wuhan coronavirus response. Szijjártó accused Denmark, Finland, Iceland Norway and Sweden of “spreading false news” about Hungary’s coronavirus lockdown measures and stated on social media platform Facebook that he would be calling all the ambassadors to the foreign ministry Tuesday. “We are moving on, but let us make one thing clear now: Hungarians are a nation more than a thousand years old, and it does not ask for this pathetically hypocritical patronising,” he said. “Don’t think of the Danish, Icelandic, Finnish, Norwegian or Swedish Foreign Ministers know better than Hungarians what is good for Hungarians. Leave it to us, the Hungarian people can decide what they want and what they don’t want. And they should take care of their own business,” he added. Parties Call for Orban’s Fidesz to Be Expelled from Largest EU Parliament Political Bloc https://t.co/UjJ1kzx2Gc — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 3, 2020  The letter signed by the Nordic countries expressed agreement with statements made by Secretary-General of the Council of Europe Marija Pejcinovic Buric, who said, “An indefinite and uncontrolled state of emergency cannot guarantee that the basic principles of democracy will be observed.” A debate on the state of Hungary’s rule of law and democracy is scheduled to take place on Wednesday in the European Parliament. The coronavirus measures implemented by Hungary have been slammed by many who have been prior critics of the country, including members of the European People’s Party (EPP), the European Parliament group Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s Fidesz is a member. In early April, thirteen EPP members signed a letter demanding that Fidesz be kicked out of the centre-right parliamentary group, the largest in the EU parliament.

Fidesz is currently suspended from the EPP due to its failure to respect the principle of rule of law. However, the recent developments have confirmed our conviction that Fidesz, with its current policies, cannot enjoy full membership in the EPP,” the letter argued. Others have gone even further, including former United States UN Ambassador Susan Rice who demanded that Hungary be removed from the European Union entirely.

PHOENIX — Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey has opened the door for professional sports to return to the state. Ducey said Tuesday that professional sports, including MLB, the NBA, the NHL and the NFL, can resume without fans Saturday. The state is starting to reopen during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, with Ducey saying on social media that Arizona is “trending in the right direction.” The governor said he has had discussions with “leaders of some of these leagues” but did not say which ones or elaborate on what activities might take place in Arizona. Last month, he said he had spoken with Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred and was open to hosting games. Other sports such as basketball and hockey have considered playing the remainder of their regular seasons in hubs, with several teams playing in one location. “It would be, at this point in time, according to the CDC guidelines, without fans,” Ducey said at a news conference. Citing his public health director, he said, “We could do that safely in the state of Arizona beginning May 16.”

A top Democrat from the important swing county of Macomb in Michigan is criticizing Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) and her handling of the coronavirus shutdown. Mark Hackel, the elected county executive, told WDIV that Whitmer needs to “ease up” on her executive orders keeping much of the state shuttered and many Michiganders out of work. Democrat Macomb County executive unimpressed with @GovWhitmer's plan, urges her to ease up on stay-at-home order #migov #michigancoronavirus @clickondetroit pic.twitter.com/b1gadJL3IU — Michigan Rising Action (@MIRisingAction) May 13, 2020  WDIV reporter Rod Meloni noted the state’s goal was to “flatten the curve,” which has been done. “And now the goal post has been moved to something he doesn’t even recognize,” Meloni said of Hackel. “Why are we still pushing forward with this nonessential opening in a slow, progressive sort of way?” Hackel said. According to Local 4, Hackel was “unimpressed” with Whitmer’s six-stage reopening plan. “Let’s be honest, once it came out, nobody paid attention to it or is looking at it anymore,” he said. Hackel said he gets many calls from business owners who are confused by the multi-step chart and just want to know when they can reopen. He wondered exactly what data Whitmer is using to make her decisions. “What is it we’re looking for?” he said. “What is the number? Is there a percentage? Is there a percentage less of people getting sick?” He wondered what Whitmer is looking for. “I don’t think anybody has that answer,” he said. Meloni said that Hackel “wants to be very clear that the state can open safely.” “They want to do it. They want to do it now,” Meloni said. On Monday, Detroit state Rep. Leslie Love (D) criticized Whitmer’s nursing home policy, which required seniors who test positive for coronavirus be kept in the same facility or transferred to “regional hubs.” “To return seniors into an environment, seniors with the virus still recovering from the virus, into an environment with, well, seniors, just didn’t seem — it’s not a good idea,” Love said. “That would break my heart because I’ve been on the front lines of this, trying to make sure our seniors — my mother, your mother, anybody else’s mother — does not get sick and die from this, particularly if they’re in a nursing home,” she said.

The NFL has three teams in California, and they’re keeping open the possibility of moving them if California’s lockdown continues into the regular season. The question of whether the NFL would relocate California teams (specifically Los Angeles teams) was posed to NFL Spokesman Brian McCarthy by Gilbert Manzano of the Southern California News Group. Though McCarthy did not say that the NFL would move the teams, he also declined to rule it out. “We are preparing to play the 2020 NFL season as scheduled and with increased protocols and safety measures for all players, personnel and attendees,” McCarthy said. “This includes games at SoFi Stadium. We will be prepared to make adjustments as necessary, as we have during this offseason, demonstrating that we can safely and efficiently conduct key activities, such as free agency, the virtual offseason program, and the 2020 NFL Draft. “We will continue to make decisions based on the latest advice of medical and public health officials, as well as in full compliance with current and future government regulations. Our primary focus will be on protecting the health of our fans, players, club and league personnel and our communities.” The question stems from a Tuesday report which claimed that the stay-at-home protection orders for Los Angeles County would be extended, “with all certainty,” through July. The Rams practice in Ventura County and the Chargers practice in Orange County. So, their offseason programs and facilities wouldn’t necessarily be impacted by the order. However, the new SoFi Stadium where both teams intend to play, is located in Los Angeles County. Still, as Pro Football Talk points out, it won’t be hard finding alternate venues for California teams. 49ers General Manager John Lynch has reportedly already begun looking for out-of-state sites to hold offseason activities.

Facebook has blacklisted the page “Michiganders Against Excessive Quarantine,” a group with over 380,000 members that served as a central organizing hub for protests against Michigan’s Chinese virus lockdown. Garrett Soldano, one of the leaders of the Michigan protests, said on his Twitter account that the group has created a new Facebook page, called “Stand Up Michigan.” “They just shut us down. We have a new page. Here’s the new one https://www.facebook.com/standupmi/” said Soldano in a post on Twitter. “Invite invite invite. We will not be shut down!” They just shut us down.

Stephanopoulos asked Zuckerberg how the company deals “with the fact that Facebook is now being used to organize a lot of these protests to defy social distancing guidelines in states. If somebody trying to organize something like that, does that qualify as harmful misinformation?” “We do classify that as harmful misinformation and we take that down,” confirmed Zuckerberg, while at the same time saying that it’s important “that people can debate policies.” Soldano’s new page, Stand Up Michigan, has so far accumulated over 27,000 followers.

LOS ANGELES, California — Dozens of surfers flocked to Los Angeles County beaches as they opened, officially, on Wednesday morning for recreation. The surf conditions happened to be unusually good, drawing more surfers than usual to the Pacific Ocean. This reporter counted roughly 60 surfers at the break at Sunset Point Beach. At one point, a pod of bottlenose dolphins swam past. A seal also made a cameo appearance among the surfers. Bottlenose dolphins swim by surfers off Sunset Point (Joel Pollak / Breitbart News) The question of access to beaches has been a contentious one in the midst of state and local stay-at-home orders during the coronavirus pandemic. Governor Gavin Newsom clashed with local authorities in Orange County, who had kept beaches open for recreation throughout the pandemic, drawing large numbers of people on a particularly hot weekend in late April. San Diego County allowed beaches to reopen last Monday, with discretion allowed for local authorities to close them. Surfers in Los Angeles never really disappeared, but they tended to be active in the early morning, before police arrived. The Los Angeles Times reported that beaches in the county would be open for recreation, but not sitting or sunbathing: “Permitted activities will include running, walking, swimming and surfing. Group sports like volleyball are prohibited.” Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti scrambled Tuesday afternoon to contain the damage after a county official announced that stay-at-home restrictions would be extended for three months. Garcetti called into CNN to clarify that some restrictions would be lifted, in coordination with the state government, while other restrictions would likely remain in place. Joel B.

At least Russian five patients on ventilators in an intensive care unit (ICU) because of the Chinese coronavirus died in a fire at a hospital in St. Petersburg on Tuesday. The blaze, which began on the sixth floor of St. George’s Hospital as a result of short-circuit malfunction on one of the ventilators, killed five people on ventilators and led to the evacuation of around 150 people. It is unclear how many people were injured. “The ventilators are working to their limits. Preliminary indications are that it was overloaded and caught fire, and that was the cause,” a source at the city’s emergency department told the Interfax news agency, according to the BBC. The fire was eventually neutralized and most of the hospital remained unaffected, the head doctor, Valery Strizheletsky, told a local television station. “Everything is more or less calm now,” he said. “We didn’t have to evacuate anyone to other hospitals.”  The fire is said to have broken out in a specific ward where four of the casualties took place. A fifth patient died in a neighboring ward. “Investigators are working to establish the cause of death of the fifth patient,” the country’s prosecutors’ office said in a statement. The country’s investigative committee announced a criminal probe on charges of death by negligence, as well an official probe into fire safety standards at the facility. Medical authorities have also suspended the use of some models of ventilators while the issue is being investigated.  The fire came just a few days after a separate incident took place at a Moscow hospital, in which one person was also killed. Similarly, there were reports that a faulty ventilator was also the cause of the fire. It is not currently clear where the faulty ventilators came from. Some reports indicate that they were manufactured in Russia, yet President Vladimir Putin has admitted to shortages of medical resources, and the country has both sent and received equipment from China and other parts of the world. Since the beginning of the outbreak, Beijing has exported medical equipment around the world in an act of supposed solidarity, although much of it has been found to be faulty or not functioning whatsoever. There are significant concerns with Russian model ventilators in the rest of the world, as well. According to Bloomberg, Aventa-M ventilators were sent from Russia to the United States at the peak of its spread, although hospitals decided against using them because of issues with the voltage. A Russian Emergency Situation worker disinfects a woman near the scene of a fire at St. George Hospital in St. Petersburg, Russia. The blaze killed five coronavirus patients.

(AP Photo/Dmitry Lovetsky) The tragedy underlines the immense failures by the Russian government in their response to the coronavirus pandemic, with many doctors complaining of a lack of personal protective equipment as well as a shortage of ventilators. Last week, the United States revealed plans to donate ventilators to support the country’s efforts. As of Tuesday, Russia has confirmed around 233,000 cases of the virus, the third-highest number of anywhere in the world, but just 2,116 deaths, a mysteriously low number compared to similar countries. Last week, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin warned that the official figures were almost certainly incorrect and could be three times as high as reported. He added that a citywide lockdown would be extended till at least 31st May. Follow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.

AP BERLIN – The German government is recommending that a requirement for people arriving from other countries in Europe to self-quarantine for 14 days be dropped. Germany last month imposed a requirement for all people arriving in the country to go straight home and stay there for two weeks, except those who were on very short trips, commuting to their jobs, transporting goods or in some other essential functions. A court in the northern state of Lower Saxony suspended the rule for that region this week. Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said Wednesday he is recommending that state governments, which are responsible for quarantines, drop the requirement for travelers from other European countries but maintain it for arrivals from other nations such as the United States and Russia. The comment came as Seehofer said Germany will start loosening checks on its borders with some neighbors this weekend – though he said controls will be stepped back up if infections rise strongly in neighboring countries.

Paul Manafort, the former chairman of President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, has been released from jail to serve the rest of his sentence at his home due to health concerns stemming from the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, according to a report. ABC News reports: Manafort was released from FCI Loretto in central Pennsylvania early Wednesday morning, the two sources said. When reached by ABC News a lawyer for Manafort declined to comment on the matter. The Bureau of Prisons also did not immediately respond to a request for comment. […] The decision to move Manafort to home confinement comes after his attorneys wrote a letter to the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) last month requesting that he be immediately transferred to home confinement because he is at high risk of contracting COVID-19 because of his age and pre-existing conditions. “We write on behalf of our client to request that the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) immediately transfer Mr. Manafort to home confinement to serve the remainder of his sentence or, alternatively, for the duration of the on-going COVID-19 pandemic in accordance with Attorney General William Barr’s directives to the BOP on March 26 and April 3, 2020, and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”), enacted on March 27, 2020,” Manafort lawyers Todd Blanche and Kevin Downing wrote in an April letter obtained by ABC News. The development comes after Manafort was briefly hospitalized in Pennsylvania in December when he suffered a “cardiac event” in prison, ABC News reported. Manafort was convicted last year on tax, bank fraud, and conspiracy charges as part of then-special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into now-debunked Russia collusion with the Trump campaign and is serving a seven-and-a-half-year sentence. Shortly after being charged in the Mueller probe, Manafort was also charged for mortgage fraud in New York, though a judge has since dismissed the charges.

President Donald Trump will visit Pennsylvania on Thursday, as Democrat Gov. Tom Wolf struggles to maintain draconian coronavirus lockdowns. Wolf threatened heavy consequences on Monday for some counties that threatened to reopen on Friday, despite being ordered to wait until June. “We are fighting a war that has taken the lives of too many people. And we’re winning,” Wolf wrote on Twitter. “The politicians who are encouraging us to quit the fight are acting in a most cowardly way.” But Wolf’s increasingly draconian tone has sparked calls for impeachment as Pennsylvania citizens wait to see if he will deliver on his punishing threats. The power struggle continues between local and state Republicans and Trump supporters and Gov. Wolf, who refuses to loosen his grip on protesting counties. President Trump will visit a medical equipment distributor on Thursday outside of Allentown, Pennsylvania, as he continues to talk about the war against the coronavirus and the importance of reopening the country.  The White House did not comment on the record to Breitbart News about the president’s message to Pennsylvania, but a spokesperson told local media that the president plans to deliver remarks about coronavirus testing. Trump’s visit also signals the fight to keep Pennsylvania in 2020, a state key to his stunning upset victory against Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016. Recent polls show former Vice President Joe Biden is leading the state by 6-8 points. Pennsylvania Trump supporters will be watching for signs of support for their rebellion against their Democrat governor. The president weighed in on Monday, criticizing Democrats in the state for playing politics with the lockdowns. “The great people of Pennsylvania want their freedom now, and they are fully aware of what that entails,” Trump wrote on Twitter. On Friday, Trump criticized Gov. Wolf’s handling of the coronavirus lockdowns after meeting with Pennsylvania Republicans Rep. Scott Perry and Rep. Guy Reschenthaler. “What the Democrats are doing in Pennsylvania is a disgrace,” he said.

The crowdfunding campaign to launch a legal challenge of the UK government’s lockdown policy has raised over £100,000 – some of it the result of a huge spike in donations during Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s lacklustre Sunday night address to the nation. Simon Dolan, the multi-millionaire businessman and Le Mans racing champion behind the campaign, says that the British people have been ‘completely manipulated’ and that it’s no good removing the lockdown in stages as Boris announced on Sunday. “It’s time for us to lift the lockdown now,” he tells me. Since launching his Crowdjustice campaign last month, Dolan claims to have received hate mail, including death threats, from people apparently so terrified of Chinese coronavirus that they want the lockdown to continue indefinitely. But he fears the economic fallout of Boris’s lockdown policy is going to do far more damage than the coronavirus. At the moment, he says, lots of people think: “This furlough thing is fantastic because though I haven’t got my job now because of this invisible silent killer from China… so my wages are guaranteed and it’s lovely.” But this will change in 12 months’ time when reality bites and businesses need to find some way to pay back a mountain of accumulated debt — the worst since the Second World War — and people realise their job losses are permanent. Dolan’s concern is that the British have been steered to disaster on a false prospectus. His Judicial Review will ask: He anticipates a tough battle which he believes is more likely to be “won in the media than the courtroom.” Indeed, he argues, its benefits are already being felt as the government is pressured into disclosing the rationales behind its decision making. “If you’re asking the British people to do something so costly to life and the economy then why are you keeping back the information you relied on to make that decision?” Dolan is particularly concerned by evidence that the British people have been manipulated into their state of hysteria — “I’m disappointed. It thought they had more backbone” — by the sly propaganda of the government’s behavioural units.

Under the heading ‘Persuasion’, the document says: “Perceived threat. A substantial number of people still do not feel sufficiently personally threatened…The perceived level of personal threat needs to be increased among those who are complacent, using hard-hitting emotional messaging.” The full interview with Dolan – who also talks about how he made his £140 million fortune, his racing driving career, his prediction that the EU is close to collapse, life in Monaco, and the likely economic winners and losers of this crisis – can be heard here .

In the first three months of 2020, the British economy contracted at the fastest rate since the 2008 financial collapse, despite coronavirus lockdown measures only being implemented in the final week of March. The first quarter of the year saw a 2 per cent fall in GDP in the UK, the worst fall since the final quarter of 2008. The decline was driven in large part by March, which alone saw a record 5.8 per cent drop in GDP. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that the economy saw “widespread” declines in the service, manufacturing and construction industries, with the service sector falling by 1.9 per cent, production by 2.1 per cent, and construction by 2.6 per cent. “This is the largest quarterly contraction since the global financial crisis and reflects the imposing of public health restrictions and voluntary social distancing put in place in response to the Covid-19 pandemic,” the ONS said. A senior UK economist at Capital Economics, Ruth Gregory told the BBC that the economic data shows that the economy was “already in freefall within two weeks of the lockdown going into effect”. “With the restrictions in place until mid-May and then only lifted very slightly, April will be far worse,” she warned. UK Faces ‘Permanent Scarring’ to the Economy with Nearly 12 Million out of Work by the Summer https://t.co/8MKoL7d4uL — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 21, 2020  The government has eased some of the national lockdown measures, saying that businesses that are “allowed to be open, should be open”. However, trade unions across the country have vowed to tell their nearly 3 million members to remain home until the government enacts “the right policies and practices are in place to make workplaces safe”. The UK is also facing a massive budget deficit, as the country continues to pour money into propping up the fledgeling economy. A confidential Treasury Department document that was seen by the British newspaper The Telegraph labelled “Official – market sensitive”, claimed that the under the “base case scenario” the government is now expecting a £337 billion budget deficit this year, up from the £55 billion that was projected in the March budget. Under the worst-case scenario, the government projects that the deficit could rise to as high as £516 billion with a five year budget hit of £1.19 trillion. The document advised Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, to cut public spending and increase taxes, to raise £25 billion and £30 billion per year in order to “stabilise debts” — a move that would go against the 2019 Conservative Party general election manifesto, which promised to not raise taxes.

COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) – The world´s biggest shipping company, Denmark´s A.P. Moller-Maersk, said Wednesday that it expects its transport volumes to drop by up to 25% in the second quarter as the world economy slides toward recession. CEO Soeren Skou said that the group was “strongly positioned to weather the storm” but that the COVID-19 crisis had had “a significant impact” on its activities. The group presented its first quarter results, which showed revenue edged down to $9.6 billion from $9.5 billion for the same period last year. It booked a profit of $209 million, up from a loss of $656 million. In a statement, the group said its full-year outlook contained “high uncertainties,” and the global container demand “is expected to contract in 2020 due to COVID-19.” It previously was for growth of 1-3%.

The Catholic Church in England and Wales has released a statement accusing the government of failing to recognize the “spiritual needs” of the people in its plan to relax restrictions put in place to curb the spread of the coronavirus. “The timing and the manner of the opening of churches touches profound sensitivities and spiritual needs. The Government’s document and statements fail to recognize this,” said the Catholic Bishops’ Conference for England and Wales. As has happened in other countries, the UK government has judged the spiritual needs of the population to be “non-essential” in its consideration of when and how to re-open churches for prayer and public worship. Thus, in Monday’s 20,000-word plan to gradually release the United Kingdom from its lockdown restrictions, the government has said that as of Wednesday, sectors of the economy that are allowed to be open should be open, which includes “food production, construction, manufacturing, logistics, distribution and scientific research in laboratories.” “The only exceptions to this are those workplaces such as hospitality and non-essential retail which during this first step the Government is requiring to remain closed.” While manufacturing and research and even recreation are immediately rebooted, however, no such provisions are made for the spiritual needs of the population, which must wait nearly two months — until July 4 — to reopen, together with cinemas, pubs, and beauty salons. In their weakly worded protest, the UK bishops make no attempt to address the religious liberty issue at the base of the categorization of sacramental life as “non-essential,” but instead continue to offer conciliatory words aimed more at appeasement than confrontation. “The Government’s position, established today, includes these steps aimed at opening churches as soon as possible: the establishment of a task force for places of worship, to work closely with ‘stakeholders’ in ensuring that premises are COVID-19 secure; and heeding the experience of other countries in which churches are already open for worship,” the bishops note. “In dialogue with the Government, the Catholic Church will continue its engagement in this process and has already submitted a detailed plan, in full accordance with public health guidelines, for churches to be opened for private prayer,” they state. “The Church is ready to play its full part in the task force, understanding that this includes the possible earlier use of churches for private prayer, as a first safe step towards their use for public worship,” they conclude. As a point of comparison, Italy — among the first countries hard hit by the coronavirus — never closed churches for private worship and will reopen public Masses for participation by the faithful on May 18.

A 47-year-old mother died weeks after a man who claimed to have the Chinese coronavirus spat and coughed at her while she was working at a railway station in London. On March 22, Belly Mujinga, a railway ticket office worker, was assaulted alongside her colleague by a man while the two were on duty at London Victoria station. The two women fell ill with symptoms of the coronavirus days after the attack. Describing the horrific attack, her husband, Lusamba Gode Katalay said per ITV: “The man asked her what she was doing, why she was there, and she said they were working. The man said he had the virus and spat on them. They reported it to their supervisor. Belly came home and told me everything.” Mujinga was hospitalised on April 2 and was put on a ventilator, yet tragically died three days after being admitted to the hospital. Her husband said that she had chronic respiratory issues prior to contracting the virus and had undergone an operation four years earlier. Mr Katalay said that the day she was hospitalised was the last day he saw his wife. “We just said: ‘Be good,’ and that God is in charge. We did a WhatsApp video in hospital, but then I didn’t hear from her again. I thought she might be asleep, but the doctor to phoned me to tell me she had died,” he said. Coronavirus: Man Arrested for Licking Handrail, Ticket Machines of Munich Subway https://t.co/4shkI4dszb — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 24, 2020  British Transport Police said that they have launched a criminal investigation into the incident. The attack was only recently reported to police, despite claims from Mrs Mujinga’s union, the Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA), that she and her co-worker had asked for the matter to be referred to police at the time of the attack. The TSSA also raised questions as to why Mrs Mujinga was working at the railway station at all with her underlying health issues and said that they are considering taking legal action over the matter. “As a vulnerable person in the ‘at risk’ category, and her condition known to her employer, there are questions about why she wasn’t stood down from frontline duties early on in this pandemic,” said Manuel Cortes of the TSSA. “Rather than talking about the easing the lockdown, the Government must first ensure that the right precautions and protections have been taken so that more lives are not lost,” Cortes added. In response to the tragic attack, a spokesperson for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “It is despicable for a key worker to be attacked in this way while serving the travelling public.” “Our thoughts are with Mrs Mujinga family’s at this terrible time,” the spokesperson added.

Nearly two-thirds of Italians now fear the country could see riots and social violence in the wake of the Wuhan coronavirus, while trust in politicians has reached single-digit lows. The alarming figures were published in a poll conducted by Euromedia Research this week, and claimed that 65 per cent of Italians feared that the country, especially in the north which has been the hardest hit region by the Chinese virus, could see social tensions and rioting in the country’s industrial heartlands. Alessandra Ghisleri, director of Euromedia Research, commented on the results saying, “After a hundred days of lockdown, Italians are beginning to be afraid: seven out of ten fear that the economic crisis will detonate social uprisings, especially in the North. Only five out of a hundred say they still have faith in politicians,” Il Giornale reports. “The real issue is that confidence in Italian politicians today is at 4.6 per cent,” Ghisleri said and referenced the “Vaffanculo-Days” (“Fuck-off Days”) that were organised by Five Star Movement founder Beppe Grillo in 2007 the last time Italian confidence in politicians was recorded as so low. 40 Per Cent of Italians Want to Leave The Euro and the European Union https://t.co/trFhJ4yOxB — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 24, 2020  “Which pushes us to strongly affirm that politics today must not chase consensus, but common sense,” she added. The polling also revealed that a majority of Italians were fearful of the economic impact of the coronavirus with 56.8 per cent saying they feared the economic situation in the country could get even worse as a result of the pandemic. The polling comes as Italians have also become far more sceptical of the European Union in recent weeks, following the lack of solidarity between member states during the coronavirus crisis. A poll released in late April revealed that at least 40 per cent of Italians thought their country would be better off outside the European Union. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has also sounded alarms on the subject saying, “If we do not seize the opportunity to put new life into the European project, the risk of failure is real.”

As the coronavirus lockdown eases across Australia, one brewer decided Wednesday the best way to get things moving again in the outback was to send free beer for pubs to disperse amongst their parched patrons. Lots of it. In the state of Queensland, the iconic XXXX brewery has donated 60 kegs of the amber nectar to bush pubs and social clubs hit hard by the combination of the drought and coronavirus lockdown, the Australian reports. “[It] will be travelling out west, over thousands of kilometres, going of course to places like Blackall, Barcaldine, Ilfracombe, Longreach — the list is endless,” Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said. “I’m quite sure there is going to be a lot of happy patrons, a lot of happy families.” From Saturday, outback pubs will be able to welcome 20 dine-in patrons, while those across the rest of Queensland can welcome ten, according to the Australian. The XXXX despatch comes just days after Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison authorized emergency beer convoys to aid in the national recovery, as Breitbart News reported. “I understand there’s a whole bunch of kegs on their way to Darwin as we speak, running up the highway — much eagerly anticipated, I’m sure,” Morrison told media in Canberra announcing the move. On Thursday, Northern Territory chief minister Michael Gunner welcomed the first shipment of 40,000 gallons of “the good stuff” with the promise of more to come. “The beers are here and the jobs are back,” Gunner said at a press conference surrounded by some freshly delivered supplies. Meanwhile, Australia’s coronavirus death toll reached 98 on Wednesday after an 81-year-old passenger on the Ruby Princess died in NSW. It’s the 22nd death from the coronavirus-plagued cruise ship. Nearly 7000 people in Australia have contracted the disease to date but there are fewer than 740 active cases.

On Tuesday’s “PBS NewsHour,” Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) stated that in the United States “there’s a shortage currently of antigen tests and of antibody tests.” Cassidy said, “I think there’s a shortage currently of antigen tests and of antibody tests. I suspect most people who want a swab up their nose can get it, but if you want to see if you’ve been previously infected, there is a shortage of those. And there’s also a shortage of antigen tests. But they showed numbers that are credible that they’re increasing in their volume.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

TEL AVIV – Likud MK Yuli Edelstein accepted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s appointment as health minister Tuesday evening. Edelstein, who served as Knesset speaker for seven consecutive years, will replace Yaavov Litzman who is due to become Housing Minister. Edelstein said he was honored to “lead the struggle against the coronavirus and prepare the health system for the new challenges.” Netanyahu said: “I am happy that Edelstein accepted my offer and chose this senior portfolio dealing with a critical challenge for Israel.” Edelstein will also be part of the security cabinet. Meanwhile, the Health Ministry’s director-general, Moshe Bar Siman-Tov, who led the coronavirus response, resigned earlier Tuesday. “With the establishment of the new government, I want to announce my resignation,” he said in a letter to Litzman. Bar Siman-Tov said he had achieved his goals with the coronavirus, including ensuring all COVID-19 patients received the best care. “We successfully completed these goals,” he said. He continued that he felt like the time was right to resign his post. “The country is returning to routine in the shadow of coronavirus. More and more activities, businesses, communities and personal pleasures are returning. The government recently rolled out a road map for a full return to routine, subject to the state of morbidity,” he said. Litzman hailed Bar Siman Tov “for his wonderful work, great investment and many achievements.” Bar Siman-Tov was a “full and active partner with me, as health minister, for five consecutive and intense years,” Litzman said. “We were required to make difficult decisions that led the State of Israel to victory in the fight against coronavirus… With God’s help and thanks to Bar Siman Tov’s resourcefulness and professional standards, we have managed the crisis so far, and I hope that this will continue and we reach a full victory soon,” he said.  

During an interview with Hill.TV’s “Rising,” on Tuesday, White House Coronavirus Task Force on the economy member Stephen Moore stated that the unemployment rate in the United States is “probably closer” to 20% and “could easily” hit 25%. Moore said, “The unemployment numbers are actually much worse than that headline number. Because they weren’t counting millions and millions of workers who have been furloughed, or workers who are getting paid but are not on the job. And so, we’re probably closer to a 20% unemployment rate right now. And it could easily climb to 25%, which would match the highest rate that we even saw during the Great Depression.” Moore added that while he thinks the summer will be “brutally bad. … I do think by the end of the summer, early fall, we’ll start to see a recovery. And once that recovery begins, I do think we could see a really good fourth quarter.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is proposing a two-year moratorium on a tax deduction enjoyed primarily by rich people in Democrat-run states — a deduction that President Donald Trump limited strictly in his 2017 tax reform law. The proposal is part of Pelosi’s $3 trillion, 1,815-page bill for a fourth phase of coronavirus relief, called the “Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act,” or the ‘‘HEROES Act.’’ The bill includes many other left-wing projects and priorities, from “ballot harvesting” to a $10 million boost to the National Endowment for the Arts. The deduction, known as the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction, allows taxpayers to deduct state and local taxes from their federal income tax bill. Historically, that has meant the wealthiest people in the states with the highest income, sales, and property tax rates — which tend to be governed by Democrats — have enjoyed the largest benefit from the deduction. But in 2017, President Trump and the Republicans capped the SALT deduction at $10,000. That raised taxes on wealthy people in “blue” states. (Contrary to what Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden, have claimed, President Trump’s tax reform actually lowered taxes for the middle class, while many wealthy people actually saw their taxes rise.) Democrats dislike the SALT deduction cap because it prevents “blue” states from passing on the burden of their high-tax policies to the federal taxpayers in general, and creates political pressure on profligate state governments to spend less. On page 224 of Pelosi’s bill, she proposes suspending the SALT deduction cap for two years, in 2020 and 2021. SALT deduction cap moratorium (Screenshot / House.gov) The moratorium would provide a massive windfall for millionaires and billionaires, whom Pelosi often claims to oppose: The Heroes Act would repeal the cap on the SALT deduction for 2 years.

On Tuesday’s broadcast of CNN International’s “Amanpour,” Donald McNeil Jr., a Science and Health Reporter for the New York Times called for the resignation of CDC Director Robert Redfield and sharply criticized the early coronavirus response. McNeil’s statements later earned a rebuke from the Times.  McNeil said, “We completely blew it for the first two months of our response. We were in a headless chicken phase, and yes, it’s the president’s fault. It is not China’s fault. You know, the head of the Chinese CDC was on the phone to Robert Redfield on January 1, again on January 8, and the two agencies were talking on January 19. The Chinese had a test on January 13. The Germans had a test on January 16. We fiddled around for two months. We had a test on March 5, and it didn’t work. We didn’t have 10,000 people tested until March 15. So, we lost two months there. And that was because of incompetent leadership at the CDC. I’m sorry to say, it’s a great agency. But it’s incompetently led. And I think Dr. Redfield should resign. And suppression from the top, I mean, the real coverup was the person in this country who was saying, you know, this is not an important virus. The flu is worse. It’s all going to go away. It’s nothing.” McNeil added, “I had the same problem at the Times. I was trying to convince my editors, this is really bad. This is a pandemic. It took a while to get them, it took a while to get anybody to believe this.” And that “getting rid of Alex Azar was a mistake. He was actually leading a dramatic response. And then…he was replaced with Mike Pence, who’s a sycophant.” He further stated that President Trump is “the same guy who said, inject yourself with disinfectant, stick ultraviolet lights into your lungs. This is not somebody whose grasp of the science is even third-grade level.” In a statement to Fox News, the Times stated, “In an interview with Christiane Amanpour today, Donald McNeil, Jr. went too far in expressing his personal views. His editors have discussed the issue with him to reiterate that his job is to report the facts and not to offer his own opinions. We are confident that his reporting on science and medicine for The Times has been scrupulously fair and accurate.” (h/t Fox News) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

The coronavirus pandemic originated in China, but evidence is mounting that once the Chinese Communist Party realized that the outbreak would cripple their economy, they knowingly allowed it to spread internationally in order to preserve their geopolitical dominance. Indeed, modeling suggests that had Beijing undertaken interventions to contain the virus one week, two weeks, or three weeks earlier, rather than embarking on an extensive cover-up of its spread, cases could have been reduced by 66 percent, 86 percent, and 95 percent, respectively, according to a study from the University of Southampton. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) notified the world in January 2020 that it had identified a new strain of coronavirus; however, publicly available cell phone data suggests the Chinese government had closed the roads around the Wuhan Institute of Virology in mid-October. If Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s assertion that “enormous evidence” exists that the Wuhan Institute of Virology played a role in the pandemic, these closures suggest the Communist Party were aware of something worth hiding there far before it announced it had discovered the new pathogen. Then they covered up the severity of it. On January 21, China’s communist leader Xi Jinping asked the World Health Organization to withhold information from the international community about the virus’ human to human transmission and to delay a pandemic warning, according to a report Der Spiegel reportedly obtained from Germany’s Federal Intelligence Service. The CCP didn’t lock down Wuhan until January 23, allowing an estimated 5 million people to leave the city. Two days later it banned group travel overseas, but also criticized other countries for following suit. When Australia and the United States banned arrivals from mainland China in early February, Chinese diplomats and officials blamed the two countries for being “insensitive” and “overreacting.” Meanwhile, Beijing was hoarding medical supplies. According to excerpts published by the Associated Press of an alleged Homeland Security intelligence report, China increased imports and decreased exports of medical supplies and tried to cover up doing so by “denying there were export restrictions and obfuscating and delaying provision of its trade data.” Then there is China’s gaslighting campaign. China has a history of lying to the international community on everything from its economic growth to its military spending, so this shouldn’t be a surprise; yet many mainstream media outlets have been allowing Chinese officials to print op-eds in their papers and publish Chinese propaganda aimed at sowing discord among Western Democracies. “It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan,” the spokesperson of the Chinese foreign ministry tweeted recently. “Be transparent! Make public your data! U.S. owe us an explanation!” It is China that owes the international community an explanation. The CCP still has not given international investigators access to the Wuhan lab since the virus’ outbreak, and it still hasn’t provided the U.S. State Department with coronavirus samples that would help determine the virus’ origin. The CCP has also expelled many U.S. journalists from the country, so little of what Beijing tells the international community is verifiable. We just must take the CCP’s word for it. China is also being strategic with the “help” it’s providing the world. Under Xi Jinping’s leadership, China has returned to its communist orthodoxies, constructed an unprecedented surveillance state, and has unveiled initiatives such as “Made in China 2025” and “Belt and Road” aimed at exerting its power and influence across the globe. Take, for example, the decision by China’s telecommunications giant Huawei to donate 800,000 masks to the Netherlands. Was it altruistic or was it motivated by the fact the Netherland’s 5G mobile licenses are set for June and the country still hasn’t decided whether to exclude Huawei from the bidding because of espionage concerns? Or take China’s support of Italy, where it has sent doctors and supplies. Rome is one of Europe’s biggest supporters of the Belt and Road initiative, where China has lent countries hundreds of billions of dollars for infrastructure initiatives. And some poorer countries are asking Beijing for debt relief as they grapple with the pandemic. China has a track record of taking assets if and when they go under, building influence beyond their borders. Moreover, as China tries to rebrand itself as a global humanitarian, much of the testing equipment it’s sending overseas is faulty – even as it sells the equipment at a premium for a hefty profit. Instead of taking responsibility, China blamed user error. Meanwhile, China requires all Chinese companies to collaborate in gathering intelligence. The party has reportedly tasked some Chinese students and scholars in the U.S. and at other foreign universities and research labs to steal the most cutting-edge life science knowledge, which includes coronavirus information. Last week, the United States and the United Kingdom issued a joint warning that “health care bodies, pharmaceutical companies, academia, medical research organizations and local governments” had been targeted for cybersecurity theft. As the New York Times reported this week, “The F.B.I. and the Department of Homeland Security are preparing to issue a warning that China’s most skilled hackers and spies are working to steal American research in the crash effort to develop vaccines and treatments for the coronavirus. The efforts are part of a surge in cybertheft and attacks by nations seeking advantage in the pandemic.” The global community has to stop being naive thinking China is going to become more democratic and play by the rules if we’re nice to them. It’s simply not going to happen. China poses a significant threat to Americans’ health and way of life, and it is time we wake up and understand that.

On Tuesday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “The Last Word,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) stated that the health experts who testified before the Senate “didn’t necessarily take” the opportunity to correct some of the statements made by President Trump and that they “bear a responsibility, probably more often than they do, to stand up to this president and correct his mistruths.” After host Lawrence O’Donnell stated that we saw what the experts are “capable of saying once they’re free of Donald Trump.” Murphy stated, “I think you saw a hint of that, but they were free to, of their own volition, rebut any of the insane things that the president has said. And they didn’t necessarily take that opportunity today. Listen, from the very beginning, I think we have always been vexed about this question as to what advice we give smart people who are working in the Trump administration. It is hard to watch some of these public servants stand behind this president as he lies through his teeth and then have them refuse to correct the record. At the same time, I’m pretty sure I want Dr. Fauci in the room, even if there are very few times when the president is listening to his advice instead of some flunky or lackey. And so, I think we treated these witnesses respectfully today because we understand the position that we’re in. We’re glad that they’re doing these jobs. But they do, I think, bear a responsibility, probably more often than they do, to stand up to this president and correct his mistruths.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

The National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) announced on Tuesday that, by its tally, over 41,000 people have died in Iran as a result of Chinese coronavirus infection. The death toll surpassed 40,000 on Friday. The NCRI keeps an independent tally of coronavirus deaths in the country in concert with its affiliated dissident groups, the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI/MEK), which uses a combination of local confirmed cases and deaths and information from medical staff at major hospitals to keep track. The death rate the group has documented is significantly higher than official Iranian Islamic regime estimates. Officially, Iran claims to have confirmed 110,767 cases of Chinese coronavirus in the country and 6,733 deaths, which still makes it one of the most severely affected nations by the pandemic. PMOI/MEK noted in its update of its internal tally that the Iranian regime death toll is less than one-seventh of what the dissident group alleges it is. The tally cites both local counts in some of the most affected provinces and individual death counts in hospitals with large numbers of people affected. In announcing the updated number, the dissident organization also cited reports in government-run media – Iran only allows official state publications or nominally private but regime-friendly media groups to operate in the country – that indicate few within Iran believe the official numbers. One state-run newspaper, Jahane San’at, allegedly published a report on Tuesday stating that the official numbers have been deflated in large part by Iranian government officials ordering hospitals not to take coronavirus patients in anymore. “In many cities, they are no longer taking COVID-19 patients to hospitals. They refuse to provide medical treatment for so long that the patient dies and is directly taken to a cemetery,” the newspaper reported, according to the PMOI/MEK. The dissident group also cited other media outlets expressing alarm at how the economic crisis is creating high-risk situations for coronavirus contamination. One newspaper reported an increase in the number of people scavenging through trash for items they could use to sell and trade for food, a situation reminiscent of that which has dominated the streets of cities of Venezuela, an Iranian regime ally, for years. The surge in cases this week comes accompanied by Iranian regime policies to ease social distancing restrictions. On Tuesday, the regime reopened the nation’s mosques, a point of contention between Health Ministry officials and the powerful radical clerics that the regime largely answers to. Health experts believe the outbreak originally exacerbated through the crowding of Islamic sites in the holy city of Qom. Despite attempting to shut down religious sites to prevent crowding in the early days of the outbreak in March, imams openly urged the faithful to defy the bans and flood shrines across the country. As it is currently Ramadan, the holiest month on the Islamic calendar, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei allowed for the reopening of mosques. Iran is also scheduled to reopen schools next week. Khamenei, the supreme leader of the country, demanded last week that Iranian businesses start a “jump in production” to fight “manufactured viruses such as sanctions,” referring to American sanctions on Iran over its illegal nuclear weapons development. “Should we want to liken the economy to human body, the defense system that provides the economy with security would be production. In other words, the element that can neutralize invasive viruses and microbes targeting the economy and keep it healthy is production,” Khamenei explained. When not boasting of its success in containing the virus, the Iranian regime has blamed others for its failures. Notably, Health Ministry officials have not shied away from blaming the Communist Party of China, an allied regime to Iran, for its efforts to censor key information about the Chinese coronavirus prior to its localized outbreak becoming a pandemic. “It seems statistics from China was a bitter joke because many in the world thought this is just like influenza, with fewer deaths. This [impression] were based on reports from China and now it seems China made a bitter joke with the rest of the world,” Health Ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur said last month. Last week, health officials openly admitted that the rate of infection had not reduced to a level that made the resumption of normal life safe. “What we expected regarding a faster decrease in numbers has not materialized. In some provinces we are actually witnessing a significant rise in our stats,” Iranian Deputy Health Minister Iraj Harirchi said on state television last week, according to PMOI/MEK. Harirchi himself became the object of international attention in February when he appeared on television, sweating and feverish, claiming that Tehran had the outbreak under control. He tested positive for the Chinese coronavirus shortly after that appearance but seems to have recovered since then. Iranian officials have remained upbeat about the nation’s response to the pandemic despite the increasingly dire numbers. Last week, Health Minister Saeed Namaki asserted definitively that Iran had “outperformed the most powerful countries in the fight against coronavirus.” He made the statement on Twitter, not citing any particular statistics to support his claim.

Tuesday on his nationally syndicated radio show, conservative talker Rush Limbaugh said Democrat Party lawmakers will attempt to squash plans to reopen the economy while the Chinese coronavirus pandemic subsides as part of an effort to sabotage President Donald Trump’s prospects of winning re-election in November. A partial transcript is as follows:  RUSH LIMBAUGH: I’ll tell you something else that’s starting to send red flags up. You probably have already noticed this. All these blue state governors that want to keep their states locked down, it’s purely political. But what are they depending on? They’re depending on the red states — the red states that are opening up! The red states are gonna get the economy kickstarted. The red states are gonna create capital and money to transfer to pay these people their stupid welfare costs (and whatever else they’re using to bleed this country dry), while their population sits home, doesn’t work, waits for the federal check to show up — and they sit around and they trash the supposedly reckless red states. I cannot tell you how this irritates me. The red-state governors — like Kemp in Georgia and any number of these people — are doing the right thing. They’re trying to get their people back to work, for all the right common-sensical human and humane reasons — to protect lives — to protect livelihoods, the United States economy, the state economy. And then you go to a blue state, and it’s the exact opposite. They shut down and lock down, and they want to remain locked down until July or August or whatever — and nothing’s gonna open and nothing is gonna happen. And they fully expect the red states to sit there and essentially pay for it. Folks, I’m gonna tell you, these next four months are gonna be a veritable war like we have not seen. The American left and the Democrat Party is going to do its best to keep this economy shut down, to extend and expand that shutdown — and blow up their own country’s jobs — just to ensure that Trump loses. But here’s the thing about that. Let’s do a little hypothetical. Let’s say this continues as it is, and let’s say that more and more red states open up and the economy in these states starts to return and revive. The blue states stay locked down. These are populous places — New York, Massachusetts, California. So they stay locked down all for the express purpose of canceling out the increase created by the red states. The economic activity that will happen from the red states going back to work, the blue state governors are gonna try to cancel it out by keeping their people at home. They’re gonna wreck the economy. Their objective is to wreck the economy and get rid of Trump. [H/T RushLimbaugh.com]

South Korea is battling a new outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus linked to nightclubs in the Itaewon district of Seoul. Itaewon’s clubs are popular with gay people, so government officials are publicly worried about a backlash against the LGBT community, and they fear some potentially infected people are reluctant to come forward for testing. Yonhap News said on Tuesday that the Itaewon cluster now accounts for 102 confirmed coronavirus infections, with testing likely to reveal more in the coming days. About half of these cases were reported within the Seoul city limits. “Outside of the capital, 23 cases were reported in the surrounding Gyeonggi Province, followed by seven in Incheon, west of Seoul, five in North Chungcheong Province and one each in North Jeolla Province, the southeastern port city of Busan and the southern island of Jeju,” Yonhap reported. Most of the patients are men in their twenties: “By age, 67 of the cases were in their 20s, followed by 23 in their 30s and four each in their 40s and 50s. There were three under 19 and one aged over 60. By gender, 92 were men, while 10 were women.” The first confirmed Itaewon infection was a 29-year-old man visiting Seoul from the city of Yongin who visited five different nightclubs on the evening of May 1 and tested positive on May 6. One of those clubs, Made, is ranked among the most popular nightspots in Itaewon, which in turn is a very popular destination for foreign visitors, making it hard for South Korean investigators to track down everyone who might have been infected. Over 3,000 tests have been performed in connection with the Itaewon cluster so far. “I heard some people are reluctant to get tested for fear of being criticized. We will try hard to make sure everyone receives a test without feeling uncomfortable or prejudiced against,” said one district official, alluding to the popularity of the district with gay people. The mayor of Seoul, Park Won-soon, said during a press briefing that some potentially infected customers from the nightclubs “intentionally avoided our calls or wrote a wrong number in the first place” when his administration tried reaching out to offer free and anonymous coronavirus testing. Mayor Park said fines are being considered as punishment for at-risk individuals who refuse to get tested. “If you hesitate a single day, our daily clock may stop for a month. Please contact the nearest clinic or health center right now,” Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun pleaded with Itaewon club patrons from a meeting of government officials on Monday. The mayors of several other cities have reported infections linked to Itaewon clubbers who visited establishments in other cities, prompting 12 municipal governments to shut down their nightlife temporarily, as Seoul has done. Several companies have delayed plans to resume normal operations after employees who visited Itaewon tested positive. The South China Morning Post (SCMP) ruefully noted the Itaewon outbreak has “interrupted the country’s gradual reopening” after a successful coronavirus response. A key component of that response was aggressive contract tracing, which has become difficult with the Itaewon cluster because so many of the people exposed to the virus are afraid of being outed as gay. The SCMP reported some instances of hostility toward gay South Koreans over the new coronavirus outbreak, including some angry comparisons to the Shincheonji Church, a sizable but highly reclusive and paranoid sect whose members were at one time linked to over half of the coronavirus infections in the country: “Don’t call them a sexual minority community,” one poster wrote on the Naver portal. “They are merely perverts!” Another asked: “Protect gay rights and let the country collapse?” Advocacy group Solidarity for LGBT Human Rights of Korea urged the media to stop “sensationalising” the outbreak and linking the new cluster to the gay community, warning this would discourage those at risk from being tested. Psychology Professor Lim Myung-ho of Dankook University also drew comparisons with the Shincheonji outbreak. “When Covid-19 virus was spreading at Shincheonji Church, followers attempted to hide their religious affiliations and infections and members of a sexual minority are also backing away,” he said. “This may result in many hidden infected cases and spark a second Shincheonji crisis.” The Health Ministry on Monday acknowledged that many gay people are nervous about being exposed in South Korea where homosexuality remains taboo and promised that the confidentiality of all patients would be protected. A Health Ministry official warned that anyone who distributes the personal information of patents or starts “groundless rumors” about them “could be criminally punished.” The Korea Herald on Tuesday offered a primer for outsiders on the elaborate nightclub ecosystem of Seoul, which includes several types of specialized clubs that cater to specific demographics and interests. It might prove helpful to resolving the Itaewon outbreak that older people – the group most vulnerable to severe illness or death from the coronavirus – tend to frequent different clubs than younger people. South Koreans do not mince words when it comes to classifying their nightclubs. A popular species of club that caters to older clients is known as the “colatechque” because they were originally created as non-alcoholic establishments that would appeal to very young customers, but the older folks decided they liked them better.  The hot hook-up establishments for youngsters on the prowl are called “pochas” – literally, hunting blinds – and some of them cut to the chase by equipping each table with electronic tablets that can be used to proposition customers seated at other tables. On the other end of the spectrum, at the genteel establishments most South Koreans refer to as “nightclubs,” strangers are expected to be formally introduced to each other by the waiters.

Elections can be done despite the threat of coronavirus, according to Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-AL). Tuesday, during an interview with Huntsville, AL radio’s WVNN, Byrne explained his opposition to the vote-by-mail push nationally. According to the Alabama Republican, absentee voting is available, if needed, and in-person voting can take place with minimal risks. “I’m not for it,” Byrne said. “Every state has an absentee ballot law because there are people that can’t show up. And there are going to be people this year because they have an underlying condition or they’re elderly don’t want to show up to vote, and we should them vote by absentee. But just open it up, and anybody and his little brother just want to send in his ballot without having to physically show up — look, we got people all over Alabama that can’t wait to physically show up and stand next to one another for three or four hours to watch a football game. Surely we don’t mind spending a few minutes standing near one another — we can probably social distance, by the way during these elections — stand in the same place with one another, wearing facemasks and go vote. That’s what we should do.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor

Retail giant Walmart says it plans to give out a second round of cash bonuses to all of its U.S. hourly workers during the coronavirus pandemic. The retailer said hourly associates in stores, supply chains, clubs, and drivers and offices, as well as assistant managers in stores and clubs, would qualify for the bonuses, KNWA reported. Full-time hourly workers would receive a bonus of $300, and part-time workers would get a $150 bonus. The Arkansas-based retailer says the bonuses will add up to more than $390 million. Employees must have started with Walmart by June 5 to qualify, and the employees will receive their bonus by June 25. “Walmart and Sam’s Club associates continue to do remarkable work and it’s important we reward and appreciate them,” Walmart President and CEO John Furner said in a statement. “All across the country, they’re providing Americans with the food, medicine and supplies they need while going above and beyond the normal scope of their jobs – diligently sanitizing their facilities, making customers and members feel safe and welcome and handling difficult situations with professionalism and grace,” the statement continued. The company has also looked for other ways to help its workers in times of crisis. It has implemented daily temperature checks, health screens, virtual counseling, and has provided masks and gloves for its employees. Walmart also installed sneeze-guards, installed social-distancing signage, and has limited the number of shoppers that can be in the store at one time. This is not the first time Walmart employees are seeing a “coronabonus.” Walmart first began paying out more than $365 million back in March to its hourly associates, paying full-time employees $300 and part-time employees $150. That bonus was paid out on April 2.

Health officials from the Trump administration told a Senate panel on Tuesday that the U.S. will be able to meet its coronavirus (COVID-19) testing goals for the next two months and that there may be an effective vaccine to combat the disease by the end of this year. Many of the Democrats on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) that held the hearing did not appear to welcome the news.  The Trump administration officials testified during a coronavirus hearing  focused on getting back to work and school after the United States shut down to stem the spread of the lethal and highly contagious disease.  Democrats keep moving the goal posts for what is needed to resuscitate the U.S. During the hearing, the top Democrat on the panel — Sen. Pat Murray from Washington — indicated that there must be free tests and vaccines for every American before states can safely reopen.  For the most part, the witnesses and the lawmakers discussed America’s testing capacity and the development of a vaccine and treatments to combat the viral outbreak.  Democrats on the HELP committee were dissatisfied with what the health officials said on that front, even though it was fairly good news.  The vast majority of them seized every opportunity to blame President Donald Trump for the coronavirus tragedy that has befallen this nation and lambast his administration’s response to the pandemic.  Adm. Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), testified:  We have established the targets with the states of over 12 million tests over the next four weeks. We think those targets are going to be good in May and June. But as [White House Coronavirus Task Force member] Dr. [Anthony] Fauci said, we really have to be evidence-based. We expect those targets to go up as we progressively open … and certainly, those numbers will need to go up significantly again in the fall when we potentially have influenza circulating with with COVID. Dr. Giroir stressed that it is difficult to make testing needs predictions for every state beyond June because the targets may need to change to reflect the conditions on the ground.  Still, Sen. Murray complained that the Trump administration is unable to see into the future and say how many tests each state will need beyond June.  The admiral also revealed that the Trump administration will be able to perform 40 to 50 million tests a month by September. That means the U.S. will be able to perform about 1.3 to 1.7 million tests each day by the beginning of fall. “By September, taking every aspect of development, authorization, manufacturing, and supply chain into consideration, we project that our nation will be capable of performing at least 40, 50 million test per month if needed at that time,” he told Senators. Giroir noted that the number could be higher if pending approvals for testing technologies are authorized. He indicated that schools, universities, and businesses will likely have adequate testing capacity to reopen.   Nevertheless, the Democrats and their mainstream media allies have indicated that 40 to 50 million tests per month are not enough to get back to at least some semblance of normalcy. Citing health experts, Forbes magazine suggested that the United States will need to conduct “500,000 to 35 million tests per day” to safely reopen.  The article came after U.S. President Donald Trump accurately indicated this week that America leads the world in coronavirus testing.  Since around mid-March, “the nation has performed more than nine million COVID-19 tests, a number far greater than any other country,” Giroir testified. In discussing what is needed to safely reopen America, Sen. Murray went a step further, suggesting the Trump administration must “make sure testing is free, fast, and everywhere” and “produce and distribute” an effective vaccine “to everyone quickly, equitably, at no cost.”  Sen. Murray said:  One thing that’s abundantly clear, we need dramatically more testing. It is unacceptable we still don’t have a national strategic plan to make sure testing is free, fast, and everywhere. … While President Trump claimed otherwise, there is no question that an essential part of reopening our economy safely is successfully developing and distributing a vaccine for COVID-19 … [We need to] make sure that once we have a safe and effective vaccine we can produce and distribute it too everyone quickly, equitably, [and] at no cost. She did concede that the U.S. needs to make sure there are adequate resources to deal with mental health challenges stemming from “the stress of physical isolation, loss of income, to the trauma and anxiety of patients and workers who’ve been on the frontlines.” Although Dr. Fauci said there are “no guarantees” that there will be an effective vaccine, as tends to be the case with similar efforts, he testified that there at least eight candidates in the clinical development stage, and some of them could be available by “late fall” or “early winter.”  “One of the big unknowns is [whether] it will be effective,” he acknowledged, later adding, “I still feel cautiously optimistic that we will have a candidate that will give some degree of efficacy, hopefully, a percentage enough that will induce the kind of herd immunity that would give protection to the population at whole.”  He warned about “the possibility of negative consequences where certain vaccines can actually enhance the negative effect of the infection.”  Dr. Fauci stressed that the federal government had also launched a public-private partnership to accelerate the development of both vaccines and therapeutic interventions to combat COVID-19.  Ignoring reopening checkpoints in the White House’s “Opening Up America Again” guidelines may trigger potentially uncontrollable outbreaks that will yield preventable “suffering and death,” he warned.  Fauci also said the U.S. does not yet have the coronavirus outbreak within its borders “completely under control.”  Some U.S. statehave begun to reopen after the White House issued its guidelines. As of Tuesday night, there were over 1.3 million cases and over 82,000 deaths in the United States, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker.

On Tuesday, the White House announced plans to test all members of the press pool as part of increasing coronavirus precautions. “Out of an abundance of caution and to further protect your health and safety as well as the entire complex, members of the restricted in-house pool should be ready in the briefing room at call time for a COVID-19 test to be administered in Lower Press by the White House Medical Unit,” White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere said in a statement. “Moving forward, we expect to test members of the restricted in-house pool daily.” The size of the pool has already been restricted, and various distancing measures have been put in place during President Donald Trump’s briefings. COVID-19 protections have escalated since White House staffers — including Vice President Mike Pence’s press secretary — tested positive for the novel coronavirus. Temperature checks are also being performed on anyone in close proximity to either leader. Even Trump and Pence have decided to keep a precautionary distance from one another for the “immediate future” on the advice of the White House medical unit. After Pence made the initial decision, Trump said he has “not seen him since then. But I would say that he will — he and I will be talking about that. Yeah, we could talk on the phone.” Both the president and vice president are being tested daily.

On Tuesday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “All In,” Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) worried that Coronavirus Task Force member Dr. Anthony Fauci will face “repercussion…for speaking the truth.” Harris said, “Thank God for Dr. Fauci. Thank God for him having the courage to speak truth. God only knows what kind of repercussion he’s going to face for speaking the truth. But obviously, he has the well-being of the American people as his priority, as opposed to the political patronage that this president thinks he’s due.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

Gov. Tom Wolf (D) is defending Pennsylvania Health Secretary Rachel Levine as she faces increasing criticism over the devastating impact the Chinese coronavirus has had on nursing homes — a devastating impact worsened, critics say, by the controversial interim guidance provided by the state’s department of health, requiring nursing homes to readmit “stable patients who have had the COVID-19 virus.” “Our secretary of health, Dr. Levine, decided that it would be good to allow COVID-positive patients to be returned to elder-care facilities,” state Sen. Doug Mastriano said during a Monday rally outside the Capitol, calling for Levine, the “first transgender person appointed to a Pennsylvania cabinet position,” to resign. “And as a result of that, it broke out like fire,” he continued, calling it “unconscionable, unacceptable” and adding that Levine “needs to be held accountable for that awful decision.” Levine’s department released the “Interim Guidance for Nursing Facilities During COVID-19” on March 18, which outlined procedures for nursing homes during the coronavirus pandemic. Despite leaders continually stressing that the coronavirus poses the most danger to older individuals with preexisting conditions, the department advised nursing homes to readmit nursing home residents who were treated for the virus, citing the need to lessen the burden on hospitals. The guidance states: Nursing care facilities must continue to accept new admissions and receive readmissions for current residents who have been discharged from the hospital who are stable to alleviate the increasing burden in the acute care settings. This may include stable patients who have had the COVID-19 virus. Nursing homes in Pennsylvania have since been ravaged by the virus. As reported last week, roughly 80 percent of the recent coronavirus-related deaths — reported in the state on Thursday — occurred at either a nursing home or personal care facility. As the Morning Call reported last week: A total of 3,416 coronavirus deaths has been reported statewide through Thursday. Of those, 2,355, or nearly 69%, were associated with nursing or personal care homes. … This week, the nursing homes operated by Lehigh and Northampton counties, Cedarbrook and Gracedale, respectively, both reported sharp increases in deaths. … Over the last seven days, about 76% of deaths added to the state’s total — 850 of the 1,124 newly reported deaths — were at personal care homes or nursing homes. Despite that, Wolf is backing his health secretary, praising Levine for doing a “phenomenal job.” “My assessment of Dr. Levine is that she is doing a phenomenal job, and I think we’ve got to be careful about blaming the messenger for the message,” Wolf said in reaction to Mastriano’s remarks. “I think it’s a tribute to her that Pennsylvania has actually done a better job than many of our surrounding states in terms of the infection rate and the death rate,” the governor added. As of Sunday, 2,552 of Pennsylvania’s 3,731 coronavirus-related deaths stemmed from nursing home facilities, according to PennLive. The White House is recommending all nursing home residents to be tested for the virus. “We really believe that all one million nursing home residents need to be tested within next two weeks as well as the staff,”  Dr. Deborah Birx stated. Meanwhile, Wolf is continuing to bar healthy individuals from reopening their respective counties and resuming work. University of Pittsburgh Medical Center’s (UPMC) Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Steven Shapiro, noted during a roundtable discussion with Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA) last week that the median age of death from the virus in the state is 84. “In sum, this is a disease of the elderly, sick and poor,” he said, warning against “extended social isolation” and urging leaders to focus on serving and protecting seniors, “especially those in nursing homes.” “If we do that, we can reopen society, and though infectious cases may rise as in the Theodore Roosevelt, the death rate will not, providing time for the development of treatments and vaccines,” Shapiro added.

Phillip and Paul Hamilton were arrested on May 1 for a physical altercation resulting from their refusal to wear masks in a Van Nuys Target. In a statement released on May 11, the Los Angeles Police Department said that both customers entered the store without masks and were immediately confronted. After they refused to don the required personal protective equipment, they were escorted from the store. As they were being led from the property, one of the suspects turned and struck a security guard.  The employee fell and broke his arm. At this point, both suspects then allegedly assaulted four other Target workers in the vicinity. Surveillance videos appear to show multiple customers attempting to help the employees under attack. Authorities arrived soon after, and Los Angeles Fire Department paramedics transported the injured guard to a local hospital. The suspects, both young homeless men, were arrested on charges of felony battery with bail set at $50,000 each. In a statement to CBS2, Target said the “safety and security of our guests and team members is our top priority,” adding that the company was “grateful for the support of local police” and would “provide any information that can be helpful to their investigation.”

Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has reportedly presented to the players union his plan for re-starting the 2020 baseball season, including revenue sharing and a regimen for testing players for COVID-19. Fox Business Network’s Charles Gasparino reported that Manfred made his pitch to the players that include cuts to both owners and players. Manfred said that he assumes that each team could lose as much as $100 million this year thanks to the coronavirus shutdowns. The season Manfred laid out will also consist of 82 games that will initially be played without fans in the stands. Owners say that the 50-50 split to cover the losses is fair and that players may even gain a bit later in the season if fans are allowed back in stadiums to buy tickets. The owners say they are already wary of sports agents and reps clamoring for more money and upsetting delicate deals. But the owners warn that if there is no season at all in 2020, players could lose hundreds of millions of dollars. Manfred added that this 2020 plan is a one-year deal that will not include money to old player deals. Finally, the league is creating a comprehensive testing regime for players to make sure none of them have the coronavirus before they walk into the clubhouse and then out on the field. “Owners have put in place hundreds of safety protocols after months of meetings w White House task force and other MDs,” Gasparino reported. “Safety protocols involve testing of players, sanitizing ballparks, and how teams will travel,” Gasparino concluded. BREAKING @RobManfred is said to be now making his pitch to the @MLB_PLAYERS. Sources say he will make the following points: Owners/league say salary cuts needed because each team will lose around $100 million given shortened 82 game season. Owners say they earn only 30 percent — Charles Gasparino (@CGasparino) May 12, 2020  Owners know player reps will balking at salary cuts but they will argue that players cld lose $1 billion in salary if there is no baseball in 2020. Owners say new rev deal just covers 2020 season and there is no money to apply old player deals given new #pandemic economics. — Charles Gasparino (@CGasparino) May 12, 2020  Safety protocols involve testing of players, sanitizing ball parks, and how teams will travel more later on @FoxBusiness @TeamCavuto — Charles Gasparino (@CGasparino) May 12, 2020  Follow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston.

NEW YORK (AP) — The shutdown on Broadway has been extended again — until at least early September. Although an exact date for performances to resume has yet to be determined, Broadway producers are now offering refunds and exchanges for tickets purchased for shows through Sept. 6. “While all Broadway shows would love to resume performances as soon as possible, we need to ensure the health and well-being of everyone who comes to the theater — behind the curtain and in front of it — before shows can return,” said Charlotte St. Martin, president of the Broadway League, which represents producers. Broadway theaters abruptly closed on March 12, knocking out all shows — including 16 that were still scheduled to open — and postponing indefinitely the Tony Award schedule. Producers, citing health and city authorities, previously extended the shutdown to June 7. Broadway grossed $1.8 billion last season and attracted a record 15 million people. Producers and labor unions are discussing ways theaters can reopen safely. Actors’ Equity Association, which represents 51,000 actors and stage managers, called the postponment “difficult but necessary.” “Before our members can safely return to work, we will need new protocols that protect audiences and workers alike,” said Mary McColl, executive director of the association. Hours after the latest postponement came word that producers of the upcoming revival of Neil Simon’s “Plaza Suite” have pushed the production to next year. Matthew Broderick and Sarah Jessica Parker will now star in the revival starting in March 2021. Other shows scheduled to open this spring have abandoned their plans, including “Hangmen” and a revival of Edward Albee’s “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?”

Appearing Tuesday on BBC’s Newsnight, Hollywood star Robert De Niro attacked President Donald Trump’s response to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, calling him a “lunatic” with no regard for how many Americans die of the disease. “It’s like Shakespearean the whole thing” – actor Robert de Niro on how the coronavirus outbreak is being handled in the US#Newsnight pic.twitter.com/k64t3Mhcl9 — BBC Newsnight (@BBCNewsnight) May 12, 2020  A transcript is as follows:  EMILY MAITLIS: Why do you think [Trump administration officials] are not speaking out? You think they can do more good if they keep quiet and help, scientifically, rather than putting their necks on the line? ROBERT DE NIRO: No, and I understand that. That’s, of course, the logic, the rationale. But it’s like Shakespearean the whole thing. You’ve got a lunatic saying things that people are trying to dance around. Whereas, at one point, and they are doing this in the hearings a little more, trying to say tactically that this is what will happen. Fauci is doing that. It’s appalling. He wants to be reelected. He doesn’t even care about how many people die MAITLIS: Trump has given himself a platform because he is the democratically-elected president of the U.S. and his fan base would presumably take issue with you saying he doesn’t care about deaths or about what happens to American lives, and they will vote for him again. DE NIRO: No, he doesn’t care. He doesn’t care for those people and the people he pretends to care about are the people he has the most disdain for, because he could care less about them. They might like to tell themselves that to delude themselves, but he doesn’t care about them.

Chinese Communist Party (CCP) authorities detained a Chinese constitutional scholar after he wrote an open letter to the Chinese government criticizing its handling of the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak and demanding free speech, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported on Monday. Zhang Xuezhong, a constitutional professor and defense lawyer for Chinese human rights activists, has long been a vocal critic of the CCP’s political and legal systems. On Sunday, security forces abducted him from his Shanghai home, according to the report. “He was taken away on Sunday night. Three police cars came to his house,” Wen Kejian, a political analyst and friend of Zhang told the SCMP. Another friend of Zhang’s, who preferred to remain anonymous, confirmed that Zhang had been “taken” by authorities. “He is mentally prepared after his open letter,” the friend added. On Saturday, Zhang posted his letter on WeChat, a Chinese messaging and social media app. He addressed the letter to deputies of the National People’s Congress (NPC), representatives of China’s legislature. The timing of the post was significant, as Zhang’s letter circulated widely online just as the national legislature prepares to convene for its “most important” parliamentary sessions in the coming weeks. In his WeChat post, Zhang attached his open letter and included an accompanying message in support of freedom of speech. “The best way to fight for freedom of expression is for everyone to speak as if we already have freedom of speech,” he wrote. In his letter, Zhang called China’s system of governance “backward” for lacking a modern constitution. “[T]he outbreak and spread of the Covid-19 [Wuhan coronavirus] epidemic is a good illustration of the problem,” he argued. The Wuhan coronavirus originated in Wuhan, capital of central China’s Hubei province, in late 2019. Since then, the virus has spread out of China to other countries, resulting in the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, responsible for at least 289,932 deaths worldwide. The CCP’s cover-up of China’s initial coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan has been widely criticized by global health authorities, who blame the Communist Party’s lack of transparency for allowing the virus to mushroom from an isolated outbreak to a global pandemic. Zhang’s letter addressed the absence of scrutiny inherent in China’s political system as a key contributor to the disastrous viral outbreak, according to the report. There were few independent professional media to investigate and report on the outbreak, nor did medical professionals provide independent advice to the public … It only shows that the government’s long-term tight control of society and people has almost completely destroyed the organization and self-help capabilities of Chinese society. The human rights lawyer also called for freedom of speech. “Twenty-two days before the [lockdown to contain the outbreak] in the city, Wuhan was still investigating and punishing citizens who had disclosed the epidemic, including Dr. Li Wenliang … showing how tight and arbitrary the government’s suppression of society is,” Zhang wrote. Dr. Li has become somewhat of a martyr for free speech in China since he died from coronavirus in February. Just before his death, Li had tried to warn the public about the danger of the coronavirus during its initial outbreak in Wuhan, for which he was arrested and reprimanded by CCP authorities, who accused him of “spreading rumors.” Li’s arrest and death have since sparked calls for freedom of speech within China, as in Zhang’s letter.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) latest Chinese coronavirus relief package shields illegal aliens from deportation so long as they take American jobs in “essential critical infrastructure work,” shielding their employers from prosecution. The plan, proposed by House Democrats, offers an amnesty for illegal aliens who take American jobs deemed “essential” during the crisis, even as more than 33 million Americans are unemployed. Specific provisions of the plan ensure that illegal aliens taking essential American jobs are provided with deferred action and authorized for employment, effectively halting Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) ability to deport them. Likewise, the House Democrat plan provides business with a major giveaway by suspending the Department of Labor’s ability to prosecute an employer that hires illegal aliens over unemployed Americans. “House Democrats prioritizing foreign workers, legal and illegal, over unemployed and underemployed Americans in the middle of a crisis is shameful,” NumbersUSA President Roy Beck. The plan would also ensure that millions of illegal aliens with taxpayer-identification numbers are able to secure $1,200 cash payments of U.S. taxpayer money — funds meant for struggling Americans. “Instead of focusing on helping 33 million unemployed Americans get back to work, the so-called Heroes Act uses the COVID-19 pandemic to give amnesty — and cash payments — to illegal foreign workers in the United States,” Beck said. The plan to flood the U.S. labor market with foreign, illegal workers during a period of mass unemployment stands in stark contrast to an initiative by GOP lawmakers to halt all foreign visa worker programs. Recent surveys find overwhelming support for pauses to legal immigration. The latest Washington Post/University of Maryland poll revealed that about 65 percent of all Americans said they support suspending all immigration at the moment.

The House Democrats’ latest Chinese coronavirus relief package includes establishing mail-in voting for the 2020 presidential election and nationwide ballot harvesting, allowing political operatives to collect and deliver ballots. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) newest legislation is packed with an effort to deliver a ballot to every registered voter on the voter rolls and to nationally legalize the process known as ballot harvesting. The plan would mandate mail-in voting during times of national emergencies, thus mailing ballots to every registered voter despite severe issues with the nation’s voter rolls. Since the 2012 election, for example, about 28.4 million mail-in ballots have gone missing. Also included in the plan is the legalization of ballot harvesting, allowing political operatives to collect and deliver as many ballots as they want so long as they are not paid based on the number of ballots they deliver. This loophole still allows these operatives to be paid.

Social distancing be damned. #MailBalloting #coronavirus pic.twitter.com/khMk4Vo38M — PublicInterestLegal (@PILFoundation) May 12, 2020  The plan guts voter ID requirements and witness signature requirements for mail-in voting. For instance, states would be effectively banned from requiring an ID from a registered voter requesting an absentee ballot. Likewise, states would be banned from requiring witness signatures on mail-in ballots — gutting the process used to trace voter fraud.

The case revealed that more than 160 mail-in ballots were signed by the same political operatives. States which allow voter registration when a resident obtains their driver’s license would be banned from requiring registrants to provide their entire Social Security Number — only mandating they provide their last four digits. The plan is similar to Pelosi’s March coronavirus relief package that sought to nationally legalize ballot harvesting in elections and provide all registered voters with mail-in ballots.

China’s state-run People’s Daily on Tuesday accused the United States of “sabotaging” the global battle against the Wuhan coronavirus by criticizing the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).  The latest twist to Chinese propaganda is an allegation that the U.S. ignored warnings from China and the World Health Organization (W.H.O.), a perfect inversion of the reality that W.H.O. spread false information fed to it by China that greatly increased the damage caused by the coronavirus in countries that took the W.H.O. seriously. The People’s Daily claimed the entire world is in “shock” over America’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, basing its claim of “sabotage” largely on claims that the United States has handled the disease poorly and wallowed in “egoism” by blaming the CCP for unleashing it: The US now has the largest number of confirmed cases and fatalities of COVID-19 in the world, and is the current epicenter of the pandemic. Its reluctance to promote global cooperation to tackle the lethal virus has made it a less credible and consistent partner for the international community. Experts and officials around the world have criticized the nation’s egoism amid a global pandemic, condemning its failure to protect its own people, as well as its hindering of joint global efforts to stop the virus’ spread. The CCP claimed the United States ignored “warnings” from W.H.O. and undermined global health by freezing contributions to the organization — an order of magnitude larger than the funding contributed by China — until allegations of malfeasance at W.H.O. are thoroughly investigated: Despite being the world’s leading power in medical technology, the US has turned a blind eye to the global crisis, sabotaging joint efforts to tackle the lethal virus. Amid swirling questions over whether the US government ignored warnings from the WHO and countries like China about the virus’ potential severity, the White House has sought to assign blame elsewhere, creating obstacles for international cooperation on pandemic control. President Trump’s decision to cut WHO funding in April led to an outcry in the international community. Even in the US, voices criticizing the US’ egoism amid the global pandemic have become increasingly loud. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease expert from Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, was quoted as saying by Aljazeera that such selfish behavior is not “the type of thing you do in the middle of a pandemic.” Among the most famous of the allegations against the W.H.O. — not really an allegation, but a documented matter of fact — is that the organization did not warn the world adequately about the coronavirus, instead relaying deliberate falsehoods from China that human transmission was impossible. The nation with the most effective coronavirus response, Taiwan, tried to warn W.H.O. about the true nature of the virus and was ignored.  China is still blocking Taiwan from membership in W.H.O. for purely political reasons and attacking Taiwan’s supporters. In fact, China is intensifying its belligerent rhetoric and campaign of military intimidation toward Taiwan In another act of projection, the People’s Daily accused the U.S. of “scooping up much-needed medical resources, leaving other nations, even its allies, in despair.” This is exactly what China did early in the pandemic, using nominally private entities under the CCP’s control to buy up medical equipment by the ton and ship it to China. People’s Daily made this case by harping on a complaint made by Germany in early April about the U.S. supposedly “confiscating” masks from American manufacturer 3M before they could be shipped from Bangkok to Berlin. Chinese propaganda incessantly quotes early statements from German politicians complaining of American “piracy,” but 3M denied those allegations and the complaint shifted to less sensational allegations that the U.S. government was outbidding other buyers for protective masks on the red-hot global market. As of May, the U.S. government is more commonly criticized for allowing too many American-made masks to be exported when domestic stockpiles are running low. The CCP has a habit of scanning the news for items critical of the United States, frequently recycling articles from months ago, to assemble slapdash hit pieces that try to project Communist China’s sins onto its accusers. The importance of constantly repeating the truth about the coronavirus pandemic, its origins, and how it was made worse by the CCP’s secrecy and deceptions cannot be overstated.

Actor Kevin James has made a short comedy that makes fun of draconian lockdown restrictions and overzealous quarantine shamers. The King of Queens star, who posted the video Out of Touch to his official YouTube account, stars as a man on the run with his friend, both pursued by the sound of sirens and barking dogs.  An extended flashback reveals their horrible crime — they shook hands after meeting up in a public area. Their act was caught on smartphone cameras by a group of over-eager quarantine shamers who alert law enforcement. The two-minute movie comes as pressure builds nationwide for states to begin re-opening their economies and relaxing stay-at-home orders as COVID-19 cases are plateauing and in some areas declining. Some states including Georgia, Texas, and Florida have already begun the process of lifting restrictions. But other parts of the country could see extended lockdowns. Los Angeles County appears likely to extend its stay-at-home order for three more months through August. Out of Touch is Kevin James latest coronavirus-themed comedy short. The actor also posted A Quarantine Birthday about a man having a bad day who arrives home to discover a surprise birthday party thrown by his friends. But a jump cut reveals that the whole party is just a VR simulation.  The actor also appeared in I Miss Baseball, a more wistful work that expresses his love for America’s favorite pastime — until the final humorous shot.  Follow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg.

A county’s reopening has been delayed after nearly 2,000 people gathered for a rodeo in Cottonwood, California, on Sunday. Monday, Shasta County officials said they had to push back some of their plans to reopen once Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) heard that the event took place despite his stay-at-home orders, according to the Record Searchlight. “The rodeo came to the governor’s attention and it has delayed full implementation of opening businesses back up here,” said Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) spokesperson Kerri Schuette. Last week, HHSA officials reached out to the rodeo’s organizer but he refused to cancel the event, according to a press release the agency shared on Twitter: Press release: A rodeo in Cottonwood on Sunday violated the governor's stay-at-home order and has delayed the county's ability to re-open retail businesses, restaurants and more during Stage 2.@CALFIRESHU @ShastaSheriff pic.twitter.com/yK4vOiolPz — Shasta County HHSA (@ShastaHHSA) May 12, 2020  Officials appeared to blame rodeo attendees for jeopardizing “the ability for all Shasta County businesses to move forward into full Stage 2 opening, which delays our economic recovery.” “Mass gatherings are very high risk events that can spread COVID-19 to many individuals at one event. The County condemns this mass gathering and officials are taking steps to investigate the event and will take action accordingly,” the release continued. However, the county recorded its first coronavirus patient in nearly two weeks on Monday, and Schuette said the patient’s illness was not related to the rodeo, the Searchlight noted. Despite the backlash, rodeo attendees Chad Bushnell and Don Johnson said they felt the data allowed the event to safely take place, according to KRCR. “Right now I know in Tehama (County), just right over the hill there is only one confirmed case. Shasta (County), there have been a few,” Bushnell commented. “We have constitutional rights. We have inalienable rights given to us by God,” Johnson stated. The rodeo was something community members looked forward to every year, especially this one, said attendee Daniel Warner. “This event has been going on for 50 years, it is a tradition for probably most of us, the rest of them that are here have been tired of being cooped up for months,” he noted, adding that he did not feel anxious about being in a large crowd. Bushnell said people went to Sunday’s event because most of them had not been around others since the lockdown began. “A lot of these people have not seen each other for a long time. Of course, it is a rodeo, I am a big rodeo fan and just getting to be around my friends I haven’t seen in a while. I think that is going to make everybody bring the mothers together for mother’s day,” he concluded.

Jihadis, primarily Afghan Taliban terrorists, have carried out nearly 100 attacks in 16 countries since the beginning of Ramadan at the end of last month. In the process they have killed at least 290 people while injuring 280 others in the first two weeks of the holiest month for Muslims, a Breitbart News count shows. That means, on average, Islamic terrorists have executed about 21 people and maimed an estimated 20 others since Ramadan began at sunset on April 23. This year, Muslims expect the holy month to last through sundown on May 23. Breitbart News’ count begins on the first full day of Ramadan on April 24. This report covers the two weeks of April 24 through May 7. In total, there were at least 570 casualties, including fatalities and injuries, during the first half of Ramadan. This year, the casualties during the first two weeks of the holy month are lower than during the same period in 2019, when jihadis killed 364 people and wounded 404 others. While the number of fatalities dropped by slightly over 20 percent from 2019 to this year, the injuries experienced a larger decrease of more than 30 percent. Overall, the total number of casualties during the first half of Ramadan dropped by over 25 percent, from 768 last year to 570 in 2020. The carnage, however, has continued even as governments across the world continue to combat the ongoing Chinese coronavirus pandemic with mitigation efforts like social distancing and the closing of “non-essential” businesses. Afghan Taliban narco-jihadis, responsible for the most significant number of attacks so far, rejected a U.S.-backed Ramadan ceasefire again offered by Kabul this year. At the end of February, the U.S. and the Taliban terrorists signed an agreement calling for the conditions-based withdrawal of American and foreign military force. Still, the narco-jihadi group has continued to step up its attacks since. So far, during Ramadan 2020, the Taliban is responsible for 48, or 50 percent, of the 99 attacks. The terrorist group is responsible for about 60 percent (169) of all deaths and over 65 percent (183) of all injuries. The Taliban attacks have rendered Afghanistan the deadliest Muslim-majority country during the first half of Ramadan this year, followed by Iraq (37 dead, 24 injured) and Syria (28 dead, 25 injured), respectively. Despite the fall of its so-called caliphate in Iraq and Syria in March 2019, the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) and its affiliates outside the Middle East remain a problem. The group has intensified attacks in Iraq in recent weeks, reportedly exploiting the coronavirus lockdown in the country. ISIS jihadis represent the second-deadliest group during the holiest month for Muslims so far this year. The terrorist group carried out at least 22 attacks during the first half of the holy month that killed 75 people and wounded 38. Other groups, including al-Qaeda and its affiliates as well as the Iran-allied Shiite Houthis in Yemen, are also carrying out attacks, although to a much lesser extent. Nearly all the victims of the Ramadan attacks are Muslim. Islamic terrorist groups are known to urge their members and supporters to engage in jihad on Ramadan, believing that martyrs will get extra rewards in paradise. Despite these attempts, violence is entirely dissonant with Ramadan for the vast majority of the world’s Muslims. Most Islam adherents follow the tradition of abstaining from eating, drinking, smoking, having sex, and other physical needs each day, starting from before the break of dawn until sunset during the month of Ramadan. A minority of Muslims, however, adhere to the belief that perceives Ramadan as a month of jihad and martyrdom. Breitbart News primarily gleans its tally from the Religion of Peace website and the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) in coordination with news and government reports. This report only includes incidents that Breitbart News has corroborated using media and government reports as well as online entities that monitor jihadi activity. The overall number of attacks and the associated casualties could be larger given that Breitbart News is not able to confirm all incidents. Moreover, not all incidents are documented online. For the most part, the tally excludes casualties suffered by jihadis. Some of the documented incidents in Syria may inadvertently include deaths and injuries sustained by rebel groups with terrorist ties. Given that news outlets and governments fail to report many of the terrorist attacks in real-time, the casualty total is subject to change. The sources may update some of the casualty figures as some of the wounded victims succumb to their injuries.

Appearing Tuesday on CNN’S The Lead, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti (D) said Los Angeles county’s likely decision to extend its stay-at-home order by three months does not mean everything will undoubtedly remain closed within such period of time. “We’re going to have to have, for our young people, not just testing once and you’re good to go to school, but at least weekly, if not more frequently, to make sure nobody infectious is going to school.” – LA Mayor Eric Garcetti on what steps need to be taken to reopen schools. pic.twitter.com/ofy4FQMEvH — The Lead CNN (@TheLeadCNN) May 12, 2020  A partial transcript is as follows:  HOST JAKE TAPPER: What was so alarming in L.A. County for the health director to make this kind of warning? Explain to us what the situation is there? MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI: I want to reassure people, because I think there was a lot of panic suddenly when the headline said we’re all going to stay exactly how we are for three more months, when that’s not the case. I think, quite simply, think that she’s saying we’re not going to fully reopen Los Angeles or probably anywhere in America without any protections or any health orders in the next three months. I think we know it’s probably going to be longer than three months. And as I’ve said a million times, we’re not moving past COVID-19, we’re learning to live with it. We’re not going to go back to pre-COVID-19 life anytime soon or just forward to post-COVID-19 time, until there is a medicine or a vaccine that allows that. So we’re still living in the age of COVID-19, and that said, we don’t need to freeze life or freeze our economy where it is. But we will continue to need to have the health order about covering our faces, specifically distancing, testing our vulnerable population, and following the numbers when it comes to what steps we take moving forward, assessing those and staying or retreating in some cases when this disease gets bad. TAPPER: But she did seem to be saying that people are going to be staying at home still through July. I understand we’re not going back to 100 percent normal for quite some time, maybe not even until next year, but are you saying that she’s wrong, that Los Angeles County residents are not going to be staying at home until July? GARCETTI: No, and I just spoke to her for a few minutes before. We have a great health director in Dr. Ferrer here. We’ve taken her advice and saved thousands if not tens of thousands of lives. And I know most Americans want us to get it right. You look at polls across the country, certainly here in Los Angeles, it’s, go slow, don’t go fast, and get it right so we don’t have to retreat. She wanted to make sure that what I communicated and what she is communicating is that we still need a public health order, because there are some populations who will need to stay at home. People need to know whenever possible that it’s safer to stay at home, so you telecommute. There are no radical changes in the next week coming. That doesn’t mean three weeks from now, six weeks from now, two months from now, we won’t continuously edit that order and make sure we open up safely as much as we can, and if it gets dangerous, we may need to step back at times as well. I’ve always told people the hard truths.

House Democrats are proposing H.R. 6666, a multi-billion dollar bill authorizing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to “award grants to eligible entities to conduct diagnostic testing for COVID–19, and related activities such as contact tracing, through mobile health units and, as necessary, at individuals’ residences.” The COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act — what some appropriately note is filed as H.R. 6666 — provides $100 billion in grants distributed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to “eligible entities” so they can “trace and monitor the contacts of infected individuals, and to support the quarantine of such contacts, through mobile health units and, as necessary, testing individuals and providing individuals with services related to testing and quarantine at their residences.” According to the legislation, recipients of the grant can use the funds to “hire, train, compensate, and pay the expenses” of individuals to carry out the tasks related to testing and contact tracing. Eligible entities include federally qualified health centers, school-based health clinics, academic medical centers, non-profits, institutions of higher education, and any other entity that the secretary deems eligible. Rep. Bobby L. Rush (D-IL) formally introduced the bill this month, asserting that it will be “impossible” to reopen the economy and return to normal “if we do not step up our testing efforts and implement robust and widespread contact tracing.” “Until we have a vaccine to defeat this dreaded disease, contact tracing in order to understand the full breadth and depth of the spread of this virus is the only way we will be able to get out from under this,” he said of the TRACE Act, attempting soften certain aspects of the bill by using the phrase “door-to-door outreach.” Rush said: The COVID-19 TRACE Act will allow us to do this by creating a $100 billion dollar grant program for local organizations to hire, train, and pay individuals and to purchase supplies to run mobile testing units and door-to-door outreach as is safe and necessary, with special preference being given to those operating in hot spots and medically underserved communities, as well as those entities who commit to hiring from these neighborhoods. “I am immensely proud to see this bill receive bipartisan support and I hope to see the COVID-19 TRACE Act swiftly adopted by the House as a stand-alone bill or as part of a larger coronavirus response package,” he added: The @CDCgov says contact tracing, is a “core disease control measure” & “key strategy for preventing further spread of COVID-19.” The COVID-19 TRACE Act would allow for mobile testing & door-to-door outreach to ensure we can SAFELY get back to normal. https://t.co/YlYhCQA5rR — Bobby L. Rush (@RepBobbyRush) May 9, 2020  Absolutely. My bill, the COVID-19 TRACE Act (H.R. 6666) would create a $100 BILLION grant program for local organizations to hire, train, and pay individuals to operate mobile testing units and conduct contact tracing in hot spots and medically underserved areas. https://t.co/5YGK34ifsU — Bobby L. Rush (@RepBobbyRush) May 5, 2020  The Illinois Democrat said in the Q&A portion of his release that taking the tests “would be completely voluntary.” He also attempted to tamp down concerns of government overreach by stating in bold font that the bill “does not authorize anyone to enter your home, for whatever reason, without your permission, nor does it allow the government to remove anyone from your home because of the coronavirus.” On Tuesday, Rush continued, contending that there is “nothing in this bill that will threaten anyone’s individual liberties”: Question: How can we ensure our liberties will be preserved?  Answer: I have spent my entire life fighting for the liberty of my community & others. There is nothing in this bill that will threaten anyone's individual liberties. Again, this bill is about increasing testing. https://t.co/63pt42plvY — Bobby L. Rush (@RepBobbyRush) May 12, 2020  However, his proclamation has done little to ease the concerns of critics, who view the bill as a slippery slope. “This is nothing but a massive government surveillance program cloaked in a cure-the-coronavirus label,” the Washington Times’ Cheryl K. Chumley warned, adding that the measure “does it deceptively so, under the guise of providing a societal good.” H.R. 6666 has several co-sponsors, mostly Democrats, including Reps. Ro Khanna (D-CA), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), Tim Ryan (D-OH), Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), Frederica Wilson (D-FL), and Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL).

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) unveiled her $3 trillion phase four coronavirus bill on Tuesday that serves as a “policy wishlist” for Democrats and progressives. Pelosi unveiled the Heroes Act, which is a 1,815-page bill that the House will likely vote on Tuesday. The legislation was not negotiated with congressional Republicans or the Donald Trump administration, and even if it passes through the House, it will likely languish in the Senate. Politico reported in May that the legislation serves as more of a wishlist for the House Democrat conference’s most progressive lawmakers. Politico wrote: Privately, several House Democrats concede their latest bill feels like little more than an effort to appease the most liberal members of the caucus, many of whom were chafed that their most important priorities were minimized or ignored entirely in previous coronavirus negotiations. The Heroes Act reportedly contains many leftist provisions in the bill, including: Pelosi’s Heroes Act represents a staggering amount of spending. Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC) noted that the bill has “70 appropriations in excess of a billion dollars each.” Norman asked rhetorically, “When you walk out of secret negotiations with an 1800 page, $3 trillion bill that thas no chance of becoming law, why is that portrayed as an accomplishment?” Today's proposal by @SpeakerPelsoi has over 70 appropriations in excess of a billion dollars each. When you walk out of secret negotiations with an 1800 page, $3 trillion bill that has no chance of becoming law, why is that portrayed as an accomplishment? pic.twitter.com/VzEm9tLS9t — Rep.

The government of Afghanistan announced on Monday that it had recorded 285 new cases of the Chinese coronavirus in the previous 24 hours, Afghan news agency Khaama Press reported. The news comes as an attack on Tuesday of a Kabul hospital by armed gunmen — who targeted a maternity ward, killing 14 people, including babies — demonstrates how regional insecurity coupled with Afghanistan’s failing healthcare system leaves the country poorly equipped to combat the coronavirus pandemic. On Tuesday, armed militants stormed the government-run Barchi Hospital in Kabul, the capital, Khaama Press and Al Jazeera reported. Three attackers disguised as police officers entered the hospital and began shooting and launching grenades, Afghanistan government officials said. The gunmen initiated a shootout with Afghan security forces that lasted hours. The attack, which seemed to target a maternity ward in the hospital run by Doctors Without Borders, according to Al Jazeera, killed 14 people, including two infants, their mothers, and a number of nurses. Afghan security forces eventually ended the standoff with the gunmen and evacuated about 100 people from the hospital, according to Khaama Press. The organization and motive behind the attack remain unknown at press time, although Afghan terror group the Taliban claimed on Tuesday it was not responsible for the attack. Afghanistan’s total number of coronavirus cases increased to 4,963 on Tuesday, with 127 deaths. Most of the new infections have been recorded in the capital, Kabul, according to Wahid Majroh, Afghanistan’s Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) spokesman. Speaking to the press on Monday, Majroh said that health authorities tested 365 people for coronavirus from Sunday to Monday and 161 people tested positive. Majroh advised the public that “the spread of the [Chinese corona]virus will not end very soon,” urging citizens to follow social distancing and lockdown guidelines currently in place in Afghanistan meant to curb the spread of the virus. In late March, MoPH chief Ferozuddin Feroz warned that Afghanistan could “turn into another Wuhan or Qom” if the country failed to take health precautions against the coronavirus pandemic at the time. The Chinese coronavirus first emerged in the city of Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019, and the subsequent outbreak of the virus there was one of the worst in the world. Qom was the first Iranian city to report coronavirus infections; it also experienced a horrific outbreak that spread to the rest of the country. Afghanistan shares borders with both China and Iran. Global health authorities believe that the Chinese coronavirus initially spread to Afghanistan from Iran. Afghan authorities have been criticized in recent months for their failure to properly screen, test, and quarantine roughly 115,000 Afghan refugees who returned from Iran since the end of last year. The blunder has been blamed for the country’s exponential increase in coronavirus cases over subsequent months. It also supports the belief by health authorities that the true number of coronavirus cases in Afghanistan is much higher than officially documented. Health authorities cite insufficient coronavirus testing due to a lack of medical supplies as a major factor preventing the country from properly addressing the pandemic. Afghanistan’s failing healthcare system — a symptom of the war-torn nation’s political and economic instability — was already struggling before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, with the country’s number of coronavirus infections growing, Afghanistan’s hospitals are ill-prepared to cope with the pandemic, as demonstrated by Tuesday’s attack on the Kabul hospital.

Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) spent a portion of her time at a Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee hearing on Tuesday four health experts about their relationship with President Donald Trump, which the media has described as filled with tension and mistrust. Media reports regularly imply that Trump has a strained relationship with the health experts in his administration and on the coronavirus task force and that he has ignored science as he has led the response to a pandemic that started in China and spread across the globe. “I have a final question for each or our great witnesses today,” Loeffler said. “Some of my colleagues in the Senate seem to want to paint each of your relationships with our president during this wartime effort as confrontational and lacking consensus.” “Can you say here to the American people today whether this is true or untrue?” Loeffler asked. “I would ask Dr. Fauci to answer that first,” Loeffler asked. “There is certainly not a confrontational relationship between me and the president,” Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said. “As I have mentioned many times, I give advice and opinion based on evidence-based scientific information. “He hears that,” Fauci said. “ He respects it.” “In no way in my experience over the last several months has there been any confrontational relationship between us,” Fauci said. “Again, I would echo what Dr. Fauci said,” Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said. “We’re there to give our best public health advice.” “That’s what we do,” Redfield said. “It’s grounded in data and science.” “I’ve always felt free to give the best public health advice that I think needs to be given at the time,” Redfield said. “It’s been done in a very professional way.” “I have not had a confrontational relationship with the president,” Dr. Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), said. “He asks questions.” “I have given him my honest answers rooted in data and science,” Hahn said. “He has listened respectively to those … incorporating that into his decision making.” Dr. Brett Giroir, assistant secretary of health at the Department of Health and Human Services, said he also wanted to “echo” his colleagues remarks. “We work very closely together, all the scientists, all the physicians, and, of course, Ambassador [Deborah] Birx,” Giroir said. “We have a productive working relationship with each other and with the president and the vice president.” Giroir said none of the relationships were“confrontational.” “We have the ability to honestly state our opinions and recommendations,” Giroir said. The focus of the hearing was on re-opening America after a virtual nationwide shutdown because of the coronavirus. The plan for achieving that fell along party lines, with Republicans expressing the need to reopen the economy before more longterm damage is done, and Democrats expressing the need for continued restrictions.

Cuba’s National Television News (NTV), a Communist Party-controlled broadcast, claimed in a report that “neo-liberal” countries such as the United States and Spain are suffering severe food shortages and engaging in forced labor at meat processing facilities, prompting outrage and a social media challenge from those abroad. As the outlet CiberCuba noted on Monday, Cubans residing in the countries the report mentioned began flooding social media outlets with photos of well-stocked supermarkets and their full residential refrigerators to combat the misinformation the Cuban government disseminated. The NTV report in question focused on the high demand at food banks in the two countries, omitting the fact that the food banks actually had enough food to distribute to those waiting on the long lines in question. The report appeared to blur the line between food banks and supermarkets, as Cuban markets tend to resemble food banks more than a traditional American supermarket. For decades, Cubans on the island have been forced to spend hours on food lines, waiting to use their ration cards to purchase small amounts of food that is often sub-par, expired, or barely edible. In contrast to this reality, Cuban government reporter Irma Shelton told her audience, “In countries where the great corporations are privatized, the situation is grave. In those nations, there are also long lines of people seeking food.”  “The lines, or queues as they say in other countries, at the doors of community kitchens, the requests for food help … the skyrocketing demand at food banks in the last week: this is the visible reality of the economic horizon” of Spain and the United States, Shelton claimed, to an anchor who declared, “In the United States, millions of people are struggling through a difficult situation… the interminable car lines at food delivery places.” Shelton made the claim that, because many food banks are doing drive-through food pickup to minimize contact and abide by social distancing regulations, “There is not just a divide between rich and poor, but between those who have a car and can get on the interminable food lines, and others who do not even have that possibility.” In Cuba, car ownership is significantly less common than in the United States, as Cuba does not manufacture cars nor has it allowed mass importing for decades, resulting in most cars on the island being worn-down models from before the communist revolution. The report also omitted that many food banks in America are doing deliveries of basic food goods, meaning the drive-through is not the exclusive form of access for the needy. Another part of the segment blared a chyron reading “FORCED TO WORK” alongside the allegation that meat processing plants in the United States are enslaving people to keep supply chains flowing. Shelton also hints at potential racism in this forced labor, claiming that “in Texas, the majority of meat processing employees are Latino.” “Where neo-liberalism rules, you have to work even if you are sick,” the anchor of the news program declared. Despite being a report attempting to depict widespread hunger in America, video footage from the United States showed food bank employees pushing supermarket shopping carts full of fresh ingredients. The report did not make the allegation that the food banks are struggling to obtain food, only that they are seeing extremely high demand due to the nearly nationwide ban on small businesses in America. The report appeared to be discussing warnings from America’s largest meat processors that shortages may soon occur due to problems in the supply chain, caused by the ban on small businesses and growing numbers of Chinese coronavirus cases. “In small communities around the country where we employ over 100,000 hard-working men and women, we’re being forced to shutter our doors. This means one thing – the food supply chain is vulnerable,” the chairman of Tyson Foods, John Tyson, said last month. The Cuban news report appeared to portray warnings of potential shortages as actual shortages, however, omitting that America still produces enough meat to fuel soaring exports of meat to China. Last week, Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue predicted that potential issues with meat supply chains would result in a week to ten days. Multiple reports in Cuban exile media note that the communist misinformation report was largely met with scorn online. Some reported that their relatives on the island called them, panicked, that they may not have access to food in the United States or Spain. In response, some have started the Irma Challenge, which consists of posting photos of plentiful food at supermarkets or in refrigerators at home. Cuban exile news outlets have also highlighted the dire state of markets and communist distribution programs in Cuba. “On the island, the only available meat is sausages, ground beef, and chicken, and to attain them Cubans have to get on long lines as early as midnight, face brawls, and the danger of infection [of coronavirus] in the crowds,” the Spain-based Diario de Cuba noted. The outlet added that, by the communist regime’s admission, over 261,000 people on the island did not have access to government-rationed chicken. Diario de Cuba and Cubanet, an online outlet that publishes dissident journalists, have posted various videos of the crowds on food lines in Cuba. While some wear thin, non-medical sanitary masks, many do not, and few follow social distancing protocol. Tensions and uncertainty about food have led to disputes and even fistfights on these ration lines.   Diario de Cuba also exposed the sad state of food care packages for the elderly, which the regime claims to distribute to those over the age of 65. Featuring carrots and various root vegetables, the packs appear muddy, featuring vegetables covered in mold and clearly inedible. The newspaper indicated that the vegetables probably rotted in their plastic bags while left outside for hours as local Party cadres attempted to organize distribution.  At press time, Cuba has documented 1,783 cases of Chinese coronavirus and 77 deaths. The Castro regime initially responded to global lockdowns by advertising tourism on the island, inviting those whose vacations were canceled elsewhere to come to Cuba. In schools, the Party demanded families send their children to school with soap and water, both of which the island has suffered chronic shortages of for years. After a nationwide public uproar, Cuba slowly began promoting social distancing measures. Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.

Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D), who is facing immense backlash from individual counties for refusing to allow them to begin reopening, is now encouraging Pennsylvanians to sign up to vote by mail for the June 2 primary election. “Only two weeks left to sign up to vote by mail in the June 2 primary election,” Wolf said on Tuesday, urging residents to “join the 1.2 million Pennsylvania voters choosing to vote from home”: Only two weeks left to sign up to vote by mail in the June 2 primary election. 📬 Sign up at https://t.co/RRNyjDIYBT to join the 1.2 million Pennsylvania voters choosing to vote from home. 📍 Already signed up? Track your progress at https://t.co/oFnxjVJhmv. pic.twitter.com/z06Anlx8An — Governor Tom Wolf (@GovernorTomWolf) May 12, 2020  The push drew plenty of backlash on social media. “CHEATING SYSTEM Endorsed by Wolf,” one user wrote. “PA REPUBLICANS VOTE IN PERSON ONLY,” another declared. “Will you start threatening people that don’t register???” another asked.”Threatening your constituents seems to be your new normal. End the Democrat Lock Up!!!” “PA has over 800,000 INACTIVE voters on rolls!” another added, linking to a Judicial Watch press release detailing its lawsuit over Pennsylvania’s voter rolls. “DIRTY rolls mean DIRTY ELECTIONS…… clean it up Wolf!” the individual proclaimed. Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar (D) indicated last week that Pennsylvania voters will have the option to vote by mail or in person on election day. “For the first time, Pennsylvanians have the option of voting by convenient and secure mail-in ballot without having to provide an excuse, thanks to the bipartisan Act 77 of 2019 signed into law by Gov. Wolf last fall,” Boockvar stated. “But all counties, including those still in the COVID-19 pandemic red phase on June 2, will have polling places open for voters who prefer to vote in-person,” she added. Democrat leaders have been using the coronavirus pandemic to advance their vote by mail agenda, heaping praise on Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), who signed an executive order last week allowing all registered voters to receive a mail-in ballot for the general election in November. “I signed an executive order that will allow every registered voter in California to receive a mail-in ballot. That mail-in ballot is important, but it’s not an exclusive substitute to physical locations,” the governor said, promising an “appropriate number of physical sites for people to vote as well.” His decision prompted praise from failed Trump challenger Hillary Clinton, who said she hoped other governors would follow Newsom’s lead: I hope other governors around the country follow @GavinNewsom’s lead. No voter should be forced to choose between their safety and exercising their civic duty this fall. https://t.co/kNkSQ5quw8 — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) May 8, 2020  Clinton renewed her calls for mail-in voting on Tuesday: States and the federal government need to act with urgency now to make sure people don’t effectively lose their right to vote this fall because of COVID-19.  Every citizen must be able to cast a ballot safely by mail. https://t.co/beOv9sVeng — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) May 12, 2020  Democrat leaders, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) intend to pack the next coronavirus relief measure with provisions for mail in voting. Pelosi presented the upcoming measure as “an opportunity to remove obstacles of participation by calling upon the governing bodies to send a ballot to every registered voter.” Democrats hope to “reduce the number of people who will be gathering in such places on election day.” “It’s going to be wrath on my Republican colleagues if they do not allow for some funding to make sure that Americans can vote safely,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) warned. Many Democrat leaders, including Pelosi and failed gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, have attempted to use the April 7 Wisconsin primary as a means to justify their calls for vote by mail, even though the results do not warrant their proposals. Wisconsin held its in-person primary on April 7. While it drew roughy 413,000 people to the polls, only a few dozen people — whether poll workers or voters — were later confirmed to have contracted the virus. None of the cases were fatal, and the state’s health department added that those individuals also indicated other ways they could have been exposed to the virus, meaning the number of those who contracted the virus due to Election Day activities could be even less. Even so, the data indicates an infection rate below two-hundredths of one percent — a fact Democrats have almost entirely disregarded.

Tuesday on CNN’s “The Lead,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said the Republicans were “partisan” in their comments about the $3 trillion coronavirus stimulus package, which she insisted is not a so-called liberal wish list. Anchor Jake Tapper asked, “So let’s talk about this bill. Your Republican counterpart, Minority leader Kevin McCarthy, called it a liberal wish list of a bunch of items that you wanted to have passed even before the coronavirus pandemic happened. What’s your response to that? Is this very specifically coronavirus focused, or are there things in here that have nothing to do with it?” Pelosi said, “He knows that what he said isn’t so. Putting that aside, I can’t be bothered about what others say. What I’m proud of is what we are doing. And the fact is that in all four of the bills that have passed before, they’ve all been bipartisan, and we’ve all in our caucus agreed that everything is coronavirus-centric and also in a timely way that relates to the virus. It’s too deadly to our lives, to our livelihood, to our democracy, for us to use it for any other purpose.” Tapper said, “So, no partisanship and yet the House Republicans sound like they oppose this bill. The Senate Republicans oppose this bill. The White House, it doesn’t sound like they’re supporting this bill. That sounds partisan to me, am I wrong?” Pelosi responded, “Well, it may be partisan on their part, but it’s not partisan on our part to meet the needs of the American people. Let me reiterate — we passed four bills, all of them bipartisan. This is the fifth bill.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said former President Barack Obama should have “kept his mouth shut” regarding the Trump administration’s handling of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, calling his comments “classless.” On Friday, Obama criticized the Trump administration’s handling of the pandemic, referring to it as an “absolute chaotic disaster.” McConnell made the remark during a campaign live stream even with Lara Trump, President Trump’s campaign adviser and daughter-in-law.  A transcript is as follows:  LARA TRUMP: Former President Obama slammed President Trump’s coronavirus response, and I think it was kind of unnecessary for the former president to criticize President Trump, especially given the Obama-Biden administration did not prepare our nation for a pandemic. What is your response to that? SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL: Generally, former presidents just don’t do that. I remember President George W. Bush and his father went right through eight years of Democratic administrations after they left office and kept their mouths shut because they didn’t feel it was appropriate of former presidents to critique — even a president of another party. I think President Obama should have kept his mouth shut. We know he doesn’t like much of what this administration is doing, and that’s understandable. But I think it’s a little bit classless, frankly, to critique an administration that comes after you. You had your shot, you were there for eight years. I think the tradition that the Bushes set up — of not critiquing the president who comes after you — is a good tradition.

The Los Angeles Times reported Monday that more people worldwide may die from the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic than from the illness itself. The Times reported that extreme poverty could increase by nearly 60%: The United Nations predicts that a global recession will reverse a three-decade trend in rising living standards and plunge as many as 420 million people into extreme poverty, defined as earning less than $2 a day. As for the 734 million people already there, the economic tsunami will make it harder for them to ever climb out. … At risk is three decades of progress. Since 1990, more than 1 billion people — 13% of the world’s population — have risen out of extreme poverty, according to the World Bank. The gains were driven by China and India, where rapid industrialization has fueled major economic growth and lifted living standards. Economists say those places are likely to recover more quickly than less-developed countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of South Asia, which depend on foreign aid and lack the economic engines to rally back. Citizens there will suffer the effects of reduced spending on education, healthcare and anti-poverty programs. The Times notes that the U.N. has warned that the impact of the coronavirus could be equivalent to multiple famines. Although only a small proportion of those infected with the coronavirus will die, entire economies have been affected by illnesses and shutdowns, both voluntary and mandatory. The U.S. lost over 20 million jobs in April alone — and likely would have lost more without massive fiscal and monetary interventions that other countries have struggled to replicate. There is some evidence linking economic recessions to higher mortality, due to poorer health, suicide, and other causes. However, the Times warns that some people may lack access to food — and that aid from wealthy countries, which are focused on their own challenges, may be in short supply. In March, the New York Times fact-checked President Donald Trump’s claim that deaths from a recession would be greater than those from the coronavirus. It found his claim “lacks evidence,” and that “The opposite is more likely to be true, according to research and experts.” Joel B.

During a press conference on Tuesday, Senate Republican Conference Chairman John Barrasso (R-WY) declared that the House coronavirus bill “will never pass the Senate.” And that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) “efforts of so-called election reform and bailing out large state pension plans, trillions of dollars, will never become law.” Barrasso said [relevant remarks begin around 19:00] the bill is “big. It’s bloated. It’s partisan. And it’s a payoff to her liberal constituencies. What it isn’t going to do is focus on the CARES Act, to take a look at what’s working, why it’s working, and what we can do to make it work even better. So let me state the obvious, what Nancy Pelosi is proposing will never pass the Senate. Her efforts of so-called election reform and bailing out large state pension plans, trillions of dollars, will never become law.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

Los Angeles County officials are eyeing “with all certainty” to extend its stay-at-home order for three more months as part of an effort to combat the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, reports The Los Angeles Times. Barbara Ferrer, director of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, told the county’s Board of Supervisors that officials are likely to extend the stay-at-home efforts through July and said the country’s “hope is that by using the data, we’d be able to slowly lift restrictions over the next three months.” “Without widely available therapeutic testing for the coronavirus or rapid at-home tests that would allow people to test themselves daily, it seems unlikely that restrictions would be completely eased,” notes the Times. The report comes after officials announced Monday that the county’s beaches will reopen with restrictions. Visitors will be required to engage in social distancing and wear face coverings on the sand. “Beginning on Wednesday, May 13, beaches operated by Los Angeles County, including those in Manhattan Beach, will be reopened with restrictions for limited active uses with physical distancing as a requirement,” said a press release. “Following numerous discussions and meetings with Los Angeles County, I am excited that one of our most valued resources, the beach, will once again be accessible to the public,” Manhattan Beach Mayor Richard Montgomery said in a separate statement. As of Tuesday, Los Angeles County has 32,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and 1,569 deaths. California has 67,939 cases and 2,770 fatalities, according to data tracked via Johns Hopkins University. On Friday, California began to loosen restrictions for certain businesses to reopen, such as select retailers with curbside pickup and clothing stores. However, shopping malls, offices, gyms, and dine-in restaurants still remain closed.

Michigan state Rep. Leslie Love (D-Detroit) is blasting Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s (D) policy of returning coronavirus patients to nursing homes, making the Detroit lawmaker the second Democrat to criticize the governor publicly in less than a month. Love told WDIV she is opposed to Whitmer’s executive order requiring seniors who test positive for coronavirus to be kept in the same facility or transferred to “regional hubs.” “To return seniors into an environment, seniors with the virus still recovering from the virus, into an environment with, well, seniors, just didn’t seem — it’s not a good idea,” Love said. “That would break my heart because I’ve been on the front lines of this, trying to make sure our seniors — my mother, your mother, anybody else’s mother — does not get sick and die from this, particularly if they’re in a nursing home,” she said. MLive reported on Executive Order 2020-50 in April: To help limit the outbreak, any facility less than 80% full is required to open a separate COVID-19 unit and provide personal protective equipment to employees working in it. Any resident who is medically unstable must be sent to a hospital. If a nursing home’s occupancy is above 80% of its capacity, COVID-19 residents must be sent to a “regional hub,” the governor ordered. The state is designating certain nursing homes as regional hubs, and they will only provide care to residents who have tested positive for the disease caused by the new coronavirus. “It’s a good move, a good step to make these regional hubs, and I think as we move forward, we have to look at making sure we’re really implementing best practices, looking to other best practices across the state,” Chief Medical Executive Joneigh S. Khaldun, Whitmer’s leading health adviser, said, according to the news station. In April, state Rep. Karen Whitsett (D-Detroit) was unanimously reprimanded by party activists for being critical of Whitmer and complimentary towards President Trump. “I guess this is teaching me to be in my place, but it’s not going to stop me,” Whitsett said, Fox 2 reported. “The only person that is being irresponsible is Governor Gretchen Whitmer, and I will continue to point the finger at her as long as black people in the city of Detroit are dying and it’s not just black people.” Whitsett visited the White House to thank Trump.  “Thank you for everything that you have done,” Whitsett told Trump. “I didn’t know that saying thank you had a political line,” she said. “I thought just saying thank you meant thank you.” Kyle Olson is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Dr. Anthony Fauci on Tuesday warned during a Senate hearing that the coronavirus was not under control in the United States. Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday asked Dr. Fauci during a Senate health committee hearing about whether he believed the virus was contained. “Right now it depends on what you mean by containment,” Fauci replied. “If you think that we have it completely under control, we don’t.” Fauci noted positive news that lower rates of new infections and hospitalizations in hotspots like New York City but warned of spikes of infection in other areas. “I think we are going in the right direction, but the right direction does not mean we have by in the means total control of this outbreak,” he said. Democrats brought up President Donald Trump’s prediction that the virus was already going away without a vaccine, but Fauci disagreed. “When you talk about, ‘will this virus just disappear,’ and as I’ve said publicly many times, that is just not going to happen because it’s such a highly transmissible virus,” Fauci said. Fauci said that even though the United States could get control of the virus in the summer, it would return in the fall. “[I]t is likely that there will be virus somewhere on this planet that will eventually get back to us,” he said. Fauci said that America’s surge in testing and growing stockpiles of personal protective equipment would help prevent a resurgence of the virus in the fall. “I hope that if we do have the threat of a second wave we will be able to deal with it very effectively to prevent it from becoming an outbreak not only worse than now but much, much less,” he said. But Fauci disputed Warren predicting that there could be as many as 200,000 new coronavirus cases by June. “I don’t foresee that as 200,000 new cases by June,” he said. “I am hoping and looking at the dynamics of things starting to flatten off and calm down that we will be much, much better than that, Senator.”

NBC News is set to host a virtual town hall about what it describes as “anti-Asian” sentiment during the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, and what can be done about it on a “legislative” level. NBC Asian America — an arm of NBC News — is hosting “United Against Hate” on Wednesday, according to a report by Deadline. The report added that the event will include guest appearances by comedian Margaret Cho, filmmaker Eugene Lee Yang, and singer Lea Salonga. The panelists will include Rep. Judy Chu (D-CA), Rep. Grace Meng (D-NY), Manjusha Kulkarni, director of Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council (A3PCON), and John Yang, director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice. As for Margaret Cho, the comedian doesn’t appear to believe that the United States only engages in “hate” against Asian Americans. The Nobody Knows Anything! actress has also previously expressed her belief that America is “ageist” and takes part in “body shaming,” which she has called “a fascism against women’s bodies.” According to Deadline, the town hall “will examine the rise of racism against Asian Americans during the pandemic,” and how it can be legislated — as well as addressed on a “nonprofit and individual level.” “NBC Asian America has been at the forefront in covering the rise in bias incidents and crimes against Asian Americans during the coronavirus pandemic,” insisted Jessica Prois, NBC Asian America editor. “This important town hall will focus on the data and offer ways that Americans can help,” she added, “and our AAPI Frontline editorial series is an example of how we’re focusing on positive ways to counter hate.” NBC News journalist Vicky Nguyen will serve as moderator for the discussion.

Harvard Law School said it has “postponed” a controversial summit on homeschooling “problems, politics, and prospects for reform,” supposedly “due to COVID-19.” According to the school, the summit, originally scheduled for June 18-19, was to have gathered various education policy and child welfare advocates “to discuss child rights in connection with homeschooling in the United States.” The summit’s description states its focus was to center on “problems of educational deprivation and child maltreatment that too often occur under the guise of homeschooling, in a legal environment of minimal or no oversight.” Professor Elizabeth Bartholet of Harvard Law School had been scheduled to welcome attendees to the summit and introduce its goals, as well as to propose a “presumptive ban” on homeschooling. In April, Harvard Magazine published an interview with Bartholet that created a firestorm among American homeschooling parents and conservative and libertarian education policy analysts. In the interview, writer Erin O’Donnell highlighted Bartholet’s Arizona Law Review paper in which the professor lamented the freedom associated with homeschooling and the fact that “parents can now keep their children at home in the name of homeschooling free from any real scrutiny as to whether or how they are educating their children.” Bartholet said many parents choose to homeschool their children because they wish to “isolate” them “from ideas and values central to our democracy.” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo responded to Bartholet’s comments on Twitter, stating, “The risk to children is NOT from homeschooling. The risk is from radical leftist scholars seeking to impost THEIR values on OUR children”: The risk to children is NOT from homeschooling. The risk is from radical leftist scholars seeking to impose THEIR values on OUR children.https://t.co/4Wz9avvyr5 — Mike Pompeo (@mikepompeo) April 26, 2020  This ivory-tower screed attacking parents who choose to dedicate their lives to educating their own children, often at significant financial sacrifice, is a reminder that we must all work together to protect civilization's most successful institution: our families. — Mike Pompeo (@mikepompeo) April 26, 2020  Perhaps revealing what many have said is a lack of accurate data about homeschooling, as well as her own prejudices, Bartholet also expressed a fear that many Christian parents who homeschool were imposing their beliefs on their own children. “Many promote racial segregation and female subservience,” she wrote in her paper. “Many question science.” The professor also accused parents of deciding to homeschool their children in order to continue abusing them without oversight by child protective agencies. “We have an essentially unregulated regime in the area of homeschooling,” Bartholet said, according to O’Donnell, “but if you look at the legal regime governing homeschooling, there are very few requirements that parents do anything.” Following the backlash from her comments, Bartholet told the Harvard Crimson she received “an interesting range of accusations that I’m both a Communist — that might be most common — but also a Fascist, a Nazi, and, in a recent email, [a member of the] KKK.” She said she responds to parents who wrote to her stating they have a “God-given right” to parent and educate their children with no government interference, with, “I do disagree with [parental absolutism].” “It’s fine if parents want to withdraw their children because they want to emphasize their own beliefs and religion, so long as they can provide an adequate education, which for me includes exposing children to ideas other than those that the parents hold,” the professor said. “I think we would do far better as a society putting effort into reforming and improving the public schools,” Bartholet told the Crimson.

Former second lady Dr. Jill Biden gushed over Dr. Anthony Fauci after the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases testified before Congress Tuesday, calling him an “American Hero.” “He has become an American hero, I think, because look at how he gets on the news every night,” Biden said during a virtual organizing call with supporters in Pennsylvania. “He gives us the facts, he doesn’t sugarcoat anything.” In late April, former Vice President Joe Biden said Fauci should be the “only person” that the U.S. public should hear from during the coronavirus pandemic, seemingly casting aside other White House task force members such as Dr. Deborah Birx. The former second lady’s comments come after Fauci testified before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, warning lawmakers of “really serious” consequences if states lift their respective lockdowns too quickly.  “My concern is that we will start to see little spikes that will turn into outbreaks,” Fauci said. “There is a real risk that you will trigger an outbreak that you might not be able to control. Not only leading to some suffering and death, but it could even set you back on the road to get economic recovery.” Responding to a question from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Fauci said the U.S.’s coronavirus death toll is likely higher than the official count reported by Johns Hopkins University. “I’m not sure if it’s going to be 50 percent higher, but most of us feel that the number of deaths is likely higher than that number, because given the situation, particularly in New York City, when they were strapped with a serious challenge to their healthcare system, that there may have been people who died at home, who did have COVID who are not counted as COVID because they never really got to the hospital,” the infectious diseases expert said.  Fauci also expressed skepticism about whether Americans will be able to safely return to school in the fall, without a widely available vaccine. “We don’t see a vaccine playing in the ability of individuals to get back to school this term,” he said. 

A number of big advertisers, including PepsiCo and GM, are looking to cut back or cancel TV ad campaigns as losses grow in the face of the coronavirus lockdowns that persist all across the nation, keeping consumers from spending money on products, and shutting down new TV production. According to the Wall Street Journal, roughly $42 billion is spent annually on TV advertising. But TV ad spending already declined in the first quarter of the year due to the COVID-19 scare. Still, much of the ad revenue remained set for cable and network TV because the previously negotiated and guaranteed contracts were already accepted. However, the next negotiation period for the coming September TV season looms, and many major advertisers have already signaled that they intend to walk back previously conceived ad campaigns. Per their contracts, corporations now have an opportunity to begin canceling up to 50 percent of their commitments. The networks are mostly safe for ads scheduled to run for the second quarter this year. But advertisers have the option to cancel up to half their proposed buys with a 60-day notice and that 60-day limit puts advertisers into the fall season as of May and June. Gabrielle Union and Jessica Alba in L.A.’s Finest. /Sony Pictures Television/Spectrum Originals This is the first time advertisers have had an opportunity to retool ad buys based on the current COVID-19 climate. Consequently, advertisers are ready to scale back. The Journal notes that those advertisers include, “General Motors, PepsiCo, Cracker Barrel Old Country Stores Inc., General Mills, Domino’s Pizza Inc., and pharmaceutical giant Sanofi SA,” among others. 20th Century Fox Animation Around $2 billion in revenue was lost between Feb. and the end of April compared to the same period a year ago. But TV networks may lose up to $1.5 billion more in advertising fees during this next negotiation period.
Cable and network executives have reportedly been fielding calls for months from panicked advertisers, the paper added. “There were dozens and dozens of calls saying, ‘we need to get out of this now,'” an executive told the Journal. “It was very hard to be on the phone and not be human.” Another concern for advertisers is the likelihood of placing ads during new fall programing. With the coronavirus shutdowns of the studios, advertisers are uncertain about how many new shows will be ready to air by fall. Indeed, only Fox has put out a fall show schedule. The Journal pointed out that new programing announcements for the fall are usually made in May, but this year most of the announcement events have already been canceled. And TV executives assume that negotiations for new shows will be drawn out for months longer into the second half of the year due to production shutdowns. Some TV executives are hopeful, though, that advertising will pick up in the last half of the year once the coronavirus threat ebbs.

White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany called out Sen. Elizabeth Warren for presiding false statistics on the coronavirus pandemic on Tuesday. McEnany addressed Warren’s comments earlier in the day during the testimony of White House coronavirus task force member Dr. Anthony Fauci before the Senate Health Committee. Warren tried to use her questions to Dr. Fauci to embarrass the president, who had promised earlier in the year — when not much was known about the coronavirus — that the pandemic would be “contained.” “Do we have the coronavirus contained?” she asked Fauci. Dr. Fauci replied that it depended on the meaning of “containment,” and that the virus was not “completely out of control.” He noted that though there were “spikes” in parts of the country, the country was heading in the “right direction.” Warren then asked: “We have about 25,000 new infections a day, and over 2,000 deaths a day. I think that’s the right numbers. And some are estimating we could be at 200,000 new cases a day by June 15. Is that right, Dr. Fauci? He replied: “I don’t foresee that as 200,000 new cases [a day] by June. I am hoping and looking at the dynamics of things starting to flatten off and come down that we will be much, much better than that, Senator.” Warren then asked again: Just so I could understand — we are right now at 2,000 new infections a day, and — 25,000 new infections a day, and 2,000 deaths a day.” He said, “Right.” Warren went on to slam the president, saying that the pandemic was not under control, adding: “President Trump needs to stop pretending that if he just ignores bad news it will go away.” But the figures were incorrect. McEnany used the opportunity of a question about when the press would speak with Dr. Deborah Birx again to correct Warren: I talk to Dr. Birx regularly. In fact, I talked to her just before I came out here, because I had questions on funny numbers I heard from Senator Elizabeth Warren. And she helped me to correct those numbers, which I’d like to correct there, because I think it is unfair to the American people to give inflated case numbers and mortality numbers, because it leads to those same Americans to making the decision to not get a mammogram, to not have the cancer screenings they need. So I would like to just reveal to you some information Dr. Birx just shared with me. Elizabeth Warren erroneously said there were 25,000 new cases today. In fact, there were less between 20,000. Senator Warren said there were 2,000 deaths. In fact, there have been less than 1,000. So, I’d encourage our Democratic colleagues and all Americans to make sure we’re putting out there good information because it does have consequences. McEnany referred to mammograms and cancer screenings because she had earlier referred to her own screenings, following a preventative double mastectomy, which she has written about before. McEnany said that hospitals were empty because of the consequences of restrictions related to the pandemic, and that she was concerned about the potential results for cancer patients like herself.

Oklahoma City University’s virtual graduation ceremony was interrupted over the weekend by a hacker that replaced the broadcast with racist images. “Zoom bombing,” a term which was popularized at the outset of the Chinese virus pandemic, is an unwanted disruption to a Zoom meeting by an intruder who is able to take control of a meeting. According to a report by TIME, Oklahoma City University’s virtual graduation ceremony was disrupted on Saturday by a hacker that displayed racist images on the screen. The report claims that the hacker replaced the commencement broadcast with a swastika and a racial slur. More than 650 members of the Oklahoma City University community were watching the broadcast when the hacker displayed the images. The “Zoom bombing” incident reportedly occurred at the end of the ceremony. The hacker’s images appeared on the screen just as the names of this year’s graduates began to scroll down the screen. In a statement, university President Martha Burger said that she was “heartbroken” over the disruption to the graduation ceremony.  “We are heartbroken and outraged at the hate-filled attack that occurred at the end of our virtual graduation celebration today,” Burger wrote in a statement. “During a time that should have been focused on recognizing our graduating students, an unknown source was able to bypass the system and display racist and offensive language.” At the beginning of April, Zoom CEO Eric Yuan apologized for the numerous security flaws in the virtual meeting act, including those that allow zoom bombing to occur. Yuan promised to devote is company’s resources to fixing security problems, however this incident proves the company, whose programming was primary done by contractors in China, has a long way to go. Breitbart News reported in April that hackers were selling a Zoom exploit for $500,000 that would allow hackers to obtain access to user accounts and spy on private calls. Breitbart News published a guide in April that explains how adjusting four software settings can help users avoid “Zoom bombing” attacks during their virtual meetings.

There are at least eight candidates for a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine in the clinical development stage, and some of them could be available by “late fall” or “early winter,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert in the United States, testified on Tuesday. Dr. Fauci, a member of the White House Coronavirus Taskforce, told the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP): There are at least eight candidate COVID-19 vaccines in clinical development. The NIH [National Institutes of Health] has been collaborating with a number of pharmaceutical companies at various stages of development. I will describe one very briefly, which is not the only one, but one that we have been involved in heavily developing with Moderna. … On January 10th, the sequence was known. On January the 11th, the Vaccine Research Center met to develop a plan, and on the 14th of January, we officially started the vaccine development. Sixty-two days later, we are now in phase 1 clinical trial with the two doses already fully enrolled. There will be animals safety. Phase 1 will directly go into phase 2/3 in late spring and early summer. And if we are successful, we hope to know that in the late fall and early winter. Trials will be very representative in trying to get vulnerable segments of the population, namely minorities, to participate, Dr. Fauci, who also serves as the director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) at NIH, added later. Dr. Fauci acknowledged that in January, he told the Senate panel it would take 12 months to a year and a half to develop a vaccine successfully. He added, however, that the NIH trial for a coronavirus vaccine “moved very quickly.” “It’s definitely not a long shot. I think it’s more likely than not that we will,” Dr. Fauci declared, referring to the likelihood that the U.S. will develop a vaccine within the time frame he described in January. Alluding to the development of a vaccine, Fauci noted that the United States hopes to potentially “have multiple winners,” adding: This will be important because this will be good for global availability if we have more than one successful candidate. We also … will be producing vaccines at risk, which means we’ll be investigating considerable resources in developing doses even before we know how any given candidate or candidates work. I must warn that there’s also the possibility of negative consequences where certain vaccines can actually enhance the negative effect of the infection. The big unknown is efficacy. Will it be present or absent, and how durable will it be? Dr. Fauci noted that the NIH had launched a public-private partnership to accelerate the development of both vaccines and therapeutic interventions to combat COVID019. “The purpose of that is to prioritize and accelerate [the] clinical evaluation of therapeutic candidates with near-term potential,” he explained. “Hopefully, our research efforts, together with the other public health efforts, will get us quickly to an end to this terrible ordeal that we are all going through.” Fauci testified alongside other members of the Trump administration’s team working on combating the coronavirus pandemic plaguing the world. The focus of the Senate HELP panel’s hearing is to discuss how to get back to work and school safely. In early April, the research group Pharma reported that “there were 284 clinical trials for potential [coronavirus] treatments and vaccines underway around the United States and the world.”

Visitors will probably have to wear masks once Disney reopens its U.S. theme parks, CEO Bob Chapek said Monday. Although it remained unclear how long the Florida and California parks would remain shuttered due to the coronavirus pandemic, Chapek told CNBC that when they do reopen, guests should expect some changes. He stated: Along with social distancing, one of the things that we’re likely going to require is masks for both the cast and the guest. And I think the masks for the guests will be something that is culturally different. In Asia, as you know, its fairly commonplace, even before COVID, for folks to walk around in public with masks on. “That is not the case in the U.S., so that will be something that will be a little trying I think for some of the guests, particularly in hot, humid summers that we tend to have,” Chapek continued. Even though there was no firm date for reopening, Disney World in Orlando, Florida, will begin accepting reservations on July 1, according to the Today Show. “The location has been closed along with Disneyland in California since March 27 because of the pandemic,” the article read. Monday, the Disneyland park in Shanghai, China, reopened with tight restrictions and a limited number of visitors allowed inside, according to the Associated Press (AP). “Disney guests, many wearing Mickey Mouse ears, and children dressed as movie characters were checked for the virus’s telltale fever at the gate,” the report noted. In addition to wearing masks, guests were also required to show government-issued IDs and download a smartphone app that city officials used to track their health and their contacts with people who might have been exposed to the coronavirus. The park’s Senior Vice President for Operations Andrew Bolstein said the measures helped the company “understand and regulate the flow of traffic.” Monday, Chapek called the Shanghai park reopening a “stair step” in getting things back to normal. “We’re going to be very conservative, we’re going to be very prudent, we’re going to be very disciplined about how we open up. And then we’re going to ramp up and increase,” he concluded.

Dr. Anthony Fauci warned Tuesday that Americans might not be able to safely return to school in the fall, citing not enough progress on developing a vaccine. Sen. Lamar Alexander asked Dr. Fauci for advice to school principals and university presidents about reopening in August. Fauci said that it was “a bit of a bridge too far” to expect that therapeutic treatments or vaccines would be widely available to treat students in August. “We don’t see a vaccine playing in the ability of individuals to get back to school this term,” Fauci said. But Fauci said that some treatments like the passive transfer of convalescent serum might be available for protecting students, offering some hope to school administrators. That is derived from antibodies from blood donated by Americans who have recovered from the virus. Sen. Bill Cassidy warned Fauci about the unintended consequences of keeping kids out of school, but Fauci acknowledged that he did not have an easy answer for his concerns. “I don’t have an easy answer to that, I just don’t,” he said. “We just have to see on a step-by-step basis.” Fauci said that the guidance for schools would vary state to state, as the virus would affect different areas. “We have a very large country, and the dynamics of the outbreak are different in different regions of the country,” he said. Sen. Rand Paul cited the extremely low mortality rate for children — approaching zero in hotspots like New York. “I think the one size fits all to have a national strategy and nobody will go to school is ridiculous,” Paul said, calling for a district-by-district decision. Fauci warned Paul about children suffering from inflammatory effects of coronavirus, similar to that of Kawasaki syndrome. “I think we ought to be careful if we’re not cavalier in thinking children are completely immune to the deleterious effects,” he said.

Elon Musk’s Tesla factory in Fremont, California, is up and running again despite the coronavirus lockdown order issued by Alameda county officials. The plant started operations over the weekend producing the Tesla Model 3 and other electric vehicles will be on the production line as soon as this week. The San Francisco Chronicle reported the news using information from an unnamed worker at the factory and Musk’s social media and website postings: Tesla said on its website on Saturday that it “has started the process of resuming operations.” The company did not respond to an emailed request for comment and has not responded to emails sent from the Chronicle since March. The massive factory has over 10,000 workers during normal operations. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Twitter on Monday that “Tesla is restarting production today against Alameda County rules. I will be on the line with everyone else. If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me.” Some workers returned to the factory on Wednesday, The Chronicle previously reported, to prepare for a return to work ahead of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s announcement Friday that some businesses, including manufacturing, could return to limited operations. Newsom said that local jurisdictions could impose greater restrictions. When asked a press conference on Monday about Tesla, Gov. Gavin Newsom  (D) said he was not aware of the opening but again said that counties can put more restrictive policies in place. “My understanding is they have had some very constructive conversations with the folks at that facility — the county health director — and they’re working to focus on the health and safety of the employees at that facility,” Newsom said. “My belief and hope and expectation is as early as next week they will be able to resume.” “The county said in a press release Monday that it is aware Tesla is moving beyond basic operations allowed during the shelter-in-place period, but did not appear poised to stop the production lines Monday,” the Chronicle reported. “We are addressing this matter using the same phased approach we use for other businesses which have violated the order in the past, and we hope that Tesla will likewise comply without further enforcement measures,” the press release said. According to the Tesla website, the factory will have increased cleaning protocol and check employees for fever. More protective equipment like masks and hand sanitizer also would be in place. Testing and contact tracing were not included in the plan. “The Tesla worker said production would be slowed on some lines to allow fewer workers to perform tasks more slowly that multiple workers previously did more quickly in order to allow for social distancing,” the Chronicle reported. “In emails previously obtained by The Chronicle, top human resources executive Valerie Workman and Musk have said workers who do not feel safe returning to work do not have to.” As Breitbart News reported, Musk has sued local authorities in California over lockdown orders and that he had previously threatened to pull his company out of California to Texas or Nevada.

Tuesday on ABC’s “The View,” Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) said President Donald Trump was called out for his “racism” during his exchange with CBS News White House correspondent Weijia Jiang. In a clip, Trump said, “Well, they’re losing their lives everywhere in the world. Maybe that’s a question you should ask China. Don’t ask me. Ask China that question. OK, when you ask them that question, you may get a very unusual answer. Yes, behind you, please.” Jiang said, “Sir, why are you saying that to me, specifically?” Co-host Whoopi Goldberg said, “We were talking earlier about you-know-who storming out of a press conference yesterday after a heated exchange with two female reporters. What did you take away from it? Is it the fact that they were female? What is it, do you think?” Duckworth said, “Well, I think he got called out on his racism. He has really been targeting Asian-Americans in particular, and he was speaking to an Asian female reporter, and I think he could bully her, and she would take it. Any time strong women have stood up to Donald Trump, he like most bullies retreats, and in this case, you can see that he turned tail and ran out of that meeting when two female reporters backed each other up.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) criticized the Trump administration’s coronavirus testing record as White House task members testified before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee on Tuesday, saying it was “nothing to celebrate, whatsoever.” A transcript is as follows:  SEN. MITT ROMNEY: I understand politicians are going to frame data in a way that is most positive, politically. Of course, everyone doesn’t expects that from admirals. But yesterday you celebrated that we had done more tests and more tests per capita even than South Korea. You ignored the fact that they accomplished there’s at the beginning of the outbreak, while we treaded water in February and March. And as a result, by March 6, the U.S. had completed just 2,000 tests, whereas South Korea had conducted more than 140,000 tests. Partially as a result of that, the have 256 deaths and we have almost 80,000 deaths. I find our testing record nothing to celebrate, whatsoever. The fact is their test numbers are going down, down, down, because they don’t have the type of outbreak as we have. Ours are going up, up, up, as they have to. I think that’s an important lesson for us as we think about this future. On a seperate topic, my impression is that, with regards to vaccines, where I’m critical of what we have done at testing, at vaccines we’ve done a pretty darn good job of moving ahead pretty aggressively. And yet the president said the other day that President Obama is responsible for our lack of a vaccine. Dr. Fauci, is President Obama, or by extension President Trump, did they do something that made the likelihood of creating a vaccine less likely? Are either President Trump or President Obama responsible for the fact that we don’t have a vaccine now, or in delaying it in some way? DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: No, senator. Not at all. Certainly President Obama nor President Trump are responsible for our not having a vaccine.  

Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) said during a hearing on Tuesday that Dr. Anthony Fauci is not the “end all” authority on the coronavirus response. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, testified before a Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee hearing on putting America back to work and putting children back to school in the fall. He has served as one of the key White House Coronavirus Task Force members. Fauci said in a statement to the New York Times on Tuesday that if the country reopens too soon during the coronavirus outbreak, it will bring “needless suffering and death.” Paul, an ophthalmologist who recently recovered from the coronavirus, countered Fauci’s argument that America should be cautious about reopening the country. The Kentucky conservative said, “We never really reached any sort of pandemic levels in Kentucky and other states. We have fewer deaths in Kentucky than an average flu season.” Paul argued that state governments and localities should decide when to reopen compared to a national reopening strategy, contending that many models have overstated the number of coronavirus deaths that would come from the pandemic. “I think that … we’re going to have a national one-size-fits-all approach — nobody’s going to go to school, is kind of ridiculous. We really ought to be doing it school district by school district, and the power needs to be dispersed because people make wrong predictions,” Paul said. Paul then said that Fauci is not the “end all” source for the coronavirus outbreak and that many authorities have shown that many parts of the country are ready to reopen. He explained: We ought to have a little bit of humility in our belief that we know what’s best for the economy. And, as much as I respect you, Dr. Fauci, I don’t think you’re the end-all. I don’t think you’re the one person that gets to make the decision. We can listen to your advice, but there are people on the other sides saying that there’s not going to be a surge, and we can safely open the economy and the facts will bear this out.  Fauci responded, saying, “I never made myself out to be the end-all and only voice in this, I’m a scientist, a physician, and a public health official.” Sean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News.

Chinese billionaire Zhang Yiming, the founder of massively popular social media app TikTok, has pledged $10 million to the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator founded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Forbes reports that Zhang Timing, the 36-year-old Chinese billionaire and founder of the social media app TikTok, has pledged $10 million to the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator, a project founded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Other donors to the Accelerator include the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation, and leftist pop star Madonna. A spokesperson for Zhang commented on his donation, stating: While [Zhang] has met Bill Gates a couple of times in passing, he does not know him well but has tremendous respect for Bill and Melinda Gates’ systematic approach and ongoing efforts in contributing to philanthropy. He sees them as an inspiration for all entrepreneurs fortunate enough to be in a position to give back to the community. The Accelerator was launched in March with a fund of $125 million backed by the Gates Foundation, the Wellcome Trust, and Mastercard. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan’s philanthropic arm then announced a $24 million gift to the fund in April. Pop singer Madonna and the U.K. government have also donated but the size of their donations was not disclosed. Trevor Mundel, president of the global health division at the Gates Foundation, commented on the Accelerator and the donations stating: Philanthropic, government and private sector organizations, as well as individuals like Zhang Yiming demonstrate the wide array of donors who understand the value of collaboration in developing effective drugs  to help turn the tide of this pandemic. Until we have a vaccine, expanded testing, isolation and treatment are our best options. The Accelerator states that its mission is to coordinate research, remove barriers to dry development and scale-up treatments to the Wuhan coronavirus with fast and flexible funding. The Accelerator is working with the World Health Organization, researchers, governments, the private sector, and global regulators to get drugs related to the Wuhan coronavirus fast-tracked to market.

The city of San Francisco is facing a lawsuit filed by the University of California Hastings College of the Law, local businesses, and local residents over the Tenderloin district’s “deplorable” conditions including feces in the streets and relentless drug dealing. Tenderloin residents, businesses, and the UC Hastings Law School are suing San Francisco over the community’s “deplorable” conditions, adding that the Tenderloin district has been used by the city as a “containment zone” for drug dealing and defecation in the streets. “The deplorable conditions tolerated by the City in the Tenderloin are not permitted in other neighborhoods in San Francisco,” the lawsuit states. “This is a matter of fundamental fairness.” “What is a city-wide problem should not be allowed to weigh disproportionately on a low-income working class neighborhood,” the lawsuit added. “San Francisco should be prohibited from abandoning a single neighborhood, in an apparent effort to spare other neighborhoods the burdens that confront the city at-large.” The lawsuit goes on to state that the Tenderloin, “always a community of tolerance and compassion,” is now ruined. “Its sidewalks are unsanitary, unsafe, and often impassable,” the lawsuit affirms. “Open-air drug sales and other criminal activity, plus crowds of drug users and sidewalk-blocking tents, pervade and threaten the health and lives of all of the Tenderloin’s residents.” “What has long been suffered in the Tenderloin has become insufferable,” it added. Last week, San Francisco mayor London N. Breed announced the “Tenderloin Neighborhood Safety Assessment and Plan for COVID-19,” which in part, blamed the Chinese virus for the “reduction in quality of life and safety” for residents, as well as “unhoused” people in the community. The mayor’s plan to remedy the situation included the following: But the lawsuit against the city insists that even before the Wuhan coronavirus hit the United States, the Tenderloin community had been used by the City and County of San Francisco as a “containment zone,” which has resulted in “a dramatic decline in the livability and safety of the neighborhood.” You can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo, and on Instagram.

Two Pennsylvania district attorneys on Monday affirmed that their offices will not prosecute business owners who choose to reopen in defiance of Gov. Tom Wolf’s (D) orders but acknowledged that “inherent limitations” to their powers “unfortunately exist” — a reference to the governor’s recent threats. Wolf on Monday did little to address the frustration among Pennsylvanians who are demanding the governor to reopen their counties, instead doubling down — issuing threats to business owners and accusing county leaders who are moving to reopen of committing a “cowardly act.” Several district attorneys have said that their offices will not prosecute businesses reopening outside of Wolf’s orders, and two reaffirmed that position on Monday following the governor’s remarks. “Effectively the governor’s orders revoked our personal freedoms and liberties as individuals,” Lebanon County District Attorney Pier Hess Graf originally stated. She stood on that position on Monday but admitted that “inherent limitations on my actions unfortunately exist,” referencing Wolf’s threats. “The state may revoke your license, close your business, and/or impose a civil fine,” Graf said. “The state may also review your insurance coverage. Examples include the Liquor Control Board, the Department of Agriculture, and cosmetology licenses.” “The state acts at the discretion of your governor and my office cannot control his actions,” Graf continued, reminding citizens that, despite Wolf’s threats, local law enforcement “stands behind this community.” “We exist to protect and serve,” she said. “Our office and Lebanon County’s police departments are a united front. This includes Pennsylvania State Police.” Graf, again, reminded residents that her office “retains the authority to withdraw and eliminate prosecution” but ultimately said that the decision to reopen businesses rests with individuals, who must weigh the potential consequences from the state. “Our blanket refusal to criminalize a business’ decision leaves the individual’s choice – to open or not to open – solely up to the individual,” she said. “The decisions ahead are difficult,” she added. “They require analysis of the necessity of business against potential health risks and harsh civil penalties. The choice you make ultimately requires thoughtful and educated contemplation.” Berks County District Attorney John T. Adams issued a similar statement, affirming that his office “will not prosecute any criminal citations for alleged violations of the above-referenced orders or regulations” and adding that the office is directing law enforcement “to not issue any such citations.” However, Adams noted that the office is “remaining silent on any issue concerning potential civil or administrative penalties that may be imposed”: Civil or administrative matters are beyond the scope and standing of this office and it would be inappropriate for us to offer any legal opinions or guidance on that topic. Law enforcement and the District Attorney’s Office has no jurisdiction in matters of State Licensing and Civil or Administrative penalties Both Berks and Lebanon counties remain in the most restrictive “red” phase. Wolf has yet to issue a date for the counties to move to begin reopening.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, testified before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee on Tuesday that the United States’ coronavirus death toll is likely higher than the official count reported by Johns Hopkins University. A transcript is as follows: SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: The official statistic is that 80,000 Americans have died from the pandemic. There are some epidemiologists that suggest the number may be 50 percent higher than that. What do you think? DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: I’m not sure if it’s going to be 50 percent higher, but most of us feel that the number of deaths is likely higher than that number, because given the situation, particularly in New York City, when they were strapped with a serious challenge to their healthcare system, that there may have been people who died at home, who did have COVID who are not counted as COVID because they never really got to the hospital. A direct answer to your question, I think you are correct that the number is likely higher. I don’t know exactly what percent higher, but almost certainly it’s higher.

A 15-year-old student was heartbroken when she heard she could not volunteer at her local nursing home because of the coronavirus, so she decided to do something about it. “They told me that I couldn’t visit because they were trying to limit interaction with seniors to prevent the spread,” Hita Gupta told CNN. Gupta had been volunteering at a nursing home near her home in Paoli, Pennsylvania, for more than a year — where she was in charge of organizing activities for the residents such as bingo and trivia games. “The seniors aren’t able to see their families, so that’s causing loneliness, boredom, and anxiety,” she said. So Gupta came up with an idea to set up goodie bags — each one stuffed with an adult coloring book, colored pencils, a large print puzzle book, and an encouraging note handwritten by her nine-year-old brother. “The puzzle and coloring books will help nursing home residents stimulate their minds and keep them occupied,” said Gupta. As for the note, Gupta says her brother helps her out “a lot” when it comes to putting these goodie bags together. Gupta coordinates with the care homes ahead of time to ensure a safe drop off for the packages. “I call them and say I’m going to leave the boxes outside the front door. They usually leave it out for a few days to make sure there aren’t any germs before passing it out to the residents,” she said. She has now dropped off packages to 23 nursing homes in the Philadelphia region. As news spread of the high school sophomore’s good deed, more people were inspired to help. “I’ve heard from a lot of people and people are sharing on social media. They’ve reached out saying ‘you’ve inspired me to do a similar project in my area,'” Gupta said. Gupta initially used money from her own allowance to make the packages, but then decided to make a GoFundMe account to fundraise money and get more people on board with the project. As of Tuesday, she has raised more than $3,600. The high school sophomore says she will continue to do this project until the coronavirus is over.

The World Health Organization’s (W.H.O.) top legal officer claimed on Monday that Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the agency, has no power to invite Taiwan to this month’s World Health Assembly, despite widespread pressure on the group to do so. The remarks by Steven Solomon follow a tumultuous few months in which Taiwanese officials have consistently denounced the W.H.O. for disregarding early warnings that could have contained the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. Tedros, who leads the organization despite not being a medical doctor, has responded by claiming that Taiwan launched a campaign of racist invective against him, offering no evidence for his claims. Taiwan is a sovereign, democratic state. It has launched one of the world’s most successful coronavirus responses despite not having access to the global public health infrastructure that the W.H.O. provides. At press time, Taiwan has documented 440 cases of Chinese coronavirus and only 7 deaths, despite its geographic proximity to the origin nation of the virus, China. Taiwanese officials confirmed a fifth straight day of no new cases on Tuesday and the 30th straight day of identifying no domestically transmitted cases. The W.H.O. does not accept Taiwan as a member because the Communist Party of China insists that the island is a rogue province legitimately under Beijing’s power, despite the fact that it has never been ruled by Beijing in its history. Given mounting evidence that China hid the contagiousness of the Chinese coronavirus and censored medical experts sharing vital safety information, W.H.O. member nations are demanding that Tedros allow Taiwan to participate in the World Health Assembly, its annual meeting, this month. Taiwan has previously attended the meetings, but not yet under current President Tsai Ing-wen, who vocally rejects Chinese pressure to abandon sovereignty. Solomon, the W.H.O. attorney, responded to that pressure on Monday by claiming that Tedros has no power to invite Taiwan because the agency’s member nations do not support doing so. “To put it crisply, director-generals only extend invitations when it’s clear that member states support doing so, that director-generals have a mandate, a basis to do so,” Solomon told reporters. “Today, however, the situation is not the same. Instead of clear support, there are divergent views among member states and no basis there for — no mandate for the DG [director-general, Tedros] to extend an invitation.” The Taiwanese government responded with outrage to Solomon’s remarks, noting that the head of the W.H.O. is the agency’s top authority and thus has the power to invite whoever he wishes to organization events. “In fact, the W.H.O. Director-General does have the discretionary power to invite observers to the W.H.A. [World Health Assembly],” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou told reporters. Ou demanded “neutrality and professionalism” from the W.H.O. on the matter and decried an alleged “secret agreement” between the agency and the Communist Party of China signed in 2005 to exclude Taiwan from the public health group. The agreement allegedly demands that the W.H.O. ask the Communist Party permission for any activity involving Taiwan, as the agency would recognize Taiwan as a province ruled by Beijing. Zhao Lijian, a Communist Party Foreign Ministry spokesman who has claimed that the Chinese coronavirus originated with the United States Army, acknowledged the existence of the memorandum on Tuesday, but claimed it was not secret. “First, there is only one China in the world and the Taiwan region is an inalienable part of China’s territory. There is no need for China to ‘set Taiwan down as part of China’ by signing an MOU with any international organization,” Zhao said. “Second, there is no secrecy at all with the MOU signed between the Chinese government and W.H.O. in 2005.” Zhao did not detail what was in the memorandum if not a command to the W.H.O. to ask permission to deal with Taiwan, only stating that it provided for “unimpeded” W.H.O. contact with Taiwan. Yet the organization has blocked Taiwan from participating in the World Health Assembly since 2016 and disregarded key coronavirus information sent from Taipei for months. There is growing consensus among W.H.O. member states, though Solomon did not acknowledge it, around inviting Taiwan to this month’s World Health Assembly, which will be held virtually in the interest of social distancing. The Taiwanese Foreign Ministry confirmed this week that 13 of the nations of the world that recognize Taiwan’s sovereignty, many of them in Latin America and the Caribbean, have formally requested Taiwan be invited to the event. The United States, which does not recognize Taiwan’s sovereignty, is also more vocally calling for Taiwan’s inclusion. On Monday, the Senate approved a bill calling for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to plan a strategy for getting Taiwan back into the W.H.O. at least as an observer nation, rather than a full member. The bill also requests Taiwan’s presence at the World Health Assembly. Australia, New Zealand, and Japan have all also expressed support for Taiwan joining the World Health Assembly. The W.H.O. said last week that two member states had requested a formal discussion on inviting Taiwan to the event, but did not name them. Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.

The European Commission is set to present a plan in Brussels to remove border controls within the visa-free Schengen zone as well the introduction of Green New Deal-style stimulus package to promote so-called green businesses in the aftermath of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. The proposed strategy, which is set to be released on Wednesday, will see a phased opening of borders throughout the bloc, with countries that share “similar overall risk profiles” being the first to open. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) will be tasked with determining which areas are of low risk, in order to lift the “blanket quarantine measures” that are currently set in place. “As the health situation gradually improves, the balance should change towards full freedom of movement for people,”  a draft of the proposal seen by the German newspaper Handelsblatt said. Citing the growing economic damage being done to the tourism industry, the EU Commission claimed that any delay to opening the borders “would not only put a heavy burden on the functioning of the internal market but also on the lives of millions of EU citizens who are being denied the benefits of free movement”. In the draft proposal, non-discrimination on nationality rules will apply to the lifting of border controls, meaning that all EU citizens residing in a country will have the right of free movement when another country lifts restrictions. The move comes less than a week after the European Commission recommended that Europe’s external borders should remain closed until mid-June as “the situation remains fragile both in Europe and worldwide.” EU President: ‘The Final Word on EU Law is Always Spoken in Luxembourg’ as Coronavirus Cracks Show https://t.co/ovnrcQXB4J — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 11, 2020  The European Commission is expected to pressure Great Britain to follow suit and allow travellers from the EU to enter the country without mandatory quarantines, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced will be the case with France. “We would expect that the UK, in this case for instance, would apply the same kind of exemptions to arrivals from other member states, which are in a similar epidemiological situation as France,” a European Commission spokesperson told The Guardian. The bloc will also use the opportunity of the coronavirus crisis to push forward with its green agenda, launching a “bespoke zero-pollution & nature fund” stimulus package that will subsidise eco-projects such as converting hotels to supposedly renewable energy sources, according to Euractiv. Last month, speaking at the Petersberg Climate Dialogue virtual summit, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that Europe should focus on Green New Deal projects to rebuild the economy of Europe. “It will be all the more important that if we set up economic stimulus programmes, we must always keep a close eye on climate protection,” she said.

Social media giant Twitter will soon begin labeling Chinese virus-related tweets that contain information the company judges to be ‘misinformation’ in an attempt to crack down on messaging not approved by the W.H.O. and other “authoritative sources.” Twitter will apply the labels to the tweets of world leaders, including President Donald Trump. Axios reports that social media giant Twitter stated in a blog post on Monday that it will soon begin labeling coronavirus-related tweets that feature possibly misleading information but don’t clearly violate the sites existing misinformation policies. The company will apply the labels to the tweets of world leaders, including President Trump. Twitter’s director of public policy strategy, Nick Pickles, stated in a blog post: In March, we broadened our policy guidance to address content that goes directly against guidance on COVID-19 from authoritative sources of global and local public health information. Moving forward, we may use these labels and warning messages to provide additional explanations or clarifications in situations where the risks of harm associated with a Tweet are less severe but where people may still be confused or misled by the content. This will make it easier to find facts and make informed decisions about what people see on Twitter. Pickles added in the post: “These warnings will inform people that the information in the Tweet conflicts with public health experts’ guidance before they view it.” When asked if these policies would apply to President Trump or other world leaders, Twitter’s head of site integrity, Yoel Roth replied: “These labels will apply to anyone sharing misleading information that meets the requirements of our policy, including world leaders.” These labels will apply to anyone sharing misleading information that meets the requirements of our policy, including world leaders. — Yoel Roth (@yoyoel) May 11, 2020  Twitter will be taking down Wuhan coronavirus tweets that pose a threat to the safety of a person or group along with any attempts to incite widespread civil unrest. The company stated that it has been removing posts that claim that social distancing or face masks do not curb the spread of the virus for weeks. However, former New York Times reporter Alex Berenson has taken issue with the effectiveness of masks in a tweet thread which can be seen below: 1/ Incredible.

The United Nations has warned that the economic devastation from the Chinese coronavirus pandemic may well kill more people than the disease, the Los Angeles Times detailed in a report on Monday. One of the most shocking projections cited was made by David Beasley, the executive director of the U.N.’s World Food Program, who recently cautioned that the world is “not only facing a global health pandemic but also a global humanitarian catastrophe.” He added that this crisis could force as many as 420 million people into extreme poverty, defined as earning less than two dollars a day. “Lockdowns and economic recession are expected to lead to a major loss of income among the working poor,” he said last month. “In a worst-case scenario, we could be looking at famine in about three dozen countries, and in fact, in ten of these countries, we already have more than one million people per country who are on the verge of starvation. In many places, human suffering is the heavy price of conflict.” The U.N. and private charities are now beginning to raise the alarm among international organizations, warning that a coordinated strategy for counteracting the crisis is necessary. Last week, officials more than tripled the size of their coronavirus aid appeal from $2 billion to $6.7 billion, warning that the world is now facing “the specter of multiple famines.” “The COVID-19 pandemic is hurting us all. But the most devastating and destabilizing effects will be felt in the world’s poorest countries,” the U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Mark Lowcock said in a statement. He continued: In the poorest countries we can already see economies contracting as export earnings, remittances and tourism disappear. Unless we take action now, we should be prepared for a significant rise in conflict, hunger and poverty. The spectre of multiple famines looms. If we do not support the poorest people – especially women and girls and other vulnerable groups – as they battle the pandemic and impacts of the global recession, we will all be dealing with the spillover effects for many years to come. That would prove even more painful, and much more expensive, for everyone. The International Monetary Fund has also provided economic projections predicting a significant rise in poverty and living standards. “The IMF projects that advanced economies will contract by around 6% in 2020 while emerging markets and developing economies will contract by 1%. Yet with more people living close to the international poverty line the developing world, low- and middle-income countries will suffer the greatest consequences in terms of extreme poverty,” the World Bank wrote in its recent report, which also estimated that the pandemic will “likely cause the first increase in global poverty since 1998.” The data will undoubtedly provide for grim reading for the entire world and reignite the debate over the importance of reopening the global economy, even if this does lead to an uptick in coronavirus cases. The pressure is consequently growing on many governments to lift lockdown measures, with increasing unhappiness and unease over the measures among citizens. This is borne out by the rising number of anti-lockdown protests that have taken place in recent weeks. According to the latest figures, there are approximately 4.3 million recorded cases of coronavirus and 290,000 deaths. In normal times, an average of 150,000 people die around the world on a daily basis. Follow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.

Monday night on Spectrum News 1’s “Inside the Issues,” Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) said President Donald Trump and the lockdown protesters should be ashamed of themselves for pressuring governors to reopen their states. Waters said, “You know our governors are under great stress. The protests that have been organized, the protests trying to intimidate our governors to open up everything are protests where the people participating in that should be ashamed of themselves. They should not be encouraged in any way. They should not be encouraged from the top leadership of this country to go out and do that.” She continued, “I know the pressure is on. I know that you’re trying to hold the line. I want you to hold the line. I don’t want to see these establishments opened back up. I want the federal government to join with the cities and the states to support these families in every way that we can. I do want a moratorium on rent evictions. I have a huge bill. I have a $100 billion bill to pay the landlords. We don’t want them to risk their properties, many of them have bought a small number of units, ten units, four units as retirement property. I know that they need to pay their mortgages. I am going to absolutely see to it that they are reimbursed, that they are paid for the moratorium on evictions on their apartments.” Waters added, “So we’re doing everything that we can give support to our constituents, to our citizens, to the people who work every day, who have families to take care of. So if we do that, this will support our states and our governors and not having to open back up. So that you know the small businesses that are in direct contact with people nail shops, beauty shops, barbershops, flower shops, these are people in touch with folks every day, and they’re risking their lives, and we don’t want them opened up. We are very sympathetic to the pressure that is being put on by the president of the United States and organize efforts of these protesters. We want the governors to hold the line. Be as tough as you can be. Be as thoughtful as you can be. Do everything you can to hold the line. I know that Governor Newsom is doing that. And any small steps that he takes, he is doing it with a lot of support. We are with you, governor. Hold the line. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Veteran pop star Bryan Adams isn’t happy that his concerts at London’s Royal Albert Hall have been cancelled, and he is blaming bat-eating “bastards” and wet markets for unleashing the coronavirus on the world. Bryan Adams sounded off in an Instagram post this week in which he laid blame for the coronavirus pandemic squarely at the feet of China.     CUTS LIKE A KNIFE. A song by me. Tonight was supposed to be the beginning of a tenancy of gigs at the @royalalberthall, but thanks to some fucking bat eating, wet market animal selling, virus making greedy bastards, the whole world is now on hold, not to mention the thousands that have suffered or died from this virus. My message to them other than “thanks a fucking lot” is go vegan. To all the people missing out on our shows, I wish I could be there more than you know. It’s been great hanging out in isolation with my children and family, but I miss my other family, my band, my crew and my fans. Take care of yourselves and hope we can get the show on the road again soon. I’ll be performing a snippet from each album we were supposed to perform for the next few days. X❤️ #songsfromisolation #covid_19 #banwetmarkets #selfisolation #bryanadamscutslikeaknife #govegan🌱 A post shared by  Bryan Adams (@bryanadams) on May 11, 2020 at 8:45am PDT “Tonight was supposed to be the beginning of a tenancy of gigs at the @royalalberthall, but thanks to some fucking bat eating, wet market animal selling, virus making greedy bastards, the whole world is now on hold, not to mention the thousands that have suffered or died from this virus,” he wrote. “My message to them is other than ‘thanks a fucking lot’ is go vegan.” Despite some social media backlash accusing him of racism and xenophobia, Adams has kept his message on Instagram and has so far offered no apologies, though he deleted a tweet referring to the post. The singer’s call to put an end to wet markets echoes similar public statements by PETA, fellow musician Paul McCartney, and HBO host Bill Maher. Wet markets are typically venues that sell live or recently killed animals, sometimes exotic in nature, for human consumption. The venues are known for their crowded and unsanitary conditions. PETA has demanded the closure of Chinese wet markets both in China and and the U.S. “No matter what species they are peddling, live-animal meat markets will continue to put the human population at risk as well as sentencing countless animals to a miserable death,” the organization said. McCartney said in a recent interview with Howard Stern that  Beijing needs to crack down on the ancient practice of selling freshly killed exotic animals. Maher sounded a similar note by slamming the wet markets and calling them “the farmer’s market from hell.” The comedian called on China’a authoritarian rulers to put their absolute power to good use by finally shutting down the markets. The Chinese coronavirus originated in Wuhan though there is disagreement over whether it came from a laboratory or a wet market. One theory posits that the virus somehow escaped from a Wuhan lab and spread at a nearby wet market. U.S. officials have been investigating the virus’ origins, including the possibility that it came from a lab. Here’s a live look at a performance of Adams’ mega-hit Summer of ’69.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — NASCAR’s season started with the Secret Service doing a security check on the firesuit-clad pole-sitter for the Daytona 500 and thousands of fans waiting hours in line to pass through a metal detector. When the season resumes on Sunday some 13 weeks later, drivers will have their temperatures taken as they enter Darlington Raceway in South Carolina and they will be wearing masks as they leave their isolated motorhomes and make their way to their cars. There will be no fans allowed inside. Faced with many of its teams falling into financial ruin, NASCAR is waving the green flag on a plan it believes allows the series to safely return to racing. Only essential personnel will be permitted into the infield with strict guidelines on social distancing, access and protective clothing. There will be no one to boo reigning series champion Kyle Busch, no pre-race concert, no pomp and probably no flyover. The seven races so far announced in May are at Darlington and Charlotte Motor Speedway, tracks within driving distance from teams’ North Carolina base. Four are in the elite Cup Series and the other three are lower-tier Xfinity and Truck Series races. NASCAR hasn’t raced since March 8 so Wednesday night events at Darlington and Charlotte are the only way to cram in some of the missed events. These races will be nothing close to the weekly traveling circus NASCAR typically stages and participants will be figuring out a new normal when they pull up to the gate at Darlington. “Just the unknowns about the procedures — you can read about them all you want and we also heard through the teleconference we had with NASCAR about the protocols,” said Daytona 500 winner Denny Hamlin. “Obviously there will be a huge microscope on how we’re doing things, making sure it’s done in a safe manner. For all of us, it’s just the unknown of making sure we’re doing it the right way.” Much has changed since Joey Logano scored his second victory of the season — which has so far consisted of just four Cup races — at Phoenix in March. Kevin Harvick is still the points leader and Hamlin, Logano and Alex Bowman are locked into the playoffs as race winners. Ryan Newman will be back in the field Sunday after his horrific crash on the last lap of the Daytona 500. He suffered a head injury that took him out of his Roush Fenway Racing Ford, but the long pause in the season gave him enough time to heal and receive medical clearance to race again. Matt Kenseth has come out of retirement to drive for Chip Ganassi Racing, which fired Kyle Larson during the shutdown for using a racial slur during an online race. NASCAR is not running any practices or qualifying before Sunday’s race, so Kenseth will be cold when he climbs into a stock car for the first time since the 2018 season finale. At 48, he will be the oldest driver in the field. NASCAR had hoped to announce a revamped 2021 schedule in April that included midweek races, more short tracks and road courses, and other efforts to shake things up. Those plans have been delayed as completing the 2020 jigsaw puzzle is now the priority; NASCAR said last week it won’t race this year as scheduled at Chicagoland Speedway or on the road course in Sonoma, California. The spring race in Richmond, Virginia, also will not be rescheduled. The series, which has seen attendance and ratings drops for several years, is desperate to get going and not just for the sake of its hard-hit teams. NASCAR has issued two rounds of layoffs during the pandemic — cuts last week decimated staffing at many race tracks — and those still employed took pay cuts, furloughs or forced vacation. NASCAR last fall closed its $2 billion purchase of International Speedway Corp. to consolidate control of 12 tracks that include Daytona, Talladega and Homestead-Miami Speedway. The move gives the France family almost total autonomy of the largest racing series in the United States and flexibility to make its own plan to survive the pandemic. Still, making money means being on the track even if the full 36-race Cup Series schedule isn’t possible. NASCAR said it wants to run at least seven Cup races within driving distance for the teams before it ventures outside the South. For now, Hamlin said drivers have faith in NASCAR’s process. “I’m pretty certain that no matter what, we’re in an advantage because we’re a non-contact sport, especially with the players themselves,” Hamlin said. “I’m confident that we can go from our street car that we drive to the racetrack into our race car (and) not be within six feet of anyone, except for the person that is on the window net. “We’re going to be able to do this and it should be pretty effective.”

According to reports in the Wall Street Journal and New York Times on Sunday, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will soon issue a warning that hackers linked to the Chinese government are trying to steal data from American researchers working on a vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus. The Wall Street Journal’s (WSJ) source said the joint alert will “accuse Beijing of working to steal from American institutions intellectual property and health information related to coronavirus vaccines and treatment through hacking and other illicit means and may come within days.” “It could not be determined what evidence, if any, the planned alert would contain. A warning that China was trying to steal information about the coronavirus would be an unusually quick assessment from the U.S. government about hacking activity and would follow other allegations from the Trump administration seeking to blame China for the outbreak,” the WSJ noted. The New York Times (NYT), which claimed to have seen a draft version of the warning notice, said FBI and DHS believe “China’s most skilled hackers and spies” are involved in the effort, along with “nontraditional actors,” which the NYT interpreted as “a euphemism for researchers and students the Trump administration says are being activated to steal data from inside academic and private laboratories.” “The decision to issue a specific accusation against China’s state-run hacking teams, current and former officials said, is part of a broader deterrent strategy that also involves United States Cyber Command and the National Security Agency. Under legal authorities that President Trump issued nearly two years ago, they have the power to bore deeply into Chinese and other networks to mount proportional counterattacks,” the NYT reported. The leaked FBI/DHS assessment has support from other U.S. agencies, private cybersecurity experts, and foreign governments: “China’s long history of bad behavior in cyberspace is well documented, so it shouldn’t surprise anyone they are going after the critical organizations involved in the nation’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Christopher Krebs, the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. He added that the agency would “defend our interests aggressively.” Last week, the United States and Britain issued a joint warning that “health care bodies, pharmaceutical companies, academia, medical research organizations and local governments” had been targeted. While it named no specific countries — or targets — the wording was the kind used to describe the most active cyberoperators: Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. The NYT did its best to run a little cover for China in its article, first by asserting that everybody is trying to steal coronavirus data and tossing in a non-sequitur about Israel’s allegations about an Iranian hacker attack last month: The warning comes as Israeli officials accuse Iran of mounting an effort in late April to cripple water supplies as Israelis were confined to their houses, though the government has offered no evidence to back its claim. More than a dozen countries have redeployed military and intelligence hackers to glean whatever they can about other nations’ virus responses. Even American allies like South Korea and nations that do not typically stand out for their cyberabilities, like Vietnam, have suddenly redirected their state-run hackers to focus on virus-related information, according to private security firms. Later in its report, the NYT framed the cybersecurity warning as part of a propaganda war between the Trump administration and the Chinese, made a point of quoting unnamed critics who think the effort to root out Chinese spies from U.S. tech and academia is a new “Red Scare,” and expounded on its “everybody is hacking like crazy these days” narrative by dwelling at length upon Vietnamese hackers going after the Chinese government and South Korean hackers digging into the World Health Organization (W.H.O.). Even the infamous “deposed Nigerian princes” who want to deposit millions of dollars in your bank account, if you would just be so kind as to send them your account information, are back in the game. CBS News recalled on Tuesday that FBI officials began talking about “intrusions” into research institutions last month, particularly those which have prominently identified themselves as working on coronavirus analysis or vaccines. “The most valuable intellectual property in the world right now is to do with COVID vaccines, no question. Talking to people in the healthcare sector and the academic world, they do feel under siege at the moment,” Robert Hannigan, former director of the United Kingdom’s version of the NSA, told CBS.  Hannigan said that hackers are hitting just about everything related to coronavirus research, from university labs and government agencies to pharmaceutical companies and their suppliers – a job made easier for the hackers by the nationwide lockdown, which is forcing many employees of targeted companies and organizations to work remotely. “Private cybersecurity firms and U.S. government agencies have observed that Russia, China, Iran and North Korea have all escalated cyber activity, as well as disinformation efforts related to the coronavirus,” CBS noted.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday sided with entrepreneur Elon Musk in his fight with California authorities to reopen his Tesla factory amid the coronavirus crisis. “California should let Tesla and Elon Musk open the plant, NOW,” Trump wrote. “It can be done Fast & Safely!” On Monday, Musk announced that he would restart production despite local authorities forbidding it. “Tesla is restarting production today against Alameda County rules,” he wrote on Twitter. “I will be on the line with everyone else. If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me.” Tesla is restarting production today against Alameda County rules. I will be on the line with everyone else. If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 11, 2020  Tesla also sued local authorities in Alameda County as Musk continues to escalate his fight to reopen the factory. Alameda County officials said in a statement that they would continue to work with Tesla but added that “we hope that Tesla will likewise comply without further enforcement measures.” #pressrelease – Public Health Updated Statement on Tesla @elonmusk @Tesla @FremontPD @Dare2BWell pic.twitter.com/oU5mSnwZKR — Alameda County Sheriff (@ACSOSheriffs) May 11, 2020 

Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont (D) has fired his public health commissioner amid the coronavirus crisis. On Tuesday, Lamont announced he would replace Renee Coleman-Mitchell with Deidre Gifford, the Department of Social Services commissioner, in an “acting” capacity. The Associated Press reported among the reasons Lamont fired Coleman-Mitchell is she was “slow to act on a plan to protect nursing homes from the coronavirus.” The governor said in his announcement: I appreciate Commissioner Coleman-Mitchell’s willingness to join my administration and lead one of our most vital state agencies, which is responsible for overseeing so many critical public health needs. Her service over the last year has been a great deal of help, particularly in the face of the global COVID-19 pandemic that has brought disruption to many throughout the world. I thank her for her advocacy on behalf of the health and safety of our residents, and for being a dedicated partner in service to the State of Connecticut. CT News Junkie reported Coleman-Mitchell, “had been largely absent from public view for several weeks despite the ongoing pandemic response.” As of May 11, Connecticut has a total of 33,765 Chinese coronavirus cases and 3,008 associated deaths. The number of patients currently hospitalized with the COVID-19 infection is 1,212 and is declining. Appointed by Lamont last year, Coleman-Mitchell quickly became a controversial figure after she released school vaccination data during a measles outbreak in the U.S. According to the news report, Lamont urged Coleman-Mitchell to release the vaccination data, but the public health commissioner had related to reporters that she would not do so. During the vaccination debate over religious exemptions, Coleman-Mitchell apparently also scolded a reporter for taking her photo during a public hearing.

As Michiganders continue to defy her orders, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer lashed out at residents on Monday, saying the coronavirus lockdown is “not optional.” Whitmer was asked about business owners and residents “doubting” her authority to enforce executive orders.

They're not helpful hints." pic.twitter.com/ImffRfwPyb — The Hill (@thehill) May 11, 2020  She claimed to know how “frustrating” the situation is, before cautioning “I expect people to follow the law. “These executive orders are not a suggestion. They’re not optional. They’re not helpful hints.” Owosso barber Karl Manke has become a like folk hero in the movement to reopen the state. The 77-year-old Manke has refused to close his shop, despite repeated orders to do so. “He just wants to work,” Manke’s attorney, David Kallman, said, according to the Lansing State Journal.  “And he wants to do it in a safe and responsible way.” The Michigan attorney general sought a temporary retraining order against Manke on behalf of Whitmer, but was denied by a Shiawassee County judge. Circuit Court Judge Matthew Stewart refused to sign the order before a hearing.
 Meanwhile, Shiawassee County Sheriff Brian BeGole said his department would not enforce Whitmer’s orders.

NEW YORK (AP) — The World Baseball Classic will be postponed from 2021 to 2023 because of the new coronavirus, a person familiar with the planning tells The Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity Monday because no announcement had been made. The decision, first reported by ESPN Deportes, must be approved by the WBC board of directors, which is expected. The board includes representatives of Major League Baseball, the Major League Baseball Players Association, the World Baseball Softball Confederation, Nippon Professional Baseball and the Korea Baseball Organization. The fifth edition of the tournament was scheduled for next March 9-23 in Taiwan, Tokyo, Phoenix and Miami. The Marlins were to host the semifinals and final along with half of the quarterfinals, which also were to be played in Tokyo. Qualifying had been scheduled for this past March but was postponed due to the pandemic.
The United States won the tournament for the first time in 2017 following titles by Japan in 2006 and 2009 and the Dominican Republic in 2013.

UK chancellor Rishi Sunak has extended the nation’s furlough scheme, which sees employers paid by the government to not fire their staff during the coronavirus lockdown, for four more months. The furlough scheme had already been extended once, but has now been given a further four-month extension by the government, guaranteeing a part of the salaries of employed workers until the end of October. Hailing the scheme as “one of the most comprehensive anywhere in the world”, chancellor Sunak said paying employers to keep staff on their books rather than make them redundant during the coronavirus lockdown “speak to my, and this Conservative government’s values.” While taxpayers of the future will pay the living expenses of furloughed workers today whether they are retained by their companies or made unemployed and shuffled onto state benefits, under this system it is thought it would make it easier for people to return to work when the coronavirus emergency calms down, and without having to re-apply for old jobs. UK: Govt to Fund Wages for Closed Businesses – But Reports Claim EU Trying to Block #Coronavirus Aid https://t.co/7FWCLyJZx8 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 21, 2020  On the importance of work, the chancellor said: “We believe in the dignity of work, and we are doing everything we can to protect people currently unable to work”, noting that seven and a half million people were now on the scheme, up from 6.3 million last week. While the scheme has now been extended, it will also change. From the end of July, employers will have more flexibility, as part of the government’s plan to get the nation back to work. Staff will be able to return to work part-time to ease the transition, and employers will be expected to take on more responsibility for paying their own staff. The announcement implies the amount of government cover for salaries — which presently stands at 80 per cent — will gradually fall towards the end of the programme. British newspaper The Guardian reports paying the salaries of seven and a half million people is now costing the exchequer £14 billion a month. The Chancellor already said last week that the scheme was costing the country as much as the National Health Service. One outcome of the nationalisation of millions of wage packets in a drive to protect jobs from coronavirus business collapse is the shift towards the state. For the first time ever, over half of adults in the United Kingdom — between Furlough payouts, those on state benefits, and those receiving pensions — are being paid by the government.

Tuesday, during an interview with syndicated radio talker Hugh Hewitt, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow offered a very optimistic long-term prognosis for the American economy. Kudlow said he anticipated a “V-shaped recovery” as the country looks to rebound from the coronavirus downturn and went on to say he sees 2021 as a good year for the economy. “I think the President has been right to adopt the mitigation measures he had,” Kudlow said. “I think the shutdowns did help bring the virus to heel. I think we’re coming down the home stretch on this, and I think we’re going to see a big reopening. And frankly, Hugh, I think the second half of this year, you’re going to see much stronger growth. I’m very much in the V-shaped recovery camp as businesses open. I think 2021 could be a very, very good year for the economy.” “And I think you’ll see the President in any negotiation with Congress insist on measures that will spur growth incentives,” he continued. “You know, we’ve gone through the rescue phase, and we did what we had to do. And we put, you know, with the Federal Reserve and the Congress and the White House, we probably put in over $9 trillion dollars of assistance paid out to roughly 175 million people to try to keep the ship afloat. Now, it’s time to turn back to tax cuts and regulatory relief and things of that sort, which made this economy so strong in recent years, including the first couple of months of this year. If we can go back to economic growth incentives, we can have a spectacular second half and next year, 2021.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor

California Governor Gavin Newsom’s hopes for a hassle-free lockdown have been dashed by a new conservative nonprofit, founded by First Amendment lawyer Harmeet Dhillon, which has filed a flurry of lawsuits on behalf of California residents and organizations who allege the state’s stay-at-home orders infringe on their constitutional rights. Dhillon’s Center for American Liberty has filed seven lawsuits against Gov. Newsom (D) since the California lockdown began, featuring plaintiffs from a wide variety of backgrounds. Two of the lawsuits, one on behalf of the South Bay United Pentecostal Church, and another on behalf of several California pastors and churchgoers, allege that the lockdowns have infringed on religious liberties granted in the U.S constitution. “The Constitution doesn’t allow for state officials to treat churches, mosques, synagogues, and temples as second-class ‘non-essential’ organizations,” Dhillon said of the latter case. “Marijuana dispensaries, liquor stores, fast food restaurants, laundromats, and numerous other businesses are allowed to operate provided social distancing standards are satisfied. The same should be true of houses of worship,” said Dhillon. Another lawsuit filed by the Center for American Liberty seeks to reopen Orange County’s beaches, which have been closed by Gov. Newsom as part of the lockdown. The case alleges that the Governor overstepped his legal authority with the order to close beaches, and violated state and constitutional rights in doing so. The Center for American Liberty also represents the 500,000 members of the Professional Beauty Federation of California, a trade association comprised of the owners of beauty clinics, barbers, and hair salon owners in the state. The association is suing Newsom over the shutdown of its members’ businesses. Now all of the Center’s lawsuits against Newsom are related to shutdowns and lockdowns — one of the suits, Benitez V. Newsom, attempts to prevent Gov. Newsom from using the crisis to give a multi-million dollar handout to illegal aliens. The lawsuit asks the California Supreme Court to stay an order from Newsom that grants $75 million in taxpayer money to unnamed non-profits to distribute to unemployed illegal aliens.  “The Governor made clear in his comments that he is giving $75 million in lieu of unemployment benefits that state and federal law bar to aliens working here illegally,” said Dhillon. “It is also concerning that unnamed nonprofits, who have no accountability to the taxpayer, are going to receive and distribute taxpayer dollars.” The Center for American Liberty, launched by Dhillon under the name Publius Lex last year, aims to provide a pro-liberty alternative to the ACLU, which is increasingly accused of abandoning a nonpartisan commitment to civil rights in favor of progressive posturing. The ACLU, which used to be so committed to free speech and free association that it defended the KKK’s right to assemble, appears to have taken a sharp progressive turn in recent years. According to the call for donations on its website, the ACLU’s priorities during the pandemic are to “protect voting rights, demand that vulnerable people in prisons, jails and immigration detention centers be released, and fight to ensure reproductive health care remains open and accessible to all who need it.” Are you an insider at Google, Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, or any other tech company who wants to confidentially reveal wrongdoing or political bias at your company?

A New York Post report claims women in New York are seeking guns in anticipation of what they fear is a coming coronavirus crime wave. According to the Post, 35-year-old Nicole Rosario is a stay-at-home Staten Island mom who wants a gun. Rosario said, “It’s my constitutional right. But that doesn’t seem to matter. I live in New York which means it’s impossible. That’s crazy and unfair.” Rosario’s 32-year-old sister, Christine, feels the same. She is actually “going to ask her boyfriend to move in with her because he already has a gun.” Cassie Kramer, a 46-year-old in the fashion industry, commented: “I’ve been living in the East Village and other occasionally tough neighborhoods for a long time. But for the first time, I’m going outside and I get a bad tingling feeling. The streets are empty and it doesn’t feel right. I know there aren’t a lot of cops out and it’s just a reality that people could get very desperate.” New York is one of a handful of states where gun stores are closed; classified as non-essential via Governor Cuomo’s (D) shutdown order. And if a New Yorker thinks they can at least begin the process of taking ownership of a gun by applying for a license to have a weapon in the city, that option is gone too, as “the NYPD has closed its licensing office.” Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa commented on the situation, intimating the wealthiest members of the city will be able to protect themselves with or without gun stores, as they can afford to “buy themselves protection.” Average Americans and the poor will have to fend for themselves. Gun stores, which are open for business in the vast majority of states, reported record business in March and April. On April 2, 2020, Breitbart News reported that March 2020 shattered the all-time, one month record for background checks with 3,740,688 checks conducted. April 2020 came in strong too, setting a record for the most background checks conducted in the month of April since such checks came into being in 1998. Small Arms Analytics and Forecasting reported that nearly 1.8 million guns were sold in April alone. And handguns dominated those nearly 1.8 millions sales, which suggests self-defense was a paramount motivator.

Mega church Pastor Brian Gibson of HIS Church announced on Monday that his churches in Texas and Kentucky will hold in-person services on Sunday, May 17, and is calling on congregations nationwide to join him. Gibson recently launched “Peaceably Gather,” encouraging church leaders to sign a petition and stand in solidarity to resume in-person church services. The petition notes that the Constitution “guarantees freedom of religion and the right to assemble peacefully” and encourages congregations across the country to pledge to “exercise these sacred rights on Sunday, May 17th for Peaceably Gather Sunday.” “Your church will be open, and will welcome all healthy people in your communities to attend and physically participate in services,” it states. The “Peacefully Gather” petition acknowledges that restrictions vary from state to state but adds that the legal watchdog group First Liberty Institute “will provide legal representation to Pastor Brian Gibson and any of his four churches in Texas and Kentucky that are targeted by local governments for practicing their Constitutional rights to gather and worship.” It encourages other churches to reach out to the group, which will to offer its services “free of charge.” Gibson said in a statement: People in churches, mosques and synagogues have been told that, regardless of any social distancing or protective practices they implement, they can not gather, with threats of retribution from local governments if they don’t keep their doors closed. It is a “deliberate slap in the face to religious freedom, that a Costco or Walmart can have hundreds of people inside their building at any one time, but places of worship and people of faith can’t be trusted to implement the same safety procedures in their own buildings,” he said. “The right to exercise our religious freedoms is the definition of Essential and must not be trampled on, and every Sunday that we aren’t in church we lose more freedom,” Gibson continued. “On May 17th people of faith can exercise the appropriate social distancing and sanitary approaches, but most importantly they must exercise the Constitutional approach,” he added, warning that “rights not fought for will eventually be lost.”

President Donald Trump on Tuesday said that Chinese Americans were the “most angry” at China for failing to contain the coronavirus. “Asian Americans are VERY angry at what China has done to our Country, and the World,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Chinese Americans are the most angry of all. I don’t blame them!” Asian Americans are VERY angry at what China has done to our Country, and the World. Chinese Americans are the most angry of all. I don’t blame them! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2020  The president commented after cable news criticized him for telling a Chinese American journalist on Monday to “ask China” about whether it was a good thing that the United States was leading the world on testing. Here is the exchange: Jiang: You said many times that the U.S. is doing far better than any other country when it comes to testing. Trump: Yes. Jiang: Why does that matter? Why is this a global competition to you, if everyday Americans are still losing their lives, and we’re still seeing more cases every day Trump: Well, they’re losing their lives everywhere in the world. And maybe that’s a question you should ask China. Don’t ask me, ask China that question, okay? When you ask them that question you may get a very unusual answer. Yes, behind you, please. Jiang: Sir, why are you saying that to me, specifically, that I should ask China? Trump: I’m telling you. I’m not saying it specifically to anybody. I’m saying it to anybody who would ask a nasty question like that. Please go ahead. Jiang: That’s not a nasty question. Why does it matter… Critics of the president claimed that the president’s comment was racist. “It is racist to look at an Asian-American White House correspondent and say, ‘Ask China,’” CNN’s Brian Stelter said after the exchange.

Ethiopian troops have claimed responsibility for shooting down a private Kenyan plane carrying coronavirus medical aid on May 4, the German outlet Deutsche Welle reported on Monday. Ethiopia shot down the place in Somalia last Monday, killing six people. The African Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM), a regional peacekeeping group, has called for an investigation of the incident. Ethiopian operatives in Somalia claim they shot down the aircraft, an Embraer EMB 120, last Monday after mistaking it for a “suicide attacker” due to its “unusual flight approach,” Kenya’s Daily Nation newspaper reported over the weekend. Loaded with coronavirus medical supplies and other humanitarian aid, the plane crashed while on approach to Bardale airstrip in Somalia, killing its six occupants, Deutsche Welle reported. The Ethiopian troops were guarding the Bardale airstrip — a base known to be used by the Ethiopian military — when they shot down the plane, allegedly with rocket fire. African Express Airways, an airline registered in Kenya, operated the plane. The aircraft reportedly flew from Somalia’s capital, Mogadishu, about 186 miles southeast of Bardale, via Baidoa. The Daily Nation noted that the Somali Civil Aviation Authority gave the plane permission to make a roundtrip flight from Mogadishu to Baidoa and back, but Ethiopian troops claimed they were unaware of this and had not been notified of the flight’s landing in Bardale. According to the newspaper, the Ethiopian troops said that the aircraft had approached Bardale in an unusual “west-east movement, as opposed to the usual east-west when landing,” and that the plane was flying close to the ground. In addition, the troops said that the flight’s arrival had not been previously communicated to ground control. “There was no information that the aircraft would be at Bardale … the aircraft was flying out of usual site repeatedly closer to the ground,” Ethiopian military forces said in a statement shared by the Daily Nation. “The troops suspected that the aircraft was a suicide attacker and seeking a target to attack. Due to the above reason, the African Express Type E-120 was shot down by our force,” the statement said. After filing a “preliminary report” on Saturday, AMISON said this week it welcomed a decision from leaders of “Somalia, Kenya, and Ethiopia to investigate the incident,” according to the newspaper. Operated by the African Union, AMISOM was formed by U.N. resolution in 2007 to support the Ethiopian government in its efforts against al-Shabaab, a Somali terrorist network in East Africa with links to al-Qaeda. The Ethiopian forces who downed the plane last Monday are not part of the AMISOM coalition, and their presence in Somalia — revealed through the incident — has raised suspicion from regional authorities. “The incident was performed by non-AMISOM troops of Ethiopia, which will require mutual collaborative investigation team from Somalia, Ethiopia, and Kenya to further understand the truth,” AMISOM said in a statement on May 5, according to the Daily Nation.

Former Vice President Joe Biden admitted Tuesday morning that he had known about efforts to investigate incoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn in January 2017 — after initially claiming that he did not know about it. Biden, appearing on ABC’s Good Morning America, was asked by host George Stephanopoulos whether he had known about the investigation, and what was discussed at a crucial Jan. 5, 2017 meeting with President Barack Obama in the Oval Office. (Biden had been at that meeting, along with then-FBI Director James Comey and intelligence and law enforcement officials.) The former Vice President sighed audibly as Stephanopoulos quoted President Donald Trump claiming that the Flynn investigation was “the biggest political crime in U.S. history.” Stephanopoulos also quoted Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) asking, “What did Obama and Biden know, when did they know it.” “So what did you know about those moves to investigate Michael Flynn and was there anything improper done?” Stephanolpoulos asked. “I know nothing about those moves to investigate Michael Flynn,” Biden said, before accusing Trump of using the issue as a “diversion” from the coronavirus crisis. Stephanopoulos followed up: “I do want to press that. You say you didn’t know anything about it, but you were reported to be at a January 5th, 2017, meeting where you and the president were briefed on the FBI’s plan to question Michael Flynn over those conversations he had with the Russian ambassador, [Sergey] Kislyak.” That seemed to refresh Biden’s memory. “No, I thought you asked me whether or not I had anything to do with him being prosecuted,” Biden said. “I’m sorry. I was aware that there was — that they had asked for an investigation. But that’s all I know about it and I don’t think anything else.” He went on to attack the president for allegedly “focusing” on the Flynn issue in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. The Department of Justice announced plans to drop its prosecution of Flynn for lying to the FBI, even though he pleaded guilty in 2017, because of new exculpatory evidence that emerged to suggest he had been targeted by senior FBI officials, and that he made a plea bargain under threats from prosecutors that they would indict his son if he did not capitulate.

China’s state-run Xinhua news service reported on Sunday that medical teams dispatched to help combat the coronavirus epidemic in Zimbabwe are bringing “traditional Chinese medicine” along with modern equipment.  China is brazenly attempting to use the Wuhan virus as leverage to dominate health care across countries with poor medical infrastructure by creating a “Health Silk Road” that parallels its New Silk Road trade and infrastructure program, more commonly known as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Xinhua’s report said the Chinese medical group was already in Zimbabwe, with a traditional medicine practitioner on the roster, and received some emergency “remote training on tackling Covid-19 provided by national and provincial health authorities in China” when the pandemic broke out: Jiang Zhichao, head of the 17th Chinese medical team to Zimbabwe, had imagined many possibilities of public heath issues when he arrived in the country last year. But he has never expected to confront anything like the novel coronavirus disease, which has led to more than 146 000 deaths worldwide. In Zimbabwe, the number of COVID-19 cases has risen to 24 after a new case was recorded in Harare on Thursday, the country’s Ministry of Health and Child Care said Friday morning. The tally included two recoveries and three deaths. A Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioner in a hospital in central China’s Hunan Province, Jiang has been keen to promote and practice TCM overseas. Last year, he signed up for the medical team dispatched to Africa. Zimbabweans, thousands of miles away, seemed unaffected by the COVID-19 outbreak in China in February and early March, when few people on the street wore masks, including doctors and nurses. It was not until March 20, when the authorities announced the first confirmed case of COVID-19, that the citizens began to realize the virus was hitting every corner of the world, including their country, Jiang said. “The outbreak came as a big surprise to us, since we are planning to give full play to our know-how in the African country,” said Jiang, who arrived in Zimbabwe along with nine other members in June. The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) noted that after floating the idea in 2017 without much follow-up, China began using Health Silk Road rhetoric more aggressively after Chinese dictator Xi Jinping dropped the phrase in a phone conversation with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy in March. Italy is the only G7 country participating in BRI at the moment, and it was the scene of an especially deadly coronavirus outbreak. Other Chinese officials began talking up the Health Silk Road after Xi’s call with Conte, seeking to use the pandemic in “ways that may be advantageous to China in this moment of crisis,” as the CFR put it. “Like the BRI itself, the Health Silk Road is not a well-defined term, and it is not clear which of China’s activities fall under the banner. According to state media, the Health Silk Road includes mutual medical aid between China and Italy to ‘battle the COVID-19 pneumonia together,’ as well as any activity that might support China’s vision of ‘a new approach for perfecting global public health governance.’ This could certainly be expanded to include China’s activities with other countries,” the CFR noted. The CFR expected China to use the Health Silk Road as a way of deflecting global anger over Beijing’s role in unleashing the coronavirus pandemic, and perhaps as a way to revitalize the original New Silk Road economic project, whose supply lines were compromised by pandemic travel restrictions, lockdowns, economic crises, and apprehension about Chinese workers bringing more infections with them. Forbes quoted analysts in March who saw the Health Silk Road as part of Beijing’s “charm offensive” in the wake of the pandemic, noting that some of China’s medical supply shipments were very obviously staged as propaganda events. Forbes noted that health care fits easily into China’s strategy of using BRI to increase its political, economic, and cultural influence in developing and distressed nations: If we look back through the history of the initiative we see China stepping into countries like Greece, Italy and Sri Lanka and trying to rebuild their shattered economic realities…in exchange for a bigger footprint for Chinese companies, more leverage for Beijing, and, of course, piles of debt. We only need to remember that China’s takeover of Greece’s Pireaus Port was a direct result of the 2008 financial crisis. [Center for Strategic and International Studies analyst Jonathan] Hillman says that China’s moves during the pandemic are “orchestrating a Belt and Road echo chamber. Recipients need assistance and they’re praising Beijing’s response [to the outbreak] to get it. China has been able to get statements of praise from Pakistan, Serbia, Ethiopia and Italy—all countries it has cultivated political and economic ties with through BRI.” The World Health Organization (W.H.O.) applauded China’s Health Silk Road idea when it was first proposed in 2017. Analysts speculated the Health Silk Road could be China’s Plan B for dominating global health care if WHO collapses, or is purged of Chinese Communist Party influence. National Bureau of Asian Research fellow Nadege Rolland described the Health Silk Road as “the clearest example of the fact that BRI is not about infrastructure construction, but a broader effort to redraw the world according to Beijing’s preferred design.”

For what are obviously partisan reasons, the media are desperate to stay focused on the coronavirus death count, even though there is not much that can be done about those deaths. The media “guardians” at both CNNLOL and the far-left Washington Post  are demanding the media stay tightly focused on death-death-death. But other than to exploit those deaths for political purposes — you know, pretending every death is President Trump’s fault, scare people into staying home, bully governors into keeping their states closed so we enter a Great Depression and elect Rapey Joe Biden to save us in November — this is all, well, pretty stupid and not a little anti-science. I hate to be the bearer of bad news… But there’s not much we can do about the China Virus. I know nobody wants to hear that. I know we all want the disaster movie we’re living through to end in an American triumph. But that is almost certainly not going to happen, at least not in the foreseeable future. Let’s put away the politics and bullshit and look at this like clear-eyed adults who respect science and human nature. To begin with… Government’s pretty much done everything it can, and did so pretty successfully… In other words, everyone who required health care got the healthcare they required; the health care system didn’t crash; the public is well-informed about what’s necessary to avoid infection… So what the hell else are we supposed to do? COVID-19 is a contagious virus with no vaccine, no cure, and none coming in the foreseeable future — if at all. Again, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the China Virus is a new fact of life and will be, maybe forever. There are really only three ways out of this:  1) If there is no cure, we can lockdown forever, 2) we can lockdown for the year or five years until there’s a vaccine, or  3)  We can go on about our business in the hope the miracle that put an end to the Spanish Flu and Hong Kong Flu  saves us. The Spanish Flu epidemic of 1918… Did you know there’s still no cure for that? In some form, it’s still out there. What saved future generations was either the virus mutating into a less lethal strain after its third wave in 1919, but before its fourth wave in 1920, or it was herd immunity — or it was some combination of both. Either way, the Spanish Flu is still around. Before it was over, worldwide that sucker infected 500 million, and anywhere from 50 to 100 million died, including some 500,000 to 675,000 Americans. In 1968, the Hong Kong Flu hit, killing one to three million worldwide and around 100,000 here in America. The Hong Kong Flu is still out there infecting people every flu season. No one’s arguing we surrender. Of course the government and private industry should continue to seek therapeutics and a cure, just the like we do for heart disease, cancers, deaths by car accidents, and the next strain of flu… In 2017, 80,000 Americans died of the flu… The regular flu. Wash your hands, don’t touch your face, social distance (when possible), wear a mask (if you don’t feel well)… What else does the media want Trump to do? What else does the media want the rest of us to do? Are we really going to shut down our country forever over a virus? Are we really — and for the first time in history — going to keep the healthy quarantined forever over a virus? Using fear porn straight through to November, does the media truly intend to hype each and every coronavirus death as though it’s a government failure, as though it’s Trump’s fault? Probably, but fear porn and the stress and isolation that come with it include their own health risks and death count. Anywhere from 250,000 to 440,000 Americans die each year from medical errors. If the media really care about saving lives, they should start focusing on those, because those deaths are actually preventable. My overall worry is that the only way out of this ends up being herd immunity, and then we discover the ultimate death toll ended up being higher than it needed to be because we refused to bite the bullet as early as we should have. Trump isn’t helping. Instead of telling us the truth, which is Government can’t do anything else without a vaccine, so you need to wash  your hands and go back to work, he keeps promising vaccines that may never come and therapeutics that might never work. He needs to urge us to move on. Instead, he has us waiting on a miracle. And we also need to acknowledge the death toll of not returning to normal, the death toll of massive unemployment and economic devastation, the death tolls of increased suicides, drug use, and depression. Again, if we’re going to put bullshit aside, it really is time to move on and accept the coronavirus as an unfortunate fact of life, wash our hands more often, and get back to normal.  Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

The Chinese coronavirus is no longer at epidemic levels in the United Kingdom as the rate of community transmission has fallen, a team of Oxford University experts claim. A study conducted by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in conjunction with Oxford University, Manchester University, and Public Health England (PHE), found that an estimated 136,000 people — 0.24 per cent of adults — are currently infected with the virus. A surveillance rate of over 40 infected people per 10,000 is required for a disease to be declared an epidemic. The figures from the ONS place the current rate at 24 in 10,000, while a separate study from the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) found that the rate could be as low as 3 in 10,000. Professor Carl Heneghan and Tom Jefferson, of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford, said that the low numbers from the RCGP may be attributable to asymptomatic people not getting tested, but added that the overall number of respiratory infections has still dropped dramatically. “The current community transmission of Covid is low, and not at epidemic levels,” the professors said per The Telegraph, adding: “Rates of upper respiratory tract infections and lower respiratory tract infections have fallen significantly since March when social distancing measures were introduced.” “The observed reductions in upper respiratory tract infections and lower respiratory tract infections suggest that most of the effect on rates of transmission occurred through the encouragement of social distancing,” the experts said, but went on to note that “some of this fall would happen naturally at this time of year with the onset of spring.” So far the team at Oxford and the ONS have taken samples from 7,087 people across the country, yet it plans on testing some 300,000 people over the course of the next year. UK Govt Lockdown: Enjoy a Game of Tennis, But Don’t Have a Drink in the Clubhouse After https://t.co/BWY04wKPqq — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 11, 2020  Professor Heneghan said that the current rate of infection “suggests that, at peak, we had loads more cases than we realised,” meaning that the virus is likely less deadly than initially believed. At the outset of the crisis, the government’s coronavirus predictions claimed that up to 550,000 people could lose their lives to the Chinese virus.  This was based on modelling done by Professor Neil Ferguson, who has since resigned from his government post in disgrace, after breaking the very lockdown rules he advocated for in order to receive visits from his married left-wing activist lover. The projections by Ferguson, which have come under increased scrutiny, spurred the British government to introduce sweeping emergency powers under the Coronavirus Act to prevent such a doomsday scenario. On Monday, the government announced what it is calling a “cautious roadmap” for easing the national lockdown restrictions that were set in place in March, yet many restrictions will be left in place for the foreseeable future. The government said that the country “cannot afford to make drastic changes”, warning that should the restrictions be fully lifted it would “lead to a resurgence of the virus and a second wave that could be larger than the first”.

Commuters should consider “all other forms of transport” before taking a train or bus, the government has said, as it concedes adhering to social distancing rules may not be possible on public transport. As the government urges those who can to return to work this week, new guidance has been issued to both travellers and transport service providers on how best to move between the home and place of employment, under the new coronavirus regime where close contact with strangers has been officially forbidden. While the vast majority of commuting journeys in the United Kingdom take place in private vehicles, this is less common in heavily urbanised areas, like London and the South West, where the use of public transport is more pronounced. Although the guidance makes clear that travellers should “Consider all other forms of transport before using public transport”, if that remains impossible there are a range of other precautions advised for those stuck underground in a metal tube with hundreds of other people during a time of infection control. The British government has now decided — after months of insisting they were pointless — that the public wearing masks in public does actually serve a purpose, and commuters are being asked to wear them, as well as being told to wash their hands and being aware of “the surfaces you or others touch.” But despite the government’s stiff insistence — still enforced by police control and now-increased fines — that members of the public remain more than two meters away from each other, the document clearly notes such distancing would be impossible on a busy train or bus. To reduce contact with others, commuters are implored instead to simply act antisocial and turn their backs. The document says: The risk of infection increases the closer you are to another person with the virus and the amount of time you spend in close contact: you are very unlikely to be infected from just walking past another person. There may be situations where you can’t keep a suitable distance from people, for example when boarding or alighting, on busier services, at busier times of day and when walking through interchanges. In these cases you should avoid physical contact, try to face away from other people, and keep the time you spend near others as short as possible. If you can, wear a face covering on public transport.

ROME — The Italian government has announced that coffee bars, restaurants, hairdressers, retail shops, and other establishments may reopen on May 18 instead of June 1 as previously stipulated. In recent days, Italy has experienced a rise in public expression of discontent with the extended lockdown, with spontaneous protests forming in piazzas throughout the country. May 18 will also see the end of the obligation to carry the detested “autocertificazione” papers, subject to police verification at random stop-checks. The decision arose out of a meeting Monday between representatives of the national government and that of the individual regions. The Italian government was quick to reaffirm its control over all activities and its ability to shut down establishments where safety guidelines and protocols are not followed to the letter. Wearing masks has become the new symbol of compliance with the government, as well as a constant reminder that the state is in charge and things will not go back to normal until authorities say so. Curiously, masks were not required during the first two months of the lockdown when infections were still relatively high, but are now mandatory as other restrictions are eased. The government said it will also intervene if it is not pleased with data trends regarding the contagion curve, according to criteria defined by a circular from the Ministry of Health. “The phase of responsibility for the regions begins,” stated the Minister of Autonomies Francesco Boccia. The timing and methods for reopening borders between Italy’s regions has not yet been determined, ANSA news service reported. “The Prime Minister has allowed the regions to present a program of openings for the 18th,” said Luca Zaia, president of the Veneto region. “Veneto, with extreme consistency, will present during the week a total restart.” Zaia said that Mr. Conte had “accepted the regions’ request for autonomy” in the management of phase 2 of the lockdown, which had been made in recent days via a letter from the governors to the premier. The number of active coronavirus cases in Italy has been in steady decline for the past two weeks and deaths at the national level have slowed to a trickle. Some of Italy’s regions have been virtually unaffected by the virus from the outset, but until now have been under the same restrictions as the rest of the country. Follow @tdwilliamsrome

China slapped an import ban on four Australian abattoirs Tuesday in an escalation of Beijing’s warning of a consumer boycott in retaliation for Canberra’s push for an independent coronavirus probe. The beef ban comes just days after China flagged plans to slap an 80 percent tariff on Australian barley, bringing the trade to its knees. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> Analysts said the move raised concerns of a possible standoff between Australia and its most important trading partner that could spill over into other crucial sectors as the world struggles to navigate the disease-induced economic crisis. The Financial Times reports China is Australia’s largest trade partner, with two-way trade worth $153bn in the year to the end of June 2019. However, bilateral relations have sunk following Canberra’s passage of tough foreign interference laws in 2018, which were aimed mainly at Beijing, and its more recent calls both for a coronavirus probe and an end to China’s live animal wet markets.
Australian Trade Minister Simon Birmingham tried to allay fears of a trade war overnight, saying shipments of meat from the abattoirs had been suspended over “minor technical” breaches. “We are concerned that the suspensions appear to be based on highly technical issues, which in some cases date back more than a year,” he added. “We will work with industry and authorities in both Australia and China to seek to find a solution that allows these businesses to resume their normal operations as soon as possible.” The four meatworks account for around 35 percent of Australia’s beef exports to China in a trade worth about Aus$1.7 billion (US$1.1 billion), according to national broadcaster ABC. Tensions between the two have increased since Australia started calling for an independent investigation into the origin of the coronavirus outbreak, which began in China before spreading around the world, killing more than 280,000, infecting millions and shattering the global economy. China Warns Australia: Drop Coronavirus Probe or Pay an Economic Price https://t.co/V54exGJuOT — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 27, 2020  But the calls have drawn retaliatory threats from Beijing, with ambassador Cheng Jingye calling them “dangerous.” In an interview with the Australian Financial Review last month, he said: “The Chinese public is frustrated, dismayed and disappointed with what Australia is doing now. “If the mood is going from bad to worse, people would think ‘why should we go to such a country that is not so friendly to China?’ The tourists may have second thoughts.” He added: “It is up to the people to decide. Maybe the ordinary people will say ‘Why should we drink Australian wine? Eat Australian beef?'” It now appears China is ready to make good on the threat because Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison has shown no intention of backing down. Australia however is not alone in its fight against China. As Breitbart news reported, a bipartisan U.S. Congress group has slammed China for threatening punitive economic sanctions against any country that opposes it. The 27 senators and House of Representatives members said China had made “deeply disturbing” threats against long-term ally Australia and the U.S. will stand with the Aussies against China’s bullying.

Frequent attendance at religious services dramatically reduces deaths from suicide, alcohol, and drugs, according to study by researchers from Harvard University. The study, spearheaded by Dr. Ying Chen of the Department of Epidemiology at Harvard’s T. H. Chan School of Public Health, found that “attendance at religious services at least once per week” was associated with a 33 percent lower hazard among men and a remarkable 68 percent lower hazard of death from despair among women compared with never attendance. The researchers embarked on their study because the increase in deaths related to drugs, alcohol, and suicide (referred to as “deaths from despair”) has been identified as a public health crisis and yet the antecedents associated with these deaths have “seldom been investigated empirically.” As the most extensive study of its kind, the team followed a large cohort of more than 100,000 nurses and health care professionals in the United States over a 17-year period and finally published their results on May 6. Employing a definition of “deaths from despair” as “deaths from suicide, unintentional poisoning by alcohol or drug overdose, and chronic liver diseases and cirrhosis,” the team followed 66,492 female participants, among whom 75 incident deaths from despair were identified, and 43,141 male participants, among whom there were 306 incident deaths from despair. According to the researchers, the findings suggest that “religious service attendance is associated with a lower risk of death from despair among health care professionals. These results may be important in understanding trends in deaths from despair in the general population.” The Harvard study seems to corroborate the results of similar studies linking religious practice with mental health. In a 2015 article in the Psychiatric Times, for instance, Drs. Rob Whitley and Eric Jarvis insisted that tapping into religious faith is important for assisting patients in their recovery. “Religiosity has consistently been identified as a factor that can promote healing and facilitate recovery amongst those with various physical and mental illnesses,” the authors observed. Whitley and Jarvis noted that the research in this area reveals that belonging to a religious community can furnish needed support during material, ethical, and emotional challenges in a person’s life. The authors also noted that research indicates that religiously inclined patients engage in many activities that are beneficial to their mental health, including prayer, devotional readings, listening to spiritual music, and listening to sermons on TV, the internet, or the radio. Such practices “can also involve public activities, which are more social in orientation, such as going to a place of worship or attending a sacred-text study group,” the authors noted. “All of these activities can foster a sense of coherence and social support that is health-promoting and may be encouraged.” Given the vital ties between religious practice and good mental health, it may be considered surprising that during the coronavirus pandemic, many governments categorized church services as non-essential activities that could easily be set aside, whereas tobacconists, newspaper stands, and abortion clinics were allowed to remain open for regular business.

A call by the United Nations for a global ceasefire to help restore world peace and understanding during the Chinese coronavirus pandemic was branded “a catastrophic failure” Tuesday by Oxfam International. The international charitable organization published a report saying the U.N. has been totally ignored in its efforts to be a peacebroker. It outlined that fighting continues unabated across war-torn countries, undermining global efforts to combat the viral epidemic which has infected more than 4.1 million people and caused more than 280,000 deaths worldwide. The report follows nearly two months after U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ initial appeal for an end to war, as Breitbart News reported. Today I am calling for an immediate global ceasefire in all corners of the world. It is time to put armed conflict on lockdown and focus together on the true fight of our lives – the #COVID19 pandemic.https://t.co/F6JRA6ekvZ pic.twitter.com/7WgtFMk5GC — António Guterres (@antonioguterres) March 23, 2020  The cease-fire remains unattained due to the U.N. Security Council’s “diplomatic failure” to collectively broker a resolution amid the deadlock, the Oxfam report observed, and its absence is expatriated by years of investment in peace-building and countries continuing to sell weapons for use in war-torn regions. “We expect leadership from the council as well as many of those countries who say they support a cease-fire, but who nevertheless remain active participants in conflicts around the world conducting military operations, selling arms and supporting third parties,” Oxfam Interim Executive Director Jose Maria Vera said in a statement. The U.N. also called for $2 billion to be transferred from wealthy countries to the poor via the globalist body as an aid in tackling the global pandemic which has fallen short. That slim financial response prompted another call for funds last week, lifting the target to $6.7 billion to accommodate the U.N.’s all new, specially updated global plan to counter the viral epidemic.

The pandemic model used by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to justify Britain’s ongoing lockdown policy is so poor that it is ‘somewhere between negligence and unintentional but grave scientific misconduct’, a computer expert has warned. Virologist and clinical computational epidemiologist Chris Von Csefalvay is the latest expert to cast a critical eye over Professor Neil Ferguson’s influential Imperial College study – the one that predicted more than 500,000 deaths in the UK alone from the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. Von Csefalvay is not impressed. Reviewing it on his website Bits and Bugs, he writes that while he was initially supportive of Ferguson and his modelling, he has changed his mind now that he has seen the code which ‘raises some extremely serious questions.’ Professor Lockdown Resigns After Breaking Own Lockdown Rules to Meet Left-Wing 'Open Marriage' Lover: Report https://t.co/N8LmFZSrKS — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 5, 2020  The coding quality, he says, is poor: First of all, the elephant in the room: code quality. It is very difficult to look at the Ferguson code with any understanding of software engineering and conclude that this is good, or even tolerable It has been swallowed whole by a gullible government which really should have known better than treat it with such credulousness: Yet for some reason, the UK government treated Ferguson’s model as almost dogmatic truth. This highlights an important issue: politicians have not been taught enough about data-driven decision-making, especially not where predictive data is involved. There is wide support for a science-driven response to COVID-19, but very little scrutiny of the science behind many of the predictions that informed early public health measures. Hopefully, a Royal Commission with subpoena powers will have the opportunity to review in detail whether Ferguson intentionally hid the model from HM Government the way he hid it from the rest of the world or whether the government’s experts just did not understand how to scrutinise or assess a model – or, the worst case scenario: they saw the model and still let it inform what might have been the greatest single decision HM Government has made since 1939, without looking for alternatives (there are many other modelling approaches, and many developers who have written better code) He concludes that it will result in: …a massive leap backwards, erosion of trust and a complete disclaimer of accountability by publicly funded scientists. Von Csefalvay is far from alone in his scepticism towards Ferguson. Another review, by Craig Pirrong, Professor of Finance and Energy Markets Director of the Global Energy Management Institute at the Bauer College of Business, University of Houston, concludes: “Models only become science when tested against data/experiment. By that standard, the Imperial College model failed spectacularly.” Even before this, Ferguson’s track record had been widely criticised, as reported: Delingpole: Ferguson’s Dodgy Model Has Engendered a World-Historical Blunder Delingpole: Who Would Buy a Used Computer Model from ‘Bonking Boffin’ Neil Ferguson? Delingpole: Why Must Coronavirus Decision Makers Be Clouded in Secrecy? Ferguson earned his nicknames Professor Pantsdown and the Bonking Boffin when he was exposed as a hypocrite for having allowed his married mistress to break the lockdown by visiting him for trysts at his home. Despite all this, Boris Johnson and his Cabinet colleagues continue to cite Ferguson’s discredited study as if it were the gold standard of scientific research. Boris even mentioned it in his speech on Sunday night when, attempting to justify the continuation of the lockdown, he claimed: It is a fact that by adopting those measures we prevented this country from being engulfed by what could have been a catastrophe in which the reasonable worst-case scenario was half a million fatalities. Interesting use of the word ‘fact’ in that sentence, Boris.

TEL AVIV – Israel will transfer as much as NIS 800 million ($228 million) to the Palestinian Authority (PA) to cover projected losses over the coronavirus pandemic, Israeli and PA officials told The Times of Israel. According to Palestinian Finance Minister Shukri Bishara, Ramallah’s economy would collapse if the monthly tax revenues on imports and exports, collected by Israel and transferred to the PA, fell below NIS 500 million ($142 million). The PA’s monthly tax revenues usually add up to NIS 750 million, from which Israel takes off around NIS 250 million to cover water, electricity and healthcare bills owed by it, Bishara explained. Finance Ministry officials from both sides signed an agreement on Monday, the report said. The loan would take place over the next five months and amount up to NIS 800 million. Over the past two years, Israel has deducted monies in taxes owed to the PA equivalent to the stipends paid out in the PA’s so-called “pay-for-slay” scheme rewarding convicted terrorists and their families. According to PA Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh, the total sum of last year’s withheld funds amounted to NIS 700 million ($200 million). The PA for its part has vowed to keep up the payments.  

French police in the department of Bas-Rhin in Alsace arrested four individuals advertising drugs on social media, and offering free hand sanitiser and medical masks with each purchase. The four people arrested, three men aged between 27 and 28 and one woman aged 40, advertised the sale of cannabis resin, cocaine and ecstasy through the popular social media mobile app Snapchat and offered to deliver the illegal drugs to the homes of their customers. Investigators say the four travelled up to 500 kilometres in two days delivering drugs in the area and not only offered masks and hand sanitizer but made sure to fill out lockdown travel certificates that claimed they were travelling to pharmacies to pick up medicine. When police arrested the drug traffickers in the city of Strasbourg and the commune of Matzenheim, they found at least 35,000 euros in cash. All four have been placed in pre-trial detention on charges of drug trafficking. Youths Arrested with Large Amount of Drugs Say They Stocked up for Ramadan https://t.co/UaqSrLaiCJ — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 29, 2020  The arrests come as French drug dealers have struggled with a shortage of supplies due to to the Wuhan coronavirus lockdown not only in France but in other countries where illegal drugs flow to and from. Many others have also adapted to the lockdown measures, which were eased in France on Monday, by using social media apps to advertise. Some have warned that the lack of supply and higher prices could mean increased violence between drug-dealing gangs with an investigator from the Ile-de-France region stating last month: “If the supply does not start again, and if the confinement lasts longer, it could become hot in certain cities.” While most French have obeyed the lockdown orders that began in mid-March, many urban youths have largely ignored them and used opportunities to attack police in certain “vulnerable” neighbourhoods. The department of Yvelines saw a large number of anti-police attacks during the lockdown, with officers complaining of being attacked daily over a two week period last month.

During a speech on the Senate floor on Monday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) argued that there should be coronavirus oversight hearings in Congress “several” times a day and such hearings “should occur in every committee, every week.” Schumer said, “We should be holding multiple, serious oversight hearings every week. Several of my colleagues on the other side, including the Republican leader, have said they want to see how the legislation we’ve already passed is working before doing anything else. At the same time, the Republican majority is slow-walking the hearing process. Finally, after a lot of Democratic pressure from myself and many others, the leader is sort of eking out week-by-week hearings. We’ve just heard we’ll hear from Powell and Mnuchin on the 19th. That will be almost two months after a bill that let $4 trillion of lending authority be released before there’s a hearing. Why didn’t we hold a hearing 3 weeks ago? 5 weeks ago? Last week? It’s just outrageous. … Now, tomorrow, in the HELP Committee, there will be a hearing conducted remotely with Dr. Fauci. This is the kind of hearing we need. Not once a week, but several a day. The American people need to hear from experts in a fair, open, and truthful setting.” He added, “But it shouldn’t be this one committee hearing tomorrow. And it shouldn’t be Dr. Fauci alone testifying, or even with the two he’s testifying with. This is the routine oversight business of Congress and now — we’re now in a crisis. It should occur in every committee, every week. There should be testimony from administration officials ranging from Dr. Birx, to Secretary Mnuchin, to Secretary DeVos, and others.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

TEL AVIV  – Three Arab Gulf states have reached out to Israel for help in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, a representative from Israel’s leading hospital said Sunday. The United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and a third, unnamed country have been in regular contact with the the Sheba Medical Center, Yoel Hareven, who heads the hospital’s international division, said. Bahrain and the UAE were already in touch with the hospital before the outbreak. In March, a senior member of the Emirati royal family came on a private visit to the hospital. “There is a growing readiness to interact with us, even openly, in the health sphere,” The Times of Israel quoted Hareven as saying. “These things happen slowly, but they happen, maybe not at the [inter-governmental] level as we would have liked, but things are happening.” The third country, likely Kuwait, has asked for help installing a telemedicine system to treat COVID-19 patients remotely. According to Hareven, the contract will likely end in future cooperation between the two countries on a governmental level. Arab Gulf states recognize Israel’s innovation prowess, especially in the health sector, and are even beginning to acknowledged it publicly, Hareven said. “You open a small crack and the foot enters the door, and later the whole body and then the head come in,” he said. “It’s indeed the beginning of a very fascinating journey — for the entire Israeli public, not only for the medical field or Sheba Medical Center.” “How do we take this one step forward [to the establishment of diplomatic ties]? That’s for the politicians and diplomats to decide. We’re enablers who provide the platform for this process.” Rabbi Marc Schneier, who helped establish the connection between Sheba and the Bahraini government, said that three of the six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council are now engaged with Israel’s health system. “That’s 50 percent representation in the Gulf. That is a very significant development,” he said in a telephone interview with The Times of Israel. “Throughout the pandemic I have been in contact with all my friends in the Gulf, members of the royal families, ambassadors and so on. They continue to express a desire to cooperate and work with Israel, particularly when it comes to the health industry.” “I’ve heard this repeatedly from my friends in the Gulf: COVID-19 is a real opportunity for joint cooperation,” he told the paper. Last week, the Emirati ambassador to the United Nations in New York, Lana Nusseibeh, would not confirm any joint Israel-UAE cooperation but said it shouldn’t be off the table. “I’m sure there is a lot of scope for cooperation. I don’t think we would be opposed to it, because I really think the public health space should be an unpoliticized space, where we all try and pool our knowledge of this virus,” she said at an online conference hosted by the American Jewish Committee. The fight against the pandemic “should not have any borders or boundaries.” She noted workshops held in the past between Israeli medical professionals’ and their Emirati. She also hailed an Israeli lab for its “breakthrough” in finding an antibody for the coronavirus.  “That is very exciting for all of us… because we are also working on similar therapeutics, so there is potentially room for cooperation there.”  

Author Michael Lewis over the weekend said President Donald Trump has been a “really crappy coach” during the coronavirus crisis and argued that the Trump administration never “assumed the responsibility of managing” the federal government’s “portfolio of risks” because the transition period was so “chaotic.” Speaking to CNN’s Wolf Blitzer,  The Blind Side and Moneyball author said former President Barack Obama felt an “obligation” to have a smooth transition because former President George W. Bush “had handed the government over to him so cleanly.” “And there were all these briefings to be got, including what you do if there is an epidemic of any sort, and the briefings are really non-ideological, sort of like how we handle this and you may handle it differently, but it’s a transfer of knowledge” Lewis said, adding that his book, The Fifth Risk, is about seeking out the briefings the Trump administration “never bothered to get.” Lewis said the briefings basically amounted to “a description of a portfolio of risks that the federal government was managing, and [Trump] was going to be in charge of.” “And you saw that they were going to be totally unprepared for whatever happened, because they never really assumed the responsibility of managing it,” Lewis said. “The pandemic, there were briefing specific to this particular problem. And I think if those briefings had happened, I think the history of this whole thing we’re going through now starts at that moment.” Lewis then said he feels that America has a “coaching problem” with a “really crappy coach” and a “very talented team” of scientists who are “just disorganized.” “We’re the world’s leaders in the sort of expertise one would use to defend oneself from a virus… And you know, you’re seeing other countries outperform us in all kinds of ways. Because essentially, the head coach… has not assumed responsibility for his job,” Lewis said. “And, you know, you don’t really think of the presidency as a coaching job, but it is a coaching job… You’re trying to bring the best out of the country. You’re trying to unify the country, get it to act as a team. You know, there are real similarities and there’s a real abdication of that responsibility right now.” Lewis also said the problem is exacerbated because the Trump administration “put people in who are wholly inappropriate and who aren’t really equipped” to deal with a pandemic because those who got various government positions “through basically a loyalty test” do not “know anything about the jobs.”

On Monday’s broadcast of the Fox Business Network’s “Evening Edit,” Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND) argued that the economy needs to be reopened before the federal government decides how much stimulus it needs. Cramer said, “We’ve already appropriated some $3 trillion of federal dollars, most of it going to states and local communities, as well as to workers and their employers. But let’s see how that works out first. And not to mention all these credit facilities that the Federal Reserve has come up with and is coming up with. So, I think we just — we need to get the economy going again or open again before we see how much more stimulus it needs.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

On Monday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “The Last Word,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) discussed the forthcoming Congressional testimony by Coronavirus Task Force member Dr. Anthony Fauci and encouraged Fauci to “Go for it” because Fauci won’t have President Trump “lurking over” him and Trump “needs to hear the truth.” Schumer said, “Dr. Fauci will have the opportunity to testify for the first time with Donald Trump not lurking over his shoulder. You know what I say to Dr. Fauci? Go for it. Tell us the truth. America needs to hear the truth and President Trump, your boss, needs to hear the truth.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, insists on keeping the state shut down until May 26 despite a declining rate of positive COVID-19 tests, hospitalizations, and coronavirus deaths per capita in the state. Evers first shut the state down with a “safer-at-home” executive order for 30 days in late March. Then on April 16, he announced he would be extending the original shutdown for 30 days until May 26 after the original 30-day shutdown order expired. Four days later, “[o]n Monday [April 20], Evers released his plan for reopening Wisconsin that requires, among other things, a 14-day decline in positive COVID-19 cases and more protective equipment, tests and other supplies to deal with the pandemic. He said his plan mirrors guidelines issued by President Donald Trump’s administration,” the Associated Press reported: “I just accepted the biggest Republican in the country, his plan, because it’s a rational plan,” Evers said. “Now, if the state Republicans don’t think Donald Trump is appropriate, they can deal with Donald Trump, I guess.” Evers’ claim that he is simply following the guidelines established by the Trump administration for state governments last month, which includes three different areas of focus — cases, symptoms, and hospitals — does not accurately represent the details of those guidelines, however, As Breitbart News reported, the Trump administration guidelines for cases “specified meeting either of two criteria: (1) Downward trajectory of documented cases within a 14-day period OR (2) Downward trajectory of positive tests as a percent of total tests within a 14-day period (flat or increasing volume of tests).” Evers has hung his decision to extend his “safer-at-home” executive order to May 26, in part, on data that shows the absolute number of COVID-19 cases has not declined. But the Trump administration guidelines specifically state that the case guidelines can be met with either a “downward trajectory of documented cases” or a “downward trajectory of positive tests as a percent of total tests.” Declining Positive COVID-19 Test Rates Data from the COVID Tracking Project shows that, as of May 11, there has been “a downward trajectory of positive tests as a percent of total tests” in Wisconsin from 9.7 percent of all those new daily tests reported on April 26 to 6.6 percent of all the new daily tests reported on May 11. This significant downward trend between April 26 and May 11 has brought the percentage of those who have tested positive in Wisconsin since the start of the pandemic down from 9.1 percent on April 26 to 8.8 percent on May 11, as Table 1 below illustrates. Table 1 Percentage of COVID-19 Tests Positive in Wisconsin April 26, 2020 to May 11, 2020 Source: Data from The Covid Tracking Project, as of May 11 Notably, the three-day running average of total COVID-19 tests conducted in the state has increased by almost 50 percent from 2,333 in the three-day period between April 26 to April 28 to 3,865 during the three-day period between May 9 and May 11. Not surprisingly, the three-day running average of cases has increased during this period from 205 to 276, but that increase is a much lower 35 percent. Though the absolute number of new daily cases of coronavirus has increased between April 26 and May 11, that is a function of the near doubling of tests conducted, as the percentage of positives has declined from 8.6 percent during the three days between April 26 and April 28 to 7.2 percent during the three days between May 9 and May 11. The 8.8 percent positive rate of all those who have taken the COVID-19 test from the beginning of the pandemic to May 11 in the state of Wisconsin (10,418 out of 118,451) is far below the national average of 14 percent (1.3 million out of 9.3 million), as reported by the COVID Tracking Project during the same time period. Low Hospitalization Rates With regards to the guidelines established by the Trump administration for hospitalizations, Breitbart News reported, “the guidelines specified the requirement to meet both of two criteria: (1) Treat all patients without crisis care, AND (2) Robust testing program in place for at-risk healthcare workers, including emerging antibody testing.” Cumulative hospitalizations for COVID-19, that is, all patients who have ever been hospitalized since the start of the pandemic in Wisconsin, have increased by only 449 patients between April 26, when it stood at 1,397, to 1,846 as of May 11, according to the COVID Tracking project. Current hospitalizations are far lower. According to the Wisconsin Department of Health, there are at present only 340 patients hospitalized in the state for COVID-19. Of those, 116 are in ICU beds. An additional 180 are hospitalized pending results of COVID-19 tests. Hospitals remain far below capacity in the state when it comes to regular beds, ICU beds, and ventilators in use by COVID-19 patients. According to the Wisconsin Department of Health, 1,257 ventilators are on hand in the state, while only 356 are receiving mechanical ventilation for the treatment of any disease. Low Per Capita Death Rates On a per capita basis, according to Worldometers, Wisconsin has experienced 69 COVID-19 deaths per million people, far below the 1,378 deaths per million people experienced in New York State. The Badger State has one of the lowest COVID-19 per capita death rates in the country. The average age of residents of Wisconsin who have died from COVID-19 deaths is 76 years old (See Table 2 below, based on the latest data from the Wisconsin Department of Health), slightly older than the national average of 75. According to the Wisconsin Department of Health, 42 percent of the 400 people who have died of COVID-19 were residents of nursing homes. Table 2 Average Age of Wisconsin Resident Who Has Died of COVID-19 Source: Data from Wisconsin Dept. of Health as of May 10 Thirty-three percent of the 400 people who have died of COVID-19 in Wisconsin were 90 years old or older according to the Wisconsin Department of Health. A stunning 70 percent of those who have died of COVID-19 in the state were 70 years old or older. According to the Wisconsin Department of Health, 42 percent of the 400 people who have died of COVID-19 in Wisconsin as of May 10 (or 164) were residents of nursing homes. On April 29, just 11 days earlier, just 37 percent of the 308 who had died of COVID-19 as of that date (or 115) were residents of nursing homes. (Note: The number of total COVID-19 deaths in the state increased to 409 as of May 11.) During the 11-day period between April 29 and May 10, 49 out of the 92 people who died of COVID-19 in Wisconsin, or 55 percent, were residents of nursing homes. Wisconsin seems to be experiencing the same phenomenon as other states — an increasing percentage of COVID-19 deaths are coming from nursing homes. On April 21, Republicans in the Wisconsin State Legislature sued Gov. Evers to end his “safer-at-home” order immediately, not on May 26, as The Chicago Tribune reported. The case is currently before the Wisconsin State Supreme Court. On Friday Gov. Evers announced a plan to reopen the state when the current order expires on May 26, but not before: Evers’ order to stay home expires May 26 and the governor said Friday he doesn’t see any reason for it to be extended. It could be cut short, technically, by a Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling in a lawsuit brought by Republican lawmakers to block Evers’ order. The lawmakers are also asking the court to immediately delay its decision to give the department time to come up with a different plan that would be considered by a Republican-controlled committee that includes members that have been heavily critical of Evers’ approach to controlling the virus outbreak.   Practically, it’s possible a new plan wouldn’t be in place until after the order lawmakers are seeking to block expires anyway.  The most recent data is likely to bolster the case filed by Republicans to end Gov. Evers’ “safer-at-home” executive order before May 26, but it is unclear if the Wisconsin State Supreme Court will render a decision on the case before the executive order expires.

Monday on MSNBC, “All In,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said the American people are in pain, at home and paying attention to Republicans’ unwillingness to fund food stamps and food banks in the next coronavirus stimulus package. Pelosi said, “We are seeing record-breaking unemployment rates and so many people signing up for it. It breaks your heart, but we have the unemployment insurance that will be renewed in this legislation, as well as cash payments, direct payments, people are craving that. I guess, what advantage we have, sad as it is that people see what is happening, even though they are working from home but listening to their constituents, there’s a lot of pain and heartache. People don’t know if they’re going to be able to put food on the table. Moms have said, Brookings Institution put this out last week, one in five children are food insecure. They don’t know where their next meal is coming from. They don’t know if they’re going to be able to pay the rent. This is very, very personal, and we want to be addressing the personal concerns in a way that is monumental because it is big. We’ve never seen anything like it, and we have to be brave, get up there, just make the case. This is the plan. These are the resources. This is how we want to do this, and as we do it, we want to be worthy of those who lost their lives, worthy of those fighting for other people’s lives and plan to do that.” Hayes asked, “In this case, my understanding is it’s coming from Mitch McConnell in the White House, we’re done here. There is a headline that gave me a chuckle, ‘The GOP Rekindles Deficit Concerns Adding Snag to Talks on Aid.’ Is it your sense there is like—what is your read of the posture of the White House and Senate Republicans towards additional legislative rescue relief like you’re proposing?” Pelosi said, “Well, it’s interesting to see what they’re saying, becoming renewing their fiscal hawk positions that they can barely remember. I have confidence in going big with what we do. When I saw them give a $2 trillion addition to the national debt in order to give 83% of the benefits to the top 1%, that was so irresponsible in terms of nothing for the economy except put mountains of debt on our children. With this, we are saying these are investments. All of these things are for the good of helping people in personal lives but also a stimulus to the economy. Ask any —well, almost any, I don’t know who they would drum up, economist they will tell you food stamps, imagine they are against SNAP, against expanding the opportunity for people to have access to food stamps at a time where the papers and news is full of families in long lines at food banks. And we have to help those food banks as well. So this is personal. It’s heartbreaking, really. So I have confidence in the American people. America has a big heart, a heart full of love, and people care about each other. What they see what we’re doing, it will be big because the problem is big and needs are big of the American people, that it will be more attention paid to what the Republicans are saying or doing and then a judgment can be made. But I’m optimistic always. I see everything as an opportunity, the bigger the challenge, the bigger the opportunity.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Monday on MSNBC, “All In,” Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) criticized President Donald Trump’s response to the coronavirus pandemic by accusing him of “injuring the soul” of the country. Booker said, “Look, I just don’t think we’re as different as some of our politicians want to make us feel in this country. We all have a lot of concerns right now, as you said. Most Americans want us to err on the side of public health and safety but understand the urgency. We understand businesses are fearful. They spent their lives building in the tourist towns like Cape May, and the small mom and pop restaurants in New Jersey. There is an urgency to save those businesses, but this is about health. This is about science. This is about data. It’s not about our opinion or politics. It’s about what is the best way to get this country back to business, because if we open up too early, and we have a second wave, I’m telling you right now it’s going to be more damming to our businesses and to our economy and on top of that, our health. So we’ve just go to stop this nonsense. Chris, this is what makes this being a moment, that we have the most uniquely unqualified president in our history, at a time we want someone to give us like a fireside chat or to appeal to malice towards none, charity towards all, at a time be want to be called together for common cause and common purpose, we have a president that is doubling down on demeaning and degrading and divisiveness, who is injuring the soul of our country, turning us against each other, tweeting out the most obnoxiously damaging unimaginable tweets like ‘Liberate states.’ This is not about his petty culture war. This is about the strength and health and well being of a nation.” He continued, “Look, in a time when this administration is fighting transparency and oversight, the one thing that’s been utterly transparent from the beginning is that Donald Trump cares about himself. He tells us that fact. You know, he didn’t want to let people off of a cruise ship in the beginning because it would hurt the numbers in how he looks. This is a guy that tweets out very transparently that everything is about him, what people say about him. Is this governor being nice to him? Are they plotting to get him? This is not about him. This is about the greatest national crisis in generations and how we are 5% of the globe’s population, but because of a failure of leadership, we have roughly a third of the cases on the planet Earth right now.” He added, “I am not going to let this crisis be defined by Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump, who, in my opinion, are failing in their leadership and their ability to drive the common, pull the country, pull the Senate together.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

President Donald Trump on Monday celebrated at the White House press conference that America was leading the world on coronavirus testing. “In the span of just a few short months we’ve developed a testing capacity unmatched and unrivaled anywhere in the world, and it’s not even close,” Trump said. The president shared a chart showing the number of tests conducted by the United States per capita compared to other countries. Coronavirus testing chart “This doesn’t happen by accident,” Assistant Secretary for Health Adm. Brett P. Giroir, M.D said. “The people sitting up here in the front have been working literally 18-20 hours a day, every single day of the week for at least the past two months.” Trump noted that the United States was conducting about 300,000 coronavirus tests per day and would complete over ten million tests by the end of the week. “We have met the moment and we have prevailed,” Trump said about the testing success. “Americans do whatever it takes to find solutions, pioneer breakthroughs, and harness the energies we need to achieve a total victory.” The president noted that leading pharmacies and retailers had set up over 240 testing sites across the country as well as a focus on urban communities. Testing, he explained, was a key part of reopening America for business. “This is a core element of our plan to safely and gradually reopen America, and we’re opening and we’re starting, and there’s enthusiasm like I haven’t seen in a long time,” he said. He said that the administration was working with governors to make sure they had the supplies and ability to boost testing levels. The administration also announced plans to send $11 billion in funding to states to help fund their testing efforts.

The White House on Monday confirmed plans to distribute $11 billion to states to help fund testing, as part of a growing effort to ramp up testing across the country. A senior administration official said that nearly nine million coronavirus tests had been completed and ten million tests were expected to be finished by the end of the week. “We’ve done a tremendous number and that number is accelerating even quicker,” the official said. The funding will be taken from the CARES Act passed by Congress in April. The administration continues coordinating with governors and local officials to ramp up testing, working to match their testing needs. The goal is to make sure every state has what they need for phase two of the reopening strategy. Officials criticized Democrat governors for complaining about the Trump administration’s failure to ramp up testing, saying that many of the critics were silenced by Trump’s success. “You’re noticing that a lot of the governors who have been a little hostile to the administration, now all of a sudden they’re saying, ‘Oh we’re figuring out how to do testing.'” The official said. “It’s not a miracle, it’s not that all of a sudden they’ve figured it out, it’s that we’ve held their hand, and we’ve helped them get the supplies they need, and we’ve explained to them how to do it, and so a lot of them are starting to take credit.”

A man charged with murdering a 25-year-old woman has been released from a Michigan prison over concerns of the Chinese coronavirus spreading in detention facilities. Orlando Whitfield, a 31-year-old high-profile murder suspect, was released from the Washtenaw County Jail as part of a statewide initiative to empty prisons to avoid the spread of the coronavirus. Judge Carol Kuhnke released Whitfield on the condition that he wear a GPS monitor. In January 2018, prosecutors allege Whitfield murdered 25-year-old Marissa Joy Edmunds and seriously injured her boyfriend during a robbery at the University Green Apartments in Ypsilanti, Michigan. Edmunds, prosecutors allege, was shot in the head by Whitfield. Marissa Joy Edmunds was allegedly murdered by Orlando Whitfield in January 2018. (Photo via Facebook) Months after his arrest, while sitting in Washtenaw County Jail, Whitfield allegedly made a shank weapon. The alleged murder came just two months after Whitfield had been released from prison after serving time for a 2007 sexual assault. Edmunds’ family told local media outlets FOX 2 Detroit and WXYZ Detroit that they are in disbelief that Whitfield has been released from prison ahead of the murder trial. “Every delay has been because of him. He needs to be behind bars where he belongs,” Marissa’s sister, Amanda Edmunds, told WXYZ Detroit. “If this all has to do with [coronavirus], open the jail doors and let everyone out.”  Marissa’s mother, Cindy, said she fears for her own life now that Whitfield is out of prison. “It’s shocking,” Cindy Edmunds told FOX 2 Detroit. “When I found out he was being released I was devastated … I’ve had terrible anxiety since Marissa was killed and this has just escalated it.” At the Washtenaw County Jail where Whitfield was being held before trial, the inmate population has been cut in half over the last two months. In March, the jail held about 330 inmates. As of late April, only 147 inmates are still in the jail’s custody, the lowest number of inmates that Sheriff Jerry Clayton has seen in his 35 years on the job.

The Hollywood Reporter noted the actress told attendees at Vulture Fest’s “Feminist AF” panel in Los Angeles that, at a subway station the day after Trump’s election to the presidency, she “began experiencing pain and shortness of breath, which caused her to collapse on the stairs,” and later realized she was “having a panic attack.”  

Manmade global warming will “compound” the devastation wrought by the coronavirus pandemic, according to an article on Sunday in Popular Science. “Experts say that climate change will likely compound the problem,” writes Jeremy Deaton. “Soaring temperatures will either compel people wanting relief to go outside, where they could get infected, or the pandemic will force people to stay indoors, where they could swelter. Both the pandemic and extreme heat pose a mortal risk to the elderly and the infirm.” Despite the laughable predictions of “experts” in trying to model consequences of the pandemic, climate change alarmists continue to cling to opinions of unnamed climate gurus with reverential devotion. “It won’t be possible to determine the role of climate change until after the season has passed, experts say,” Mr. Deaton writes, without explaining how the role of climate change can be determined afterward. “Much of the country can expect unusually high temperatures this summer,” Deaton notes, and the American northeast, “which has been hit hard by the coronavirus, faces an especially high risk of warmer weather.” Deaton does acknowledge that “there is some preliminary evidence that sunlight, heat, and humidity could slow the spread of COVID-19,” but he immediately moves to suggest that the disadvantages must certainly outweigh the benefits. One thing the writer fails to mention is that COVID-19 is classified as an “influenza-like disease” and as such is likely to mimic the flu in important ways. There is a “flu season,” which ends with the onset of warmer weather, and thus, relatively few people come down with the flu in the summertime. In this case, warmer weather — whether caused by “climate change” or not — is likely to be a blessing rather than a curse. But this would not sit well with alarmists because it flies in the face of a fundamental premise of the climate cult: “warming temperatures cannot benefit humanity and therefore must be battled.” This axiom is not based on science, of course, but on a deeply held belief. It is a dogma that must not be questioned, rather than a conclusion that has been rationally proven. Follow @tdwilliamsrome

A Michigan judge has denied a motion made by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s administration that an Owosso barber close up shop during the coronavirus outbreak. Great Lakes News was outside Karl Manke’s Barber & Beauty Shop on Monday when the ruling came down.  Reporter Katie Heid said the judge denied the state’s claim that the 77-year-old Manke to close his shop because he was allegedly in violation of Whitmer’s stay-at-home order. “This is not only a big victory for Mr. Manke, but also for other small businesses,” she said. “Who else will open their doors?” The state Attorney General lost in its effort to obtain a temporary restraining order, NBC 25 reported. The AG said: The Attorney General’s court action, filed on behalf of MDHHS, seeks to enforce the MDHHS Director’s Public Health Order that deemed Mr. Manke’s business an imminent danger to public health in light of the COVID 19 pandemic and directs him to immediately cease operations at his barbershop. The State is seeking to schedule a hearing as soon as possible. The AG asserted Manke’s open business presents “clear public health dangers”. Manke told ABC 12 he reopened after unemployment benefits were denied three times. The barber had been repeatedly fined for allegedly violating the shutdown orders, but supporters paid the fines. “I just couldn’t live with myself if I didn’t do that,” Manke told radio host Steve Gruber about continuing to operate his business. “I don’t care really if I have to spend all of the money I’m making right now to pay my fine. It’s worth it,” he said. He said he will only leave “if they drag me out in the street or Jesus comes.” Manke said he has fielded several calls from other barbers about what to do. “You have to have courage,” he said.

Left-wing actor Jim Carrey painted a grim reaper giving President Donald Trump the middle finger to insinuate that the Angel of Death is “jealous” of the president and the Republican Party’s so-called “death count.” “Grim reaper officially jealous of Trump and GOP’s ability to double the death toll,” read a message at the bottom of Carrey’s painting, which was posted to Twitter without any further explanation on Monday. The 58-year-old actor’s painting appeared to be referring to the deadly Chinese coronavirus, which originated from Wuhan, China, proliferating around the world, spreading disease, crisis, and financial devastation to a plethora of countries, including the United States. pic.twitter.com/fEhggYsfxn — Jim Carrey (@JimCarrey) May 11, 2020  The Dumb and Dumber actor is no stranger to making bizarre anti-Trump and political paintings. But in January, Carrey swore that he would no longer be creating Trump-bashing cartoons. “I basically didn’t bring that into 2020 with me,” insisted the Liar Liar actor. “That’s gone — pretty much, for the most part.” “I’ve said what I need to say, and I’ve allowed it to inhabit my body and cause whatever low vibrations do to a body,” he added. “You know, I sounded my yelp, I warned people, and that’s enough. They know how I feel.” Carrey’s hiatus from untoward political art didn’t last long, though, as the actor was back to his old ways by March, with a cartoon accusing the president of potentially risking “countless lives to save his economic record.” Trump is willing to risk countless lives to save his economic record. He has fully become the mayor from Jaws. pic.twitter.com/ZggJClEaXG — Jim Carrey (@JimCarrey) March 27, 2020  The cartoon — similar to the one Carrey posted on Monday — appeared to be in reference to President Trump’s desire to reopen America and get the people back to work in the wake of the deadly Wuhan coronavirus. Lockdown measures established in response to the Chinese coronavirus have already upended businesses across the country and have plunged millions of Americans into unemployment and financial devastation.

CNN host Van Jones and the rapper known as will.i.am are teaming up with China’s Huawei to lead a virtual panel discussion about the rise of disinformation during the coronavirus pandemic. That’s right. A Chinese tech giant is sponsoring a coronavirus disinformation panel. And it will be headlined by a CNN anchor. #Misinformation on #COVID19 is hitting African American, Asian, Hispanic, rural & low-income Americans hard. On May 13 @NABJ, @IAMWILL, @VanJones68, @RolandSMartin & @EbonyJadeHilton discuss keeping Americans healthy + safe. https://t.co/iali0OFBrR #HuaweiNABJWebinar pic.twitter.com/XSs58j0Wdk — HuaweiUSA (@HuaweiUSA) May 11, 2020  Huawei announced Monday that the free webinar will take place Wednesday at 2 p.m. E.T., and will focus on how disinformation about the coronavirus disproportionately affects communities of color and low-income neighborhoods. “Since the 2016 general election, Americans have faced an endless barrage of misinformation designed to undermine democratic values and sow social division among various communities,” Huawei said in its announcement. “Now in the face of a global pandemic, the misinformation tide continues to rise, hitting African Americans, as well as Asian, Hispanic, rural and lower-income Americans particularly hard.” Huawei, which is the largest maker of telecom equipment in the world, has come under intense scrutiny as the Trump administration has sought to block its 5G equipment from being used in domestic networks due to concerns over spying.”If Huawei is embedded in 5G networks, they’ll scoop up the world’s data,” Gordon Chang, a China expert, told Breitbart News. While Huawei claims that it is privately owned, it is widely believed that China’s ruling Communist Party exerts significant influence over the company’s operations. Huawei’s coronavirus panel comes as China carries out a massive disinformation campaign seeking to deflect responsibility for its role in the coronavirus pandemic, which originated in Wuhan. Beijing has created an army of fake and hijacked social media accounts aimed at spreading Chinese propaganda about the virus. Communist Party officials are also coming under fire for their discriminatory treatment of Africans living in China. Human Rights Watch has accused China of mistreating African immigrants, including forcing them into quarantine and denying them entrance to certain public areas. CNN has also received criticism for parroting official Chinese propaganda. Last month, the left-wing cable news outlet ran an online article about the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), citing China’s state-controlled Global Times as its source.

CBS News White House correspondent Weijia Jiang made a thinly-veiled accusation of racism against President Donald Trump on Monday afternoon when he spoke about China in response to one of her questions at a press briefing in the Rose Garden. Her claim was instantly picked up by network and cable news as if Trump had targeted her for being Asian American. The exchange was as follows: Jiang: You said many times that the U.S. is doing far better than any other country when it comes to testing? Trump: Yes. Jiang: Why does that matter? Why is this a global competition to you, if everyday Americans are still losing their lives, and we’re still seeing more cases every day Trump: Well, they’re losing their lives everywhere in the world. And maybe that’s a question you should ask China. Don’t ask me, ask China that question, okay? When you ask them that question you may get a very unusual answer. Yes, behind you, please. Jiang: Sir, why are you saying that to me, specifically, that I should ask China? Trump: I’m telling you. I’m not saying it specifically to anybody. I’m saying it to anybody who would ask a nasty question like that. Please go ahead. Jiang: That’s not a nasty question. Why does it matter… Trump then tried to call on another reporter, but a different reporter tried to interject. He then ended the press briefing. The media have repeatedly tried to criticize the Trump’s administration response to the coronavirus pandemic by referring to the performance of the U.S. — most frequently by claiming the U.S. has the most coronavirus cases or deaths, without noting that the U.S. also has a far higher population than most other countries, and that data from China is not reliable. Trump has repeatedly stressed his belief –later confirmed by revised death counts — that data from China underestimated the impact. “So when the fake news gets out there and they start talking about the United States is number one — but we’re not number one; China is number one, just so you understand. China is number one by a lot. It’s not even close. They’re way ahead of us in terms of death. It’s not even close. You know it. I know it. And they know it. But you don’t want to report it,” he said in April. Jiang has a record of making accusations of racism against the Trump White House. In 2018, she reported that a supposed “N-word tape” of Trump using a racial slur existed, based on claims by a disgruntled former official, Omarosa Manigault, that Trump staffers believed it did. Jiang omitted key evidence to the contrary. In March, she reported that an anonymous, unnamed person at the White House had used the term “Kung Flu” to refer to the coronavirus. She has repeatedly clashed with Trump at other press briefings. In April, she asked him what White House adviser Jared Kushner meant by calling the federal stockpile of medical supplies “our” stockpile. Trump called it a “gotcha” question. At a press briefing in April, Trump challenged Jiang to state how many cases of coronavirus were in the U.S., and how many Americans had died, when he implemented his travel ban on China. She did not know. (There were few cases and no deaths.) Earlier at the Rose Garden press conference, Jiang accused Trump of a “delay in embracing widespread testing” and asked him about whether he wanted to “suppress the official number of U.S. cases and deaths” as he tried to re-open the economy. Trump answered her calmly. Jiang then asked the president why he believed that Democrats’ “motive is politics rather than public safety” in slowing the re-opening of the economy, and asked whether he himself had political motives “to try to grow the economy ahead of the election.” Trump answered her calmly, again.

Monday on CNN, Brian Stelter declared President Donald Trump’s exchange with CBS News White House correspondent Weijia Jiang was “racist.” In a clip, Trump said, “Well, they’re losing their lives everywhere in the world. Maybe that’s a question you should ask China. Don’t ask me. Ask China that question. OK, when you ask them that question, you may get a very unusual answer. Yes, behind you, please.” Jiang said, “Sir, why are you saying that to me, specifically?” Stelter said, “I think what we saw in that exchange is something that has racial overtones. It is racist to look at an Asian-American White House correspondent and say, ‘Ask China.’ This isn’t happening in a vacuum. This is part of a pattern of behavior from the president that goes back many years. He doesn’t have the benefit of the doubt that someone might have if, for the first time in their life, they made a comment like that to a reporter. But the president has been rattled by Weijia Jiang’s questions in the past. He has treated her and other female reporters differently in the past. And he’s also had this pattern of reacting to minority journalists in a very specific and different way, Wolf.” He continued, “For example, a few years ago President Trump said to April Ryan, a black correspondent, to follow up with the Congressional Black Caucus because he kind of just assumed they were friends. And here today, he’s saying to a Chinese-born journalist, ask China. Now, of course, he says he would have said the same thing to anyone. But the pattern suggests otherwise. The pattern suggests a racial reaction to certain individuals in the press corps. And that’s deeply, deeply disturbing.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Americans may want to get back to normal in the wake of the coronavirus, but according to polling a large majority want certain standards to be met, including mandatory quarantine for people with the virus, a drop in cases and deaths, and a vaccine to help prevent the disease – even if a vaccine never materializes. Gallup found that 80 percent want people who test positive for the virus to face mandatory quarantine, 77 percent want effective treatment, 73 percent want “a significant reduction in the number of cases or deaths,” and 68 percent want a vaccine to be available.  Some 61 percent said that widespread testing and a protocol to “monitor coronavirus infections are essential,” according to the poll. Gallup reported on its poll: While less than half think it is very important that four additional requirements be met before returning to normalcy, majorities say each is at least “somewhat” important. Among them are mandatory face masks in public areas, widespread contact tracing, lifting statewide stay-at-home or social distancing orders, and compulsory temperature checks to enter public buildings. The most sizable gaps in Americans’ opinions about the importance of the various requirements measured by Gallup are seen by gender and party identification. In most cases, women are more likely than men to say each condition is a very important factor in their willingness to return to their normal activities. A similar pattern is seen in partisans’ views of the importance of the factors. Democrats are far more likely than Republicans and independents to consider each requirement except the lifting of state government orders to be very important. Easing of state restrictions and mandatory temperature checks when entering public buildings are the only measures that less than a majority of Democrats consider very important. Democrats’ views of temperature checks may be attributable to privacy concerns. Other findings include: • Americans living in the Northeastern U.S. (55 percent), college graduates (52 percent), and those living in cities (55 percent) are more likely than their counterparts to say the use of face masks is very important. • 73 percent of college graduates, 72 percent of city residents, and 70 percent of adults under 45 say the availability of widespread testing to identify and monitor those exposed to the virus is very important to them — significantly higher rates than their counterparts. Gallup reported: As some Americans around the country have begun to protest COVID-19 stay-at-home orders and the president is anxious to restart the economy, many governors are moving to lift restrictions in their states. Yet, governors in some of the areas hardest hit by COVID-19 are not yet ready to do so, and although Trump has outlined a graduated plan for reopening, some governors are being criticized for lifting restrictions before their state meets all of the criteria. Gallup noted that views on how to get back to normal are “sharply polarized politically.” The Gallup poll is based on self-administered web surveys conducted April 27-May 3, 2020, with a random sample of 4,553 U.S. adults, aged 18 and older who are members of the Gallup Panel.  “Gallup weighted the obtained samples to correct for nonresponse,” the report on methodology for the poll said. “Nonresponse adjustments were made by adjusting the sample to match the national demographics of gender, age, race, Hispanic ethnicity, education and region.” Based on any individual sample, the poll has a margin of sampling error or plus or minus three percentage points.

On Monday’s broadcast of Fox News Radio’s “Guy Benson Show,” Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) argued that if China develops a coronavirus vaccine before anyone else, “that’s not good for the country or for the world.” Because China is “not going to share.” Scott stated, “Everything they do is for the benefit of the Communist Party of China, and nobody else. And, look, if they get the vaccine first, that’s not good for the country or for the world. Because you know what? They’re not going to share. I mean, they’re going to take care of one group of people: the Communist Party of Communist China.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett  

A grandmother and her boyfriend were arrested Sunday for allegedly tying up a six-year-old boy in a shed behind their home in Dallas, Texas. When police arrived at the home on Coston Drive at about 11:30 p.m. and asked the grandmother where the boy was, she told them he was with his mother, according to CBS 11. However, once the officers walked toward the rear of the home, they found a man living on the back of the property who directed them to a shed. “Officers told the grandmother to open the shed or they would break down the door. She opened it and police found the boy,” the article said. When police questioned the boy, he reportedly told them the alleged abuse began when he “got out of school for this corona thing.” “His grandmother said he was only in there that one time as punishment. But her boyfriend (who lives in the house) said for at least two weeks, confinement in the shed was the child’s punishment since he was stealing food,” the report stated. Following the arrests, police did not release the names of the suspects and the child’s condition remained unknown. In March, doctors at Cook Children’s Hospital in Fort Worth said they believed six cases of severe child abuse that happened in one week were linked to the coronavirus pandemic, according to CBS 11. Typically, the children’s hospital only saw that number of such cases over the course of a month. Each of the children admitted the week of March 20 were under four-years-old. The stress of the health crisis may have become too much for some parents, said Jamye Coffman, M.D., who is the medical director of the hospital’s Center for Prevention and Child Abuse and Neglect. Coffman stated: People have so much increased stress right now. They’ve got financial stress. Some people lost their job or worried about keeping their current job. They lost their income. You’ve got stress from being overcrowded. Everyone’s cooped up together. They feel like they can’t get away from each other. These stressors can lead to abuse. However, the numbers of child abuse reports took a nosedive the last week in March, according to KVUE. “In the last full week in March, less than 6,000 reports were made. That’s about a 48% drop from the beginning of the month to the end,” the article noted. But the decline in reports did not mean abuse was not happening at all, according to Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) spokesperson Marissa Gonzales. “If children are at home and they don’t have as many pairs of eyes on them, and we know this is a particularly stressful time, then it could put children who are already at risk at higher risk of abuse and neglect,” she commented. Although Texas schools have been closed for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year, Dallas Superintendent Michael Hinojosa said the district hoped to bring students back in the fall after making changes to guard against the virus. “We’re not going back to normal. We know we’re going to have some type of modifications in August,” he stated.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Donald Trump’s top coronavirus adviser, claimed that the NFL’s football season could be seriously affected by the pandemic even if the virus is waning by fall. Speaking to NBC Sports, Fauci insisted that teams could have a significant problem if more than one, perhaps as many as four players, were diagnosed with the virus during the season. “You got a problem there,” said the director of the National Institutes for Health since 1984. “You know why? Because it is likely that if four of them are positive and they’ve been hanging around together, that the other ones that are negative are really positive. So I mean, if you have one outlier [only one player testing positive], I think you might get away. But once you wind up having a situation where it looks like it’s spread within a team, you got a real problem. You gotta shut it down.” If an entire team ends up being “shut down” for 14 days in quarantine, then they would have to forfeit the games they are missing. If several teams end up in this situation, it could disrupt the entire season, Fauci said. Fauci added that it would be “malpractice in medicine” to put players who tested positive on the field. NBC pressed Fauci about when the country, including sports programs, could get back to normal. But he said he had no idea, and no one can make such predictions. “The virus,” he claimed, “will make the decision for us.” Still, Fauci did lend some hope that football could be back soon. “I think it’s feasible that negative testing players could play to an empty stadium,” Fauci said. “Is it guaranteed? No way . . . There will be virus out there and you will know your players are negative at the time they step onto the field. You’re not endangering . . . Also, if the virus is so low that even in the general community the risk is low, then I could see filling a third of the stadium or half the stadium so people could be six feet apart. I mean, that’s something that is again feasible depending on the level of infection. I keep getting back to that: It’s going to depend. Like, right now, if you fast forward, and it is now September. The season starts. I say you can’t have a season—it’s impossible. There’s too much infection out there. It doesn’t matter what you do. But I would hope that by the time you get to September, it’s not gonna be the way it is right now.” The doc added, “If you really want to be in a situation where you want to be absolutely certain, you’d test all the players before the game. And you say, Those who are infected: Sorry, you’re sidelined. Those who are free: Get in there and play.” He also called for repeated testing, maybe even several times a week. Fauci imagines that the NFL, at least, has the luxury of time since the league does not begin playing until fall, and by late summer, the virus will likely be much weaker. But even with that, Fauci said that there would be a second round of the virus in the fall. “The answer is not going to be black and white,” Fauci said. “When I said there’s no doubt the virus is going to return, that is in response to some who have said ‘Oh, it’s just going to disappear.’ So, unlike the virus SARS, back in 2002, when we had an outbreak of about 8,000 people and close to 800 deaths, and then the virus just essentially petered out by good public health measures by the simple reason that it wasn’t efficiently or effectively transmitted from one person to another. In other words, it was not an efficient spreader. So that when you tamp down on it with public health measures, it actually got to the point where it disappeared. “That’s not the case with this novel coronavirus. It is so transmissible, and it is so widespread throughout the world, that even if our infections get well-controlled and go down dramatically during the summer, there is virtually no chance it will be eradicated. Which means there will be infections in the Southern Hemisphere, in South Africa, in Argentina, places like that. And with the travel, the global travel, every single day, of literally hundreds of thousands of people coming into the United States every day from all over, there’s no chance we’re going to be virus-free.” Fauci ended the interview offering his help to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. If league officials want to consult him, he’d be happy to respond. But he warned that the path forward would be tenuous. “It is uncertain. You’ll have to play it by ear according to the level of infection in the community,” he said. Follow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston.

Calls for the impeachment of Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D) are increasing after the governor doubled down on Monday, accusing Pennsylvanians who are moving to reopen outside of his orders of engaging in a “cowardly act” and issuing threats to businesses that fail to comply with his directives. Wolf on Monday dismissed Pennsylvanians who remain under lockdown orders, which he recently extended to June 4, drawing further ire from critics. Republican state House candidate Danny DeVito, who last month asked the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene and overrule the governor’s stay-at-home order closing nonessential businesses, formally demanded the impeachment of Wolf and Lieutenant Gov. John Fetterman (D). “The Wolf Administration’s threats against Counties and small businesses today were an unacceptable declaration of war,” he said on Monday. “I am calling on the General Assembly to impeach Wolf and Fetterman and I am calling on elected officials and candidates to join me in this declaration”: DANNY DEVITO CALLS FOR IMPEACHMENT OF GOVERNOR WOLF, LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR FETTERMAN I am now formally calling for the… Posted by Danny DeVito on Monday, May 11, 2020 Similarly, a Change.org petition demanding an impeachment investigation of Wolf took off, garnering over 46,000 signatures as of Monday afternoon. The petition requests an investigation “due to Governor Wolf’s violations of the Pennsylvania Constitution and the US Constitution.” Per the petition: Specifically Pennsylvania Constitution Article 1 Section 1 – inherent rights of mankind, Article 1 Section 3- religious freedoms, Article 1 Section 12 -power of suspending laws, Article 1 Section 26 – no discrimination by Commonwealth and its political subdivisions, Article 1 Section 25 – reservation of power in people. United States Constitution Bill of Rights Article 4 section 4, the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution, and the 21st Amendment of the United States Constitution. Once we have enough signatures on this petition a letter will be drafted to send to the majority leader Speaker of the House Michael Turzai. Requesting a formal committee be convened on the investigation of Governor Thomas Wolf. Due to his unconstitutional acts during corvid 19 outbreak first quarter 2020. State House Republicans also blasted the governor following his press conference. “It is never wrong to lift the voices of concerned constituents,” they stated in part. “In fact, it is the duty of every elected official to do so. That is not cowardice; it is patriotism.” Meanwhile, the state legislature is moving more legislation to charge ahead with reopening, despite the governor’s orders. “My committee just approved legislation that would reopen manufacturing, real estate, barbershops & hair salons, animal groomers, lawn & garden centers, messenger & agent services and legal services,” State Sen. Tom Killion (R) announced Monday afternoon: BREAKING: My committee just approved legislation that would reopen manufacturing, real estate, barbershops & hair salons, animal groomers, lawn & garden centers, messenger & agent services and legal services. @ChescoChamber @DelcoChamber @PAChamber @PAManufacturers @PARealtors — Senator Tom Killion (@SenKillion) May 11, 2020 

The Governor of the Nigerian state of Rivers ordered the demolition on Sunday of two hotels allegedly found guilty of violating lockdown measures imposed in response to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. The bulldozing took place after Rivers Governor Nyesom Wike, who personally oversaw the operation, warned that hotels found to be hosting guests during the outbreak would have their properties demolished. One of the hotels was owned by a member of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the same party Wike belongs to. “If we can do this to a PDP person, then you know we are not discriminatory,” Wike told reporters following the demolition. “Whether you are in PDP, SDP, or no party, you must obey the law. If any other person does the same thing, the same rule will apply. Government has no alternative but to apply the Executive order which I signed before the lockdown of Obio/Akpor and Port Harcourt.” He continued: I called all the Traditional Rulers and Council Chairmen and told them to ensure that no hotel operates in the State. We are not saying it will be forever. This is for now, so that we know where we are, to reduce the cases and check the spread. We said no hotel should operate within this period. Unfortunately, the PDP youth leader in Eleme joined others to flout the Executive Order. Therefore, the executive order will be applied.  Wike went on to explain that he had been forced to take such stringent measures because of the state’s supposedly aggressive rate of infection: Look at the rate of infections, most of these people are found in hotels. Look at the man that died, he was at Mingi Hotel in Rumumasi. Due to that contact, we have had other seven cases. People should help us and support government for Rivers people to be safe. Security Council will meet to review the strategies and achievements or setbacks, moving forward. All we are doing is to protect our people. Some people may not like our strategies, but our objective is to achieve results. It is not the first time that Wike has attracted controversy for his draconian approach to lockdown implementation. Having vowed to take on any individual or corporation that thinks it is above the rules, he recently arrested 22 Exxon Mobile employees who entered the state in violation of quarantine measures. With a population of close to 200 million, Nigeria has so far recorded 4,400 cases of the coronavirus and 143 deaths, well below that of other African countries. However, such figures are not heavily reliable. Many hospital patients have complained of being deprived of food, medicine, and essential care, while doctors have also gone on strike over lack of personal protective equipment (PPE). A group of Nigerian attorneys last month filed a lawsuit against the Chinese communist regime seeking $200 billion in damages for its role in causing and attempting to cover up the ongoing pandemic. They also hope to bring Beijing to the International Criminal Court (ICC) at The Hague. Follow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.

Jim Bognet, a former Donald Trump administration official and Pennsylvania eighth district Republican candidate, said on Monday that Pennsylvania Democrat Gov. Tom Wolf should either resign or face articles of impeachment if he will not reopen up Pennsylvania. Several Pennsylvania counties have decided to reopen their economies in defiance of Wolf’s decision to keep much of the state locked down. In response, Wolf called many of those public officials “cowardly.” The Pennsylvania Democrat said, “To those politicians who decide to cave in to this coronavirus, they need to understand the consequences of their cowardly act.” Bognet, who hopes to unseat Rep. Matt Cartwright (D-PA), said that Wolf’s lockdown has been a “disaster” for millions of Pennsylvanians. In light of Wolf’s opposition to reopening the state, Bognet said that Wolf should either leave the office of the governor or be impeached. “@GovernorTomWolf‘s lockdown has been a disaster. Millions of Pennsylvanians lost jobs & losing hope, 1000s dead in nursing homes,” Bognet charged. “If Wolf won’t open up PA QUICKLY & SAFELY he should resign or face articles of impeachment.” .@GovernorTomWolf's lockdown has been a disaster. Millions of Pennsylvanians lost jobs & losing hope, 1000s dead in nursing homes.

Both need to go! https://t.co/hPW2if0bN5 — Bognet For Congress (@Bognet4congress) May 11, 2020  Bognet also slammed Wolf for keeping the state closed to the detriment of Pennsylvanians. .@GovernorTomWolf is an absolute disgrace to the people of Pennsylvania, especially to those hurting in #PA08. Small businesses are struggling to stay open and pay their employees. Wolf’s reaction? Threaten local communities to enforce his dictatorial orders. https://t.co/bXGeAGBr4G — Bognet For Congress (@Bognet4congress) May 11, 2020  Other Pennsylvania Republicans slammed Wolf. Rep. Fred Keller said that Wolf “surrendered” to the coronavirus. He said: Trying to feed your family is not “cowardly.” The vast majority of Pennsylvanians rely on their jobs to put food on the table and pay their bills. Because of Gov. Wolf’s prolonged shutdown order, nearly 2 million Pennsylvanians, or 26 percent of our state’s workforce, are unemployed, and overdose and suicide deaths are rising. Pennsylvanians have shown they can safely shop and work in mega-retailers while the Governor unilaterally keeps small businesses closed and is now threatening them if they re-open. Despite what Gov. Wolf believes, Pennsylvania’s small business owners and workers are smart enough to operate safely and feed their families. By constantly moving the goalposts and not allowing Pennsylvanians the option of supporting themselves, he is denying Pennsylvanians their freedom, exacerbating the societal effects of this virus, and creating a situation where the cure is worse than the disease.” “The only person who has surrendered to the virus is Gov. Wolf,” Keller added. Sean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter @SeanMoran3.

President Donald Trump on Monday said at the White House that Americans had learned a lot about wearing masks to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. “They’ve learned about face masks,” Trump said. “The good and the bad, by the way. It’s not a one-sided thing, believe it or not.” The president was likely referring to past guidelines shared by the White House Coronavirus task force about wearing masks. In the past, Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx have both spoken about the positive and negative effects of wearing a mask. “We don’t want people to get an artificial sense of protection because they’re behind a mask,” Dr. Birx said in April, noting that wearing a mask was not a substitute for washing hands and socially distancing. Dr. Fauci has previously explained to reporters that since he was tested for the virus and found to be negative, there was no reason for him to wear a mask that day at a press briefing. Trump pointed out his own staff and cabinet members who were all wearing masks, after the vice president’s press secretary Katie Miller tested positive for the virus on Friday. When asked if he required them to wear a mask, he replied, “I required it, yes.”

Los Angeles County, California, inmates are deliberately infecting themselves with the Chinese coronavirus in the hope of being released from prison, surveillance footage released by Sheriff Alex Villanueva reveals. During a press conference on Monday, Villanueva released surveillance footage from the Pitchess Detention Center showing inmates trying to contract the coronavirus crisis. Subsequently, more than 20 inmates seen in the footage tested positive for coronavirus. “It’s deeply disturbing,” Villanueva said. In one portion of the footage, an inmate can be seen getting hot water from a dispensary that is available to all inmates. Then, the inmate walks over to a group of fellow inmates where they pass the bottle around just before a nurse takes their temperature. Villanueva said the inmates were not only drinking from the same bottle to try to get coronavirus, but they were drinking the hot water to falsely show high-temperature symptoms of it. “Under normal circumstances, no one would be doing that anyway, particularly when everyone has the same access to the water. … No one shares this,” Villanueva said. “Now, they’re sharing the hot water and using the same bottle.” Other footage shows inmates drinking from the same Styrofoam cup and sniffing from a mask in order to infect themselves with coronavirus. Villanueva said the inmates were deliberately crowding together and not social distancing despite being held in the relatively large space where distancing is possible. “It’s sad to think that someone deliberately tried to expose themself to [coronavirus],” Villanueva said. “As a result of this behavior, from this particular modular, 21 inmates tested positive for [coronavirus] in a week of these videos being taken.” “That is problematic because somehow there was a mistake in belief among the inmate population that if they tested positive that there was a way to force our hand and release more inmates out of our jail environment,” Villanueva said. “And that’s not going to happen.” Since March 11, California’s Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has released more than 5,500 inmates into local communities. In the last week, alone, nearly 315 inmates were freed from prison. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter at @JxhnBinder.

The New York City Police Department (NYPD) is preparing for a crime surge in the aftermath of the Chinese coronavirus crisis as city officials have freed nearly 1,700 inmates from prison. In interviews with the Wall Street Journal, law enforcement officials said a surge in crime may be on its way to New York City as Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) considers reopening plans and the New York Board of Corrections continues freeing hundreds of inmates from prison. The Journal reported: The department’s commissioner, Dermot Shea, said in an interview that crime could rise in part because of the mass release of inmates from city jails to stem the spread of the disease among incarcerated populations and jail staffers. More than 1,600 people were released from city jails during the coronavirus pandemic, according to city Board of Correction records. [Emphasis added] … NYPD Chief of Crime Control Strategies Michael LiPetri said he is wary of an uptick in certain crimes, including violent acts, as residents return to public spaces. Thefts of personal belongings may increase as well, Mr. LiPetri said. [Emphasis added] … [Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams], a former NYPD captain, predicted an increase in crimes such as domestic violence because there will be few public places of leisure open. [Emphasis added] Since March 16, when Cuomo first requested that the Board of Corrections free inmates considered “non-violent” offenders, about 1,657 inmates have been released into New York City over fears that the coronavirus will spread in prison, according to state records. In the first two weeks of New York’s stay-at-home orders, the Board of Corrections freed 925 inmates into New York City — meaning that city officials released about 462 inmates each week in the early days of the stay-at-home orders. Before the stay-at-home orders, about 5,557 inmates were in the custody of the Board of Corrections. Today, that number has been cut to just 3,900 inmates. This indicates a nearly 30 percent reduction in the New York City prison population in less than two months. At the beginning of the year, Cuomo implemented bail reform laws that eliminated bail for suspects accused of second-degree manslaughter, aggravated vehicular assault, third-degree assault, promoting an obscene sexual performance by a child, criminally negligent homicide, aggravated vehicular homicide, and about 100 other crimes. In March, NYPD officials said that in the first 58 days of the year, close to 500 suspects who would have been kept locked up in jail if not for the new bail reform laws had been rearrested for committing an additional 846 crimes. Nearly 300 of these crimes included murder, rape, robbery, felony assault, burglary, grand larceny, and grand larceny auto. Over the last month, even with strict stay-at-home orders, murders are up 36 percent in New York City compared to last year. The city has also seen a 37 percent increase in burglaries and a 56 percent increase in grand larceny auto. In the last week, alone, New York City has seen a 110 percent increase in the number of shooting victims and a 90 percent increase in the number of shooting incidents compared to the same time last year.

The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) newsletter People’s Daily on Monday demanded a controlling role for China’s Belt and Road News Network (BRNN) over all global media, ostensibly to counteract “racially discriminatory messages” from certain Western nations that refuse to stop asking questions about where the Wuhan coronavirus came from. People’s Daily pushed CCP propaganda about its supposedly magnificent leadership in fighting the coronavirus to its logical extreme, demanding China be allowed to take charge of media coverage in other countries so that Beijing’s uplifting narrative becomes the standard everywhere. The world’s worst censors invoked the importance of “truth” as the reason they should be allowed to censor everyone else’s news: The media should faithfully record history and respect facts in news reporting. Truth is basic for news. At this crucial moment, media practitioners must work in a down-to-earth way, learn the real situations, and report the truth in the most accurate, objective and comprehensive manner. Unfortunately, some irresponsible Western media outlets spread and even fabricated rumors, which undermined international cooperation to fight the virus. China’s incredible sacrifice in fighting COVID-19 has made a huge contribution to the world, winning high recognition from the international community. It’s of great significance to provide objective and accurate coverage of Chinese anti-epidemic achievements when rumors abound. The media should be aware that when they share China’s successful anti-epidemic experiences with the world, they are injecting positive energy into protecting the lives and health of the people across the world. So why not let a Chinese Communist media operation become editor-in-chief for the entire planet, to “enhance cooperation to assist in the world’s COVID-19 fight and contribute to safeguarding the health and well-being of mankind”? The Belt and Road News Network (BRNN) issued an open letter to its alliance members of 205 media outlets from 98 countries around the world, calling on them to give the message of unity and support to the public, tell stories of how countries fight together by looking over for and helping each other, and give the warm message of unity and strength. The letter demonstrated the common aspiration of all media practitioners who stand by justice. When people are united and determined, they can achieve anything. To conquer the virus, the world must reach the consensus of building a community with a shared future, gather the common will from all human beings, and formulate a strong power for joint actions. Communist China is consistently ranked one of the worst places on Earth for press freedom and rarely scores much better than its feral client state North Korea. Germany’s Deutsche Welle (DW) was among many media organizations in 2020 to express concerns that Beijing already has far too much influence over global news coverage, and it is aggressively interested in acquiring more.  “In the case of China, the coronavirus outbreak has revealed the most important teaching of this crisis, which is censorship in China doesn’t only concern the Chinese people. It is also a threat to anyone on Earth,” Reporters Without Borders (RSF) bureau chief Cedric Alviani told DW. “Being able to control content dissemination channels, that allows them to be the gatekeepers outside of China, so then they can decide what gets on TV in Africa and elsewhere, what people are able to share,” added Freedom House analyst Sarah Cook, who wrote a report warning about the CCP’s relentless multi-billion-dollar effort to create a “media megaphone” that would broadcast its political narratives around the world. Cook’s report quoted Chinese dictator Xi Jinping laying out the objectives of his foreign propaganda campaign in 2014, demanding that media depict his authoritarian state as “a civilized country featuring a rich history, ethnic unity, and cultural diversity.” That is very much in line with the global narrative the Belt and Road News Network wants to set by taking editorial control of media operations around the world in the wake of the Wuhan pandemic.

Monday on CNN, anchor Jake Tapper said of President Donald Trump’s reopening push, “What about all the dead people?” Tapper said, “Gloria, as of right now Dr. Fauci, the head of the CDC Dr. Robert Redfield and the head of the FDA Dr. Steven Hahn are in some version of the self-quarantine because of possible exposure to coronavirus at the White House, and still President Trump refuses to follow the guidelines he has given to the rest of us. He doesn’t wear a mask or social distance. Why not set an example?” Network chief political analyst Gloria Borger said, “Well, because that is not the example he wants to set. The example he wants to set, and I think we’re going to hear a lot of that later this afternoon, is everything is fine. We’re going back to normal. Things will be okay. He doesn’t want to appear in a mask because he thinks that public will say, ‘well, wait a minute, if you’re in a mask, why are you things okay?’ And I think the problem that the president has been having is that what is going on in the White House contradicts that very message. He’s been tweeting over the weekend, for example, about how Democrats want to drag out the reopening because of politics. Lots of governors want to drag out the reopening because they want to do it in an orderly way, so they don’t endanger people’s lives, but that is not the message. The message is get back to normal. We have to reopen the country, and everything needs to look normal at the White House so you could know that it is normal in your community, as well.” Tapper responded, “Okay, but, I mean, what about all of the dead people?” Borger responded, “Well, you don’t hear the president talking about that often, Jake. Do you? At the beginning of this, we heard the president talk about the terrible toll this is taken in the country for people who have gotten the virus and people who have died from the virus. But you’re not hearing that a lot now.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D) on Monday outlined a broad list of potential “consequences” for counties and businesses that refuse to obey his lockdown orders. The warning follows his admission that he has not asked Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro (D) to interfere in areas that are moving ahead in violation of the lockdown orders. “I won’t sit back and watch residents who live in counties under Stay at Home orders get sick because local leaders cannot see the risks of #COVID19 and push to reopen prematurely,” Wolf said on social media following his press conference. “Today I am announcing consequences for counties that do not abide by the law to remain closed,” he continued, reiterating some of the vague threats he outlined during his presser. Counties that opt to proceed in reopening outside of the governor’s plan “won’t be eligible for federal stimulus discretionary funds,” Wolf said, noting that those funds will instead go to obedient counties. So far, Wolf has only allowed 24 counties to move into the restrictive yellow phase. Thirteen other counties can join them Friday, May 15. “Businesses should know that opening in counties that don’t abide by the law will potentially jeopardize their business liability insurance or the protections it provides,” Wolf continued in his threats. Restaurants that opt to offer dine-in services in defiance of the orders “will risk receiving a citation,” the governor declared. “These citations can ultimately lead to the loss of a restaurant’s liquor license,” he warned. Currently, no restaurants are permitted to offer dine-in services, as the Wolf’s yellow phase of reopening explicitly states that restaurants and bars are “Limited to Carry-Out and Delivery Only.” Wolf also attempted to empathize with workers, stating, “If your county reopens prematurely and you don’t feel comfortable returning to work, rest assured that the commonwealth will allow you to continue to receive unemployment compensation, even if your employer reopens.” The dangers associated with the coronavirus are “present,” he continued, proclaiming that they are winning but, as he did during his press conference, accused those who seek to reopen as acting in “a most cowardly way”: Non-compliant counties won't be eligible for federal stimulus discretionary funds.  Instead, those funds will be allocated to counties working to stop the spread of #COVID19. — Governor Tom Wolf (@GovernorTomWolf) May 11, 2020  Dine-in restaurants that open in counties that have not been authorized to reopen will risk receiving a citation.

And, I believe that the overwhelming majority of my fellow Pennsylvanians intend to keep fighting it too. And with that unity, I know we can win. — Governor Tom Wolf (@GovernorTomWolf) May 11, 2020  Several county leaders have vowed to begin reopening, despite their red phase status, which bars “non-life essential” businesses from operating. A number of district attorneys have said that their offices will not prosecute businesses violating Wolf’s order. Despite the governor’s tough talk, Wolf admitted on Monday that has not urged the state’s attorney general to take action. “No, I have not–nor do I intend to,” Wolf said. Nonetheless, Shapiro is defending the governor’s actions. “The PA Constitution gives the Governor broad emergency power & his actions have been ruled constitutional multiple times,” he began. “In one of its rulings, the PA Supreme Court wrote the Governor’s actions to prevent the spread of #COVID-19 are ‘reasonably tailored to the nature of the emergency,'” he continued, adding that they “emphasized that the Governor is ’empowered to ‘issue, amend and rescind executive orders, proclamations and regulations which shall have the force and effect of law.'” “Further, the Supreme Court of the United States has also rejected a call to intervene and issue a stay,” Shapiro added: The PA Constitution gives the Governor broad emergency power & his actions have been ruled constitutional multiple times… — AG Josh Shapiro (@PAAttorneyGen) May 11, 2020  They emphasized that the Governor is “empowered to ‘issue, amend and rescind executive orders, proclamations and regulations which shall have the force and effect of law’.

Some of the nation’s leading progressive groups are demanding former Vice President Joe Biden vow to prioritize diplomacy and avoid “militarizing” disputes with Russia and China if elected commander-in-chief. More than 50 left-leaning organizations sent a letter to the former vice president’s campaign on Monday urging him to embrace “a principled foreign policy” that emphasizes diplomacy above all. The letter, which was signed by progressive heavyweights like MoveOn and Demand Progress, argued the crisis posed by the Coronavirus outbreak presented an opportunity for “bold leadership,” as the pandemic marked the “beginning of a period of profound instability for the entire planet.” “The American people are looking for a leader who will turn the page on 9/11 policies that have resulted in an endless cycle of war, countless lives lost, increased global instability, large-scale refugee flows … and the violation of Americans’ civil liberties,” the letter reads. Included with the letter was a 10-point policy blueprint the organizations wanted to see Biden adopt. List among the proposals were budgetary cuts to the Department of Defense, the reigning in of presidential war powers, the rejection of “discriminatory immigration policies.” Most notably, however, the blueprint urges Biden to pledge to avoid actions that will further Russia and China. “As Russia and China become increasingly assertive on the world stage, it is critical that you promote diplomatic engagement and avoid further militarization of our relationship with these major powers,” the letter reads. Adding that “overhyping the threat these countries pose to the United States intensifies fear, racism, and hate domestically.” The letter comes as Biden and his likely general election rival, incumbent President Donald Trump, have traded barbs back and forth about China’s responsibility for the Coronavirus outbreak. The president and his allies have accused Biden of being in favor of increased trade with China, highlighting not only the former vice president’s but also his family’s decades-long ties to the Asian power. Biden, for his part, has responded in kind, alleging the president has failed to hold China accountable for failing in its initial response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Such attacks on Biden’s part, though, have somewhat backfired on the left, underscoring the ideological divide among Democrats over China. While moderates believe the communist regime botched its Coronavirus response and then attempted to hide its negligence, some in the party’s progressive wing claim that any association of the virus with China is derogatory, specifically towards Asian Americans. Biden, himself, has attempted to walk a tightrope on the issue. Earlier this year, the former vice president indulged the sentiment of progressives by attacking as “xenophobic” Trump’s insistence on imposing a travel ban on China when the pandemic first emerged. In recent weeks, as polling has shown approximately 77 percent of Americans blame China for the pandemic, the former vice president has jettisoned that approach, much to the chagrin of his party’s progressive flank. Last month, the feeling of many on the left was summed up by Cecilia Wang, a deputy legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union, when Biden’s campaign released a fiery ad accusing Trump of having “rolled over for the Chinese” in the face of the Coronavirus outbreak. Wow ⁦@JoeBiden⁩. Already trying to out-Trump Trump. This kind of fearmongering is causing violent attacks on Asian Americans. If you are trying to reform your past history of racist policymaking, like your 1994 crime bill, you had better do some homework. This ain’t it. pic.twitter.com/ePHiVGQFf3 — Cecillia Wang 王德棻 (@WangCecillia) April 19, 2020  “This kind of fearmongering is causing violent attacks on Asian Americans,” Wang wrote on social media. “If you are trying to reform your past history of racist policymaking, like your 1994 crime bill, you had better do some homework.

Monday on MSNBC, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) said President Donald Trump’s response to the coronavirus pandemic was to issue a travel ban from China that he said “just didn’t work.” After that, the Connecticut Democrat accused Trump of having “gave up.” Host Nicolle Wallace asked, “On a scale of one to ten, where do you rate the crisis of the leaders of the executive branch in charge of the pandemic?” Murphy said, “Well, I mean, we have had just an absolute abysmal failure of leadership from the White House since the very beginning. Effectively, after the travel ban, a travel ban that just didn’t work, 400,000 people got in from those countries that were subject to the restrictions, after that, the President just gave up. The President and his team effectively gave up. They run a task force, they have press conferences, but they have effectively left the response to the states and to hospital systems and to municipalities. And even when they do try to intervene, it frankly makes the situation often much worse than if they had done nothing.” He continued, “I mean, we’re going to have these officials appearing before us tomorrow, largely via video, because of this outbreak at the White House. And one of the clear questions we have for them is, are you making the situation better or worse by having a half-way hand into the supply chain? Right now, what keeps me up at night as we start to reopen Connecticut in about ten days is testing. And right now, the administration refuses to take control of the testing supply chain, but they keep their hand in it just enough so that no one really knows who’s in charge. Is it the White House that’s deciding where testing machines go? Is it the testing companies? Is it the highest bidder that gets them? So we need to understand what the White House and the administration is doing and what they’re not doing, so we can effectively plan a response. Sometimes, a little bit of action is almost worse than no action at all.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

A group of demonstrators performed a series of exercises, squats, and pushups, in front of the courthouse in Clearwater, Florida, on Monday in protest of continued gym closures across the state. Gyms in the Sunshine State have been closed for weeks, and while the state is slowly reopening, gyms are not included — at least, not yet. The lack of gym openings spurred a protest outside of the Pinellas County Courthouse in Clearwater on Monday, which featured protesters holding signs, waving flags, and doing squats and pushups: WATCH: Protesters calling for gyms to reopen in Florida are doing squats and push-ups outside the Clearwater courthouse https://t.co/3BVzxHQPEJ #Florida #COVID19 pic.twitter.com/3cjgQ6kaM8 — WFLA NEWS (@WFLA) May 11, 2020  The state is currently in Phase One of Gov. Ron DeSantis’s (R) reopening plan, which allows retailers to conduct in-person shopping with a limited capacity and allows restaurants to offer dine-in services at 25 percent capacity. While Phase One did not originally include personal care services, DeSantis is allowing most to resume operations this week, although with limitations: Here’s a major announcement from my friend J Henry, owner of J Henry’s Barber Shop in downtown Orlando. ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/KnXFaMRVns — Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) May 8, 2020  Gyms are permitted to reopen under Phase Two of the state’s plan to reopen. However, they will only be able to operate at a 75 percent capacity. Additionally, they will be required to adhere to strict social distancing measures and increased sanitation methods. Florida can move into the next phase of reopening “once the governor determines it is suitable to continue reopening and after fully considering medical data in consultation with state health officials,” according to a FAQ of the governor’s orders.

A Colorado restaurant drew large crowds on Sunday despite a state public health order limiting restaurant services to takeout and delivery during the coronavirus pandemic. Crowds of people packed into Castle Rock’s C&C Coffee and Kitchen for its Mother’s Day service, with lines snaking out the door and every booth and table filled, according to video posted by Colorado Community Media reporter Nick Puckett: Happy Mother’s Day from C& C in Castle Rock, where the owner said this is almost double a normal Mother’s Day. pic.twitter.com/cPSzjmAfAg — Nick Puckett (@nick__puckett) May 10, 2020  The restaurant’s owner, April Arellano, reportedly said her business would fail if she did not “do something.” The long lines meant that in some cases, social distancing measures were not enforced. Some customers even showed up without masks. Under the state’s safer-at-home order, residents are not required to stay at home, and nonessential businesses are currently operating under certain restrictions to limit the spread of coronavirus. But the governor’s office said restaurants like C&C Coffee were breaking the law. “These restaurants are not only breaking the law, they are endangering the lives of their staff, customers, and community,” spokesperson Conor Cahill said in a statement. A health official told the Denver Post that violating the order could result in a year in jail or $1,000 in fines. Businesses who violate the law could also risk losing their licenses. While restaurants are allowed to provide delivery and takeout options if restaurants follow social distancing protocols, the safer-at-home order says dine-in services would not be allowed until at least May 26.

A city in China’s northeastern Jilin province, bordering North Korea, declared “wartime control mode” over coronavirus, locking down communities over the weekend after twelve Chinese coronavirus cases were recorded within three days, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) newspaper Global Times reported on Sunday. Jilin province health authorities declared the city, Shulan, to be at “high risk” for coronavirus, making it the only city or region in China with this highest-level designation as of Monday. The lockdown follows news on Friday that a 45-year-old female laundry worker, employed by the city police laundry in Shulan, tested positive for coronavirus, according to a press release by the Health Commission of Jilin Province (HCJP). On Sunday, the HCJP confirmed that eleven more people in Shulan tested positive for coronavirus, all of whom had come into close contact with the laundress. “Shulan should declare wartime control mode in line with the requirements of highest-risk level prevention and control,” Bayin Chaolu, the CCP Committee Secretary for Jilin Province, said at a coronavirus-response meeting on Sunday, according to the report. “The clustered infections in Shulan pose great danger to the lives of the public and the situation is heart-breaking, exposing the shortfalls and loopholes in anti-epidemic work. Those who failed to take action over the epidemic will be held responsible,” Bayin warned. Shulan, a city of 630,000 people, enforced a lockdown of its local communities and villages on Saturday, according to the report. Security personnel will guard all of the city’s official “exits and entrances,” allowing only one “door” or gateway to be used by local residents for essential movement. Families have been asked to stay home, and the government will allow just one family member to leave the house once a day to purchase “necessities” such as food or medicine. All of the city’s public transportation, including buses, shut down on Sunday. No taxis are allowed to leave Shulan. Railway services into and out of the city have been halted until May 31, according to the report. The HCJP announced three new infections on Monday, increasing the total number of coronavirus cases in Jilin Province to 15, CCP newspaper China Daily reported. According to the HCJP, the new cases were recorded in Jilin City, but all three were linked to the new Shulan cluster. Sixth Tone, a state-owned news site based in Shanghai, reported on Monday that Shulan’s mayor has ordered all “high-risk” people to be isolated. “The local government has taken strict pandemic control measures, including placing all high-risk people under quarantine and giving them coronavirus tests,” said Jin Hua, mayor of Shulan. “All residential communities and villages have been locked down.” In April, Heilongjiang province, which borders Jilin, saw some of its cities impose extreme lockdowns on people’s movement after dozens of new coronavirus cases emerged. In the capital, Harbin, CCP authorities forced residents suspected of having coronavirus into mandatory quarantine, locking them inside of their homes, according to local reports. At the time, a Harbin local filmed and shared a video of an apartment building that appeared to be sealed shut from the outside by authorities. On Monday, Wuhan, the city where the Chinese coronavirus first emerged in late 2019, reported five new coronavirus cases, according to a press release by the Health Commission of Hubei Province. The new cases are the first to be documented in Wuhan by authorities since April 3, the South China Morning Post reported. The news follows weeks of government authorities claiming that Wuhan and other parts of Hubei province have been “free” of coronavirus and ready to re-open after months in lockdown.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) on Monday referred to the Chinese-origin coronavirus as the “European virus” during his daily press conference on his state’s efforts to combat the ongoing pandemic. Cuomo made the remark as he vowed to defeat the deadly virus that has infected over 335,000 New York residents and killed 21,478, according to data tracked by Johns Hopkins University. “If you look at what we’ve done, New York cases are on the decline,” Cuomo said. “You look at the rest of the nation, outside of New York, the cases are still on the incline. We took the worst situation in the nation and changed the trajectory.” “If you had said when we started this, yes we had more cases than anyone else, yes, we had the European virus attack us and nobody expected it, but we’re not only going to change our trajectory, but we’re going to change the trajectory more dramatically than anyplace else in the nation,” he added. The New York governor’s misnomer was first noted by journalist Jordan Schachtel. In late April, Cuomo said coronavirus came to New York from Europe — not Wuhan, China, citing recently-published research. “The virus that came to New York did not come from China. It came from Europe,” Cuomo began as he explained new research tracing the early spread of coronavirus. The research, conducted by NYU Langone Health, found roughly 13,000 flights landed in New York and New Jersey from Europe between January and March, carrying at least 2.2 million people. “We closed the front door with the China travel ban, which was right, but we left the back door open,” he said, referring to President Donald Trump’s travel ban on Europe on March 12. Cuomo’s Monday comments also came as he announced that several update regions will begin reopening May 15th. The “Pause” declaration, which closed all non-essential businesses, will expire on Friday and it will be replaced by a system in which officials in 10 New York regions will make reopening decisions based on health criteria. “A new chapter starts today,” he said. “This is the next big step of this historic journey. “We’re on the other side of the mountain. It’s an exciting new phase we’re all anxious to get back to work.” Several of New York’s upstate regions, including the Finger Lakes region around Rochester, will partly reopen this weekend. The relaxation will allow for limited amounts of manufacturing, construction and curbside retail. Recreational outdoor activities and low-risk business like landscaping, gardening and drive-in movie theaters will also be allowed. The UPI contributed to this report. 

Boris Johnson’s government has decided that face-coverings, actively discouraged until now, do in fact work after all, as the coronavirus lockdown begins to ease. “As more people return to work, there will be more movement outside people’s immediate household,” declares the official guidance accompanying the minor changes to Britain’s pandemic restrictions. “This increased mobility means the government is now advising that people should aim to wear a face covering in enclosed spaces where social distancing is not always possible and they come into contact with others that they do not normally meet, for example on public transport or in some shops.” Countries such as the Czech Republic, Poland, and Austria came to this conclusion long ago, recommending the use of masks in some or all public settings and even making them compulsory — while in Britain health workers and border guards were banned from wearing even masks they provided themselves. UK Border Officials Ordered Not to Routinely Wear Masks https://t.co/EGNj8IO738 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 2, 2020  The new guidance says face coverings are not thought to provide protection to the wearer — although virologists have indicated that they can reduce the viral load on infection, which can lessen the severity of an infection and give the body’s natural defences time to ramp up and deal with it itself — and that their primary utility lies in preventing the “inadvertent transmission of the disease to others if you have it asymptomatically”. The guidance therefore appears to vindicate lay critics who argued against the official position that masks should only be worn by medical professionals and infectious persons from the outset, because it often takes some time for infectious persons to realise they have the virus, and asymptomatic carriers may never realise they have it at all. Johnson did add, however, that he was only recommending a “cloth face-covering in encolosed spaces where social distancing is not always possible and you’re more likely to come in contact with people you don’t normally meet… [because] face-coverings can help to protect each other and reduce the spread of the disease” — in line with the “my mask protects you, your mask protects me” messaging in Central Europe — “but this does not mean, I must stress this, this does not mean wearing medical face masks… which must be reserved for people who need them.” This means the official position is that members of the public are still to be discouraged from wearing those masks with the most proven benefits in terms of protection against the virus, in the name of beating supposed shortages of such items for health workers — despite the government having previously claimed that there is no shortage of such items, and frontline staff only lack them due to distribution issues. Germans Face Fines of up to 5,000 Euros for Not Wearing Masks in Public https://t.co/OKVrALd2EV — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 28, 2020  Boris Johnson’s government and public health technocrats are not the first administrators to U-turn on masks, however, with Germany now levying massive fines on people who do not wear masks despite Chancellor Angela Merkel having previously suggested that they would do more harm than good.

House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy told Breitbart News this weekend that Democrats under orders from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi backed out of a planned bipartisan commission to investigate the Chinese Communist Party and in particular the Chinese origins of the coronavirus. Democrats, he said, have instead opted for an impeachment-style House Select Committee to investigate President Donald Trump’s response to the coronavirus pandemic rather than zoning in on China as they had originally intended to do. Appearing on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel this weekend, McCarthy noted that Democrats had been working with Republicans to launch a Task Force in the House to investigate China for more than a year—but just before the pandemic struck the United States, Pelosi pulled the Democrats back. Despite Pelosi backing out on holding China to account, McCarthy extended an open invitation to Democrats to join the Task Force and work on this critical issue as they originally intended to do. At this stage, no House Democrats have agreed to stand up to the Chinese Communist Party. “This is something we’ve been working on for over a year,” McCarthy said. “I went to the Democrat leadership with this. The challenge for the 21st century for us and others is going to be China. We need to come with one strategy of America together, not as Democrat and Republican but together as one American plan. It took me a long time and I finally got the Democrat leadership to agree. This would be the same number of Republicans and Democrats. We went to make the announcement. We selected who was on it. There was even a great story in the Washington Post—something I could never say before—by Josh Rogin. He literally had the story written about us going to do this together when the Democrats pulled back on February 24. Before the virus, they pulled back—and now they don’t want to do it. I’m moving ahead without them. We’re doing our own China Task Force. I welcome the Democrats to join with us. Rogin just wrote this story this week about it, but we’re going to analyze everything about China. One thing of course will be COVID. Think when the Chinese found out about this in Wuhan. They stopped the flights, any domestic flights to Beijing or anywhere else in China, but they allowed international flights for people who wanted to continue to leave and go to other countries and spread the disease. We’re going to study about them taking over different organizations like the World Health Organization, U.N., and others. We’re going to study what the Chinese are doing when it comes to our university system. Just recently you saw where the Harvard professor was arrested for taking $50,000 a month from the Chinese and giving them our secrets. Think about the theft that has gone forward, or the expansion of their military—the lies that they gave to President Obama and he accepted that the islands would not be weaponized and they were. There is so much out there that we cannot sit back and just hope this stops. We need to have an understanding and a strategy behind it. That’s what we’ll do in this task force.” McCarthy said that the Task Force will investigate the origins of the Chinese coronavirus, which the U.S. intelligence community is unanimous in the belief it originated in China. Intelligence officials also increasingly believe that it may have come from a Wuhan laboratory called the Wuhan Institute of Virology inserted of a wet market, and that work that Rep. Guy Reschenthaler (R-PA) has led investigating U.S. tax dollars that flowed to that Chinese lab will be a part of the investigation. “That will be part of the Task Force study as well,” McCarthy said. “We need to know where this came from. If the Chinese government truly believed that it came from the wet market, they never would have reopened the wet market. They know where it came from. Why did they withhold our scientists from coming in and still why will they not give the information? This is an answer that the entire world needs to know.” Pelosi, meanwhile, is blocking any U.S. congressional investigation into China to instead pursue an investigation of Trump. “That’s exactly what it is,” McCarthy replied when Breitbart News asked him if Pelosi’s select committee plans were just “impeachment 2.0.” “You’ve got to understand, because in the CARES bill that we passed that was more than $2 trillion—you know what we put in there because we wanted to make sure we had oversight? We put three new oversight committees, knowing that every committee has an oversight component and knowing that in Congress we have just the committee of oversight,” McCarthy continued. “We went even further—we put three new entities. One is with inspectors general. They select who, and they’re going to analyze the money. One is the president nominates somebody and the Senate confirms and they’re going to be in for another five-year study. Then another one was all four leaders from the Senate to the House appoint a person and then the Speaker and the Leader in the Senate pick who’s the chair. Then they report to Congress every 30 days. The difference between that and what Nancy Pelosi wants to do is these are all nonpartisan, meaning it’s an equal number senators—Republicans—and you’ve got inspectors general who are independent. You’ve got somebody who has to be confirmed. You’ve got the protection there that somebody is going to do their job. Nancy goes and puts in a new one, and you’ve got to look who she put on the committee. It’s weighted for Democrats to have the majority, not an equal number. There’s no senators involved either. They named the chair before they ever told you the mission of the committee, Mr. Clyburn, who’s the person who said when the COVID virus came forward that it was an opportunity for them to restructure government into their liberal views. She put in Maxine Waters, we all know what Maxine has said that she will not stop until she impeaches the president.” McCarthy said that in addition to investigating the coronavirus origins in China, the House’s China task force will investigate the broader threat of the People’s Republic of China and its Communist Party leadership’s efforts to take control worldwide. “China has a very clear plan. By 2049, they want to be a one-world power. They want to defeat America by stealing our technology, overrunning our universities to take our very best minds, then you look at what they’re doing in agriculture and others,” McCarthy said. “You look what they’re doing even in the middle of COVID. They cornered the market when it came to PPE, personal protective equipment. Now when countries ask to buy some, they say that Huawei has to be able to enter their country. Then when you find today, does the American public know we don’t make aspirin, we don’t make penicillin, we don’t make vitamins in America anymore? China controls that supply chain. It’s the ingredients within, more than 70 percent when you go to the pharmaceuticals and others. Then were we shocked when we look to South Dakota and we had a meat-packing plant but what did we find out as well? It was owned by the Chinese. Are they trying to control our meat supply? This is a tactical move that the Chinese have been planning strategically for quite some time. Remember, it’s a Communist Party that runs China. Every company in China has to allow the Communist Party into it. If you want to buy an airline ticket inside China, and you’re Chinese, it doesn’t matter if you have money. It’s your social score that will allow you whether to get an airplane ticket or train ticket. That’s based upon what you have said—and not just what you have said about the government but what your family has said. It will determine what college you get into. Look what they are doing in Hong Kong when they said they would not for more than 50 years. That all changed. These are the types of tactics we have continued to watch and sit back on. I have talked to people who have been a part of government who campaigned on and wanted China to join the World Trade Organization who now come back and say that was a mistake. They have been stealing and theft from us for too long. We’re going to study every element of it, lay it out for the American public, get it back to the American public by October 1. We have some excellent experts out there and we welcome Democrats to join with us.” He also said that the November presidential and congressional elections will be a referendum on China. He said voters will remember that Pelosi’s Democrats in the House chose not to stand up against the Chinese Communist Party just like how former Vice President Joe Biden—the 2020 presumptive Democrat nominee for president—has stood down when it comes to Beijing. McCarthy even called Biden “Beijing Biden,” and said the American public will have a clear choice of appeasing China with Democrats or standing up to them with Republicans. “In November there’s going to be two questions before us,” McCarthy said. “There’s going to be two people running for president, President Trump and Joe Biden, who many people refer to as ‘Beijing Biden.’ You look at Biden and the money they’ve been able to provide his family, you watch what Biden has done for more than 40 years—appease China—providing them the resources they need. Did he ever stand up to them? Now what we’re finding is who is the best to stand up against China? Who’s the best to rebuild the economy? You’ve got Biden, who sat over one of the weakest economy growths of our time since World War II and you’ve got President Trump, who built the strongest economy in the history of America. It’s an easy decision between those two questions, on who is going to protect our children for the future and make sure that the 21st century is the American century not China’s century.” LISTEN TO KEVIN MCCARTHY ON BREITBART NEWS SATURDAY: 

The White House is directing West Wing staff members to wear masks — unless they are at their desks — in an effort to prevent the spread of the Chinese coronavirus on the premises, ABC News reported Monday afternoon. “The CDC continues to encourage the use of facial coverings when social distancing is not an option,” reads the memo from the White House Management Office. “As an additional layer of protection, we are requiring everyone who enters the West Wing to wear a mask or facial covering.” “If you are in need of a facial covering, you may pick one up from the White House Medical Unit Clinic located in EEOB 97,” it continues. “Staff who sit in the West Wing ar not required to wear a facial covering while at their desk if they are appropriately socially distanced from their colleagues.” The directive also asks staff to avoid “unnecessary” visits to the building. NEW: Here is the directive that went out to staff about the new mask policy in the West Wing this afternoon –> Reporting w/ @Santucci pic.twitter.com/FIaCptdwgh — Katherine Faulders (@KFaulders) May 11, 2020  The development comes as Vice President Mike Pence, head of the coronavirus task force, has been in self-isolation since Friday due to his press secretary, Katie Miller, testing positive for the illness. “Vice President Pence will continue to follow the advice of the White House Medical Unit and is not in quarantine,” Pence spokesman Devin O’Malley said. “Additionally, Vice President Pence has tested negative every single day.” Miller is married to top Trump adviser Stephen Miller, who has tested negative, an administration official said. On Saturday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said they will quarantine for 14 days. The day before, Food and Drug Administration commissioner Stephen Hahn, said he already had gone into quarantine. All three of them have tested negative, along with Trump and Pence, but two people with access to the White House tested positive for coronavirus last week. Trump and Pence are being tested daily, officials said. Beside Miller, one of Trump’s personal valets tested positive for the coronavirus. The White House said the unnamed aide, who is in the Navy, developed symptoms Tuesday and then was tested. The aide works in the West Wing, and duties involve serving meals to Trump.

The American Hockey League canceled the rest of its season Monday because of the coronavirus pandemic, shifting its focus toward an uncertain future. While the Calder Cup will not be handed out for the first time since 1936, the 31-team AHL hopes to return next season. That remains uncertain; one possibility is that no fans would be allowed in arenas. Incoming president and CEO Scott Howson, who will take over for David Andrews this summer, said the AHL is still planning for a full 2020-21 regular season running from Oct. 9-April 18. But it also is working on schedules that start in November, December or January. “Obviously (we’ll) talk about no fans in the building: Are teams prepared to do that?” Howson said. “It’s just in the infancy stages now, and we’ve got a lot of information to gather. But we are going to have models that sort of have truncated season as we move along. … We’re just going to keep planning and make sure we’re flexible and nimble and ready to turn to a different scenario if we have to.” Andrews, who has been at the helm of the Springfield, Massachusetts-based AHL for 26 years, announced that the league had “determined that the resumption and completion of the 2019-20 season is not feasible in light of current conditions.” The AHL’s Board of Governors made that determination in a conference call Friday. “It’s something that was essentially inevitable,” said Syracuse defenseman Cameron Gaunce, who is an AHL executive committee member for the Professional Hockey Players Association. “I think they had been waiting for this point because they wanted to see if there had been any changes, and I think that was the responsible way to go about it. They didn’t want to make any knee-jerk reactions either way.” The 84th season for the NHL’s top minor league was suspended March 12 with 209 games remaining. That was the same day the NHL stopped play, though it still hopes to resume and could include many AHL players as part of expanded rosters. “We are very grateful to the National Hockey League and its teams for their support and leadership in navigating through the challenges faced over the past two months,” Andrews said. “The AHL continues to place paramount importance on the health and safety of our players, officials, staff and fans and all of their families, and we all look forward to returning to our arenas in 2020-21.” PHPA executive director Larry Landon recently said he’s concerned about the ability of the AHL and ECHL — which canceled the rest of its season in March — returning if it’s not safe for fans. “You don’t know what’s going to happen, whether there’s going to be an AHL season next year,” said Gaunce, whose NHL/AHL contract with Tampa Bay is set to expire after this season. “If ticket revenues aren’t part of the revenue stream for a lot of these teams, that’s going to affect a lot of their bottom lines. And if that’s the case, how many expenses are they really going to be willing to take on? So it’s something that’s up in the air.”

Round the Clock Diner in Pennsylvania’s York County opened its doors for patrons to dine in on Mother’s Day despite Gov. Tom Wolf’s (D) orders preventing such action. Round the Clock Diner opened its restaurants in the Manchester and Springettsbury townships for dine-in services, just days after the York County district attorney’s office indicated that it would not prosecute businesses that refused to abide by the governor’s restrictions. “On Sunday morning, a line of patrons spilled out of Round the Clock’s west location, at Route 30 and Toronita Street, Manchester Township,” the York Daily Record reported, noting that “the majority of the patrons were picking up orders for take-out, but some were seated at tables and booths.” The establishment has a pledge posted to the window, assuring customers that it is “doing what is necessary to assure a safe dining experience in this time of COVID-19.” Tables and silverware are sanitized thoroughly, two times, and are “done so again every time the table is cleared,” according to the pledge. The restaurant is also using disposable paper menus and asking customers to wear a mask as they come in the establishment and leave. “We’ve all helped flatten the curve,” owner Themi Sacarellos said on Sunday, according to the York Daily Record. “I think it’s time that people get back to work.” The restaurant’s reopening follows the decision of York County district attorney Dave Sunday, who said in a statement last week that his office “will not prosecute any criminal citations for alleged violations of the aforementioned orders and regulations, as amended, issued by the Governor and Secretary of the Department of Health concerning the operation of non-life sustaining businesses.” He also directed law enforcement to “not issue any such citations.” York Daily Record reported that York County 911 “said it received several calls for the diners, although a dispatch supervisor did not know the nature of the calls”: Northern York County Regional Police responded to the Manchester Township Round the Clock Diner, and Springettsbury Township responded to the location in its township. In Sprinbgettsbury Township, police spoke with owner Demos Sacarellos concerning possible consequences from the state, but business at the restaurant continued after police left. “We are operating within our constitutional rights and will protect our civil liberties as American citizens at all costs,” Sacarellos said. “We will not let the American dream fall throughout COVID-19.” “We’re not committing crimes here; we’re just trying to feed people and support the local economy,” he added. “It’s not a rebellion. It’s just business as usual.” York County remains in the state’s most restrictive red phase, which only allows “life-sustaining” businesses to maintain operations, with few exceptions. Even counties that have moved to the yellow phase remain under strict restrictions, as salons and gyms remain closed and restaurants are barred from offering dine-in services.

The long-term preoccupations of the British government were laid momentarily bare Monday when the Prime Minister’s coronavirus recovery strategy document hailed the partial shutdown of the economy as bringing “significant benefits”. The United Kingdom has been under government lockdown orders for almost two months, with many businesses shuttered, huge numbers of workers shunted from gainful employment to state welfare through the furlough scheme, and many of those still working forced to do so from home. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a slight relaxation of the regime Sunday evening, details of which followed on Monday afternoon in a 50-page Cabinet Office briefing document. While the paper — presumably drafted by civil servants on behalf of Downing Street — offered further detail on the present and future phases of lockdown including mask-wearing in public to slow the continued spread of the virus and the re-opening of schools, it also cited at least one perceived upside. Noting the impacts of the British economy being devastated by coronavirus and the subsequent lockdown, the paper reported that at least the reduction in economic activity — namely travelling to a place of work — had reduced the United Kingdom’s carbon footprint. The paper said: Many businesses across the UK have already been highly innovative in developing new, durable ways of doing business, such as moving online or adapting to a delivery model. Many of these changes, like increased home working, have significant benefits, for example, reducing the carbon footprint associated with commuting. As has already been noted — particularly by Breitbart’s James Delingpole — the severely reduced state of humanity, with its collapsing economic activity, fall in consumption, and nearly utterly destroyed global aviation industry, is a strong blueprint for the net-zero new world order hoped for by radical green activists. Indeed, British celebrity scientist and regular contributor to the nation’s state broadcaster Professor Brian Cox revealed such thinking when observing the state of humanity early in the lockdown, when he said the planet under lockdown had “shown us what a future with less pollution and more active wildlife could be like.” Delingpole: Earth Day 2020 – Greens Celebrate Coronavirus Lockdown as Blueprint for New World Order https://t.co/oURnG8d7Z5 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 22, 2020 

Vice President Mike Pence returned to work at the White House on Monday despite fears of contact with the coronavirus. The vice president was spotted by reporters arriving at the White House on Monday morning. Pence’s press secretary, Katie Miller, tested positive for the virus on Friday, prompting fresh criticism from the media establishment about the president and the vice president not wearing masks. The White House maintains that President Donald Trump, the vice president, and members of their staff are tested daily for the virus, allowing them to maintain their current work schedule. “Vice President Pence will continue to follow the advice of the White House Medical Unit and is not in quarantine,” spokesman Devin O’Malley said Sunday. “Additionally, Vice President Pence has tested negative every single day and plans to be at the White House tomorrow.” Miller was present with Pence in recent Coronavirus Task Force meetings at the White House. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Director Robert Redfield and Federal Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn will self-quarantine for 14 days, according to reports, and Dr. Anthony Fauci will go under “modified” quarantine. Fauci, Redfield, Hahn, and Assistant Secretary for Health Adm. Brett Giroir will appear via video conference for Senate committee testimony on Tuesday.

Eric S. Dreiband, the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ), told Breitbart News Sunday that Attorney General William Barr’s policy on protecting religious liberty had already seen results. Simply by taking a stand, Dreiband said, Barr and the DOJ had succeeded in encouraging some local governments to back down from extreme coronavirus measures that discriminated against religious institutions. “While shelter-in-place orders can be lawful, it is not lawful to treat religious worshippers worse than non-religious people who do similar things,” Dreiband said. Barr has been vocal about the erosion of religious liberty during the coronavirus crisis, and active in fighting it. In an interview with Fox News shortly before Easter, Barr expressed alarm at what he called “draconian” emergency measures taken by state and local governments to ban public gatherings, noting that he was concerned about “continuing encroachments on personal liberty.” In the days that followed, state and local authorities — almost all of them Democrats — cracked down on churches. In Greenville, Mississippi, drive-thru services were banned; parishioners sitting in their cars received $500 fines from police. When the church sued, the DOJ filed a “statement of interest” backing the church. “After we filed, the City of Greenville backed off, and announced they were not going to seek to enforce any penalties, or the citation,” Dreiband told Breitbart News Sunday. “So they backed off there — for which, I give them credit for that. I mean, I think, you know, state and local governments have a difficult job to do, and sometimes, we all make mistakes.” Later in the month, Barr issued a memorandum to U.S. Attorneys warning that the “First Amendment and federal statutory law prohibit discrimination against religious institutions and religious believers,” even in an emergency. “[T]he Constitution is not suspended in times of crisis,” he noted. Subsequently, last Sunday, the DOJ filed another “statement of interest” in support of a Virginia church catering to “recovering drug addicts and former prostitutes” whose pastor was issued a criminal citation for breaking Gov. Ralph Northam’s ban on religious gatherings of more than 10 people. (The church had held a service for 16 people in a 225-seat sanctuary). The governor has allowed larger gatherings in stores, including liquor stores.  Dreiband told Breitbart News Sunday that Virginia state authorities have not backed down, and the case is heading to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. But the DOJ continues to have success elsewhere. At the Powerline blog, Paul Mirengoff likewise noted Monday that the DOJ had encouraged Norman, Oklahoma, Mayor Breea Clark — a Democrat — to back down from a ban on religious services. “As a result of the DOJ’s intervention, Clark reopened the city’s churches in time for Mother’s Day,” Mirengoff noted (original link).

“Stay alert, control the virus and save lives”. This is UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s latest propaganda slogan — and like everything else his flailing, failing administration has done in response to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic it’s an embarrassing shambles. Stay alert? Alert for what exactly? Deadly microbes hiding in dark alleys waiting to pounce on unwary passers-by? Naughty lockdown-breakers — and there are more of us by the day — insolently flouting the government’s nannyish rules on how much sun you’re allowed in the park? Dangerous columnists fomenting dissent by suggesting that all these measures are a complete waste of time because the virus has likely peaked as viruses tend to do, with or without lockdowns and the self-inflicted destruction of the global economy? Here — courtesy of Lockdown Sceptics — is part of the case for the prosecution: The Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM), a great source of data about COVID-19, has published a graph plotting the rise and fall of deaths from the virus. This shows the numbers who have died in English hospitals and tested positive for the disease at the time of death up to May 7th: Note that deaths peaked on April 8th, less than three weeks after the lockdown was imposed on March 23rd. Professor Carl Heneghan, the director of the CEBM, has repeatedly made this point. As he says, it suggests the social distancing measures recommended by the Government on March 16th were more than adequate to suppress infections without the need for more draconian measures. Increasingly, it is starting to look as though the UK government — in common, it must be said, with a lot of other governments — has badly misjudged this pandemic. It didn’t react soon enough at the beginning; then, it overcompensated by overreacting subsequently. The result is utter nonsense like Boris’s latest traffic lights policy, whereby Britain is to be gradually eased back to normality in a succession of stages from red through amber to green. Currently, the UK is at Level Four (Lockdown) – though it is entering Level Three (Partial Lockdown) this week, which won’t feel an awful lot different, except that it some respects it will be worse: police are to be granted the power to impose increased fines for lockdown breaches; more people will be out and about — but restaurants and cafes will remain frustratingly closed; arrivals at British airports will have to undergo 14 day quarantine at some point in the future — so forget your summer holiday abroad unless you’re prepared to factor in a fortnight’s compulsory isolation when you arrive home. Green — Level One — won’t be achieved, according to the Sunday Telegraph, until there are “no transmission of infections in England – a situation currently only foreseen in the event of a successful vaccine being administered across the country.” So, not until at least well into next year, then. More likely never. If you genuinely believe — as a worrying percentage of Britain’s cowed, bedwetting population still does — that Chinese Coronavirus is as deadly as Spanish Flu, then even Boris’s modest relaxations of the lockdown regime will still feel terrifyingly risky. But if you do believe this stuff that makes you a low-information hysteric because, though many of us had a perfect right to panic when Coronavirus and its trajectory was an unknown quantity, we now know certainly at least enough to know that endless lockdowns aren’t the solution. A biology professor put it well in the Telegraph: (h/t Lockdown Sceptics) SIR – Science proceeds by putting forward conjectures or hypotheses, collecting empirical data to test them, and accepting, rejecting or modifying them on that basis. The implication is that our scientific understanding is not fixed, but changes as evidence accumulates. In the United Kingdom the initial decision to impose lockdown to control the effects of COVID-19 was based on a conjecture or model that has now been tested against real data and is found to be wanting. The model predicts that, under the sustainable public health measures taken by Sweden and in the absence of lockdown, there should now be 60,000 deaths in that country from Covid-19, whereas there are currently only about 3,000 there, with deaths now well past the peak and declining. Given the failure of the model to make useful predictions, there is no justification for using it to guide future policy. In contrast, large amounts of empirical evidence have now been gathered which demonstrate that for a very large fraction of the population the virus poses a very low risk, while a small fraction – whose immune systems are compromised – are vulnerable. Therefore, to follow the science, an appropriate policy is the targeted shielding of those who choose to be classified as vulnerable, rigorous screening of their carers to prevent transfer of infection to the vulnerable sector, and release from lockdown for those outside these categories. Continuing the blanket lockdown cannot be justified on the basis that it is “following the science”. Professor Richard Ennos, Edinburgh Very well put, Prof. So why, you wonder, is Boris Johnson’s administration – which supposedly has many more talents within it than the dismal David Cameron and Theresa May administrations – proving so unresponsive to the changing evidence? I have my theories – but we’ll come to them on another occasion. There was no reason why the British economy needed to be flushed down the toilet and the British people turned into snitches, tinpot authoritarians and brainwashed bedwetters. Boris and his idiot crew fell hook line and sinker for the specious narrative provided by the left-leaning scientists on their SAGE committee. And now a once-proud nation is paying the bitterest of prices for it.

NEW YORK (AP) — Major League Baseball owners gave the go-ahead Monday to making a proposal to the players’ union that could lead to the coronavirus-delayed season starting around the Fourth of July weekend in ballparks without fans, a plan that envisioned expanding the designated hitter to the National League for 2020. Spring training would start in early to mid-June, a person familiar with the decision told The Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because details of the plan were not announced.
Each team would play about 82 regular-season games: against opponents in its own division plus interleague matchups limited to AL East vs. NL East, AL Central vs. NL Central and AL West vs. NL West. Postseason play would be expanded from 10 clubs to 14 by doubling wild cards in each league to four.
Teams would prefer to play at their regular-season ballparks but would switch to spring training stadiums or neutral sites if medical and government approvals can’t be obtained for games at home. Toronto might have to play home games in Dunedin, Florida. The All-Star Game, scheduled for Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles on July 14, likely would be called off.
Teams will propose that players receive the percentage of their 2020 salaries based on a 50-50 split of revenues MLB receives during the regular-season and postseason, which likely will be among the most contentious aspects of the proposal during negotiations with the players’ association. That proposal would take into account fans being able to return to ballparks at some point, perhaps with a small percentage of seats sold at first and then gradually increasing.
Rosters would be expanded from 26 to around 30. With minor leagues shuttered, there likely will be the addition of about 20 players per club akin to the NFL’s practice squad. MLB officials are slated to make a presentation to the union on Tuesday. Players and teams agreed to a deal on March 26 that called for each player to receive only a portion of salary, determined by what percentage of a 162-game schedule is played. As part of that deal, if no season is played each player would receive 2020 service time matching what the player earned in 2019. But that deal is contingent there being no restrictions on mass gatherings at the federal, state, city and local level; no relevant travel restrictions in the U.S. and Canada; and Commissioner Rob Manfred after consulting the union and medical expects, determines there is no risk to playing in front of fans at regular-season ballparks.
Players and teams committed to “discuss in good faith the economic feasibility of playing games in the absence of spectators or at appropriate neutral sites.” Manfred has said about 40% of MLB revenue is tied to gate, including concessions, parking, ballpark advertising, luxury suites and programs. Union officials and players have cited the March 26 agreement as setting economic terms and say they have no inclination for additional cuts. Players are more interested in medical protocols and testing designed to protect them from and detect the new coronavirus. The proposal will detail the plan for dealing with players and staff who test positive. Because players accrue salaries for the regular season only and not for spring training or the postseason, the union may counter by asking for more regular-season games during negotiations that could significantly alter or possibly even scuttle the restart plan. The DH was adopted by the American League for the 1973 season but has been resisted by National League owners. The players’ union has favored it because it would create more jobs for high-paying hitters in their 30s, by MLB has looked at it as an economic issue. However, money has disappeared as an issue at this stage for 2020 because nearly all veteran players have agreed to contracts. Yasiel Puig is the most notable exception.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) slammed a “sick and twisted” column by a feminist writer who is yearning for the death of Stephen Miller, one of President Donald Trump’s top advisers on immigration policy. “This is sick and twisted,” Cruz said in a May 11 tweet in support of Miller. “Political disagreements are fine, but—especially in a time of crisis—we need more love in the world and less hate. #OneAmerica“ This is sick and twisted. Political disagreements are fine, but—especially in a time of crisis—we need more love in the world and less hate. #OneAmerica https://t.co/XodXR0bURV — Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) May 11, 2020  “I Will Personally Be Thrilled If Stephen Miller Dies of Covid-19,” said Molly Osberg’s headline at Jezebel.com. “While I am generally loathe to wish physical harm on those I disagree with, and while I do wish Katie a speedy recovery, I’m comfortable shedding whatever objectivity I have here to say I desperately hope Stephen Miller contracts covid-19,” Osberg wrote, adding: This is the man who has spent his entire life pursuing the idea that America’s diversity is a disease. … If thousands of Americans, the vast majority of them black and Latinx, are going to die every day from the new coronavirus, Stephen Miller should absolutely get it too. Trump’s supporters praise Miller for using the government’s many rules to incrementally reduce the flow of wage-cutting blue-collar and white-collar migrants into the U.S. labor market amid furious opposition from progressives and Fortune 500 lobbyists. Under Trump’s direction, Miller and other officials are now developing plans by mid-May to trim the inflow of salary-cutting white-collar visa workers from India and China. Numerous progressives — including immigration lawyers — have been making jokes over the news that Miller’s wife, Katie Miller, has been diagnosed with China’s coronavirus.

An increasing number of Pennsylvania district attorneys are stating that their offices will not prosecute businesses for violating Gov. Tom Wolf’s (D) orders restricting them from reopening. “People are being smart, wearing masks, and maintaining social distance. Using criminal sanctions would not be helpful,” Dauphin County District Attorney Fran Chardo said in a Saturday press release, which indicated that prosecution would only occur in an “extraordinary circumstances.” “The criminal law is a blunt instrument and is not ordinarily used for enforcement of a Governor’s decree,” Chardo added. Dauphin County is one of several Pennsylvania counties that Wolf has failed to allow to move on to the next phase of reopening. It remains in the most restrictive red phase — a lockdown phase that prevents most business owners from resuming operations. Wolf recently extended the lockdown order for counties remaining in the red phase to June 4. Only “life sustaining” businesses are permitted to operate, with a small exception for those who applied for waivers — a controversial process that has been under intense scrutiny, spurring a class action lawsuit on behalf of businesses that were rejected for reasons that remain largely unknown. Dauphin County Board of Commissioners Chairman Jeff Haste outlined the county’s plan to defy Wolf’s order on Friday, demanding the governor to “return our state to the people (as prescribed by our Constitution) and not run it as a dictatorship.” The decision to remain locked down “has ruined the livelihood of millions of hard-working Pennsylvanians in exchange for 0.4 percent of our population,” Haste explained, expressing sympathy for those who lost loved ones to the Chinese coronavirus while also noting “great concern for the families that now have to struggle with financial concerns, mental health stress, addiction and more because of the shutdown.” “For centuries, our people and businesses have shown they can adapt to changes to survive and prosper,” Haste said. “They cannot, however, do a thing when a dictator and an unelected secretary place them in lockdown.” We “stand behind our District Attorney in his decision not to prosecute any case against a business that chooses to open following the mandated guidelines as laid out in the yellow phase of reopening PA,” he added. Chardo is not the only district attorney to express that stance. Lebanon County commissioners said the county “plans to move forward and will require businesses who are ready to reopen to follow CDC guidelines” despite the governor’s decision to exclude the county from moving forward. District Attorney Pier Hess Graf indicated that her office will not prosecute business owners who opt to reopen in defiance of the governor’s orders. “Effectively the governor’s orders revoked our personal freedoms and liberties as individuals,” Graf stated in a release. “The essential question is how do we as a society weigh the need for the economic success of those around us against the community’s ability to remain safe,” she added. York County district attorney Dave Sunday said last week that his office will also not prosecute nonessential businesses reopening in defiance of the governor’s edicts and directed law enforcement to “not issue any such citations.” “In analyzing the ever-changing scope and application of these orders, we find that their enforcement as criminal penalties is not possible on the consistent basis required of prosecutors and law enforcement,” Sunday said in a Friday letter. He continued: Accordingly, this office will not prosecute any criminal citations for alleged violations of the aforementioned orders and regulations, as amended, issued by the Governor and Secretary of the Department of Health concerning the operation of non-life sustaining businesses. Lancaster County followed suit. The district attorney’s office said it will “not prosecute any alleged violations of the state-mandated orders issued in response to COVID-19, nor will it prosecute pursuant to directives of the Governor’s administration regarding the operation of ‘non-essential businesses’”: We decided this after careful examination of the law and the Governor’s orders/business waivers.We discussed with our neighbor @yorkcounty_da Dave Sunday and agree with his stance: a citizen must be clearly aware of the difference between criminal and non-criminal conduct. — Lancaster DA (@Lancaster_DA) May 10, 2020  “The COVID-19 pandemic and administrative orders from our state officials have placed law-enforcement all across Pennsylvania in uncharted waters,” District Attorney Heather Adams said Sunday. “Our interpretation of existing law in balance with the constantly shifting definitions of what is and is not allowed, per these orders, brought us to this informed decision: we will not prosecute,” she added. Wolf, while blasting local leaders who are standing in defiance of his order, admitted that he has not asked Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro (D) to act, particularly in red phase areas where district attorneys have vowed to refrain from prosecuting business owners. “No I have not. Nor do I intend to,” Wolf said during Monday’s press briefing.

Gov. Tom Wolf (D), who is facing mounting pressure from residents desperate to get back to work, doubled down on Monday, accusing local leaders who are reopening their counties early of engaging in a “cowardly act” as well as stating that local business owners who plan to reopen in defiance of his orders are “morally wrong.” Wolf addressed the bubbling tension in his state as several counties outline plans to reopen despite his lockdown orders. “To those politicians who decide to cave in to this coronavirus, they need to understand the consequences of their cowardly act,” Wolf said. He continued: The funding we have put aside to help with fighting this crisis will go to the folks who are doing their part, and that includes our CARES Act funding, which will be used to help counties that are following the orders to prevent the spread and medical communities who are treating patients. However, other discretionary funding won’t go to counties that put us all at risk by operating illegally. Politicians “urging businesses to risk their lives and risk the lives of their customers or their employees by opening prematurely” are “engaging in behavior that is both selfish and unsafe,” Wolf continued, attempting to pit Pennsylvania business owners against local leaders who are standing in solidarity with them to reopen their respective counties so Pennsylvanians can continue with their livelihoods. “You business owners, these politicians put you at risk of losing your health department certificate,” liquor license, and certificate of occupancy, Wolf said. “All these depend upon your doing everything you can to keep your patrons safe, and by opening before the evidence suggests you should, you’re taking undue risks with the safety of your customers,” the governor warned. “That’s not only morally wrong; that’s also really bad business,” he said, continuing to lecture business owners who follow the “whims” of local leaders and warning that they will “probably find themselves uninsured.” Wolf continued to accuse those who want to reopen ahead of schedule of surrendering to the virus and quitting the fight. However, Wolf walked back his threats during the Q&A portion of the presser, noting that the federal government largely designates where the CARES Act money goes. “What I was talking about are discretionary dollars,” he said. When asked if he could prevent counties from defying his orders and reopening, Wolf suggested he could. “Yeah. Again, the constitutions of county commissioners are also my constituents,” he said, later admitting that he has not asked Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro (D) to act in areas where district attorneys will not prosecute for reopening in regions where the lockdown order remains in place. “No, I have not–nor do I intend to,” Wolf said. Wolf also refused to forcefully push back on President Trump’s tweet Monday morning in which he proclaimed that the “great people of Pennsylvania want their freedom now.” “I don’t know how you stay safe and move quickly,” the governor stated. Wolf’s remarks came as several local Pennsylvania leaders outlined their intention of moving their counties to the next phase of reopening, regardless of Wolf’s orders. Many district attorneys and sheriff’s offices across the state have indicated they will not criminalize business owners who operate outside of the governor’s stringent orders, which he recently extended to June 4.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) announced Monday his state will begin reopening several upstate regions on May 15, marking what he described as an “exciting new phase” of the Chinese coronavirus recovery. Cuomo’s “Pause” order, which shut down all nonessential businesses, will expire on Friday, allowing officials in ten New York regions to decide on how to get their areas up and running again. “A new chapter starts today,” the governor said in a press briefing in Rochester. “This is the next big step of this historic journey. We’re on the other side of the mountain. It’s an exciting new phase, we’re all anxious to get back to work.” NY Gov. Cuomo: "We have abated the worst by what we've done and now we can intelligently turn towards reopening" https://t.co/OX3JqvMg39 pic.twitter.com/4wUUKgCIFs — CBS News (@CBSNews) May 11, 2020  Several of New York’s upstate regions, including the Finger Lakes region around Rochester, will partly reopen this weekend. The relaxation will allow for limited amounts of manufacturing, construction, and curbside retail. Recreational outdoor activities and low-risk business like landscaping, gardening, and drive-in movie theaters will also be allowed. Earlier Monday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said key figures continued to decline. As of Friday, the latest data available, hospitalizations fell to 55 people, and the number of individuals in intensive care dropped to 537, he said. De Blasio also announced an initiative to supply 1,000 community clinics with protective equipment, and said schools are on track to be open for the next academic year in September.

Monday on MSNBC, Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) compared President Donald Trump’s response to the coronavirus pandemic to President Herbert Hoover handling of the beginning of the Great Depression. Markey said, “Obviously there has been a complete underestimation of the magnitude of this problem right from the get-go by the Trump administration. They continue to downplay it. They continue to leave the misimpression that it is going to be something that will be relatively brief. It’s very clear now that it won’t be. This is going to go on for a long time. Their own FEMA analysis indicates that 3,000 persons a day could be dying by June 1st. This is going to be something that requires a systemic and massive intervention by the federal government to keep families alive and to keep businesses alive. And what we’ve been doing so far is insufficient to the magnitude of this problem, which is why Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris and I are introducing legislation to say that per month every individual should receive $2,000, a couple $4,000 a month, and each child $2,000 per month up to three children in the family. We have to get the resources into the hands of the families of the workers so that they have the economic life raft to make it through this health care crisis.” He continued, “We have to think back to Herbert Hoover in denial all the way up to 1932 when FDR came in, he began to put together solutions that were the match for the problem. Well, Trump is just the latter-day Herbert Hoover. And so we just have to basically say it’s a crisis, it’s only been seen by the Great Depression. If that’s the case, we need a Rooseveltian response put in place. That’s what we’re proposing in terms of the aid that we are going to give to individuals all across the country until we come on the other side of this crisis.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

“Maybe college kids will go to school next year and laugh at the idea of microaggressions, because maybe they actually lived through something difficult lately,” said Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-TX), speculating on a possible improvement among post-secondary students’ attitudes following the eventual end of the coronavirus pandemic. In an interview on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Sunday with host Joel Pollak, Crenshaw, a retired Navy SEAL and author of Fortitude: American Resilience in the Era of Outrage, considered the development of resilience through adversity. Pollak said, “You wrote this book about the breakdown of America’s ability to deal with difficulty,” adding, “It’s a hard lesson to learn, but it’s something you’ve got to teach your kids.” Left-wing fetishization of illusory grievances weakens one’s capacity to persevere through difficulty, warned Crenshaw. “I didn’t write this book for coronavirus, but there are lots of applicable lessons to the virus, and this confrontation with risk and risk acceptance,” Crenshaw said. “I note in the book how worried I am to see this trend about outrage culture, and the obsession with being offended, and microaggressions. I worry that the current population could never deal with something truly difficult, and I make note of that in the book.” Crenshaw added, “We actually are encountering something quite difficult right now. Some people are encountering it on the public health side, most Americans are encountering that difficulty on the economic side.” American grit is not well reflected in the nation’s political discourse, estimated Crenshaw. “I still believe — I’m still optimistic — the American people ultimately, at the ground level, still engage with this enormous element of fortitude, perseverance, and resilience, but our public dialogue seems to be the opposite,” Crenshaw assessed. “It does seem fragile. It seems like we are hair-on-fire. It seems like you would think that [the coronavirus outbreak] is the most difficult thing that anybody has ever imagined, but of course, it isn’t, looking back in history with some perspective.” Crenshaw stated, “I feel that the American psyche has become soft and fragile and I want us to be better.” LISTEN:  Crenshaw said, “My overall assessment of it is, given what we knew at the time, I think we had to lock down. But we gave people a set of goals for that lockdown, which was to flatten the curve and save our hospital system, and those have been accomplished. So I really question the governors and local officials throughout the country who refuse to reopen their societies even after that attack.” “That’s worrying to me, and it shows us that we misconstrue risk,” continued Crenshaw. “I think we’ll look back on this and say it took no courage whatsoever to tell people to stay locked in their homes. It actually took some courage to be honest with the American people about the risks we’re going to confront, and how we were going to do it, and if it ultimately was the right thing to do. Because you can’t pretend there’s no cost to shutting down the economy the way we’re doing.” Crenshaw warned of self-defeatism through perceptions of helplessness and victimhood. “One of the chapters in my book is called ‘The Stories We Tell Ourselves,’  and [it] is about engaging in suffering and hardship, but telling yourself the right story about that,” Crenshaw stated. “Sometimes you’re misconstruing hardship. Sometimes it’s really not hard at all. You think it is, but it’s not. Sometimes you’re a victim. Sometimes you’re actually not okay, but that’s irrelevant. Crenshaw went on, “What is relevant is the story you tell yourself afterwards, how you confront that challenge, because you control the future. You do not control what happened, but you do control the future. We do need to tell ourselves the right story about whatever hardship that we’ve confronted, and we do have to tell that story as overcoming as opposed to a story of victimhood and helplessness. Politicians “take advantage” of perceptions of victimhood and helplessness by trafficking in grievance and “emotional blackmail” to empower themselves, noted Crenshaw. “Telling people that they’re oppressed [and] that only they can be saved by a politician and government gaining power over [them] is a story of disempowerment, and I think it’s the most immoral thing you can do to the American people,” determined Crenshaw. The coronavirus pandemic may provide broader perspective to those fixated on trivial matters, estimated Crenshaw. Crenshaw stated, “Maybe college kids will go to school next year and laugh at the idea of microaggressions, because maybe they actually lived through something difficult lately, and microaggressions [will] seem like an afterthought [and] seem silly. I would hope that perspective is now being embraced by college students.” Breitbart News Sunday broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. Eastern.

Several Pennsylvania counties are planning to begin reopening, regardless of Gov. Tom Wolf (D) and his orders placing them in an extended lockdown period. Pennsylvania county leaders and residents are growing increasingly frustrated with the governor, who recently extended the lockdown order for counties remaining in the red phase until June 4. Only 24 counties moved into the state’s yellow phase of reopening on Friday, which loosens restrictions on in-person retail operations but requires many businesses, like gyms and hair and nail salons, to remain closed. Wolf last week announced that 13 other counties could join them and begin reopening on Friday, May 15. However, several counties have been left in the dust, and local leaders are revolting, vowing to proceed with plans to reopen despite Wolf’s orders. “We prefer to act with your cooperation, but we intend to move forward with a plan to restore Lancaster County,” county leaders wrote in a letter to the governor questioning his “methods.” “Governor, we don’t question your motives, however given all that has unfolded over the past several weeks, we must question your methods. We believe we share the same goals: public health, safety and an economy that can begin to recover,” they added. Other county leaders have released letters, indicating that they plan to charge ahead and move into the next phase of reopening, even though the governor excluded them. Lebanon County commissioners appealed to the frustration of residents, who they say “desire the ability to safely reopen their businesses and safely return to work.” Residents “heeded your instructions to practice social distancing and other mitigation efforts, and as a result, our local health care facilities do not lack the capacity to effectively treat these patients going forward,” they wrote in the letter. “Lebanon County plans to move forward and will require businesses who are ready to reopen to follow CDC guidelines including requirements such as hand washing, social distancing, and masks until further guidance is received for the county to move to the green phase,” they added. Jeff Haste, Pennsylvania’s Dauphin County Board chairman, came out particularly forcefully, blasting Wolf and and Health Secretary Rachel Levine, referring to them as a “dictator and an unelected secretary.” Haste said residents should be given the opportunity to demonstrate that they can reopen their businesses responsibly and safely. “I truly believe, if given the opportunity, businesses and citizens and residents will do the right thing, will follow the CDC (Centers for Disease Control) guidelines, and will let the rest of the business go,” he said. Haste “expects his board to take up a resolution Wednesday moving Dauphin into the equivalent of the state’s yellow phase for reopening from Wolf’s statewide business closure and stay-at-home orders,” PennLive reported. According to WGAL, several counties are either planning to open Friday or are clamoring to do so: Officials in Pennsylvania’s Buck County are also in talks with the governor’s office to move into the next phase of reopening. Commissioner Diane M. Ellis-Marseglia stated: The citizens of Bucks have been patient and committed to the requirements of a stay-at-home order and use of PPE; now they need to be given the final date so they can prepare for the change, which will involve extensive social distancing requirements. Bradford, Cameron, Centre, Clarion, Clearfield, Clinton, Crawford, Elk, Erie, Forest, Jefferson, Lawrence, Lycoming, McKean, Mercer, Montour, Northumberland, Potter, Snyder, Sullivan, Tioga, Union, Venango, and Warren counties moved into the yellow phase of reopening last week. This week, 13 additional counties — Allegheny, Armstrong, Bedford, Blair, Butler, Cambria, Fayette, Fulton, Greene, Indiana, Somerset, Washington, and Westmoreland — will join them this week, per the governor’s orders.

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D)’s office announced Monday that he is self-quarantining for an “appropriate isolation period” after a staff member tested positive for the Chinese coronavirus. The development comes after Pritzker once again tested negative for the deadly virus. The Illinois Democrat will now hold his daily virus briefings via video conferences.  Last week, Pritzker released a five-part plan to reopen businesses and institutions in the state. The plan divides the state into four regions – northeast, north-central, central, and southern Illinois – and each area can open independently through the five phases as businesses, institutions, and recreational activities restart operations. The state entered phase two of the plan on May 1, marking the beginning of a modified stay-at-home order. On Sunday, Pritzker once against attacked the Trump administration, claiming it has failed to deliver on numerous promises. “I have not been counting on the White House because there have been too many situations in which they’ve made promises not delivered,” he told CNN host Jake Tapper. “Very recently, they promised a lot of swabs. They’re supposed to arrive today, the first shipment of those. I’m looking forward to that. But what we’re doing is we’re going it alone, as the White House has left all the states to do. And we’ve done well, spinning up testing. We will continue to grow our testing. We have the ability to do that on our own. And we’ve had contact tracing across the state. We have county health departments that do that. We have our state health department, which does that.” As of Monday, Illinois has over 77,700 confirmed coronavirus cases and at least 3,400 deaths, according to the state’s public health department. The United States has 1.37 million cases and 80,652 fatalities, while 211,000 have recovered, reports John Hopkins University.

A virologist and clinical computational epidemiologist has slammed the Chinese virus model created by fellow epidemiologist Dr. Neil Ferguson of Imperial College London, whose dire mathematical models of the Wuhan coronavirus’s spread formed the basis for lockdowns in the U.K. and around the world. Scientist Chris von Csefalvay labeled Ferguson’s work “somewhere between negligence and unintentional but grave scientific misconduct.” Dr. Ferguson, whose advice to the British Prime Minister led to the lockdown in that country, recently resigned as an adviser to the U.K. government after breaking quarantine rules to meet his married lover, left-wing activist Antonia Staats. The code used by Dr. Ferguson, called by some the “architect of lockdown,” has now come under fire from another epidemiologist, Chris von Csefalvay, who called the computational code, developed by Dr. Ferguson to simulate the global spread of Chinese virus, “somewhere between negligence and unintentional but grave scientific misconduct.” Writing on his blog, Csefalvay took aim at Dr. Ferguson’s use of  13-year-old code to model the current pandemic, something that makes it far harder to understand. Via Csefalvay’s blog: For those who are not in the computational fields: “my code is too complicated for you to get it” is not an acceptable excuse. It is the duty of everyone who releases code to document it – within the codebase or outside (or a combination of the two). Greater minds than Neil Ferguson (with all due respect) have a tough enough time navigating a large code base, and especially where you have collaborators, it is not unusual to need a second or two to remember what a particular function is doing or what the arguments should be like. Or, to put it more bluntly: for thirteen years, taxpayer funding from the MRC went to Ferguson and his team, and all it produced was code that violated one of the most fundamental precepts of good software development – intelligibility. Csefalvay goes on to question why the British government seemingly unthinkingly accepted the Imperial model: There is wide support for a science-driven response to COVID-19, but very little scrutiny of the science behind many of the predictions that informed early public health measures. Hopefully, a Royal Commission with subpoena powers will have the opportunity to review in detail whether Ferguson intentionally hid the model from HM Government the way he hid it from the rest of the world or whether the government’s experts just did not understand how to scrutinise or assess a model – or, the worst case scenario: they saw the model and still let it inform what might have been the greatest single decision HM Government has made since 1939, without looking for alternatives (there are many other modelling approaches, and many developers who have written better code). The epidemiologist concludes by accusing the scientists of Soviet-style paternalism: There is a moral obligation for epidemiologists to work for the common good – and that implies an obligation of openness and honesty. I am reminded of the medical paternalism that characterised Eastern Bloc medicine, where patients were rarely told what ailed them and never received honest answers. To see this writ large amidst a pandemic by what by all accounts (mine included) has been deemed one of the world’s best computational epidemiology units is not so much infuriating as it is deeply saddening. Breitbart News columnist James Delingpole described Dr. Ferguson’s computer model as, “a busted flush — entirely unfit for purpose.” You can read Csefalvay’s full blog post here.  Are you an insider at Google, Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, or any other tech company who wants to confidentially reveal wrongdoing or political bias at your company?

Carnival Cruise Lines was inundated with bookings after announcing it would return to the high seas starting in August, following in the wake of months of being on Chinese coronavirus lockdown. Cruise Planners, a company that books cruises for the world’s largest cruise liner, said bookings shot up by 600 percent when Carnival announced that it would begin again on August 1, The spike is a 200 percent increase over last year. Cruise Planners told TMZ those cruise-bookers were “not a bit concerned about traveling at this time” because many said they were in good health and were looking forward to some fun after being in quarantine for several months. Carnival and its competitor, Viking, suspended their operations back in March to slow the spread of coronavirus, as ships quickly became hotspots for the virus to breed. The State Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) then issued warnings to Americans not to travel by cruise ship during the coronavirus outbreak. Carnival released a statement saying that although they are optimistic they will return to ports by August 1, the cruise line offered no guarantees. “We are taking a measured approach, focusing on the potential for sailing from a select number of homeports where we have more significant operations that are easily accessible by car for the majority of our guests,” Carnival Cruise Line said in a press statement last week. “We continue to work with various government agencies, including the CDC, as we introduce new onboard protocols, but there is no assurance of a return on August 1,” the statement continued.

Two federal courts blocked Democrat Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear’s ban on “any in-person religious service” during the Chinese coronavirus crisis. In two separate cases, federal courts ruled houses of worship must not be treated differently from secular gatherings or activities during the pandemic. On Friday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit granted, in a 3-0 opinion, an injunction for in-person religious services to take place Sunday, May 10, in the case of a Maryville Baptist Church. Last week, the court granted an injunction for parking lot church services, but directed the lower district court to address the issue of in-person faith services. In the case of Tabernacle Baptist Church of Nicholasville, Judge Gregory F. Van Tatenhove of the U.S. District Court of the Eastern District of Kentucky, a George W. Bush nominee, then ruled churches in Kentucky may open during the coronavirus crisis as long as they practice social distancing and the hygiene guidelines as prescribed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). BREAKING: Judge grants restraining order against Kentucky governor in dispute over in-person religious gatherings after the Governor’s order unlawfully limited church services in violation of the First Amendment. https://t.co/c3MqrNiBBi — First Liberty Institute (@1stLiberty) May 9, 2020  Tatenhove wrote his ruling applies statewide and that in-person church services are “essential.” He noted that while Beshear has some authority during public health emergencies, “constitutional rights still exist”: The Constitution will endure. It would be easy to put it on the shelf in times like this, to be pulled down and dusted off when more convenient. But that is not our tradition. Its enduring quality requires that it be respected even when it is hard. On the Road to Tyranny? The last few months have revealed dangers to our freedoms—especially religious liberty—taking place. We must realize that when churches and religious organizations are called 'non-essential', it is the first step toward oppression. https://t.co/jSMk7II5eV — First Liberty Institute (@1stLiberty) May 9, 2020  In its ruling Friday, the Court of Appeals wrote: The Governor has offered no good reason for refusing to trust the congregants who promise to use care in worship in just the same way it trusts accountants, lawyers, and laundromat workers to do the same. Come to think of it, aren’t the two groups of people often the same people – going to work on one day and going to church on another? How can the same person be trusted to comply with social distancing and other health guidelines in secular settings but not be trusted to do the same in religious settings? The distinction defies explanation, or at least the Governor has not provided one. The court also emphasized church members are not asking to be excused from social hygiene practices during the coronavirus pandemic. Instead, they are asking for treatment equal to those businesses and services Beshear and his administration have deemed essential to remain open: [W]hy is it safe to wait in a car for a liquor store to open but dangerous to wait in a car to hear morning prayers? Why can someone safely walk down a grocery store aisle but not a pew? And why can someone safely interact with a brave deliverywoman but not with a stoic minister? The Commonwealth has no good answers. While the law may take periodic naps during a pandemic, we will not let it sleep through one. Mat Staver, chairman of Liberty Counsel, which represented Maryville Baptist Church, said the injunctions send “a loud message that Gov. Andy Beshear may no longer discriminate against churches for religious gatherings – whether those gatherings be in-person or in the parking lot.” “At a minimum, the First Amendment requires that government cannot single out religious worship and churches for disfavored treatment,” he added. “The Constitution does not have a pause button during a crisis and it will not sleep through a pandemic.” Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron joined the lawsuit brought by Tabernacle Baptist Church: “I encourage all houses of worship to prayerfully and carefully consider when it is the right time to resume in-person services consistent with health guidelines,” Cameron said following the rulings. “Although these rulings protect the religious liberty of Kentuckians, we must continue to do our part to protect the health of our fellow citizens by reopening carefully.”

After weeks of claiming the coronavirus has been completely eradicated from Wuhan and its surrounding Hubei province, save for a few “imported” infections brought by foreigners and Chinese citizens returning home from abroad, the Chinese government admitted over the weekend that fresh coronavirus outbreaks are occurring in Wuhan and other cities. AFP reported Chinese officials admitting one positive test from Wuhan on Sunday and five more on Monday, plus 11 “asymptomatic” cases detected in other parts of Hubei province. The Wuhan patients are said to be residents of the same residential compound, a community called Sanmin with about 5,000 occupants, and most of the patients are “older people.” According to the South China Morning Post, an official named Zhang Yuxin has been sacked as head of the Wuhan branch of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) for his “poor control of the disease in the community,” which seems a bit harsh if only six people from the same residential compound have tested positive for the coronavirus after a month of absolutely zero new cases. “We need to always bear in mind that we have to control both imported cases as well as local cases, and resolutely keep the resurgence of Covid-19 at bay,” CCP officials said on Monday, working in the Party’s favorite talking points about foreign infections and second waves of infection.  Another outbreak was reported in the northeastern city of Shulan, which the SCMP said was in “wartime mode” after 14 new cases were reported in two days.   The city is imposing strict testing requirements for travelers and halting the sale of flu medications so that everyone with coronavirus-like symptoms will report to hospitals. A full lockdown has not been ordered even though at least one person from Shulan has been found in another city with an asymptomatic coronavirus infection. The individual in question was tested after he was detained on suspicion of an unspecified crime.

Eighteen Republican state attorneys general sent a letter to congressional leaders on Saturday, urging them to investigate China’s role in the coronavirus pandemic. The state attorneys general (AGs) sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), and other congressional leaders asking that they investigate China’s role and subsequent coverup of their failure to contain the coronavirus. The attorneys general wrote: Recent reports suggest that the communist Chinese government willfully and knowingly concealed information about the severity of the virus while simultaneously stockpiling personal protective equipment. In what Secretary of State Pompeo has described as a “classic communist disinformation effort,” the Chinese government, aided by the World Health Organization, appears to have intentionally misled the world over the last 6 months. The attorneys general include: The attorneys general slammed China for spreading disinformation such as “suspicious” gifts of drones to state, local, and federal authorities as well as “education” grants to American universities connected to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. They noted that some of their colleagues, Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch and Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, have filed lawsuits against China. They also noted that many of them are considering similar actions against China. They also called for Congress to investigate the origins and coverup of the coronavirus outbreak. “Congressional hearings are critical to our Nation’s understanding of the origins of COVID-19 and efforts and efforts by the communist Chinese government to deceive the international community,” the attorneys general wrote. The letter to congressional leaders follows McCarthy’s announcement last week that House Republicans reported the creation of a China Task Force to coordinate legislative strategy on all aspects of China while Pelosi continues to investigate President Donald Trump.

President Donald Trump on Monday criticized Pennsylvania Democrats for ongoing coronavirus lockdowns in the state. “The great people of Pennsylvania want their freedom now, and they are fully aware of what that entails,” Trump wrote on Twitter. The president commented on the Pennsylvania lockdowns as several counties are planning to reopen, in defiance of Democrat Gov. Tom Wolf’s restrictions. Wolf announced last Thursday the state lockdowns would continue until June 4, with some counties to begin reopening on May 15. Trump accused Democrats of letting political motivations keep their states locked down. “The Democrats are moving slowly, all over the USA, for political purposes,” he wrote. “They would wait until November 3rd if it were up to them. Don’t play politics. Be safe, move quickly!” The president met with Pennsylvania Republicans at the White House on Friday who complained about Wolf’s “draconian” lockdowns. Rep. Scott Perry (R-PA) and Rep. Guy Reschenthaler (R-PA) criticized Wolf for failing to protect the elderly, noting that 65 percent of the deaths were in nursing homes and eldercare facilities. “He just had a draconian measure, one-size-fits-all approach that lacked any kind of nuance,” Reschenthaler told Trump. “And it’s destroying our economy, while at the same time leaving the most vulnerable exposed to this virus.” Perry also criticized Wolf. “The governor has made the choice: Instead of helping some of these eldercare facilities, we have a website where people can snitch on their neighbor who’s going to work or who’s opening their business in — in contradiction to the order,” he said. “That not bringing anybody together.” Trump agreed. “What the Democrats are doing in Pennsylvania is a disgrace,” he said.

Boris Johnson’s government had reached a special deal with Athens to fly in over 50 migrants from Greece, despite the coronavirus pandemic and the country’s flight ban. Travel between the United Kingdom and Greece suspended in March — by the Greeks — amid the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, leaving some migrants in the Mediterranean country unable to join family members who had already reached British shores one way or another. But the British government has now, for whatever reason, made a special deal with the Greek government to fly in 52 migrants from overcrowded camps for the purpose of “family reunion” — also known as chain migration. Britain is almost unique in the world for having failed to impose bans on travel from any territory at any point — including Wuhan itself — and for not even requiring new arrivals to undergo a period of self-quarantine. The government has hinted strongly that quarantine measures may, at last, be on the way now — but likely not until June, and France, which is currently sending illegal boat migrants to Britain in record numbers, will be exempt. 'Beginning of an Invasion' – UK Boat Migrant Influx Hits New Record https://t.co/2hlpa39ZE7 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 10, 2020  “I hope it is only a start,” said Lord Dubs, the Labour peer who helped facilitate the flights, in comments quoted by the Guardian. “[T]here are other children who want to join their family in Britain under the Dublin III family reunion and there are other children who are in the Greek camps who may not have family here but also need to be helped to find safety,” he added, referring to EU rules regulations which the United Kingdom is still bound by. The 52 migrants, which according to the Guardian included people “from Syria, Somalia, and Afghanistan”, were also mostly not “children”. Family reunion policies, particularly where migrants claiming to be minors are involved, have come under sustained criticism from migration sceptics, as they encourage would-be migrants to send younger family members ahead, generally via criminal people-smugglers, to ask as a “bridgehead” for their relatives.

LONDON (AP) — The path to the Premier League resuming was eased Monday by the government saying elite sports will be allowed to resume in England in June if there is no new spike in coronavirus infections. While spectators will not be allowed into stadiums for some time, the British government embracing the return of professional sports stands in contrast to rulings by French and Dutch authorities who have banned any events until September. The announcement from Boris Johnson’s administration came as Premier League clubs held a conference call about the logistics involved in restarting the competition amid divisions over a plan to use neutral venues for all games. When the league was halted two months ago, Liverpool was 25 points clear with nine games remaining.
Now the national lockdown that was imposed in March and led to the shut down of sports is starting to be lifted by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Step two of the government roadmap for easing the lockdown restrictions includes “permitting cultural and sporting events to take place behind closed-doors for broadcast, while avoiding the risk of large-scale social contact.” “To aid planning,” the document added, “the government’s current aim is that the second step will be made no earlier than Monday 1 June, subject to these conditions being satisfied. … Organizations should prepare accordingly.” The Premier League and other sports organizers will now be waiting to hear when the government will allow the resumption of group training by athletes, even as social distancing regulations are maintained in wider society.
The challenge containing the coronavirus without a vaccine will mean sports will be staged without fans.
The government said permitting large crowds in stadiums again “may only be fully possible significantly later depending on the reduction in numbers of infections.”

Mexican health officials are already warning about a possible Coronavirus resurgence in October corresponding with the start of flu season. During a nightly news conference, Mexico’s Undersecretary of Health Hugo Lopez Gatell said that as most of the world expects to see an eventual downturn of the pandemic and a return to normal life, individuals must be cautious to avoid creating a new spike. “In October 2020, at the start of the Influenza season, there is the possibility that we could see a return of COVID with greater intensity,” Lopez Gatell said as he warned of possible regional quarantines.

ROME — The progressive leader of the Bishops’ Conferences of the European Community (COMECE) has called on Europeans to fight against the twin enemies of coronavirus and nationalism in order to preserve the European Union. “Let us do battle with the coronavirus and do battle with the virus of nationalism and selfishness,” said the Jesuit Cardinal Jean-Claude Hollerich (pictured) in an interview this weekend with the Vatican newspaper L’Osservatore Romano. “We need to have more solidarity and more empathy,” said the cardinal, who is also the archbishop of Luxembourg. “It is so important to show the world that human society can live in solidarity, that such a global crisis, this pandemic, can only be fought on a global level, and that the European Union is an instrument for world peace.” The cardinal gave the interview in the city of Schengen (Luxembourg), where the agreement opening borders between the signatory countries was signed in 1985, to celebrate “Europe Day” (May 9). There he lit a candle “to reiterate the need for solidarity, unity and peace, in this time when the covid-19 pandemic is plaguing the world,” the Vatican newspaper reported. “We need another virus, the virus of solidarity and charity, to understand that man does not live alone,” the cardinal said, because “we can only be human together with others.” “The European ideal is solidarity,” Hollerich said. “And solidarity does not stop at the borders of Europe. We have problems with borders: borders in Europe and borders of the European Union with other countries. There are people who die on the borders of the European Union and we cannot tolerate this.” Cardinal Jean-Claude Hollerich prays before the E.U. flag in Schengen (Vatican News) The cardinal has been an outspoken advocate for relaxing migration laws and last December chastised his fellow Europeans for failing to end the exploitation of migrants in Greece, urging member states to take in more migrants. “This is not happening far from Luxembourg in some place where we cannot help,” he said. “This is happening in Greece — in Europe and in the European Union. We must be fiercely ashamed that we have not done anything to help.” One week earlier, the cardinal said that the political inaction on the Mediterranean migrant crisis was due to “fear of right-wing parties.” “I find it outrageous that we’re letting people drown in the Mediterranean; that our hearts have become so hard; that politics no longer dares to act for fear of right-wing parties,” Hollerich said. In his interview Saturday, the cardinal said that the celebration of Europe Day furnishes “a moment of gratitude, because thanks to the European Union we have had peace.” In the face of the coronavirus pandemic, he said, in which many Europeans have died, the European Union needs to give “strong signals, with empathy.” “Not just theoretical solutions: aid must come soon because otherwise people will lose confidence in Europe,” he added.

NEW YORK (AP) — Just 0.7% of Major League Baseball employees tested positive for antibodies to COVID-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus. The small number of positive tests, announced Sunday, was positive news for a sport pushing ahead with plans to start its delayed season. Researchers received 6,237 completed surveys from employees of 26 clubs. That led to 5,754 samples obtained in the U.S. on April 14 and 15 and 5,603 records that were used. The survey kit had a 0.5% false positive rate.
Dr. Jay Bhattacharya of Stanford, one of the study’s leaders, said the prevalence of the antibodies among MLB employees was lower than for the general population during testing in New York, Los Angeles, the San Francisco area and Miami. “I was expecting a little bit of a higher number,” Bhattacharya said during a telephone news conference. “The set of people in the MLB employee population that we tested in some sense have been less affected by the COVID epidemic than their surrounding communities.” Data for players was not separated in the study, and some MLB family members were included.
Spring training was stopped March 12 and opening day was pushed back from March 26 because of the pandemic. MLB intends to give the players’ association a presentation this week for a possible start to the season, and has said frequent testing would be necessary. Antibodies are produced by a person’s immune system if they have been infected by a virus. These tests are different than the polymerise chain reaction (PCR) tests used to detect active infection.
“By using two different technologies, both PCR to diminish the active virus, as well as the antibody, the serology tests, that will give you better information and may even be able to alleviate some of the concerns with false positives,” said Daniel Eichner of the Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory in Salt Lake City. another of the study leaders. “So I would definitely advocate if anyone was going to put a program together to get their sport of their work back, is to utilize both different technologies,” he said.
The University of Southern California also participated in the study. Bhattacharya said MLB employees are younger than the overall population and took protective measures such as frequent hand washing when they reported to spring training in February, earlier than most people.
No MLB employees have been known to have died from COVID-19.
While the percentage of Los Angeles Angels employees with positive tests was the highest among teams, the error margin is too high to draw results because just 123 tests were included from the team. Bhattacharya called the results “both good and bad news” because they showed the virus has not spread widely in MLB but still has many baseballers left to target. Eichner said results could mean MLB employees had been diligent in use of personal protective equipment, such as masks. “If this population was social isolating and practicing good PPE, then it shows that that worked and it didn’t get the spread in there,” Eichner said. “And then the flip side of that is that means it’s worked well, then they keep doing it.” Sixty people tested positive in the raw data, and the figured was adjusted to about 42 to account for false positives and false negatives. Over 95% of the participants were under 65 and few reported comorbidities, according to Stanford medical student Bianca Mulaney, who authored the study. The Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati, Colorado and Miami did not participate, Bhattacharya said. A pre-print server will publish the study this week, and it will be sent to a journal for peer review.
Test kits were provided by the Partnership for Clean Competition, which funds anti-doping research, and researchers worked for free. Mulaney said the prevalence of positive tests for antibodies was higher in areas that have been harder hit by the virus, such as New York, and lower in less-impacted areas, such as Ohio. “This is a special population. It’s not it’s not representative of the American population at large,” Bhattacharya said. “But it’s an important population because it allows us to get a peek at the nationwide prevalence.”

South Korea experienced a considerable uptick in cases of the Chinese coronavirus this weekend linked to the re-opening of the nightclub district in the capital of Seoul, the majority of which are believed to have come from establishments catering to the LGBT community. The country has won widespread praise for its effective efforts in containing the outbreak, mainly through the use of a system known as “track and trace.” Officials from the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported 97 new cases as of Monday morning, the majority of which were linked to nightclubs in the gay district of Itaewon. The spike in cases led the government to postpone the re-opening of schools by at least one week, as children were originally scheduled to return to classes from Monday. Deputy Education Minister Park Baeg-beom described the delay as “inevitable” in the interests of safety, with the government now warning citizens about the likelihood of a second wave of infections. “We need to quickly find patients to stem community transmission,” said KCDC chief Jeong Eun-kyeong at a press briefing on Monday, warning that all people who visited the Itaewon clubs over the past three weeks should be tested regardless of whether they are symptomatic. Jeong added that the virus has so far not spread beyond the contacts of the first patient, identified as a 29-year-old man who visited five clubs on the night of May 1. “We should stop the virus from reaching a high-risk group and causing them serious damage,” she said. “I heard some people are reluctant to get tested for fear of being criticized. We will try hard to make sure everyone receives a test without feeling uncomfortable or prejudiced against.” The mayor of Seoul, Park Won-soon, has warned that although people will be granted anonymity, they will face heavy fines if they fail to get tested. According to The Guardian, many people are fearful of getting tested because of the possible anti-LGBT backlash they might receive. Despite its high levels of freedom and progressive leadership, the paper claims that South Korea has a “high level of deeply entrenched homophobic attitudes,” and those caught up in the recent wave of infections have faced hostility online and across the country’s media. “I admit it was a huge mistake to visit the gay district when the corona situation was not fully over,” Lee Youngwu, a gay man in his 30s, told the British daily. “But visiting the area is the only time when I can be myself and hang out with others similar to me. During the week, I have to pretend to like women.” “My credit card company told me that they passed on my payment information in the district to the authorities. I feel so trapped and hunted down,” he continued. “If I get tested, my company will most likely find out I’m gay. I’ll lose my job and face public humiliation. I feel as if my whole life is about to collapse. I have never felt suicidal before and never thought I would, but I am feeling suicidal now.” On Saturday, Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun urged people to “refrain from criticizing a certain community as it will not help efforts to contain the coronavirus spread.” Since the onset of the pandemic this year, South Korea has recorded close to 11,000 cases of the coronavirus and 256 deaths. Its figures are relatively low given the size of its population and proximity to China, where the outbreak began. It is often cited as one of the countries most aggressively attempting to return society to a state of normality, having already re-opened most sectors of its economy.

Dr. Anthony Fauci sees a football game with an infected player as “the perfect set up spreading” the coronavirus. In a recent interview with NBC Sports’ Peter King, Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that testing players would be a vital component of any plan to bring sports back. The doctor also stressed the need to take swift action to quarantine players who test positive. “Sweat does not do it,” Fauci said. “This is a respiratory virus, so it’s going to be spread by shedding virus. The problem with virus shedding is that if I have it in my nasal pharynx, and it sheds and I wipe my hand against my nose—now it’s on my hand. You see, then I touch my chest or my thigh, then it’s on my chest or my thigh for at least a few hours. Sweat as such won’t transmit it. But if people are in such close contact as football players are on every single play, then that’s the perfect set up for spreading. I would think that if there is an infected football player on the field—a middle linebacker, a tackle, whoever it is it—as soon as they hit the next guy, the chances are that they will be shedding virus all over that person. “If you really want to be in a situation where you want to be absolutely certain, you’d test all the players before the game. And you say, Those who are infected: Sorry, you’re sidelined. Those who are free: Get in there and play.” At this point, it doesn’t appear that testing would be available in the kind of quantities needed to test the entire league. Though, as we get closer to September, that may change. Fauci also spoke about his own personal contact with a White House staffer who is infected with the virus. “If I test today, and I’m negative, you don’t know if I got exposed tomorrow,” Fauci said. “There’s no guarantee that you’re going to get exposed and be positive the next day. To give you an example, you’re probably reading in the newspapers that there’s an infection in the White House. I was exposed to that person. So I immediately got tested. I am negative. So, I’m negative yesterday. I don’t know if I’m going to be negative Monday. Understand? It’s almost an impossible situation. “To be 100 percent sure, you’ve got to test every day. But that’s not practical and that’s never going to happen. But you can diminish dramatically by testing everybody Saturday night, Sunday morning, and say OK, only negative players play.” That dynamic, though necessary, will give head coaches a headache they haven’t had to contend with in the past. While players frequently are “game time” decisions in terms of their injuries, coaches normally have a good idea of whether the player can play and have time to plan if that player can’t play. Under the coronavirus testing regime, a player who is otherwise perfectly healthy and expected to play could be ruled ineligible the night before the game. The problem expands when you factor in that the player could be a quarterback, a star receiver, or some other impact player. However, if testing is the NFL’s ticket to getting on the field, and it is, the league will undoubtedly choose to punch that ticket regardless of how it inconveniences coaches.

White House trade advisor Peter Navarro on Monday’s “Fox & Friends” sounded off on Democrats and the media saying the United States is heading towards another “Great Depression” because of the coronavirus pandemic’s effects on businesses and jobs not deemed “essential.” Navarro pushed back against the economic “pity party” and the notion of a Great Depression, arguing anybody using that term to describe the state of the economy does not understand history or economics. “This is not the Great Depression,” Navarro advised. “Anybody who thinks this is the Great Depression doesn’t understand either history or economics. The Great Depression was a 10-year process — it came out of the end of World War I. It went through inflation and then a deflation cycle. It was accompanied by catastrophic applications of currency, trade, fiscal and monetary policy, and it lasted a very, very long time.” He continued, “Here’s what we have here: We have President Donald J. Trump built up the strongest and most beautiful economy in three and a half years, and the Chinese Communist Party dropped a virus on the world that in 60 days has temporarily shut us down. All we need to do here is focus on the mission … to bring manufacturing onshore, to have the American people make things here, and we will move forward in a way where we will rebound.” Navarro said recovery will be a “long process,” adding now is not the time for a “Great Depression pity party.” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent

As the nation grapples with the coronavirus pandemic and with the 2020 general election in clear view, some Democrats have downplayed China’s role in the outbreak, and according to Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) that will come back to bite Democrats. Monday on Hugh Hewitt’s nationally syndicated radio show, Cheney predicted China would play a role in the November elections, primarily given that Democrats have focused on blaming President Donald Trump for the outbreak. “I think because of the pandemic, I think that the role of China is clearly going to play,” she said. “I think it’s going to play a bigger role in the election. People will, I think, look really negatively at Vice President Biden and of the Democrats the extent to which they’d rather, frankly, blame President Trump, blame the administration than look at what really happened here. You know, the people to blame for what we are all living through in this devastation is the Chinese Communist Party. And I think they will need to be held accountable.” Hewitt asked the Wyoming Republican if she thought the term “appeasers” was too strong. “No, I don’t think so,” Cheney replied. “I think that you know, just look at what’s happened in Congress. We’ve tried for months to get the Democrats to agree to a bipartisan task force focused on the whole array of steps we need to take with respect to China. They agreed, and then you know, sort of moments before the announcement last February, they backed off. Now, Leader McCarthy has named a number of us to this task force, and we welcome the Democrats to join us. We hope and we wish they would. It would be much better for the country to have a bipartisan focus and effort on this. But we’re going to go ahead and make sure that we’ve laid out what needs to be done with respect to China. And frankly, it’s pretty hard to understand why the Democrats won’t participate in that.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor

The German newspaper Der Spiegel published a report this weekend stating German intelligence officials believed Chinese dictator Xi Jinping personally asked the head of the World Health Organization (W.H.O.), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, to delay key warnings about the Chinese coronavirus. Xi allegedly urged Tedros not to declare the outbreak a pandemic yet at the time of the phone conversation, which the German newspaper said had occurred on January 21. He also reportedly encouraged Tedros not to share information showing that the virus could spread from person to person. The conversation allegedly occurred a week before Tedros personally visited Beijing – despite mounting concerns that international travel may hinder the fight against the outbreak that at the time was largely contained in China – and discussed the newly identified virus with Xi. Tedros declared the Chinese coronavirus crisis a pandemic on March 11, the day after Xi Jinping visited Wuhan, the origin city of the virus, and declared that China had beaten its local outbreak. Xi avoided Wuhan until then despite reports indicating cases of a contagious respiratory disease spreading in the central Chinese city as early as November 2019. The W.H.O. denied the conversation in the Der Spiegel report in a series of tweets. The German newspaper published a report Friday in which it claimed that Germany’s Federal Intelligence Service (BND) was hesitating to support claimed by American Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that “enormous evidence” existed linking the pandemic to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a biological laboratory that had been studying highly contagious coronaviruses of animal origin at the time the outbreak began. The story also claimed, “according to the BND, China pushed the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) to delay a global warning after the virus has broken out at the highest level. On January 21, China’s leader Xi Jinping asked W.H.O. chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to hold back information about a human-to-human transmission and to delay a pandemic warning.” Der Spiegel added, “the BND estimates that China’s information policy has lost four to six weeks to fight the virus worldwide.” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping before a meeting at the Great Hall of the People, on January 28, 2020 in Beijing, China. (Photo by Naohiko Hatta – Pool/Getty Images) The BND’s alleged concern that China’s behavior had significantly hindered the fight against what would become a pandemic echoes similar statements from other intelligence agencies leaked to the press. Among the most prominent is an alleged intelligence dossier leaked to Australia’s Saturday Telegraph, which identified its origin as the “Five Eyes” intelligence group linking agents from the United States, Britain, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. The dossier, as reproduced to the Australian newspaper, found evidence of a massive, national Chinese Communist Party campaign to keep information about the virus, including information that could have helped contain its spread, from the general public. Among the actions Beijing took against its people were the censorship of key search terms such as “Wuhan unknown pneumonia;” destruction of early samples of the virus, which scientists could have used to trace its evolution, and a marked insistence to groups like the W.H.O. that the virus could not spread from person to person. Scientists have now confirmed the virus is highly contagious, resulting in the mass quarantining of asymptomatic people, even in cases of no recorded exposure to the virus. “Despite evidence of human-human transmission from early December, PRC [People’s Republic of China] authorities deny it until January 20th,” the Saturday Telegraph quoted the report as reading. “The World Health Organization does the same. Yet officials in Taiwan raised concerns as early as December 31st, as did experts in Hong Kong on January 4th.” Taiwan’s government confirmed in March that it had attempted to contact the W.H.O. about the pneumonia cases, noting that its experts had begun isolating patients, a sign that evidence existed for human-to-human transmission. “Taiwan did report our concern on the severity of coronavirus last December to the W.H.O.,” Taiwan’s representative office in America told Breitbart News at the time. “But as a rule, our reporting is always a one-way street. WHO mostly ignored our messages and never shared information as they do to other countries.” The Chinese Communist Party prevents Taiwan, a sovereign state that has never in its history been ruled by Beijing, from officially participating in the W.H.O. China illegally claims Taiwan as a province. In January, a month after Taiwanese officials stated they had warned of a contagious disease spreading from China, the W.H.O. claimed that “no clear evidence” existed that the Chinese coronavirus was contagious.

One of the arrested, Dr. Li Wenliang, later died in mysterious circumstances; the government claimed he had contracted the Wuhan coronavirus and died despite being 34 years old and healthy prior to infection, not a member of the most at-risk groups. The W.H.O. has consistently praised the Chinese government for its handling of the virus and discouraged mistrust of the communist regime. The W.H.O. explicitly warned against travel restrictions for those coming from Wuhan or elsewhere in China, despite the fact that these restrictions could have identified coronavirus patients early and kept them from spreading the disease elsewhere on the planet. Tedros’ visit to Beijing was, in part, a vote of confidence in favor of travel ties to China. “The W.H.O. noted that some countries are planning to evacuate their citizens from China, saying there is no need to overact and the W.H.O. is fully confident that the Chinese government can bring the spread of the disease under control,” Chinese state media reported while Tedros was in Beijing on January 28. The W.H.O. has failed to address China’s travel bans on most foreigners, currently in place because the Communist Party claims only “imported” cases of the disease pose a risk. The Party’s statements have resulted in a wave of racist attacks on black people in Guangzhou, a southern city with a high population of African immigrants. Tedros, who is from Ethiopia and claimed Taiwan was instigating racist attacks against him without evidence, has provided no substantive comment on the matter. The W.H.O., on its Twitter account, called the Spiegel report false this weekend and claimed that Xi and Tedros had never spoken on the phone. “Such inaccurate reports distract & detract from W.H.O.’s and [the world’s] efforts to end [the Chinese coronavirus pandemic],” the agency asserted.

American businesses can reopen safely using “strategic testing, tracing, and smart business innovations,” writes Alfredo Ortiz, the president of the Jobs Creators Network, and Gov. Jeff Colyer, MD, a practicing physician who served as the governor of Kansas. In an op-ed for Fox Business, Ortiz and Colyer write: To prevent the coronavirus-induced economic recession from turning into a depression, society must intelligently reopen now. Doing so safely and protecting the most vulnerable will allow Americans to return to work and provide for their families. With personal consumption making up 70 percent of the economy, reopening will also protect the American dream.   We will not go back to January 2020 B.C. (Before COVID). Instead, we must chart a new course in a COVID world where Americans can still thrive and prosper. If we use strategic testing, tracing, and smart business innovations, we can isolate the few to protect the many instead of isolating the many to protect the few. In fact, many commercial labs, which are often small businesses, could dramatically increase daily tests by the tens of thousands. For years businesses have used them for drug tests and other tests to protect their employees. For example, a small manufacturer can test and survey some of their employees regularly and solve a problem before it affects the whole community. Read the rest here.

The President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said that EU law has “primacy over national law” following a ruling from a German court that the European Central Bank’s bailout scheme was unconstitutional. President of the European Commission said that “The final word on EU law is always spoken in Luxembourg. Nowhere else”, referring to the location of the European Court of Justice (ECJ). “The recent ruling of the German Constitutional Court put under the spotlight two issues of the European Union: the euro system and the European legal system,” she said in a statement. “The European Commission upholds three basic principles: that the Union’s monetary policy is a matter of exclusive competence; that EU law has primacy over national law and that rulings of the European Court of Justice are binding on all national courts,” von der Leyen added. The EU president also warned that the commission is considering filing “infringement proceedings” against Germany at the ECJ for violating EU law, which could result in large fines being levied against her home country. Earlier this month, Germany’s Constitutional Court found that the bloc’s bond-buying program, the Public Sector Purchase Program (PSPP), was unconstitutional as it set monetary policy without being properly scrutinised by German lawmakers. The court said that Germany’s central bank, the Bundesbank — the main financial backer of the project — would be forced to leave the €2.6 trillion scheme after a period of three months if popper justification was not provided to by the ECB. EU Commission Boss Issues Another Coronavirus Apology as Bloc Cracks https://t.co/zYFHUHmsif — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 19, 2020  Andrew Kenningham of Capital Economics said that the legal challenge will likely not bring the scheme to an end, “but it highlights that a successful legal challenge to its policies in the future could contribute to increased tensions in the bond markets and to a renewed risk of euro-zone break-up.” “What was different with Germany was that it always made clear the [constitutional] court was prepared to step in and do something about it. This is the first case where a German court says the European court has no jurisdiction,” noted Panos Koutrakos, Professor of European law at London’s City University. The ruling by the German court could also create a legal framework for challenges against the bloc’s €750 billion scheme to ease economic strains brought on by the Chinese coronavirus, as well as other legal challenges from member states. Tensions within the bloc have been building during the pandemic, with tensions building over the commission’s response to the virus, with nearly 50 per cent of Italians saying that they would prefer to leave the EU over perceived lack of solidarity during the crisis. Commenting on Ursula von der Leyen’s attacks on the German court, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said that the president is “unknown and irrelevant”, adding that “the EU is crumbling.” European Union Will ‘Cease to Exist’ Over Coronavirus Response Failure, Warn Italian Politicians https://t.co/X8dlYmNH5u — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 2, 2020  Follow Kurt on Twitter at @KurtZindulka

Laredo Sector Border Patrol agents rescued an injured migrant woman after human smugglers abandoned her. Laredo Sector officials report a significant increase in the number of rescues this fiscal year despite an overall dramatic drop in illegal border crossings due to the Coronavirus. During the morning of May 8, Laredo Sector Border Patrol agents conducted a search operation to locate a migrant woman who became lost after being abandoned by human smugglers. The woman needed medical attention for dehydration and a leg injury, according to information obtained from Laredo Sector Border Patrol officials. The agents searched for the missing woman and located her about 20 minutes after initiating the operation, officials stated. The agents provided medical assistance for her dehydration and injured leg. Officials did not disclose the extent of her leg injury. Breitbart Texas has observed incidents during border-area visits where human smugglers will abandon any migrant who becomes injured, weak from heat exhaustion or dehydration, ill, or for any other reason cannot keep up. Each year, hundreds of migrants die in South Texas due to abandonment. The agents provided first aid to the woman and transported her to a local hospital, officials reported. The agents identified her as a Mexican national who had illegally crossed the border into the United States. Once medically cleared, the woman will likely be returned to Mexico under Coronavirus protection protocols. In an interview in April, Laredo Sector Chief Patrol Agent Felix Chavez told Breitbart Texas that the sector is unique in that migrants crossing the border here are not looking to be apprehended like most others. He explained the lack of physical infrastructure makes it challenging for agents to maintain operational control of the area and dangerous for migrants crossing the border illegally. “We are inches away from the heat of summer,” Chief Chavez explained. “Crossing the river here is very dangerous as the lake continues to release water creating deadly currents. The desert-like ranches in this sector are dangerous and present a great risk for injury or death to the migrants being smuggled around checkpoints. Then, add the dangers of COVID-19 on top of all of that.” “We have carried out more than 1,400 rescues during this fiscal year (which began October 1, 2019),” he explained. “Illegal border crossings are down, deaths are down, but rescues are up.” Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior news contributor for the Breitbart Texas-Border team.

Shelley Luther may still be jailed for violating a court order to close her hair salon, explained her Warren Norred, her lawyer, on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Sunday with host Joel Pollak. Luther was fined and jailed for contempt of court and violation of a temporary restraining order directing her to close Dallas-based hair salon, Salon Á la Mode. Judge Eric Moyé, a Democrat elected to the 14th District Court in 2008, offered Luther the opportunity to avoid jail time if she indicted herself as “selfish” and closed her business. Luther refused and said, “Feeding my kids is not selfish.” Pollak described Luther’s case as representative of “a new emerging front in the struggle against big government.” He recalled Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) getting a haircut at Luther’s salon. Hair salons & barbershops are open in TX today. Just got my hair cut for first time in 3 months at Salon ALa Mode to support Shelley Luther, who was wrongly imprisoned when she refused to apologize for trying to earn a living. Glad Shelley is out of jail & her business is open! pic.twitter.com/yJD8fWb84W — Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) May 8, 2020  Luther was jailed after rejecting Moyé’s offer, and subsequently released after two days following an order from the Supreme Court of Texas. Norred mocked the premise of “white privilege” while noting other salons in Dallas have not been persecuted by local authorities while remaining open in defiance of an ongoing “stay at home” order issued by Dallas County commissioners. “It’s very rich when I hear these people say, ‘white privilege,’ as though [Shelley Luther] was treated well,” Norred said. “There are salons in Dallas that never closed at all, and we’re forced to close, and I can tell you that that if anything [is] in somebody’s favor, it’s not in Shelley Luther’s favor.” LISTEN:  Norred explained that “under most normal circumstances,” a restraining order directing a person “to stop working and making an income” is paired with a bond “for the money that person would have made if they had been allowed to work” to compensate for monetary damages incurred by adherence to the order’s instructions. The city “never posted a bond,” he added. Norred continued, “The Supreme Court doesn’t say we’ve won, but they’ve simply said [we’ve] expressed an argument that may be valid, so the city of Dallas has until four o’clock tomorrow to respond to this, and and then the Supreme Court may take action or make some sort of decision.” “This is an ongoing lawsuit,” added Norred. “This is a lawsuit by the city of Dallas — a normal, everyday civil lawsuit — where the city of Dallas is saying, ‘You’re breaking an ordinance, and we have the opportunity to go and sue you in civil court — not criminal — for breaking our ordinance.’ We’re going to say that ordinance is no good. It’s not based on any real law. It’s based on imaginary emergency regulations that do not have the force of law, because they break the rules of federalism,and only the Texas state legislature gets to make laws.” Luther may still be jailed, added Norred. “[Shelley Luther] still has five days of jail, that if this doesn’t go right, she’ll still be faced with.” Norred noted prosecutorial discretion is not a feature of his client’s case, given her potential jail time is rooted in her rejection of a judge’s directives. “She would be going to jail not for the violation of the ordinance for staying open, but for defying the court in violating that ordinance.

(AFP) – New Zealand will phase out its coronavirus lockdown over the next 10 days after successfully containing the virus, although some restrictions will remain, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced Monday. Ardern said that from Thursday shopping malls, restaurants, cinemas and playgrounds will reopen — with the country moving to Level Two on its four-tier system. The 39-year-old leader warned “none of us can assume COVID is not with us” but said New Zealand currently had only 90 active cases after a seven-week lockdown. “Your efforts New Zealand have got us to this place ahead of most of the world and without the carnage that COVID has inflicted in many other places,” she said in a televised address. “But there are risks ahead, so please be vigilant.” New Zealand, with a population of five million has recorded 1,147 coronavirus cases, including 21 deaths. The number of new cases has been in single digits since mid-April, with three new infections recorded on Monday. Under Level Two restrictions, international borders remain closed but life domestically will return to something approaching normality. While social distancing must still be followed, the advice that people isolate themselves at home and “stick to your bubble” will no longer apply. “This is a transition out of our bubbles, you can see people you haven’t seen in a while, you just can’t do it all at once,” Ardern said. “At Level Two we are out and about again, just about all parts of the economy are opening up again.” The lockdown was first eased two weeks ago, allowing food takeaways and resumption of some recreational activities, but the freedoms granted by the latest relaxation will be far greater. Those aged over 70 will be allowed out again after more than seven weeks of mandatory quarantine. Domestic travel will be allowed, providing a boost to the crippled tourism industry and schools will fully reopen next Monday. Bars will not be back in business until May 21, giving them extra time to ensure they can keep patrons properly separated. Team sport will also return, with planning already underway to start a domestic version of Super Rugby on June 13 involving the competition’s five New Zealand-based teams. Ardern said the move to Level Two would be reassessed after two weeks, with further easing possible depending on developments.

The rate of infection for the Chinese coronavirus in Germany has begun to rise following Chancellor Angela Merkel’s decision to ease the lockdown measures that were introduced to stem the spread of the virus. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the federal agency tasked with managing the coronavirus pandemic, found that the reproduction rate of the illness — the approximate number of people an infected person passes the virus to — has spiked from .83 on Friday to 1.13 on Sunday. The increase in the so-called ‘R number’ above 1 means that the rate of infection is increasing in the country rather than declining. The RKI did caution that there is some degree of lag in numbers, therefore it is unclear whether the easing of the lockdown restrictions contributed to the spike in the infection rate, Deutsche Welle reports. Last week, Chancellor Angela Merkel announced that the government would begin to allow certain businesses, religious services and schools to begin opening. When she made the announcement the rate of infection was at .65 per cent. “We have achieved the goal of slowing the spread of the virus…because our citizens have behaved responsibly and saved the lives of others,” Merkel said. The German Chancellor had previously warned that should the rate of infection reach 1.1 by October the country would “reach the capacity level of our health system, with the assumed level of intensive care beds.” Coronavirus: Govts Fear Second Wave After Outbreaks in Germany, Mingling in Italy https://t.co/LEByWN8yvZ — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 10, 2020  A senior German Social Democrat MP and a professor of epidemiology, Karl Lauterbach, told The Times that he is expecting a second wave of the coronavirus after witnessing people take to the streets following the easing of the restrictions. “It can be expected that the R rate will go above one again and we will return to exponential growth,” he said. “At least that corresponds to everything I saw in Cologne. The easing has been poorly prepared,” Lauterbach lamented. Despite the easing of restrictions, thousands of protestors took to the streets across the nation, accusing the government and medical officials of inciting panic and infringing upon their liberties by imposing the lockdown. Some 3,000 people gathered in Munich and thousands more rallied in Stuttgart. Similar protests popped up in Berlin and other cities as well. Police arrested at least 130 people during the protests in Berlin, after the gatherings turned into violent clashes with officers, with protestors hurling bottles and the police.

Monday, MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” discussed President Donald Trump’s behavior and handling of the coronavirus pandemic as a chyron highlighted the president’s social media behavior: “TRUMP SPENDS MOTHER’S DAY TWEETING AND RETWEETING 100 TIMES.” Co-host Mika Brzezinski asked host Joe Scarborough what Republicans could do to “make a difference” in the fight against the pandemic and “perhaps” save more lives, to which Scarborough suggested that if Trump were to leave office, “America would be far better off.” “So, Joe … I ask you, what could the Republicans do at this point? Who are the Republicans who could make a difference? And what is it that they could do? Why are they so afraid?” questioned Brzezinski. “Of course, the backdrop of this is if we all agree, that if something was said to this president, if they were able to close in on him, perhaps more lives could be saved.” “Well, you know, people always talk about when Arizona conservative icon Barry Goldwater went to the White House and actually told Richard Nixon that it was time to leave,” replied Scarborough. “That’s not what we’re even asking here, though I believe America would be far better off.” “[S]enior citizens would be far safer. We could face this crisis far better if Donald Trump did leave office,” he reiterated. “That’s not going to happen, but, you know, we’re not talking about 50 Republicans here. We’re not talking about 30 Republicans. Five Republicans going over there, saying, ‘Mr. President, we’re not asking you to leave, we’re just asking you to do your job. We have people suffering in our districts, we have people suffering in our states, we have to get people back to work, but your own doctors have been telling you for months now that can’t happen without a robust testing regimen where we can test and trace, Mr. President, and you keep refusing to do that. You’re the only person in this government that can have a national approach to testing, to tracing, to treating, to doing the sort of things that we need to do to reopen our economies, to save our businesses in our states.'” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent

Campus police officers around the nation have remained on duty despite university closures. Officers at Kansas State University spoke this week about life on campus during the Chinese virus pandemic. According to a report by the Kansas State student newspaper, campus police officers have been keeping the campus safe during the ongoing Chinese virus pandemic. While some officers have been able to conduct investigations and complete paperwork from their homes, many officers have remained on campus. Lt. Bradli Millington of the Kansas State Police Department said that the department has adopted various precautions to keep the officers safe. For example, officers spend time sanitizing their vehicles to prevent the spread of the virus during shift changes. “We got [personal protective equipment] for everybody,” Millington said in a comment. “They don’t like to wear it when they’re just out and about, but if they’re going to a possible unknown COVID-19 case, we have it all for them to put on in there if they come in contact. They [also have] the option to wear masks.” To make work more pleasant during the pandemic, officers have starting holding their briefing sessions outside, a change that has allowed them to maintain social distancing guidelines. “They go outside for their briefing and information exchanges in the crossover shifts,” Millington explained. “They are social distancing the officers themselves in the debriefing room. [We’ve] separated computers out so that they’re six to 10 foot apart and everything like that. But there are certain things that we do have to the guidelines as part of the jobs, to minimize that as much as possible.” Breitbart News reported last week that the University of Wisconsin, Madison, has accepted $10 million in federal coronavirus relief. The decision sparked controversy due to the university’s $3 billion endowment fund. Many wealthy universities, including Harvard, Yale, Princeton, rejected federal coronavirus relief in April. Stay tuned to Breitbart News for more campus updates.

University of California System President Janet Napolitano recently announced that the 10 campuses that comprise the UC system will not “fully reopen” for the fall semester. UC San Diego announced last week that it will utilize rapid testing kits to mitigate the spread of the Chinese virus on campus. According to a report by The College Fix, the University of California system will not “fully reopen” for the fall semester. UC System President Janet Napolitano announced during a webinar last week that California’s largest public system lost $300 million in revenue during the month of April due to the Chinese virus pandemic. “I think it’s fair to say none of our campuses will fully reopen,” Napolitano said during the webinar. “I think what some of our campuses are exploring is a mix, where there will be some material delivered in a classroom or lab setting, so-called wet labs, and other classes will continue to be online.” Napolitano suggested that international enrollment will likely decline at the University of California for the foreseeable future. She accused the Trump administration of enacting policies that make it more difficult for international students to attend the University of California. “I don’t know for sure, but we predict the number of international students will be reduced,” Napolitano added. “That’s partially attributable to the (Trump) administration making securing visas more difficult. That’s created a virtual wall. It’s unfortunate and bad policy, but that’s what we have.” Several universities have announced plans to reopen their campuses for the fall semester. In April, Brown University President Christina Paxson argued that campuses can safely reopen in the fall if administrators take certain precautions. Breitbart News reported last week that UC San Diego will utilize rapid testing kits to mitigate the spread of the Chinese virus on campus. The university claims that they will offer “isolation housing” to students that test positive for the virus. Stay tuned to Breitbart News for more updates on this story.

The UK government has announced the first “modest” changes to the lockdown regime to take place this week, where members of the public will no longer be harassed by police for being stationary in public places, but still may not meet with people from outside their own households. Promising the government was balancing the importance of saving lives with not destroying livelihoods, those in industries where home working is not necessarily viable — for instance in construction and manufacturing — are being encouraged to return to work from Wednesday this week. Doing a round of media interviews Monday morning after the Prime Minister’s announcement Sunday night, first secretary of state Dominic Raab said the government would be providing more clarity on how to return to work without breaking social distancing rules in the coming hours so people had “some clarity” for Wednesday. Saying the new “modest” changes to lockdown would allow people to regain “some semblance” of pre-coronavirus normality in their lives, Mr Raab said it would now be possible to go outside with your own household to play sports or enjoy the sunshine. This stands in contrast to the previous phase of the government’s police-enforced lockdown, where officers have been deployed to move people on from parks and beaches, even when they are in no proximity to other human beings. In the most remarkable examples of the previous policy, cyclists in remote areas have been chased by police drones and footage shaming them shown online, and officers with megaphones driving through city parks have ordered people to go home. Now, it will be possible to leave the house for “unlimited” exercise and leisure, as long as it is not near other people. Mr Raab said told UK radio station LBC Monday: “Let me give you a concrete example. If someone wants to go out with a member of their household for a game of tennis, that’s something you can do while staying two meters apart [from the rest of the population]. What you couldn’t then do is go and mill around the clubhouse with lots of people where you’d all be close together.” In line with this, he urged the public to avoid public transport if at all possible. He continued: “If at all possible we want people to go by other means — cycling, walking, or taking the car — but if not and if it’s essential then by public transport… but we can’t go back to a situation where the tube and the busses will be as full as they were before.” As Breitbart London reported Sunday, how many people precisely the change to lockdown will actually impact is unclear. Many already work from home after the first two months of lockdown, and with schools still closed for months more at least, parents will not necessarily be free to return to work.

George Soros, progressive billionaire and mega Democrat donor, claimed in a Monday interview President Donald Trump would be a “dictator” if it weren’t for the U.S. Constitution and is self-destructing during the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. “Donald Trump would like to be a dictator,” Soros told the Independent. “But he cannot be one because there is a constitution in the United States that people still respect. And it will prevent him from doing certain things. That does not mean that he will not try, because he is literally fighting for his life.” “I will also say that I have put my faith in Trump to destroy himself, and he has exceeded my wildest expectations,” he added. In another part of the interview, the Hungarian-born Soros warned the coronavirus pandemic, which originated in Wuhan, China, threatened humanity as a whole. “This is the crisis of my lifetime,” Soros told the British newspaper. “Even before the pandemic hit, I realized that we were in a revolutionary moment where what would be impossible or even inconceivable in normal times had become not only possible, but probably absolutely necessary.” “And then came Covid-19, which has totally disrupted people’s lives and required very different behavior. It is an unprecedented event that probably has never occurred in this combination. And it really endangers the survival of our civilization,” he added. The left wing multi-billionaire’s remarks come after his Open Society Foundations pledged to donate $130 million to fight the pandemic and “[push] back against government encroachment on political freedoms,” in mid-April. Soros said the funds will be used for a wide range of causes, including support for low-income workers in the United States, countering “disinformation” in Europe, and emergency health care services in parts of Africa. Earlier in April, the hedge fund manager donated $1.1 million to help Budapest prepare for the deadly outbreak. “The COVID-19 pandemic knows no boundaries, not between countries, communities, religions or people. Anyone can become infected, but some of us are more vulnerable than others,” he told Forbes of the donation. “I was born in Budapest, in the middle of the Great Depression, barely a decade after the Spanish Flu left thousands of dead in Budapest. I lived through World War II, the Arrow Cross rule and the siege in the city. I remember what it is like to live in extreme circumstances.” Soro’s comments also come as a coalition of progressive groups, several of them funded by Soros, has sponsored a “People’s Bailout” community organizing outfit pushing Congress to use the next coronavirus stimulus package to enact a host of progressive policies. Breitbart News’ Aaron Klein reported: In the spirit of the repurposed progressive anthem of never letting a crisis go to waste, the suddenly created People’s Bailout group is demanding that the next stimulus package adhere to “five principles” the group says are endorsed by “nearly 1,000 organizations, unions, and community leaders, and nearly 100 members of Congress.” Those “principals” encompass such far-left wish list items as government healthcare for illegal immigrants, required $15 per hour minimum wage, enhanced union collective bargaining and government regulation of the board of directors of private companies to ensure “worker representation.” Also within the “five principles” list are “direct sizable cash payments to every person” and the use of stimulus legislation to push what would amount to a massive “green” new deal. Soros spent $28.3 million on the 2020 presidential election in the first quarter of the race. Politico reported: Soros’ $10 million will go to Win Justice, which mobilizes people of color and other infrequent voters who could be disenfranchised in the coming months as states battle over whether to hold in-person voting in November, an increasingly pressing concern among Democrats. He gave the money at a moment when many in the Democratic political world have warned that PACs and campaigns may run out of money as the economy — and with it, donors’ pocketbooks — seize up. […] Soros gave millions of dollars in January and February to the main super PACs planning to help presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and Democratic Senate candidates, including $5 million to pro-Biden Priorities USA and $7 million to Senate Majority PAC, which is aligned with Senate Democratic leadership. He also donated major sums to groups building political power among women, including a $1 million donation to EMILY’s List, and $2 million to Supermajority, a PAC co-founded by former Planned Parenthood leader Cecile Richards and Black Lives Matter activist Alicia Garza. Despite dolling out millions on the 2020 election, Soros has yet to publically express support for the Democrat Party’s presumptive nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden. In October, the billionaire investor praised failed White House candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), calling her “the most qualified to be president.”

Europe’s best-selling newspaper announced this weekend the lockdown in response to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic was a “huge mistake,” citing a number of public intellectuals critical of the country’s official response. Reproducing comments from seven well-known intellectuals, Bild underscores the importance of “warning, doubting, and arguing” in the case of a public crisis that involves the suppression of the fundamental rights of citizens. In presenting the opinions of highly esteemed “lateral thinkers,” the newspaper notes Germany’s political leaders, on the contrary, “pushed the recommendations of other luminaries to justify the lockdown of the economy and public life, as well as the severe interference with everyone’s freedoms,” while ignoring contrary voices. Prof. Klaus Püschel, for instance, a respected pathologist and head of the Institute of Forensic Medicine at Hamburg University Hospital, argues that “in the end, COVID-19 is a viral disease like the flu, which in most cases is harmless and is only fatal in exceptional cases. “It is important to look at the aftermath of the epidemic to see if COVID-19 really was the cause of death,” Püschel observes. “Of the approximately 180 deceased with coronavirus that we have now examined, all suffered from severe pre-existing conditions and were not children or adolescents. The COVID-19 infection was the straw that broke the camel’s back.” University of Hanover Professor Stefan Homburg, a former adviser to the federal government, agrees official figures in Germany in no way justified the lockdown. “In Italy, the coronavirus epidemic was worse than a flu epidemic, in Germany it was less severe,” Homburg said. “With the lockdown, the federal and state governments have made a huge mistake.” “The damage is increasing every day, all bans must be lifted immediately,” he continued. “Empty soccer stadiums and half-empty restaurants are of no use to anyone.” For his part, Professor Hans-Jürgen Papier, former president of the Federal Constitutional Court, said the debate was too short and state interventions went too far. “The balance was between the protection of life and health on the one hand and the protection of constitutional goods on the other,” he said. In principle, “there should have been a broader and more detailed parliamentary and public debate. To this end, the legal goods to be weighed up were too important and the consequences and interventions too great.” Julian Nida-Rümelin, Germany’s former Minister of Culture, said statistics without contextualization create fear and panic but do not promote a rational debate. “With COVID-19, new, huge numbers appear every day, which make us frightened and perplexed,” he said. “These figures must be understood by asking: how many people die every day in Germany in total? How many have heart attacks? How many from cancer? How many from COVID-19? Little is being done to this effect.” For “legendary” journalist Patricia Riekel, warnings and an appeal to personal responsibility would have been preferable to the lockdown. “I would not have thought the measures necessary,” Ms. Riekel states. “I am in favor of the Swedish way, with recommendations that distance be kept and that people who are at risk stay at home.” “What we have seen in the last six weeks has been excessive,” Riekel adds: “We have become a people of compliers and snitches.” Follow @tdwilliamsrome

A bipartisan U.S. Congress group has slammed China for threatening punitive economic sanctions against Australia. The support follows Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s refusal to drop his call for an independent investigation into the origins of the global Chinese coronavirus pandemic. In a letter to Australia’s U.S. Ambassador Arthur Sinodinos released by the Sydney Morning Herald, the 27 senators and House of Representatives members said China had made “deeply disturbing” threats against long-term U.S. ally Australia for seeking an inquiry into the origins of the viral outbreak first identified in the southern Chinese city of Wuhan. The politicians said in part: This incident is part of a broader and concerning pattern from the Chinese government. As we continue to confront this deadly disease and its consequences, we will be faced with many tough decisions, including those that may arise from the Chinese government’s continued lack of cooperation and transparency. No matter the external pressure or coercion, we will always have Australia’s back, just as Australia has always had ours. Republican Senator Marco Rubio, Republican House member Liz Cheney and the co-chairs of the Friends of Australia caucus, Democrat Joe Courtney and Republican Mike Gallagher are just some of those included in the group supporting long-term ally Australia and its refusal to be bullied into silence by Beijing. They went public with their backing after China’s ambassador to Australia, Cheng Jingye, warned the Australian government’s call for China to explain its bungled handling of the deadly coronavirus pandemic could spark a boycott by Chinese consumers, as Breitbart News reported. The ambassador said Australia’s inquiry push was “dangerous” and destined to fail, adding to previous criticism from Beijing, which portrayed Canberra as unblinking lackeys of the U.S. in the Pacific. “I think in the long term… if the mood is going from bad to worse, people would think ‘Why should we go to such a country that is not so friendly to China? The tourists may have second thoughts’,” he said. “The parents of the students would also think whether this place which they found is not so friendly, even hostile, whether this is the best place to send our kids.” Australia’s call for China to come clean over its handling of all facets of the coronavirus pandemic followed the United States’ pause of funding for W.H.O. at the request of U.S. President Donald Trump, who said the organisation was promoting Chinese “disinformation” about the virus. Trump warned China then that actions have consquences: In the face of increasing Chinese pressure, the U.S. Congress group said they “could not agree more” with Morrison and Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne’s calls to keep looking for answers to the Chinese pandemic. “For more than a century, our nations have stood side by side during moments of great peril. The current crisis is no different. Although the challenges we face are new, what has not changed is our shared commitment to our values and to our friends.” According to the Herald, Sinodinos said by way of response: “We welcome the strong affirmation from the U.S. Congress of the alliance between our two countries and support for an independent objective examination of the pandemic to provide lessons for the future.” Morrison has said Australia’s conservative coalition government will push for an independent investigation at the next annual meeting of the World Health Assembly on May 17. Morrison is also calling for Taiwan to join the U.N. health subsidiary, an issue that has drawn a similarly furious response from Beijing towards Australia. Australia’s decision to join the U.S. and ban Huawei from any participation in a national 5G network remains a “sore point or thorny issue” between the two countries, the Chinese ambassador alleged in February, adding “discrimination against a Chinese company” lies at the core of the dispute.

Nearly everything Democrats have done at the national level has made the job losses from coronavirus worse. You would not know that from the mainstream media, which have under-reported Democrats’ malfeasance and have failed to report President Donald Trump’s successes, which are gaining attention abroad. Indeed, the media are often complicit in helping Democrats block good ideas, and introduce destructive ones. Here are 5 examples: 1. Delay. Democrats have delayed every single coronavirus relief bill. In March, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi stopped a bipartisan CARES Act from going forward, then introduced her own version of the legislation with pork for left-wing interests and purely partisan provisions like voting by mail. In April, Pelosi delayed the extension of the Payment Protection Program (PPP) by 16 days. The media let her get away with it, both times. 2. Using state unemployment systems rather than direct payments. When the administration proposed sending money directly to Americans, Democrats insisted on using the state unemployment systems. The CARES Act ultimately included both kinds of payments. But as Trump later observed, some states struggled to handle the unemployment caseload, resulting in delays in payments many who had just lost their jobs. 3. Making unemployment more lucrative than work. Democrats tacked on $600 per week in additional unemployment benefits under the CARES Act. A few Republicans protested: that would make layoffs more attractive, and hiring more difficult, for employers. They were attacked in the media. But that they were right. “Workers on unemployment benefits are reluctant to give them up,” the Wall Street Journal reported last week. 4. Shaming public companies who apply for PPP funds. Nearly 40% of the money under the second tranche of the PPP has been unclaimed because Democrats and the media protested against public companies being able to apply. (Joe Biden built on that criticism Friday, accusing Trump of helping “big corporations.”) But those companies employ a lot of people. (Or, at least, they used to do so.) Under pressure, Treasury changed the rules. 5. Proposing more relief until the crisis “ends.” Democrats are now proposing that higher unemployment benefits continue until the unemployment rate falls to a certain level, or giving families monthly checks of $2,000 or more until the pandemic is over. In addition to expanding the national debt, doing so will maintain unemployment at a higher level (see #3 above), and will discourage the entrepreneurship that creates jobs. Joel B.

Burgess Owens, a former Oakland Raiders Super Bowl champion safety and Utah’s fourth congressional district Republican candidate, told Breitbart News Saturday that Republicans need to take back Utah’s fourth district to help the GOP “take back our country.” Burgess Owens hopes to unseat Rep. Ben McAdams (R-UT), a freshman swing district Democrat. McAdams, like many other Democrats, chose to stick with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and investigate President Donald Trump rather than investigate China’s role in the coronavirus pandemic. Breitbart News Saturday host Matthew Boyle noted that McAdams could choose to investigate China rather than stick with Pelosi at any moment. Owens told Breitbart News Saturday McAdams would not buck Pelosi because “that’s the way Democrats’ roll. Not a lot of courage on the left. They have a narrative, and if anything, they want power.”  “In the case of Ben McAdams, he is a nice guy, but he stands right there with Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters, [Adam] Schiff, and the other socialist-Marxists that are trying to take down our country,” he added. Owens noted that conservatives and Republicans “are truly fighting for the hearts of the nation.” “I’m the person best positioned to beat Ben McAdams because I will call them what they are: they are bullies and cowards and socialist-Marxists, and I will let them know that we will not stand for it anymore,” Owens said. Owens said that Utah’s fourth congressional district is one of the many vital districts that Republicans need to win to regain the House majority. President Donald Trump won Utah’s fourth congressional district by more than six percentage points during the 2016 presidential election, but House Democrats managed to flip the district in 2018. Republicans need to retake 18 congressional districts in 2020 to regain the House majority. Owens said that “Democrats must have” Utah’s fourth district “to keep their power. We must have it to take back our country.” Breitbart News Saturday airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 10:00 A.M. to 1:00 P.M. Eastern. Sean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News.

 A couple in Omaha, Nebraska, are not letting the coronavirus pandemic get in the way of their future plans. Recently, Methodist Hospital employees Ashley Jensen and her boyfriend, Jason Heimes, sat down for a lunch break that turned into something really special, according to the Omaha World-Herald. “Heimes, a registered nurse, works on the sixth floor of the hospital’s North Tower in the Progressive Care Unit, which deals with patients with COVID-19. Jensen, a certified nursing assistant, works in the Short Stay Unit on the fifth floor of the South Tower,” the article read. Both were in the middle of a 12-hour overnight shift and dealing with the stress, anxiety, and fatigue that has weighed heavily on many healthcare workers during the coronavirus pandemic. However, Heimes wanted to make this lunch break different from all the others and asked his coworkers for help. Before the break, he told them to enter the room loudly and surprise Jensen. While his girlfriend of three years turned around to see what all the commotion was about, Heimes got down on one knee. He then pulled out an engagement ring and asked her to marry him. To everyone’s delight, Jensen quickly said yes. “I loved that he involved his colleagues to witness and take part,” coworker Lucy Miranda-Gonzalez said of the moment she later described as “beautiful, fun, uplifting, and heartfelt.” “It’s wonderful, and it just shows that we are family,” she explained. Heimes’ proposal brought some much-needed positivity to the hospital staff who have been working hard to care for their patients during the health crisis, according to Miranda-Gonzalez. “We are grateful that this can still happen among the chaos,” she stated. Sunday on Twitter, the hospital congratulated the couple on their recent engagement: A sweet Methodist Hospital engagement to lift you up! Congratulations to Ashley and Jason from the entire Methodist family. Sending you our love and gratitude for all you do to care for and protect our community. https://t.co/COZT3cjnAE — Methodist Health System (@MeaningOfCare) May 10, 2020  Following the proposal, Jensen said despite the uncertain times, she and her fiancé would move forward with their wedding plans. “If we can get through this together and share those anxieties together through the pandemic, we can get through anything,” she concluded.

A nurse in Haslet, Texas, got a big surprise Wednesday after returning home from caring for coronavirus patients in New York City. When Wilson Middle School nurse Kristy Edney saw the reports about how hard the coronavirus pandemic hit the Big Apple, she wanted to help, according to KENS 5. Her school had already closed, so she began thinking about how she could use her skills to help those on the east coast. “I made a phone call and 48 hours, later I was on a plane,” said Edney, who is a former ER and labor and delivery nurse. She spent the next month separated from her husband and four kids while she cared for those sick with the virus at a hospital in Queens. “I was leaving being at home to go fight the unknown. It was crazy. It was something you’d seen on the news and knew it was bad, but it was something you could not have prepared yourself to walk into,” the nurse explained. However, when residents of the Sendera Ranch neighborhood heard about her sacrifice, they were inspired to say thank you in a big way. Neighbor Chelsea Angles and her husband, Chris, run a Facebook page that organizes birthday parades for the community and after someone told them Edney was on her way home last week, they got to work. Wednesday, Edney was enjoying her front yard when a line of cars decorated with signs and balloons began driving by her house. A Haslet fire truck and other emergency vehicles also joined the procession and even turned on their sirens to welcome the nurse home. “You could tell at first she’s waving like, oh, cool it’s a parade, awesome,” Chelsea recalled. “And then all of a sudden I think when she started to see the signs she realized—oh my god, this is for me!” About 80 vehicles participated in the event. “I cried tears of joy because it was very overwhelming to see the support. I still just see it as I’m a nurse and I went to help,” she concluded.

Airborne Toxic Event lead singer Mikel Jollett said if President Trump senior advisor Stephen Miller gets infected with the deadly Chinese coronavirus, it will be “a sign” that God is “coming for these fuckers.” “I’m not a deeply religious person and I don’t wish physical suffering on any human being,” began Mikel Jollett, who immediately went on to contradict himself in his next statement. “But if Stephen Miller gets covid-19 after putting literally thousands of brown children in cages, I’m going to consider it a sign from God that he’s coming for these fuckers yet.” I’m not a deeply religious person and I don’t wish physical suffering on any human being but if Stephen Miller gets covid-19 after putting literally thousands of brown children in cages, I’m going to consider it a sign from God that he’s coming for these fuckers yet. — Mikel Jollett (@Mikel_Jollett) May 10, 2020  Jollett’s rant came after Vice President Mike Pence’s press secretary, Katie Miller, tested positive for the Chinese coronavirus — and Katie Miller is the wife of Stephen Miller. Jollett has previously compared President Donald Trump’s efforts to stop illegal immigration to Adolf Hitler’s Holocaust across Europe. “The Holocaust did not end with people being called subhuman, constantly compared to criminals, put into yellow markers with children torn from the the arms of screaming mothers,” said Jollett. “But it did start there,” he added, along with the hashtag, #WhereAreTheChildren. The Holocaust did not end with people being called subhuman, constantly compared to criminals, put into yellow markers with children torn from the the arms of screaming mothers.. But it did start there.#WhereAreTheChildren — Mikel Jollett (@Mikel_Jollett) May 26, 2018  In 2018, after senator Susan Collins (R-ME) announced that she would be voting to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court of the United States, Jollett reacted by referring to her remarks as “unforgivable.” “This is why survivors don’t come forward. This speech right here,” said the Airborne Toxic Event frontman of Collins’ sentiments. This is why survivors don't come forward. This speech right here. This horrible moment when this horrible woman gives every presumption of innocence to the attacker and the harshest prosecutorial view of the victim, as she is the one with the incentive to lie. Unforgivable. — Mikel Jollett (@Mikel_Jollett) October 5, 2018  “This horrible moment when this horrible woman gives every presumption of innocence to the attacker and the harshest prosecutorial view of the victim, as she is the one with the incentive to lie,” added Jollett of his dismay over Collins’ prioritization of Rule of Law and presumption of innocence — the bedrock and foundation of American principles.

Sunday on MSNBC’s “AM Joy,” host Joy Reid said President Donald Trump is attempting to move on from the coronavirus pandemic and reopen the economy  because it is “disproportionately killing people who are black and brown, which is not his base.” Former CBS News anchor Dan Rather said, “Joy, I think it’s important to point out that this has developed as it became increasingly clear that those who are suffering the most from the coronavirus are people above a certain age and people below a certain level on the economic scale. And once the president became convinced, ‘Okay, it’s those people at the bottom end of the economic scale and some people above, say, age 70 or 80,’ then he took this strategy, this tactic saying, I’m just going to talk about positive things and let the devil take the high note with the deaths. That’s the way of normalizing the deaths.” Reid said, “Yeah, it’s very —it’s hard to ignore the fact, absolutely as you said, as it has emerged also that it’s disproportionately killing people who are black and brown, which is not his base. You know, so he has sort of moved in a direction that can keep his base thinking, ‘Well those people are the ones at risk, it doesn’t matter to me.’ That is very difficult to miss as well.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

We come not to praise the loogie, but to bury it. Already banned on sidewalks, outlawed indoors and pooh-poohed by polite society, that gob of saliva and Lord-knows-what-else is done mucking up sports. In the wake of the new coronavirus, teams are revoking the germ-landing privileges that turned dugouts, benches, boxing rings and even grass fields into potential biohazard sites. No sharing towels, hats, bats, gloves or water bottles. Which could mean the golden era of spitting, slobbering, gleaking, glanding, hawking, hocking, venoming and expectorating is about to dry up. Or not. “About time they did something,” said Bobby Valentine, who played and managed in the major leagues for more than 40 years, including two stints in the Japanese Pacific League.
“I was over there for seven years and I could probably count on one hand how many times I saw a ballplayer spit. Heck,” he added, “they don’t even chew gum.” But a moment later, Valentine remembers a photo tucked in a drawer somewhere in his Stamford, Connecticut, home. It reminds him why the loogie will not disappear without a fight. “It’s a picture of me after a game from 30 years ago, back when I was managing the Rangers and behind me there’s this elongated view of the dugout. There must have been 200 of those green Gatorade cups and all this other … let’s just say gunk, laying around. “And I used to wonder even then,” Valentine mused, “why guys couldn’t clean up after themselves.” The answer may be as old — and as American — as the sport itself. Baseball began as a working-man’s game on sandlots and dusty diamonds, and more than a few players struggling with “cotton mouth” turned to chewing tobacco (and later gum and sunflower seeds) to work up some moisture. It became an institution in no time flat.
Pitchers figured out that loading a glob onto one side of the ball made it dip like crazy. Fielders pounded spit into the pocket of stiff leather gloves to soften them up and hitters rubbed it on their hands or lacquered up bat handles to improve their grips, at least temporarily. But it had psychological value, too.
Spitting helped some soothe jangling nerves, show contempt or machismo, or just mark their territory like dogs do. It was only a problem when an opponent got in the way of its gravity. It isn’t just baseball, of course. Rough-and-tumble sports like soccer and football embraced the practice at the beginnings of their games, too, and once grabbing a swig of water on the sidelines during a break became available, it practically elevated it into an art form. But don’t expect any new masterpieces to flow soon.
With Germany’s Bundesliga considering a return to play within week s, Michel D’Hooghe, the chairman of FIFA’s medical committee, is strongly advising against any soccer league restarting until the fall. But if they do, he wants even the most casual dribble on the pitch punished with a yellow card.
“It is unhygienic … I think we should have to avoid that at maximum,” D’Hooghe said. “The question is whether that will be possible.” More genteel pursuits like tennis and golf have proved that it is, although both Tiger Woods and Sergio Garcia handed over hefty fines for leaving something besides sweat out on the course. Basketball and hockey are stuck indoors, but only one of them said no to spitting. Puckheads defend hockey’s choice by arguing players who get a tooth knocked out during a game shouldn’t have to swallow a chiclet. Fair enough. But if you’ve ever watched a game and seen how much blood, sweat and tears they voluntarily share on the bench, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that the National Hockey League has been hit twice in recent years by outbreaks of mumps. But that’s about to change. The coronavirus has pulled the rug out from underneath just about everything in sports, and better sanitation shouldn’t require a seismic cultural shift. Just rise at some ungodly hour and catch a Korean Baseball Organization game on ESPN. The KBO is at the vanguard in the return of live sports. It checks players’ temperatures twice daily, requires umpires and trainers to wear masks and gloves, and banned spitting, handshakes, fist-bumps, high-fives and perhaps most noticeably, a live audience. That’s been replaced by banners picturing fans — also wearing masks — stretched across every row. In a spectacularly complicated nod to social distancing, the opening pitch was rolled to home plate by a youngster wearing a uniform inside a clear balloon made up to look like a baseball. Dan Straily, an American-born pitcher with the Lotte Giants of the KBO, said the game lacked so much energy, it reminded him of “weekday games in Oakland.” Still, he had only one real complaint.
“I want someone to find me a game in history where baseball players did not spit on the field,” Straily told NPR. Get used to it.

Boris Johnson has announced some minor changes to the British lockdown, but people arriving abroad are still not being quarantined and a deal with Emmanuel Macron to avoid quarantining arrivals from France, despite illegal boat migrants arriving from the country in record numbers. The British premier, who was himself put in intensive care by the Chinese coronavirus for a brief period, announced that Britons would now be able to take an unlimited amount of daily exercise outdoors, sunbathe, and play sports — but only with members of their own household, socially distanced, and with social distancing rules still enforced and punished with even harsher fines for the “small minority” who refuse to follow them. Johnson also announced that workers who cannot work from home may now go into work, avoiding public transport where possible, if social distance can be maintained. How many workers this will actually effect is therefore unclear, particularly as shops and some schools will not be able to open until “step two” of his plan — “at the earliest by June the 1st” — and the hospitality industry will not be able to open again, in part, until “step three” a month later, at best, and again only if they can “enforce social distancing”. An important update to the nation on coronavirus: https://t.co/tRvIjJLrCu — Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson) May 10, 2020  On flight bans and quarantine requirements for incomers, which the British government has been almost unique in refusing to implement, even against virus hotspots such as Italy, Iran, China, and Wuhan itself, the Prime Minister continued merely to hint at a two-week self-isolation requirement for air travellers “soon” — June is reported — but with a special carve-out for France. The deal to exempt arrivals from France, at least for a time, was announced jointly with that country’s president, Emmanuel Macron — and may raise eyebrows, considering illegal boat migrants are currently flooding into Britain from infectious camps on the French coast in record numbers. Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, who has been critical of the Conservative Party government’s handling of the pandemic — particularly with respect to foreign travel and illegal immigration — was decidedly unimpressed by the announcement, tweeting: “I think the big change from this much vaunted Presidential-style address is that I can sunbathe. Was that really it?” “Never in the field of human statesmanship was so much said to such little effect,” he added later.

Major League Soccer has re-opened outdoor training camps for the 2020 season but is requiring medical screenings for players as they arrive. The soccer authority noted that it had created a new safety regime, including temperature checks, masks, and other measures after they consulted with medical professionals. The changes went into effect on Wednesday, May 6, TMZ Sports reported. MLS posted a video showing members of the Orlando City and Sporting Kansas City players observing the new protocols, including getting their temperatures monitored and using medical masks and hand sanitizer. League officials also told teams to make sure players are not pressured to return and to let them know they can stay sequestered in their homes if they feel it is too early to leave lockdown. MLS pointed out that having players work out in a controlled atmosphere is better than leaving them on their own hook and using parks of other facilities. Locker rooms, gyms, and showers are still not yet open, and the league has not, however, authorized full team activities for the 26-team league. Other aspects of pro soccer are still on hold. On Tuesday, for instance, DC United GM Dave Kasper noted that they are doing all the behind-the-scenes work in preparation for the player transfer market to re-open, but have made no official announcements on the topic. Finally, MLS is looking for a potential June return to play. The league had recently announced that it will be shuttered until June 8, but after that, they are hoping to re-start the season with the full 34-game season to be played.

American Airlines and Hyatt Hotels Corporation announced in a joint statement Friday that they would be giving thousands of free vacations to New York City health care workers on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic. The companies said in the statement that more than 4,000 workers employed at the NYC Health + Hospitals/Elmhurst medical center would be treated to roundtrip vacations to destinations throughout the U.S. and the Caribbean once they can “take time for themselves.” Hyatt Hotels plans to provide accommodations once they arrive at no cost. The companies said doctors, nurses, physician assistants, facility workers, and food service teams would be among those who qualify for the trips. “We are extremely grateful to Hyatt and American Airlines for this generous gift to our health care workers, who have been at the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic,” Israel Rocha, vice president of NYC Health + Hospitals and CEO of NYC Health + Hospitals/Elmhurst, said. “Our doctors, nurses, and other staff on the front lines of this unprecedented health care crisis really appreciate the outpouring of support,” he continued. The New York City metropolitan area has emerged as one of the epicenters of the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. As of Sunday, the New York City Health Department reported more than 177,000 cases and 14,505 confirmed deaths reported by New York state. New York state as a whole has reported more than 21,000 deaths and more than 333,000 confirmed cases.

California nail salons are planning to sue Democrat Gov. Gavin Newsom after he said they were to blame for the first case of the coronavirus in the state. It all started when the California governor was asked why nail salons were part of phase 3 of reopening instead of phase 2, KGO reported. “This whole thing started in the state of California, the first community spread, in a nail salon,” Newsom said Thursday. His remarks drew a backlash from the beauty industry in California and the Vietnamese-American community, who own most of the salons in the state. The tension mounts even more as California is moving into its next phase of reopening, and while more businesses were allowed to reopen for curbside pickup and delivery in this next phase, nail salons were nowhere near reopening. This brought in an association of barber shops and salons, which said it would try to sue to attempt to force the California Democrat to let them reopen sooner. “I have dealt at a very close proximity with cashiers, with Walmart associates, with Costco and Sam’s Club associates, with a Home Depot guy who helped me cut some wood. None of them had gloves; only some of them had masks,” Fred Jones, public policy director and legal counsel for the Professional Beauty Federation of California, told KCRA. “There’s not going to be a salon in California, when we reopen, that doesn’t have both. We are trained in this,” he said. Some salons have already opened despite Newsom’s order. In Northern California, a line went out the door of a Yuba City salon on Wednesday. Some of the customers wore masks while others did not. Newsom said at least 33 salons operating illegally have been shut down across the state. California entered its first phase of stage two of reopening on Friday, which allows curbside pickup at retail stores and the reopening of parks for hiking and trails.

(AP) — BERLIN — The World Health Organization has dismissed as “false allegations” a media report that it withheld information about the new coronavirus following pressure from China. The U.N. agency said in a statement late Saturday that a German magazine’s report about a telephone conversation between WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Jan. 21 was “unfounded and untrue.” Weekly Der Spiegel reported that Xi asked Tedros during the call to hold back information about human-to-human transmission of the virus and delay declaring a pandemic. The magazine quoted Germany’s foreign intelligence agency, BND, which declined to comment Sunday. Der Spiegel also claimed that the BND concluded up to six weeks of time to fight the outbreak had been lost due to China’s information policy. The U.N. agency said Tedros and Xi “have never spoken by phone” and added that “such inaccurate reports distract and detract from WHO’s and the world’s efforts to end the COVID-19 pandemic.” It said that China confirmed human-to-human transmission of the new coronavirus on Jan. 20. WHO officials issued a statement two days later saying there was evidence of human-to-human transmission in Wuhan, but more investigation was necessary. The global body declared COVID-19 a pandemic on Feb. 11. U.S. President Donald Trump has been among the strongest critics of WHO’s handling of the pandemic, accusing it of deference to China and ceasing payments to the agency.

Sunday on CNN’s “Reliable Sources,” host Brian Stelter accused President Donald Trump and the “right-wing media” of being obsessed with the news the Justice Department dropped the case against former national security adviser Michael Flynn while the coronavirus pandemic death toll continues to go up. Stelter said, “Think about this, between 1,000 and 2,000 deaths a day. It’s as if ten planes crash every day, and we just expect it to happen tomorrow. It’s as if New Orleans floods every day, and we just assume it will happen again tomorrow. That brings us to the president and the leadership we’re seeing or lack of leadership from the federal government. There’s attempts now to downplay what is happening or normalize what’s happening. We saw this week the president talking about shuttering the Coronavirus Task Force, then saying he won’t do that. We’re not seeing daily briefings by the task force. We’re not getting the national data we need from the government. We’re seeing some allegations of the administration retaliating against whistle-blowers who are speaking out trying to call attention to some of these failures. It’s a frightening time.” Stelter said, “The death toll is not something that just is downplayed, it’s not something we can hide from, even if it’s gut-wrenching to hear about every day. It’s like New Orleans floods every day. It’s like the planes go into the towers every day. And to look away or act like it’s now normal or acceptable is a disgrace to the victims.” He continued, “It’s so disappointing to look at what we’re seeing from right-wing media these days. There’s such an obsession with the ‘deep state’ and these revelations about the Russia probe and the decision about Michael Flynn. They’re treating the Michael Flynn story like it’s a bigger deal than the deaths of 2,000 Americans a day.” He added, “When the president called in to Fox and Friends Friday morning before the unemployment rate numbers came out, he talked about the Flynn case for 20 minutes before he was asked about the pandemic. In what right mind is any scandal, any political scandal, any Department of Justice story more important to ask the president about than the pandemic that’s raging? Look, ultimately, it’s about news judgment, it’s about lack of judgment, but I find it befuddling that this death toll is normal, common, just another day now. Imagine if 1,000 to 2,000 Americans were dying a day from terror attacks? Imagine the president’s response?” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Sunday on MSNBC’s “AM Joy,” former CBS “Evening News” anchor Dan Rather accused President Donald Trump of attempting to “normalize thousands of deaths” from the coronavirus pandemic “for his own political purpose.” Host Joy Ried said, “So, you know, Jay Rosen this week wrote a piece that gives this alternate, it gives it an alternate way of describing another man Norman Vincent Peale-esque you know Trump’s philosophy of handling a pandemic. Not how to handle a pandemic but talk himself through it. It’s called, ‘The plan is to have no plan, to wing it without a plan is merely the best this government can do given who heads the table. The manufacturer of confusion is just the ruins of Trump’s personality meeting the powers of the presidency. There is no genius there, only a damaged human being playing havoc with our lives.’ The overall point of what he wrote is the plan really is to talk Americans into thinking that it’s okay. That it’s okay that 80,000 people or 100,000 people are dead, that the 33 million unemployed is all fine and just get people to believe that with happy talk rather than actually solve the problem. What do you make of that?” Rather said, “Well, that’s exactly what it is. It’s a full-power effort using the pomp and circumstance of the presidency to accentuate the positive and try to eliminate the negative or at least to diminish the negative. This is right out of the Dr. Norman Vincent Peale playbook, for those who remember Dr. Norman Vincent Peale. Donald Trump and his father were followers of Dr. Norman Vincent Peale. It’s the belief is if he keeps saying positive things, people will at least begin to believe that things are positive, whether they are or not. The deepest of that is to actually believe that by saying things or how you imagine them to be, that you can make them to be.” He added, “I’m not saying I subscribe to any of this. I’m saying this is sort of in short what Dr. Norman Vincent Peale preached. Donald Trump is a believer. It’s pretty hard to argue right now but argue, I would say, every decent person regardless of their political affiliation has to do because we can not, we must not normalize thousands of deaths, which is what the president is attempting to do for his own political purpose. He’s accentuating the politics, diminishing the science for his own political benefit. At the same time preaching, I’m saying everything is all right, folks. Don’t worry about all these deaths.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Sunday, during an appearance on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures,” Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) highlighted how cell phone data suggests the Chinese government had closed the roads around the Wuhan Institute of Virology in mid-October. This is significant, as Cotton points out, that some believe the Wuhan facility is the origin of the COVID-19 virus. “Reports emerged yesterday in the media that publicly available cell phone data suggests that roads around the lab in Wuhan was closed in the middle of October,” he said. “Again, this information is publicly available. American media has used it to analyze mobility patterns in states to see if our people are practicing social distancing. So the reports indicate that on major roads around these labs, Wuhan, you obviously had thousands and thousands of cell phones pinging towers day in and day out. And then, all of a sudden, it stopped. And it remained stopped for several days. That would suggest, without any further information, that those roads were blocked for some reason.” “Now, we need to go confirm that,” Cotton continued. “We need to look at the data carefully. We also need to try to use other means to verify if there were, in fact, shutdowns of roads around those labs in the middle of October. The Chinese Communist Party could obviously help us with that if they would open up and allow us to investigate what happened in Wuhan. But if it is confirmed that roads around that lab were shut down for a number of days in mid-October, it is highly coincidental that there was a major shutdown of those roads at about the time one might have expected this virus to first get transmitted to humans, whatever the origins may have been. But this would be another piece of circumstantial evidence that there was some kind of accident or outbreak from those labs, not from the seafood market or anywhere else. That’s why it’s so important we get to the bottom of this data.” As Cotton explains, Wuhan is larger than New York City, and closing roads as the government had would require a significant reason. “Remember, Wuhan is a city that is larger than New York City. So, obviously, its roads are highly trafficked and heavily congested. So to shut down roads around the lab would suggest that they had some good reason to disrupt traffic patterns so severely. So, again, first, we need to verify these reports, the cell phone data say what these media reports indicate, and then we need to use other sources to try to confirm what they suggest, which is, those roads were shut down. And if that’s the case, if roads were shut down around these laboratories for several days in mid-October, then we need to figure out exactly why, because it’s simply another piece of circumstantial evidence that would support the idea that this virus originated from one of those labs.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor

Georgia reported the lowest number of hospitalized coronavirus patients seen in more than a month on Saturday, according to Gov. Brian Kemp. “Today marks the lowest number of COVID-19 positive patients currently hospitalized statewide (1,203) since hospitals began reporting this data on April 8th,” the governor tweeted: Today marks the lowest number of COVID-19 positive patients currently hospitalized statewide (1,203) since hospitals began reporting this data on April 8th.  Today also marks the lowest total of ventilators in use (897 with 1,945 available). We will win this fight together! pic.twitter.com/byxACEiQCp — Governor Brian P. Kemp (@GovKemp) May 9, 2020  In a press release Thursday, Kemp said the state was seeing “record highs” in coronavirus testing. He stated: Thanks to Georgia’s partnership with Augusta University, our university system, the private sector, and local public health officials, we’ve doubled our daily testing capacity and now have over 217,000 total tests reported to the state’s website. A few weeks ago, Georgia ranked 43rd out of 54 states and territories in testing per capita. Today, we are 29th according to the COVID-19 Mapping Project. Out of twenty-three states with more than five million people, we are now 12th in per capita testing. The governor also reported record lows in ventilator use thanks to the shelter-in-place order that helped slow the spread of the virus and strengthened Georgia’s healthcare infrastructure. “Because of your patience and your compliance, we reduced the amount of stress on our hospitals and their employees,” Kemp explained, adding that it was equally important to protect the state’s economic wellbeing. “As I have said many times before: We must protect both the lives and livelihoods of all Georgians. There are many people today who literally cannot afford to put food on the table. We must fight for both the public – and economic – health of our state,” he concluded. April 30, Kemp lifted the shelter-in-place order for most residents, but said it would remain in place for the elderly and “medically fragile” until June 12, according to Breitbart News. Although most businesses were allowed to reopen, establishments including bars and nightclubs would remain closed until May 14, the report noted. “The health and well-being of Georgians are my top priorities, and my decisions are based on data and advice from health officials. I will do what is necessary to protect the lives – and livelihoods – of our people,” the governor concluded.

Leaders of universities and colleges in Rhode Island argued this week that the Chinese virus pandemic affirms the importance of the campus experience. Many leaders said that they are eager to reopen their campuses for students and faculty for the upcoming fall semester. According to a report by the Providence Journal, university and college leaders in Rhode Island believe that the pandemic has affirmed the value of an on-campus college experience. Universities and colleges around the country rapidly adopted distance learning tools in March to prevent the spread of the Chinese virus. Kelli Armstrong, the president of Salve Regina University, said that the adoption of distance learning tools has proved that it is “impossible” to provide certain aspects of the campus experience over the Internet. “In a way that has been heartening, this experience has been kind of a blessing. It’s been an affirmation of why it’s important to live in community,” Armstrong. “You get to know faculty. You’re doing research. You are growing as a leader and developing your values. It’s impossible to do that online.” Although many analysts have predicted that higher education will take place online in the future, some college officials disagree. Joseph Greene, vice chancellor of finance and administration at Johnson & Wales University, claims that the recent transition to online learning has convinced him that students benefit from the socialization that can only occur on campus. “We really thought that with the growth of online learning, the future would move away from bricks and mortar. With the young generation being so connected, we thought it would be an easy transition, but they are all missing the socialization that comes from being on a college campus,” Greene said. Breitbart News reported in April that Brown University is planning to reopen its campus for the fall semester. In a column for the New York Times, Brown University President Christina Paxson said that the university will utilize rapid testing kits to mitigate the spread of the virus on campus. Stay tuned to Breitbart News for more campus updates.

Widespread public fear, not government orders, drove economic shutdowns in America during the 1918 flu pandemic, said John Barry, author of The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History, offering his remarks on Wednesday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with host Rebecca Mansour and special guest host John Hayward. “I’m probably more concerned about what I regard as premature reopening,” Barry stated. “I think maybe the most important thing is to have in place the ability to identify people who are sick and trace their contacts. If we don’t do that, then there’s very possibly going to be an explosion.” Dr. Irwin Redlener, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, similarly called for the development of fast, reliable, and affordable coronavirus testing technology at businesses in order to safely reopen the economy while providing peace of mind to the pubic. Barry added, “If we do it right, then I would anticipate seeing not so much another wave — this virus isn’t going away, I think everybody knows that — but sort of undulating swells. Some might be a little bigger than others, but we can keep pace with them [and] get ahead of them, maybe. Barry warned, “If we don’t do it right, then you’re going to see a hurricane storm surge, and since I’m speaking to you from New Orleans, that has a lot of meaning to me when I say that. In terms of where the public stands, according to the polling that I’ve seen, the public actually is pretty nervous about the real things.” LISTEN:  “There’s a vocal minority that wants to get going again now, but there’s a lot of concern that it’s too early,” added Barry. “But the reality is, leaders don’t make life and death decisions, they shouldn’t make really any decisions — much less a life and death decision — based on polling data.” Barry remarked, “The real problem is that all the pain and suffering that [small businesses] have gone through, if we don’t do the reopening correct, that will waste everything they’ve already sacrificed, because we’ll be back where we started, except it’ll be worse than where we started. That’s my real concern. It’s not that I don’t have enormous sympathy for those people. I’m fortunate enough not to be much affected, but they will be in a worse position in the long term.” “There was a study of cities in 1918,” Barry stated. “Cities that stayed closed longer their economic activity was actually much better after the pandemic than the cities that stayed closes for a shorter period of time.” Barry continued, “San Antonio was one of the slowest cities in the United States to close anything, and it was just about the earliest city in the United States to reopen. It also had the highest morbidity in the United States [where] 53.5 percent of the entire population got sick and 98 percent of every household had at least one person sick. Barry noted that varying factors aside from San Antonio’s distinction of being the city with the highest morbidity rate in the country could have been shaped by factors other than its later closure and earlier reopening relative to other cities. Mansour asked about the differences between governmental directives in 1918 and today. “They were nowhere near as extreme as what we’ve done,” Barry responded. “It was places of public gathering after work. So bars, restaurants, in most cases no church services, theaters, things like that. There were basically no closing orders of ordinary business operations. Of course, we were in a war, and practically everything was considered an essential service and part of the war effort.” Barry continued, “Nonetheless, and there is not a lot of data on this except for some very limited war industries like shipbuilding. There was tremendous absenteeism, enough that it certainly affected the economic importance. Streets were empty. In the book, I quoted a Philadelphia doctor who lived 12 miles from the emergency hospital he worked in, and when he went home every day, he saw so few cars on the road, he started counting them. In one day and [over] 12 miles — in the third biggest city in the country — he didn’t see one other car on the road in either direction. He said, ‘The life of the city has almost stopped.'” Barry added, “Now, that was not because of closing orders. That was because of fear, which was quite effective. It’s just like the photographs you’ve seen of Beijing earlier [where] this vast thoroughfare is totally vacant, or here in New Orleans, I walked through Jackson Square, there’s nobody there. There’s one musician playing where there used to be dozens, and there’s nobody on the street. Barry concluded, “Today, it’s not so much fear, it’s closing. But in 1918, it was fear.” Breitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on “Fox News Sunday,” America could suffer “permanent economic damage,” if we do not reopen the economy amid the coronavirus pandemic. When asked about the danger of reopening the economy too soon, Mnuchin said, “If we do this carefully working with the governors, I don’t think there’s a considerable risk. As a matter of fact, I think there’s a considerable risk of not reopening. You’re talking about what would be permanent economic damage to the American public.” He added, “We are going to reopen in a very thoughtful way that gets people back to work safely, that has them social distance. One of the things we’ve seen, Chris, is a lot of businesses can do telework. Not ever, but he has to come back into the office at the same time, but people will be able to go into stores. Some of them will have reservations when they go in, but businesses will be able to reopen. I think, as you know, certain parts of the country had very devastating impacts, like New York and certain parts of the country didn’t. And this is all being monitored very, very carefully.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis Neel Kashkari said the “worst is yet to come” on unemployment driven by the coronavirus pandemic. Stephanopoulos asked, “We see the market pricing in that relatively rapid sustained recovery you just heard Larry Kudlow saying he expects a very strong second half of 2020 and a roaring 2021, is that realistic?” Kashkari said, “I wish it were. This is more likely to be a slow, more gradual recovery. Unfortunately, the virus continues to spread. People continue to get it. Unfortunately, people are tragically dying. When we look around the world, there’s evidence when countries relax their economic controls, the virus tends to flare back up again. The more this goes on, the gradual the recovery will be. If we see companies going through bankruptcy, empty strip malls for a while until new businesses form, the economic recovery takes longer. I loved to see a robust economy, that would require a breakthrough in a vaccine, widespread testing, a breakthrough in therapies to give all of us confidence that it’s safe to go back. I don’t know when we’ll have that confidence. Ultimately the American people will decide how long the shutdown is.” He added, “The worst is yet to come on the job front, unfortunately. It’s really going to be, as these states start to reopen, and as thee these businesses start to reopen, obviously we need to reopen safely, and we need to monitor and look for signs of things flaring back up. We may have to clamp back down again as the virus continues to spread. To solve the economy, we must solve the virus. Let’s never lose sight of that fact.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Governor Mike DeWine (R-OH) warned the economy would not open unless people had “confidence” that they would be safe amid the coronavirus pandemic. On this week’s broadcast of “Fox News Sunday,” host Chris Wallace asked, “By the end of this week, you will have reopened 90% of Ohio’s economy. Why do you think you can do that safely, sir?” DeWine said, “Well, it’s really a risk no matter what we do. It’s a risk if we don’t do anything. It’s a risk if we do this. What we have done is come up with the best practices for businesses to reopen. We put businesspeople together with help people and have them come up with these best practices.” He added, “The economy is not going to open no matter what we do, whatever we order, unless people have confidence and we are trying to give them confidence, but at the same time we’re telling them the virus is still out there, it’s still very, very dangerous. We have to keep the distancing. People should wear masks, wash their hands. I mean, these are basic things that we have to do. We can’t let up.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

LONDON (AP) – The British government has replaced its “stay at home” coronavirus slogan with a new “stay alert” message, a move that has met with widespread criticism ahead of a speech Sunday in which Prime Minister Boris Johnson will lay out the stages for lifting the country’s lockdown. Britain’s lockdown, which began March 23, has clearly reduced the transmission of the virus but the country’s daily death toll remains uncomfortably high, and as a result most restrictions are expected to remain. After a week of mixed messages that started with Johnson indicating there will be changes to the lockdown beginning Monday, the government has sought to douse speculation that they will amount to much. That’s because the U.K., which has recorded the most coronavirus-related deaths in Europe at 31,662, is still seeing a relatively high number of infections. Johnson is expected to announce modest changes in his pre-recorded televised address, including quarantining anyone flying into the country for 14 days except those from Ireland, amid rising evidence that Britons are increasingly flouting the “stay at home” message. British police warned Saturday that they are “fighting a losing battle” on this front. Boris Govt Won’t Require Quarantines for Airport Arrivals Until June https://t.co/jcV69QlstU — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 10, 2020  Ahead of his speech, Johnson fleshed out the meaning of the new “stay alert” slogan as telling the public to “stay at home as much as possible,” to keep two meters (over 6 feet) apart when going out and to limit contacts with other people. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said a broader message was needed as the government tries to restart the economy. “We should be staying home as much as possible but when we do go to work and go about our business we need to remain vigilant, we need to stay alert,” he told Sky News. The leaders of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, Nicola Sturgeon, Mark Drakeford and Arlene Foster, said they would retain the “stay at home” message. Up until now, the four nations of the U.K. have moved in lockstep on virus regulations. Jonathan Ashworth, health spokesman for the opposition Labour Party, said there is “no room for nuance on this,” adding that Johnson will have to provide “absolute clarity” in his address. Professor Til Wykes of the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King’s College London said people need “clear, concise and accurate” messages on what to do during the pandemic. “This one is concise only,” she said. “It will just be confusing, be open to misinterpretation and likely to increase risky behaviour.” Jenrick also said Johnson will detail a new virus alert system and that the country was currently at four on a scale that goes up to five. “Our aspiration is to bring that down as swiftly as we can to three,” he said. “And at each stage, at each of those milestones, we will be in a position to open up and restart more aspects of the economy and of our lives.” Coronavirus: International Flights Continue to Bring 100,000 Unchecked Travellers a Week to Britain https://t.co/k1QQsDfzHy — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 17, 2020  Other modest changes to the lockdown are expected, including allowing people to exercise more than once a day and garden centres to reopen. New advice on face coverings and increased fines for those breaching lockdown rules are also anticipated. The worry is that a more dramatic easing of the lockdown will lead to a second spike in infections and deaths – something that health experts predict will occur as nations ease lockdowns. Johnson’s Conservative government has also faced wide criticism for being too slow to react to the pandemic and for not supplying medical workers with enough protective gear. Johnson, more than other world leaders, has seen the virus up close. He returned to work only two weeks ago following a hospitalization for Covid-19 that nearly cost the 55-year-old his life. Karen Dee, the chief executive of the Airport Operators Association, said she has not received any details about any proposed quarantine plan but warned that it would have a “devastating impact” on the U.K.’s aviation industry as well as the wider economy.

Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said it was possible the unemployment rate could go as high as 20% in May. Anchor Jake Tapper asked, “How high do you think unemployment is going to get this year?” Hassett said, “You know, I think just looking at the flow of initial claims, that it looks like we’re probably going to get close to 20% in the next report, depending on whether the virus has really abated by that point and economies are getting going again, then it could start to head down from there. But I would guess sort of middle of the summer is when we’ll start to go into the transition phase. Then I expect that by the second half of the year, the CBO forecast is what we hope will be right, which will be that you’ll have very strong growth in the third and fourth quarters.” He added, “We basically stopped the greatest economy on earth to save lives, and I think that we’re very glad we’ve saved lots of lives, we’re very glad we’ve done that, now we’re gradually turning the economy back on. If you go from a stopped economy to an economy that’s turning back on, it kind of necessarily needs to be trajecting up. It’s not a mystery why the Congressional Budget Office expects the second half of the year to be stronger.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN) said he is disappointed the Trump administration is advancing a lawsuit to get rid of the Affordable Care Act amid the coronavirus pandemic. Anchor Chuck Todd asked, “Are you disappointed that the president decided to go ahead with the Obamacare lawsuit? There was a window where he could have pulled the Justice Department could have pulled out of it. They didn’t. He wanted to continue forward. If you undo Obamacare, what’s the plan to replace it?” Alexander said, “Well, the answer to your question is yes. I thought the Justice Department’s argument was really flimsy. What they’re arguing is when we vote to get rid of the individual mandate, we voted to get rid of Obamacare. I don’t know one single senator who thought that.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Tres trabajadoras de la salud en el estado fronterizo de Coahuila se convirtieron en las últimas víctimas de violencia en la región después de que dos hombres las golpearan hasta matarlas en su hogar. El asesinato sucede en un momento en que México ha visto un aumento de agresiones contra los trabajadores de la salud por temor ante la pandemia del coronavirus. El asesinato sucedió en la ciudad de Torreón, en una casa en el fraccionamiento Compresora, donde vivían las tres víctimas que son hermanas. Según información de la Fiscalia General de Coahuila, dos de las víctimas trabajaban como enfermeras y la tercera como secretaria en una clínica administrada por el gobierno del Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS). El gobernador @mrikelme confirmó que la Secretaría de #SeguridadPública y la @FGECoahuila #detuvieron a los presuntos #responsables del triple #homicidio de las #trabajadoras de la salud del @Tu_IMSS, que sucedió el día de ayer por la noche.#FuerteCoahuilaEs pic.twitter.com/Pr0iQh5LvT — Gobierno de Coahuila (@GobDeCoahuila) May 9, 2020  Las tres víctimas han sido identificadas como Cecilia Pérez, de 48 años, Araceli Pérez, de 59 años, y Dora Pérez, de 56 años. La información forense reveló que las mujeres habían sido atadas, estranguladas y golpeadas. La causa de muerte se cree que fue traumas contundentes a la cabeza. Inicialmente, las autoridades y los funcionarios del gobierno analizaron la posibilidad de que el caso pudiera haber sido otro ataque contra trabajadores de la salud en México, sin embargo, esa teoría ha sido refutada por el motivo de robo. Las autoridades han encontrado varios elementos que faltan en la casa, así como un vehículo de la víctima. Breitbart Texas informó que México ha visto una tendencia en acoso y ataques contra los trabajadores de la salud por parte de personas que temen que puedan transmitir el coronavirus. Según el FiscalGeneral de Coahuila, Gerardo Márquez Guevara, en menos de un día tras el asesinato pudieron arrestar a dos sospechosos. Uno de los sospechosos identificado solo como Luis, es enfermero y había trabajado con una de las víctimas. El otro sospechoso, también llamado Luis, es trabajador en un mercado local y es amigo del primer sospechoso.

Three health care workers in the border state of Coahuila became the latest victims of violence in the region after two men beat them to death inside their home. The gruesome murder comes at a time when Mexico has seen a rise in aggressive actions against healthcare workers over fears of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The murder took place, at a home in the city of Torreon in the Compresora neighborhood where the three victims who are sisters lived. According to information from the Coahuila Attorney General’s Office, two of the victims worked as nurses and the third as a secretary at a government-run clinic with Mexico’s Social Security Institute (IMSS).

Forensic information revealed that the women had been tied up, strangled, and beaten. The cause of death of the victims is believed to be blunt force trauma to the head. Initially, authorities and government officials looked into the possibility that the case may have been yet another attack on health-care workers in Mexico. That theory has been replaced by the current motive of robbery. Authorities found numerous items missing in the house as well as the victim’s vehicle. As Breitbart Texas has reported, Mexico has seen a unique trend in harassment and attacks against healthcare workers at the hands of individuals fearing that they may spread the coronavirus. According to Coahuila’s Attorney General Gerardo Marquez Guevara, within a day of the murder, police arrested two male suspects. One of the suspects, identified only as Luis, is a nurse and had worked with one of the victims. The other suspect, also named Luis, is a day laborer at a local market and is a friend of the first suspect.

Chen Weihau works for the government-owned China Daily, reliably cranking out articles with headlines such as “White House must concentrate on fighting outbreak, not China-bashing” and “Washington must stop making decisions which undermine WHO.”  In other words, his journalistic output nicely coincides with the People’s Republic of China’s propaganda plans, from deflecting blame for the coronavirus away from Beijing to defending Beijing’s minions at the World Health Organization. Yet Chen’s Twitter feed is more raw and personal—it reads as if it’s not filtered through any sort of editor—and so it’s more revealing. For instance, on May 4, reacting to a report about U.S. intelligence on the origins of the Wuhan virus, he tweeted, “Trump and Pompeo are not even good liars.” The next day, May 5, he tweeted that Trump was speaking “nonsense,” adding in non-idiomatic English, “Why no one can stop him lying?”  Not only does Chen bash the president and his administration reliably, he also echoes, eagerly, top Democrats and leading Never Trumpers. Indeed, on May 5, he pulled off a trifecta: First, he retweeted Hillary Clinton, the twice-failed—but still hopeful!—presidential candidate, who had snapped, “We must replace this administration in November.” Second, he retweeted an MSNBC tweet quoting Sen. Chuck Schumer trashing Trump. Third, he retweeted the Washington Post’s virulently Never Trump columnist, Jennifer Rubin. You get the idea.   Chen mixes it up with other Republicans as well. For instance, he tweeted a response to Sen. Josh Hawley’s New York Times op-ed calling for the abolition of the World Trade Organization. The WTO, of course, has been the neoliberal vehicle by which China has gained access to the American market, enabling it to flood the U.S. with low-wage-subsidized exports, thereby hollowing out our industries.  The WTO, in other words, is China’s golden goose, and so Chen, loyalist that he is, must seek to smite anyone who threatens it. Says Chen of Hawley: “Sometimes you wonder why NYT would publish such an oped by an ignorant politician. Just because he is a Senator?” For his part, Hawley was quick to respond:  #China not happy about my call to confront their economic imperialism by ending the WTO & replacing it with system that’s good for American workers. I love being insulted by #China state-run press. Okay, so we get the picture: Chen happily works for the Chinese state, that odd combination of ruthless capitalist economics and even more ruthless communist politics.  Yet if we look at Chen’s terse Twitter-page bio, we see something interesting: He has been the beneficiary of many liberal programs in the U.S.  Evidently those programs have been failures, in terms of having any impact on him, at least in terms of making him a liberal in the classical sense—that is, being an open-minded defender of freedom.  For instance, Chen was a John S. Knight Journalism Fellow at Stanford, in a program that describes its mission thusly: We focus on helping these journalism leaders succeed as effective change agents, improving the access to information people need to create and sustain democratic communities. [emphasis added]  Yes, we might dwell on that last line, about building “democratic communities”—because Chen doesn’t so dwell. Chen also lists himself as a onetime World Press Institute Fellow at Macalester College in Minnesota, where he was supposed to have spent “four months immersed in journalism issues and the culture of the United States.” In addition, Chen spent time at the Freedom Forum in Washington, DC, which declares its mission to be “foster[ing] First Amendment freedoms for all.”  In other words, it seems that Chen passed through these and other do-gooder institutions—without the good rubbing off on him. Who knows? Maybe he was simply a spy.   Of course, it’s also possible that these supposedly free-speech outfits aren’t actually so liberal. That is, it’s possible that they have all gone the way of many other once-liberal institutions, transforming themselves into hard-leftists. We’re all familiar with that type: They’re “liberals” in terms of opposing conservatives, but not so liberal in terms of defending freedom of thought or of legal due process. To illustrate, we might ask ourselves: How many American liberals have defended free expression on college campuses? How many liberals defended the legal rights of Michael Flynn?   In other words, it’s an open question as to how much today’s liberals—perhaps we should call them what they usually prefer to call themselves, namely, progressives—really care about the Constitution and the speech- and due-process rights that it affords to all Americans? That non-liberal progressive attitude is fully reflected, of course, in today’s media. In other words, if we regard the Knight Fellowships, the World Press Institute, and the Freedom Forum as progressive, then maybe Chen fits right in.  Perhaps this is an unfair characterization of these three organizations. Perhaps they think of Chen as a disappointment, even a failure, one who didn’t understand, or didn’t agree with, their free-press message.   If so, there’s one surefire way for these entities to address any mischaracterization: They can denounce Chen for falling short of their high First Amendment standards.   Or maybe these media philanthropies will do nothing of the kind. Maybe they still think fondly of Chen—and maybe they agree with him, at least in his critique of America.   In any case, at least for now, Chen seems happy to advertise his journalistic credentials without worrying about the credentialing outfits asking him to return his honorific certificates. And if that silence continues to be the case, well, that says something about Knight, WPI, and Freedom Forum. Moreover, there’s nothing stopping any journalist from criticizing Chen, an obvious propagandist in their midst. But will they do so? And oh yes, there’s another item on Chen’s bio that’s worth noting. In all capital letters, he declares, “FREE ASSANGE.” Julian Assange, of course, is an intensely controversial figure in the West. Some say that the Australian-born Wikileaks founder is a pro-transparency crusader. Others say he’s a Russian stooge or spy. Still others say he’s a creepy sex offender.    All of these declarations about Assange—currently living in London, fighting an extradition order to send him to the U.S. to face espionage charges—could be true, or none of them could be true.  Hopefully, a free press, and an impartial judiciary, will sort out the truth about Assange.  Yet for the time being, there’s one thing we can be absolutely certain of: If Assange were Chinese, and had been publishing unflattering leaks about the Chinese Communist Party, he’d have long ago been in jail—or worse. And Chen Weihau would be cheering the government on, probably typing “IMPRISON ASSANGE.”  Of course, if Chen were back in China, he wouldn’t be able to type those words on Twitter—because China bans Twitter.

Left-wing actor Alec Baldwin continued his obsession with death posting an early Sunday morning tweet in which he asked his 1 million Twitter followers “Why does Trump want so many people to die?” The Saturday Night Live Trump impersonator’s tweet linked to a Washington Post article that highlights how medical supply company Prestige Ameritech asked federal officials earlier this year if they wanted the company to produce N95 masks. The WaPo article notes that the Prestige Ameritech-related quotes came from an 89-page whistle-blower complaint filed last week by former director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority Dr. Rick Bright. Why does Trump want so many people to die?https://t.co/Zs6uTiWCem — HABFoundation (@ABFalecbaldwin) May 10, 2020  Dr. Bright claims he was booted from the Trump administration because he had refused to promote hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for coronavirus. But Bright, who retained the attorneys who helped launch Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s accusations against Brett Kavanaugh in 2018, was reportedly headed for the doors, Politico reporter Dan Diamond notes, months before. Alec Baldwin failed to mention any of this, despite having more than enough room in his tweet to do so. Instead, the Boss Baby star is flirting with a conspiracy theory, one that would have you believe that while President Trump was holding “Keep America Great” rallies across the country he was also willingly allowing a deadly virus from China to spread throughout the United States, triggering the worst economic collapse since the Great Depression — all just a few months before asking millions of American voters, many of whom have had their lives and livelihoods destroyed, to reelect him. But we’re talking about a man in Baldwin who just hours before asking why the president “wants so many people to die,” said this: “The earth, Mother Nature, God, take your pick. Something wants to evict mankind. You needn’t look to far to understand why.” The earth, Mother Nature, God, take your pick. Something wants to evict mankind.

Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” anchor Chuck Todd accused President Donald Trump of “moving away from fighting the coronavirus” and pivoting to the economy. Todd said, “President Trump is making it clear he’s moving away from fighting the coronavirus to cheerleading an economic recovery. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump announced he was winding down the White House task force. Then a day later, undid the undoing while continuing to urge the reopening of the country in defiance of even his own task force guidelines. He chose also not to wear a mask at a mask-making factory because the AP reported he believes it would send the message he’s more concerned with health than with the economy. Meanwhile, three top health officials have begun a partial or full quarantine after two people working in the White House became infecting indicating just how hard it is to keep the virus out of even the most testing and secure workplaces in this country. All this in a week where the confirmed cases in the United States passed 1.3 million, and the death toll is approaching 80,000 now.” He continued, “It is not partisan to say the administration’s response to this coronavirus pandemic has been both confused and confusing, and it raises troubling questions. What’s the plan for testing and contact tracing? Or does the federal government think that’s just too hard to do without a breakthrough? What’s the plan for maintaining social distancing as states reopen? What’s the plan for making people feel confident about returning to work when even the White House can’t even keep the virus out? And what’s the plan for treating this pandemic as our greatest national crisis since the Second World War? In other words, what’s the plan?” He added, “Facing a pandemic that shows no signs of containment The president is making it clear he is not willing to wait for a national decline in cases or deaths, instead of pushing states to reopen now.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Sunday on “Full Court Press,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) told host Greta van Susteren vote-by-mail would be in the next coronavirus stimulus legislation. Pelosi said, “Well, let me stay a couple of things. First of all, I’m proud of our state of California. Jerry Brown, when he left, scores of billions of dollars of surplus. That’s all gone because of the virus. That’s all gone because of the virus. So, to those who make that charge about, ‘oh, they had problems before,’ it has nothing to do with that. This is strictly, what are your outlays for the coronavirus? What is your revenue loss for the coronavirus? That’s what has the support of Democratic and Republican governors across the country. It strictly about this, and it’s about nothing else. It has nothing to do with anything else in the budget of the governors. And we will come and our bill, also have funding for vote by mail, which we think is essential and supported by Republicans across the country. They like voting by mail. They have more of a habit of voting by mail.” Van Susteren asked, “How our vote by mail and absentee voting different?” Pelosi said, “This is related to COVID for the reason that we are trying to keep people at home, vote at home and the rest, vote by mail does one thing—I was a former chair of the California party, and our goal was to remove all obstacles to participation.” She added, “This is an opportunity to remove obstacles of participation by calling upon the governing bodies to send a ballot to every registered voter by having same-day registration, by having adequate polling places for those who want to or need in person, but to reduce the number of people who will be gathering in such places on election day. We had some elections coming up soon. In the state of Wisconsin, they had a number of COVID cases that were immediately traced to people having to stand in line for a long time to vote, so this is not only the health of our democracy commits the health of our people, and it makes the argument, there are states like Oregon that have had vote by mail for a number of years, and they claim success, and it certainly pleases the people there.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Los Angeles Times art critic Christopher Knight — who just won the 2020 Pulitzer Prize for criticism — wants to demolish Trump Tower in New York and create a coronavirus memorial, or “plague column,” in its place. Christopher Knight made the bizarre recommendation in a recent L.A. Times essay, saying that Trump Tower symbolizes a “social pestilence” that needs to be eradicated. In the article, he outlined a few hypothetical scenarios for the high-rise building, which is located on 5th Avenue in midtown Manhattan. “Trump Tower… could be seized by eminent domain,” he wrote. “Repurpose the entire building for public benefit, or demolish it and let a new plague column rise in its place. Few things are more pressing than eradicating the social pestilence symbolized by the place.” (Full disclosure: I was a reporter at the L.A. Times and worked on the same team as Knight. Moreover, I sat in a cubicle next to his.) The article argues that Trump Tower at 56th Street and 5th Avenue provides the ideal location for a “plague column.” “At that notorious intersection, the potential for poetic justice is most resonant,” Knight wrote. He added the coronavirus pandemic represents “the colossal failure of our New Gilded Age society, where the top-down, winner-take-all  philosophy of the last 40 years has been complicit in shredding America’s hard-fought advances in equality and social justice.” The critic, who is a virulent Trump hater who regularly tweets his loathing of the current administration, provided no alternate locations for his hypothetical plague column. Nor does he mention China’s role in covering up the severity of the coronavirus outbreak or the Chinese Communist Party’s subsequent disinformation campaign to blame the U.S. On Monday, Knight was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for criticism, the highest honor in his profession. In its citation, the Pulitzer committee praised his series of articles criticizing the renovation of the L.A. County Museum of Art. His writing demonstrates “extraordinary community service by a critic, applying his expertise and enterprise to critique a proposed overhaul of the L.A. County Museum of Art and its effect on the institution’s mission,” the committee wrote. This year’s awards have come under fire for honoring the New York Times‘ 1619 project — a series of articles that sought to reframe American history around slavery.  Nikole Hannah-Jones’s Pulitzer-winning essay has been criticized by historians for its inaccuracies, particularly her assertion that the Revolutionary War was fought in part to preserve slavery.

The globalist think tank run by Tony Blair has claimed that it is “embedded in governments around the world”, supposedly advising them on the Chinese coronavirus crisis — despite the former prime minister’s connections to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) regime. The Tony Blair Institue said that it has “teams” advising world governments “to keep their people safe during this pandemic — not just in respect of Covid-19 itself but also the political and economic collateral damage.” The think tank has advised governments to adopt “dramatically increased technological surveillance”, arguing that it is “a price worth paying”. “In normal times the degree of monitoring and state intervention we are talking about here would be out of the question in liberal democracies. But these are not normal times, and the alternatives are even more unpalatable. This is quite different from the traditional debate about whether confronting security threats to our way of life merits sacrificing the values of freedom and privacy that define us,” said Chris Yiu, the institute’s executive director of technology and public policy. Similar big government policies, such as compulsory ID cards for all citizens — ultimately defeated — were a key feature of Blair’s years in power. The former premier has also argued that the UN’s World Health Organization (WHO) should be given “much greater heft and weight” and claimed that without more funding and support it would be “unfair to criticise them” — despite the fact that the WHO promoted Chinese communist propaganda from the outset of the coronavirus outbreak. Our teams are now embedded in governments around the world, helping them to keep their people safe during this pandemic – not just in respect of Covid-19 itself but also the political and economic collateral damage.

Following reports linking the now-defunct Tony Blair Associates firm with the Saudi oil company PetroSaudi and the Abu Dhabi financial management firm Mubadala, the Iraq War architect resigned from his already controversial post as Middle East peace envoy at the United Nations. Questions about Mr Blair’s close business ties with the Chinese regime and people connected the Chinese Communist Party have also been raised. In 2015, an investigation by The Telegraph found that after leaving office Mr Blair served as a liaison between Abu Dhabi and the “highest levels of the Communist Party and state-run corporations” in bringing investment to the Xinjiang province of the country, where it is alleged that millions of Uyghurs are being interned in concentration camps by the regime in Beijing. It is also known that Mr Blair received £200,000 to give a speech in the Chinese industrial city of Dongguan in 2007 — more than his combined salary for a year as Prime Minister and a Member of Parliament. In an interview with POLITICO earlier this month, Mr Bair said that Western governments must come to terms with China’s new “dominant position” in the world, and that the West should abandon nationalist impulses.

The German bishops conference has dismissed a warning by high-ranking Church figures that the Chinese coronavirus crisis has furnished a pretext for government overreach and the squelching of liberties. As Breitbart News reported, a group of prominent Catholic prelates and lay leaders issued a declaration this week denouncing unjustified government suppression of the basic rights of citizens under the “pretext” of the Covid-19 epidemic. The group, which includes three cardinals and nine bishops, warned that public health “must not and cannot become an alibi for infringing on the rights of millions of people around the world,” especially as “growing doubts emerge from several quarters about the actual contagiousness, danger and resistance of the virus.” The prelates claimed that “there are powers interested in creating panic among the world’s population with the sole aim of permanently imposing unacceptable forms of restriction on freedoms, of controlling people and of tracking their movements.” The German bishops, who have been favorable to the lockdown and the government’s suspension of public worship, have criticized the letter as indulging in unfounded conspiracy theories. “The German Bishops’ Conference’s assessment of the coronavirus pandemic is fundamentally different than the appeal published yesterday,” said conference president Bishop Georg Bätzing Saturday evening. For his part, the vicar general of the city of Essen, Klaus Pfeffer, commented on Facebook that he was “simply stunned at what was being published in the name of the Church and Christianity: crude conspiracy theories without facts or evidence, allied with aggressive right-wing populist rhetoric meant to cause alarm.” Among the signatories of the letter is Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, the former chief of the Vatican’s doctrinal office and Germany’s highest-ranking prelate, as well as Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, former Vatican nuncio to the United States. In their letter, the prelates side with a growing number of observers that the negative effects of lockdowns on public health and well-being will far outweigh the destruction wrought by the virus itself. The text also warns against the dangers of new forms of surveillance being adopted to monitor the movements of citizens under the guise of better ensuring public health. “Forms of control over people, whether through tracking systems or any other form of location-finding” must be “rigorously avoided,” the letter reads, and the fight against the coronavirus “must not be the pretext for supporting the hidden intentions of supranational bodies that have very strong commercial and political interests in this plan.” Follow @tdwilliamsrome

ROME (AP) – South Korea’s capital closed down more than 2,100 bars and other nightspots Saturday because of a new cluster of coronavirus infections, Germany scrambled to contain fresh outbreaks at slaughterhouses, and Italian authorities worried that people were getting too friendly at cocktail hour during the country’s first weekend of eased restrictions. The new flare-ups – and fears of a second wave of contagion – underscored the dilemma authorities face as they try to reopen their economies. Around the world, the U.S. and other hard-hit countries are wrestling with how to ease curbs on business and public activity without causing the virus to come surging back. In New York, the deadliest hot spot in the U.S., Gov. Andrew Cuomo said three children died from a possible complication of the coronavirus involving swollen blood vessels and heart problems. At least 73 children statewide have been diagnosed with symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease — a rare inflammatory condition – and toxic shock syndrome. But there is no proof the mysterious syndrome is caused by the virus. Two members of the White House coronavirus task force – the heads of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Food and Drug Administration – placed themselves in quarantine after contact with someone who tested positive for Covid-19, a stark reminder that not even one of the nation´s most secure buildings is immune from the virus. Elsewhere, Belarus, which has not locked down despite sharply rising infections, saw tens of thousands turn out to mark Victory Day, the anniversary of Nazi Germany’s defeat in 1945. Authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko has dismissed concerns about the virus as a “psychosis.” Elderly Veteran Coronavirus Patient Treated Like 'Leper', 'Plague Carrier' After Recovery https://t.co/GitISWaxDv — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 9, 2020  That was in contrast to Russia, which skipped the usual grand military parade in Moscow’s Red Square. This year´s observance had been expected to be especially large because it is the 75th anniversary, but instead, President Vladimir Putin laid flowers at the tomb of the unknown soldier and a show of military might was limited to a flyover of 75 warplanes and helicopters. Worldwide, 4 million people have been confirmed infected by the virus, and more than 279,000 have died, including over 78,000 in the U.S., according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. Spain, France, Italy and Britain have reported around 26,000 to 32,000 deaths each. Germany and South Korea have both carried out extensive testing and contact tracing and have been hailed for avoiding the mass deaths that overwhelmed other countries. But even there, authorities have struggled to find the balance between saving lives and salvaging jobs. Seoul shut down nightclubs, hostess bars and discos after dozens of infections were linked to people who went out last weekend as the country relaxed social distancing. Many of the infections were connected to a 29-year-old man who visited three nightclubs before testing positive. Mayor Park Won-soon said health workers were trying to contact some 1,940 people who had been at the three clubs and other places nearby. The mayor said gains made against the virus are now threatened “because of a few careless people.” Germany faced outbreaks at three slaughterhouses in what was seen as a test of its strategy for dealing with any resurgence as restrictions ease. At one slaughterhouse, in Coesfeld, 180 workers tested positive. Businesses in the U.S. continue to struggle as more employers reluctantly conclude that their laid-off employees might not return to work anytime soon. Health officials are watching for a second wave of infections, roughly two weeks after states began gradually reopening with Georgia largely leading the way. Some malls have opened up in Georgia and Texas, while Nevada restaurants, hair salons and other businesses were able to have limited reopenings Saturday or once again allow customers inside after nearly two months of restrictions. The reopening of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park along the Tennessee-North Carolina border was a bit too tempting a draw as scores of nature lovers crowded parking lots and trails and even trekked into closed areas, park spokeswoman Dana Soehn said. Many did not wear masks. In Los Angeles, hikes to the iconic hillside Hollywood sign and hitting the golf links were allowed as the California county hit hardest reopened some sites to recreation-starved stay-at-homers. Mayor Eric Garcetti urged “good judgment” and said the city would rely on education and encouragement rather than heavy-handed enforcement: “Not our vision to make this like a junior high school dance with people standing too close to each other,” he said. In New York, a Cuomo spokesman said the governor was extending stay-at-home restrictions to June 7, but another top aide later clarified that that was not so; the May 15th expiration date for the restrictions remains in place “until further notice,” Melissa DeRosa said in an evening statement. The federal government said it was delivering supplies of Remdesivir, the first drug shown to speed recovery for Covid-19 patients, to six more states, after seven others were sent cases of the medicine earlier this week. Chechen Migrant Drags French Policeman Over 60 Feet to Escape Virus Check https://t.co/viKnRdVLym — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 9, 2020  Italy saw people return to the streets and revel in fine weather. Milan Mayor Giuseppe Sala warned that “a handful of crazy people´´ were putting his city’s recovery at risk and threatened to shut down the trendy Navigli district after crowds of young people were seen out at the traditional aperitivo hour ignoring social-distancing rules. The Campo dei Fiori flower and vegetable market was also bustling in Rome. But confusion created frustrations for the city’s shopkeepers. Carlo Alberto, owner of TabaCafe, an Argentine empanada bar that was selling cocktails to a few customers, said that since reopening this week, police had threatened to fine him over crowds outside. “Am I supposed to send them home? They need a guard here to do that,” he said. “The laws aren’t clear, the decree isn´t clear. You don´t know what you can do.” Elsewhere, Pakistan allowed shops, factories, construction sites and other businesses to reopen, even as more than 1,600 new cases and 24 deaths were reported. Prime Minister Imran Khan said the government was rolling back curbs because it can´t support millions who depend on daily wages. But controls could be reimposed if people fail to practice social distancing. In Spain certain regions can scale back lockdowns starting Monday, with limited seating at bars, restaurants and other public places. But Madrid and Barcelona, the country´s largest cities, will remain shut down. “The pandemic is evolving favourably, but there is a risk of another outbreak that could generate a serious catastrophe,” Spanish health official Fernando Simón said. “Personal responsibility is vital.” Lifting of UK Coronavirus Lockdown Could Begin Monday, Says Boris https://t.co/JP9lFzRI2h — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 7, 2020  ___ Gera reported from Warsaw, Poland, and Forliti reported from Minneapolis.

Several Italian regions have demanded their shops and restaurants be allowed to start reopening on Monday, and the economy gradually opened up more as the month goes on. The autonomous region of South Tyrol voted 28 to one in its regional council to begin lifting restrictions this week after it saw a second consecutive day with no new Chinese coronavirus cases, and will allow several industries to reopen their doors on Monday. The industries allowed to open their doors will include restaurants, hairdressers and beauty salons, museums, libraries, and youth centres. All of those allowed to reopen will do so under social distancing rules and other health precautions. “After Rome did not listen to the requests for a regional differentiation of the measures for weeks, we decided to undertake our autonomous legislative path and the region wants to face phase two in the name of applying its autonomy,” said South Tyrol governor Arno Kompatscher.

He added that he wanted to look out for small business owners, slamming the government of Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte: “I personally find it very difficult to justify the government’s choice to allow companies with three thousand employees to open and to impose closure on a handbag shop.” Other European countries have also begun opening up their economies in recent weeks, including Denmark, which will allow shopping centres to start opening on May 18th and announced “phase three” this week which will begin on June 8th. Phase three will involve the opening of amusement parks, sports stadiums, museums, colleges, and cinemas across the country. Gatherings will also be increased from ten to either thirty or fifty people.

PARIS (AP) – As France prepares to start letting public life resume after eight weeks under a coronavirus lockdown, many parents are deeply torn over a question without a clear or correct answer: Should I send my child back to school? The French government is easing some of the closure and home-confinement orders it imposed March 17 to curb infections, with businesses permitted to reopen, residents cleared to return to workplaces and schools welcoming some students again starting Monday. Only preschools and elementary schools are set to start up at first, and classes will be capped at 10 students at preschools and 15 elsewhere. Administrators were told to prioritize instruction for children ages 5, 6, and 10. Due to the slow startup, as well as ongoing fears about Covid-19 in hard-hit France, school attendance will not be compulsory right away. Parents and guardians may keep children at home and teachers will provide lessons like they have during the nationwide lockdown. Students with parents who want or need to send them to school are not guaranteed places in the smaller classes and only will be allowed to attend if their school can accommodate them. Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer estimated that 80 per cent to 85 per cent of France’s 50,500 preschools and elementary schools will open this week. Junior high schools in regions with fewer virus cases are expected to reopen on May 18th. A target date hasn’t been scheduled yet for high schools. France: Far-Left Antifa Extremists Possible Suspects in Mass Sabotage of Internet Infrastructure https://t.co/ydwvfFowXn — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 8, 2020  Given the ambiguous education guidance and uncertainties over spreading coronavirus, French parents are conflicted as they puzzle over making the most responsible decision. Cecile Bardin, whose two sons are 6 and 2, said she thinks it is “too soon” to put them back in their nursery and primary schools in Paris. “I am not reassured at the moment, because it will be very difficult to keep safe distance at school, especially for the little ones, who will want to play together,” Bardin said. Mathilde Manaud and her partner are raising their 3-year-old and 7-year-old in Le Pre Saint-Gervais, in the French capital’s eastern suburbs. They agreed to send the children kids back to school if there are spaces. “Truth is, we don’t know whether we are right to do so or no, we don’t know if it’s a mistake. We ask ourselves this question every day, and we change our mind every day,” Manaud said. “We are trying to convince ourselves that if they are reopening, they assume they can handle the situation.” Returning students will find their classrooms running differently. Teachers will wear masks and remind children to social distance from each other and to wash their hands several times a day. French President Emmanuel Macron sought to reassure parents and teachers while visiting an elementary school in a town west of Paris last week. Macron said schools would reopen gradually because he wants “things done well.” School director Mathieu Morel warned the president that “children remain children. There are spontaneous moves which are hard to prevent.” The school expects about 50 children out of an enrolled 181 to come back this week. Some mayors in France have refused to reopen local schools just yet. Michele Berthy, mayor of the town of Montmorency north of Paris, sent parents a letter saying the government’s health guidelines were “unenforceable.” “Although I’m for the relaunch of our economy, I am certain that public health must remain our priority,” Berthy wrote. Mayors in other areas set local restrictions on enrollment, such as limiting school access to children of essential workers such as police officers and health care providers, and to families whose living conditions are precarious. That’s the situation in Paris, where Ingrid Rousseau hoped to send the youngest of her two children, who is 6, back to school. She doesn’t know if her son will be allowed to go, even though both she and partner are working. Rousseau noted the fatigue of parents who have been overwhelmed with homeschooling, work and domestic duties for almost two months. “I don’t feel quite up to the job of teaching,” she said. “We are swamped. We don’t have enough time. And we cannot do a big part of the activities they do in class.” Paris officials estimate about 15% of the city’s students will be able to go back to school. Other towns and cities think they can serve about half of the children normally in preschool and elementary school. Scientists are still split on the role that children play in transmitted the new coronavirus, which has infected over 176,000 people in France, killing at least 26,300 of them, according to government figures. Health officials have repeatedly said that children appear to be the demographic that is among the least-affected by Covid-19. The World Health Organization has reported that children seem to mostly suffer only mild symptoms, although some severe cases and deaths have been recorded as the virus continues to spread globally. Several studies published earlier this year suggested that closing schools has a negligible impact on reducing the spread of the coronavirus and that children are less easily infected and not responsible for the cases within families. Other infectious disease experts say while children can acquire the virus and may be infectious, it´s clear they are not super-spreaders of Covid-19 as they are believed to be with influenza. The United Nations educational, scientific and cultural agency, UNESCO, estimated that up to 87 per cent of pupils and students across the world have seen their schools being closed, affecting more than 1.5 billion young people in 195 countries.

A cargo ship unloaded 79 migrants to the island of Sicily as Italy sees a rise in illegal immigration and the European Union border agency Frontex warns of a surge of migrants heading toward Greece. The cargo vessel Marina dropped off another 79 migrants at the town of Porto Empedocle on Friday after they were picked up in the search area off the coast of Malta on May 3rd. The landing of the migrants came despite orders from the town’s mayor Ida Carmina given on April 10th that the town’s ports would be closed to migrant transport vessels, newspaper Il Giornale reports. “First aid will be guaranteed to migrants and then they will be taken away,” Mayor Carmina claimed. Lampedusa, Italy’s southernmost island in the Mediterranean, has also begun to see another surge of new migrant arrivals — despite the Chinese coronavirus outbreak and the national lockdown measures put in place to stop its spread. Migrants Continue to Storm Italy Despite Coronavirus https://t.co/rr7SSm8Azx — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 7, 2020  Earlier this week the island saw at least 200 migrants arrive in just two days and joined another 100 migrants who were camped on a pier for two days prior under the cover of a large tent. Italy has also seen a surge of migrants enter the country through its northern border with Slovenia, with local police complaining that the Slovenians have done nothing to stop the migrants from getting across the border into Italy. League (Lega) Matteo Salvini was planning to build a wall to put a stop to such crossings while he was in government, but the new left-liberal coalition does not support strong border controls. Greece, meanwhile, is also facing a surge of new arrivals, according to the European Union border agency Frontex. The agency stated in a confidential report, leaked by German newspaper Die Welt, that it expects a huge surge of migrants as coronavirus lockdown measures are lifted in Turkey. “The restrictions on Covid-19 have been gradually lifted in most Aegean provinces, but not yet in Canakkale, Istanbul, and Izmir. If freedom of movement is restored in these areas, massive movements of migrants towards the Greek-Turkish border can be expected,” the internal report said. The Turkish government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had previously been shipping illegal migrants to the Greek border in large numbers, and used force to support their efforts to break through its defences. Turkey’s Islamist regime only closed the border due to the coronavirus outbreak, but shortly after the closure Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu warned that the migrants would return when the pandemic was over. Greek Defence Minister Says Country ‘on Alert’ for Fresh wave of Migrants https://t.co/rs9XqXbh0X — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 1, 2020  Coinciding with the surge in new arrivals has been a push from Germany’s foreign minister Heiko Maas to push for migrant redistribution across the EU, a policy rejected by countries like Hungary and Poland — which unlikely Germany never supported bringing hundreds of thousands of migrants to Europe — in the past.

President Trump delivered a video message just before the pay-per-view portion of UFC 249. His message was clear: “We want our sports back.” Trump was effusive with praise for the UFC and his friend, UFC President Dana White. “I want to congratulate (UFC President) Dana White and the UFC,” Trump said. “They’re going to have a big match. We love it. We think it’s important. Get the sports leagues back. Let’s play. Do the social distancing and whatever else you have to do. We need sports. We want our sports back.” Watch: Trump on the #UFC broadcast pic.twitter.com/kmpPdSs8f7 — Jed I.

On Friday, UFC fighter “Jacare” Souza tested positive for the coronavirus and was pulled from the event. UFC 249 was the first live event the organization has held in two months. The UFC will also hold live events on May 13th and May 16th. The next sport to get re-started will be NASCAR, when they resume racing on May 17th at Darlington.

On Saturday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “America’s News HQ,” Rep. Michael Waltz (R-FL) stated that China’s rise is the biggest “existential threat to the United States, to liberty around the world, to a free world order that we’ve ever faced.” And said facing them will be like facing the Soviet Union in the 20th century. Waltz said, “This is a national security issue, and in fact, I think this will be the national security issue, much like how we had to face the Soviet Union for most of the 20th century. This will be the case for the 21st century. … This is about dealing with what I think is the most existential threat to the United States, to liberty around the world, to a free world order that we’ve ever faced.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) — Kicks, punches and grunts echoed through the empty arena. Coaches, commentators and camera clicks resonated like never before. Blood, sweat, swollen eyelids and face masks signaled the return of UFC, the first major sporting event to resume since the coronavirus shuttered much of the country for nearly two months. UFC 249 ushered in a new look for sports, too. One without fans and amid several safety precautions.
It was definitely different — two fighters adjusted their approaches because of what they heard announcers say — and a welcome reprieve for a sports-craved country that went nearly eight weeks with few live events. “We did this for you, to bring sports back,” fighter Tony Ferguson told fans following his loss in the main event. Five hours after President Trump congratulated UFC for restarting the sports world, Justin Gaethje stunned heavily favored Ferguson (26-4) in the finale. Gaethje earned a TKO in the fifth and final round of the headliner that was deemed an interim lightweight title bout. It essentially gives Gaethje (22-2) the right to fight titleholder Khabib Nurmagomedov next. Nurmagomedov was unable to fight this weekend because of travel restrictions. Gaethje flipped over the top of the cage and back in following the biggest victory of his career. He then screamed repeatedly. “I want the real one,” he said as he threw down the interim belt. “There’s no other fight I want right now.”
The stacked card saw 33-year-old Henry Cejudo, with blood gushing from his forehead and running down his chest, defend his bantamweight title against Dominick Cruz and then announce his retirement in the middle of the octagon. “I really do want to walk away, but money talks,” said Cejudo, an Olympic gold medalist in 2008. “It gets stagnant. I want to leave on top.” The event also included heavyweight contender Francis Ngannou pummeling another opponent, former NFL defensive end Greg Hardy winning for the sixth time in eight fights and former welterweight champion and fan favorite Donald “Cowboy” Cerrone losing his fourth straight. Trump grabbed the spotlight early. His taped message was played during ESPN’s broadcast of the undercard.
“I want to congratulate (UFC President) Dana White and the UFC,” Trump said. “They’re going to have a big match. We love it. We think it’s important. Get the sports leagues back. Let’s play. Do the social distancing and whatever else you have to do. We need sports. We want our sports back.” UFC 249 was originally scheduled for April 18 in New York, but was postponed in hopes of helping slow the spread of COVID-19. The mixed martial arts behemoth will hold three shows in eight days in Jacksonville, where state officials deemed professional sports with a national audience exempt from a stay-at-home order as long as the location is closed to the public. The UFC came up with a 25-page document to address health and safety protocols, procedures that led to Jacaré Souza testing positive for COVID-19 on Friday. His middleweight bout against Uriah Hall was canceled that night. Souza’s two cornermen also tested as positive, the UFC said.
All three men left the host hotel to self-isolate elsewhere, where UFC’s medical team will monitor their conditions remotely and provide assistance with necessary treatments. The positive results surely increased the focus on the event. Every other sport is watching closely to see how it plays out. White didn’t want to postpone any fights. He tried to host the event on tribal land in California and still hopes to create a “Fight Island” for future cards. He settled for Jacksonville for at least a week — without fans and with social-distancing rules in place.
Judges and broadcasters worked from separate tables. Fighters, trainers, referees, judges, UFC staff and even outside media had to undergo COVID-19 testing to get inside Veterans Memorial Arena. Many of those in attendance Saturday wore masks and gloves, although several were seemingly exempt from the mandate. Referees, ring announcer Bruce Buffer, other officials inside the octagon and the ring girl were unmasked. Play-by-play commentator Joe Rogan, who initially was supposed to interview winners remotely, ended up doing them inside the octagon. The cage floor was disinfected between bouts, and the padded parts of the octagon were wiped down between rounds. Without fans, though, sounds that usually would be muted or completely drowned out filled the desolate arena. Fighters said it affected their bouts. Hardy and Carla Esparza said they altered their approach after hearing commentators during early rounds. “It’s hard to assess without the crowd,” Anthony Pettis said after beating Cerrone in a wild welterweight fight. “When I land stuff, I hear the crowd and know it was a good one. This time, there was no crowd. I saw his head pop, but there was nothing behind it, so it’s hard to tell.” Also on the card: — Cejudo (16-2) caught Cruz (22-3) with a right knee to the face that sent him reeling to the canvas. Cejudo then delivered nearly a dozen unanswered blows before the referee stopped it. Cruz argued it never should have been called because he was working to get back on his feet. Cejudo surprisingly ended his career a few minutes later, saying he wants to spend more time with his family. — Ngannou knocked out fellow heavyweight Jairzinho Rozenstruik in 20 seconds. Ngannou rushed Rozenstruik and delivered a flurry of blows that left Rozenstruik so woozy he had trouble getting into his slides long after the fight ended. It was Ngannou’s fourth consecutive victory totaling less than 3 minutes in the octagon. — Calvin Kattar (21-4) stopped Jeremy Stephens (28-18) in the second round after consecutive elbow blows, one standing and another on the ground. — Hardy (6-2) celebrated a unanimous decision over Yorgan De Castro (6-1) in a heavyweight bout. — “Showtime” Pettis (23-10) beat Cerrone (36-15) in an unanimous decision. Pettis and Cerrone last fought in 2013. Pettis won that one as well. Cerrone has dropped four in a row, including losses to Conor McGregor, Gaethje and Ferguson. — Aleksei “The Boa Constrictor” Oleinik (59-13-1) beat Fabricio Werdum (23-9-1) in a heavyweight bout featuring a pair of 42-year-olds. It was a split decision that included more toe-to-toe blows than ground grappling. — Carla Esparza (16-6) edged Michelle “Karate Hottie” Waterson (17-8) in a split decision. It was Esparza’s third straight victory in the straw-weight division. — Vicente Luque (18-7-1) won for the seventh time in eight fights when he beat Niko Price (14-4) in a bloodbath. The fight was ruled a TKO in the third round after Price developed a nasty cut above his right eye. Luque was ahead on all three cards when it was called. — Featherweight Bryce Mitchell (13-1) defeated fellow grappler Charles Rosa (12-4) in a unanimous decision. — Spann (18-5) extended his winning streak to eight by beating veteran Sam Alvey (33-14) in a split decision.

On Saturday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends,” Rep. Jeff Van Drew (R-NJ) stated that Democrats are not interested in holding China accountable for the coronavirus, and “The only thing that can possibly be in their mind is politics.” Van Drew said, “I mean, it is mind-boggling and unbelievable to me that everyone isn’t joined together in trying to figure out how and why China did this to us. … But, we have to know what the World Health Organization was doing, why they said that this was safe, why they said there was no problem with human transmission, why the two people who first identified this disappeared, one died, one just disappeared and now has sort of re-appeared, why China didn’t open its arms to us and allow our scientists, who were begging to come in to help them to really try to reduce and restrict what would happen here.” Van Drew added that Democrats “would rather just go after our own elected officials in the United States,” and “The only thing that can possibly be in their mind is politics.” He also stated that the Democratic Party’s posture towards China confirmed that he made the right decision by switching parties.

A woman in Hackensack, New Jersey, is celebrating more than just being a mom for Mother’s Day this year. After days of battling the Chinese coronavirus, Donna Molina’s fever spiked to 103 degrees on March 30 and she was rushed to Hackensack University Medical Center for treatment, according to Pix 11. “I was in an induced coma for 11 days, I was intubated and on a ventilator,” she recalled. Although pregnant women seemed to be at the same risk for contracting the disease as other adults, they should take every precaution to guard against it, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). “Pregnant people have changes in their bodies that may increase their risk of some infections,” the agency noted. Just before she went into the coma, doctors performed an emergency C-section on April 2 to protect Molina’s baby girl, Harley, whose birthday was supposed to be June 10. “They did an emergency c-section, and that’s the last thing I remember cause then after that I was out,” she explained. Following two weeks on the ventilator, the young mom began showing signs of improvement and eventually made a complete recovery. However, it was not until she tested negative twice for the coronavirus that she was allowed to meet her beautiful little girl for the first time. Video footage showed the emotional moment when a nurse laid Harley in her mother’s loving arms. “I wish I could kiss her,” she said, crying. “Her little feet, her little hands. Just so amazing how someone so small can pull through and survive.” Harley weighed three pounds at birth but quickly grew to five pounds, 3.8 ounces, and is expected to go home with her parents in two weeks, according to ABC 7. “The hospital was amazing. They worked on me, they didn’t give up. They took care of me in the ICU. They saved her life, which was most important to me, was to save my daughter’s life,” Molina said. “And here we are, together, two survivors. The best Mother’s Day ever,” she concluded.

Someone reportedly dumped sand into the revolving door entrance to Pittsburgh’s City Hall on Thursday hours after a crew filled in a local skate park with sand to deter people from congregating in those areas. TribLive.com reported that the police are currently investigating the incident at Grant Street entrance to Pittsburgh’s City-County building located downtown, but officials say it is uncertain if those events are connected at this time. Public Works Director Mike Gable said the West Penn Skate Park had been closed because a large number of children were gathering there during the coronavirus pandemic. The skate park had been chained off at first, but Gable said people had been climbing over the chains and cutting the locks to get in. “We have been forced to do this because people are just not listening. They are determined so we have to take extra measures,” he told WPXI. Gable said it is an extension of the city’s decision to close parks and playgrounds back in March and April and made the decision to shut down the parks and playgrounds following California’s lead. The city of San Clemente, California, did just that, dumping 37 tons of sand on a local skate park to block residents from using it during the coronavirus outbreak.

Renowned Chef Guy Fieri is helping restaurant industry workers get back on their feet during the coronavirus pandemic. When Fieri realized how much out of work restaurant employees were hurting due to the health crisis, he decided to do something about it, according to TMZ. “Boy, I started thinking about my brothers and sisters in the restaurant business and a bunch of the restaurants that I was closing,” he said Thursday. Fieri explained: So we partnered up with the National Restaurant Association Educational Foundation, ’cause they’re folks that know how to take in donations and get money out. And we started raising money. I started sending out personal video invitations to all the heavy hitter CEOs that are involved in the restaurant business and said, “Listen, Pepsi, Coke, Uber Eats, all of you, we need to raise some money.” Not long after, Fieri and the National Restaurant Association Education Foundation (NRAEF) created the Restaurant Employee Relief Fund and raised over $20 million in less than two months for workers in the industry. “Through this Fund, grants will be made to restaurant industry employees who have been impacted by COVID-19, including a decrease in wages or loss of employment,” its website read. Fieri continued: And to date, gentlemen, we’ve raised $21.5 million, and we’ve been giving out $500 grants to restaurant employees all over the country. We’ve given out 40,000 grants so far, approved 40,000 grants so far. So you can do the math and we’re up to 20 million. We’re gonna continue, as long as the money comes in, we’re gonna continue to give these grants. Friday on Instagram,  the NRAEF announced it would send out over 10,000 email notifications to grant recipients:     Update for Applicants on 5/8: We are sending out 10,000 new award notifications today. Please be sure to check your email inboxes over the weekend for an update from RERF@nraef.org or admin@communityforce.com. We thank you for your continued patience. A post shared by  NRAEF (@nraefoundation) on May 8, 2020 at 10:19am PDT Consumers will be even more excited to support restaurant employees once the pandemic ends and everything goes back to normal, Fieri said Thursday. “Just looking and listening and hearing what’s going on, I think people are gonna be fired up, gung ho, and ready to get out there and visit their restaurants a lot more than they were prior to the pandemic,” he concluded.

On Friday’s “PBS NewsHour,” New York Times columnist David Brooks stated that he doesn’t think we are at a point where opening the country back up makes sense. Brooks said, “If you look at the death rates, we’re pretty much around 2,000 a day. … The curve is flat, but it’s not going down. The death rate is hellacious. The people who model these things are raising their estimates of how many people are going to die. So, we’re just not winning. And, someday, we’ll get to the point where opening up seems to me a smart strategy. But I personally don’t see the evidence of that, looking at the data. And neither do people who know a lot more about this than me, the health experts. And so, Trump seems to me wildly premature in doing this. And, frankly, the American people seem to me a little premature.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

Choose Your News On May 8, web-surfing readers faced two very different accounts of California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s decision to shift his state to vote-by-mail for the coming November elections.   The Los Angeles Times headline read, “California voters asked to vote by mail in November due to coronavirus fears.” That same day, the headline atop Breitbart News read, “California: Gavin Newsom Orders Cheat-by-Mail for November Election.”  Both articles agreed on this much: California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, has ordered that ballots be mailed to the state’s 20.6 million voters for the November election, even as he is restricting voting in person. In other words, the goal of Newsom, a Democrat, is to make it harder to vote in person; instead, he wants Californians to vote-by-mail (VBM).   Beyond that, the two articles diverged: The Times was cheery about the VBM development. It quoted California’s secretary of state, Alex Padilla, the state’s chief elections officer, saying of Newsom’s decision, “It’s great for public health, it’s great for voting rights, it’s gonna be great for participation.”  By contrast, Breitbart News quoted Tim Murtaugh, spokesman for the Trump campaign, saying, “This is a thinly veiled political tactic by Gov. Newsom to undermine election security … a wide-open opportunity for fraud. California has a bad record on ensuring that people on the voting rolls still live at the same address, still reside in California, or are even still alive.” (In fact, Breitbart News has published scores of articles on “cheat by mail.”)   Okay, it’s clear: Just as readers faced a stark choice on what to read on May 8, so California voters will face a stark situation this November, when traditional voting will be utterly transformed.    And of course, voting won’t just be changed in California—voting is being transformed in many states. Voting By Mail: It’s Not Just Coming; It’s Here In fact, VBM has been increasing in recent years. According to the Election Science Data Lab, a unit of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), in the 2018 elections, absentee ballots—almost always, mail-in ballots—accounted for 24 percent of the national total, while 61 percent of ballots were cast in person on election day and another 15 percent were cast in-person, but early.  And we might recall, of course, that Democrats had a great election in ’18, gaining 41 House seats, thus putting Nancy Pelosi in the speakership; in addition, Democrats gained seven governorships. And according to a 2020 report from the bipartisan National Conference of State Legislatures, five states (Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah, and Washington State) now vote entirely by mail, and many other states have changed their laws to make absentee balloting easier. And many counties and cities have also changed their voting procedures; our federalist nation has become a patchwork of voting variety.  So what’s been the impact of these changes? In the words of MIT: “The expanding opportunities to cast an absentee ballot or to vote by mail have not been uncontroversial. Perhaps the most important issue has been whether expanding VBM opportunities increases voter turnout.” The report noted that turnout is in fact up, thanks to VBM: “This increase likely comes in two ways: by bringing marginal voters into the electorate and by retaining voters who might otherwise drop out of the electorate.” As a matter of fact, the 2018 turnout surged; it jumped from 36.7 percent of the voting-eligible population in 2014 to 50.3 percent four years later—that’s a more than one-third increase. Indeed, turnout in the 2018 midterms was the highest since the 1914 midterms. One can cite many possible reasons for this spike in turnout, including Trump intensity, pro and con, and yet it seems reasonable to conclude that MIT is right: easier voting played a role. We can observe that the MIT report was published long before the coronavirus outbreak. So today, there are obviously health concerns about the traditional system of queuing up to vote on election day.  And here’s some recent news, factoring in the impact of the virus: A May 3 article in the Washington Post, headlined, “Unexpected outcome in Wisconsin: Tens of thousands of ballots that arrived after Election Day were counted, thanks to court decisions.” In that election—it seems quaint to say that it was held on April 7, since so much voting seems to have happened on other dates, before and perhaps after—the most notable result was that an incumbent Republican state supreme court justice was defeated by a Democrat challenger.  So now back to California, a state boasting almost an eighth of the American population; it’s joining the VBM ranks. As of February 18, the Golden State counted 20,660,465 registered voters; quite likely, that number will grow between now and November, as parties seek to boost the number of their potential voters.   So what’s going to happen when California mails out nearly 21 million ballots? The ballots will be sent to the mailing address of the registered voter, and according to California law, upon receipt of the ballot, the would-be voter has three options: a) fill it out and mail it back in; b) drop it off at a “voting center,” that being California’s new phrase to cover for its reduction in the number of physical polling places; or c), allow a third party, such as a partisan campaign worker, to mail it in or drop it off.   This last practice, the use of third parties to facilitate voting, is known as “vote harvesting,” or “ballot harvesting,” and it’s already legal in California. Indeed, the widespread application of the practice explains why votes—almost all of them, interestingly enough, Democrat votes—kept turning up in days after the 2018 midterm elections, when California Democrats picked up seven House seats.   Indeed, ballot harvesting is seen as the political equivalent of a wonder-weapon—that is a weapon of victory for Democrats and a weapon of defeat for Republicans.    The mega-question, of course, is whether or not VBM, plus ballot harvesting, will increase opportunities for vote fraud. Vote Fraud Here’s what MIT’s Election Lab has to say about VBM and vote fraud:  There are two major features of VBM that raise these concerns.  First, the ballot is cast outside the public eye, and thus the opportunities for coercion and voter impersonation are greater.  Second, the transmission path for VBM ballots is not as secure as traditional in-person ballots. These concerns relate both to ballots being intercepted and ballots being requested without the voter’s permission. Continuing, MIT allows that, “even many scholars who argue that fraud is generally rare agree that fraud with VBM voting seems to be more frequent than with in-person voting.” [emphasis added]  The prospects of increased fraud should concern all Americans, of course—in both parties. And yet so far, it seems that only Republicans are concerned.   As President Trump declared on March 30, speaking of Democrat efforts to put VBM provisions into the Covid-19 economic relief bill, “They had things—levels of voting that, if you ever agreed to it, you’d never have a Republican elected in this country again.” Trump has repeated his warning about VBM many times since.  In the meantime, a CNN “fact check” on April 10 offered this blunt headline, trashing Trump and wrapping VBM in the mantle of science: “Trump lies about voter fraud while states, CDC encourage voting-by-mail as pandemic-friendly option.”  Many, if not most, on the right agree with Trump’s dire prognosis about the dangers of VBM. For instance, there’s the Heritage Foundation, which has published many reports on vote fraud; it has even provided a vote-fraud map. Zeroing in on VBM, Heritage’s Hans von Spakovsky, a former commissioner at the Federal Election Commission, headlined an April 10 piece, “Potential for Fraud Is Why Mail-In Elections Should Be Dead Letter.” As von Spakovsky put it: Absentee ballots are the tools of choice of election fraudsters because they are voted outside the supervision of election officials, making it easier to steal, forge, or alter them, as well as to intimidate voters. Continuing, he added: Going entirely to by-mail elections would unwisely endanger the security and integrity of the election process, particularly if officials automatically mail absentee ballots to all registered voters without a signed, authenticated request from each voter. Voter registration rolls are notoriously inaccurate and out of date, containing the names of voters who are deceased, have moved, or otherwise have become ineligible. Having thousands of ballots arriving in the mail for individuals who no longer reside at a registered address risks those ballots being stolen and voted. It’s not too hard to visualize some of the scenes wherein ballots will arrive: not just to homes and apartments, but also to nursing homes, homeless shelters, military bases—even jails. And then, too, it’s not hard to visualize the role played by ballot harvesters, as well as others operating along the whole length of the ballot “supply chain.” And so in California, whom should we trust to handle security for 21 million ballots, before, during, and after election day? Specifically, von Spakovsky pointed to California’s largest city, Los Angeles: The problem (and opportunity for fraud) this could cause is illustrated by something the president talked about at one of his news conferences; namely, the settlement that Judicial Watch obtained from Los Angeles and the state of California over their failure to maintain the accuracy of their voter registration rolls. The state and LA agreed to remove from the rolls 1.5 million individuals who remained registered even though they no longer were eligible to vote. Imagine what would have happened if 1.5 million ballots were simply mailed out to all of those individuals to addresses where they no longer live. Yes, 1.5 million stray ballots makes for a lot of potential political mayhem.  We might further note that, according to the Census Bureau, almost 12 percent of Americans change addresses every year. If that percentage of changers were to be found in California this year, that would mean that roughly 2.4 million Californians will have changed addresses in 2020. Can California handle that volume of change? Can any state?   We might also add that, extrapolating from national mortality statistics, approximately a quarter-million Californians over the age of 18 will die this year. How many of these decedents will get ballots?  In other words, it seems likely that the political dam is going to burst in California.   So what should California Republicans do in the face of this flood? How should America as a whole respond? These are questions for another time, and yet in the meantime, it certainly seems vital that we use our federalized system to compartmentalize California and other VBM states. That is, our 50-state constitutional system provides a natural bulwark against the choices of some states, especially those that have proven themselves to be sloppy, deliberately or otherwise, about policing vote fraud. Specifically, as this author has argued, we should double down on our defense of the Electoral College. Oh, and one more thing: Once VBM is established, it won’t be long before we start moving to VBA—that is, Vote By App. Also in California, the tech moguls of Silicon Valley look forward to the prospect of helping with e-voting. And Democrats look forward to their help.

Ivanka Trump’s personal assistant is the latest in a list of White House staffers who have reportedly come down with the coronavirus. CNN reported that the aide has been teleworking and has not physically seen the president’s daughter in weeks. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) administrator Stephen Hahn has been forced to self-quarantine for two weeks after being exposed to Vice President Mike Pence’s spokesperson Katie Miller, the wife of presidential adviser Stephen Miller, who has tested positive for the virus. The troubling news came within days of President Donald Trump’s personal valet testing positive in what was considered the first known case of a White House staffer contracting the deadly virus. Now President Trump, Pence, staffers, and reporters are getting tested daily to prevent the spread of the virus even as the White House continues to support reopening measures across the country. Pence’s flight to Iowa to promote the restarting of the economy was delayed due to the news of Miller’s illness. Six staffers had to deplane and quarantine because they were recently in contact with her. Those protecting Trump have also tested positive for the coronavirus. Breitbart News reported Saturday that 11 U.S. Secret Service officers have come down with the deadly virus.

During Friday’s Democratic weekly address, Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) stated that without “comprehensive contact tracing” and a national testing strategy that ensures everyone who needs a test can get one, “consumers won’t have the confidence needed to jump-start our economy.” Transcript as Follows: “Hi, I’m Bob Menendez, senior Senator for the state of New Jersey. As I’m recording this message from my Senate office in Washington, countless medical and healthcare professionals across the country are on the frontlines, leading our fight against the coronavirus. Already this virus has taken more than 70,000 of our friends and loved ones, hundreds of thousands more remain sick as we pray for their recovery. Grocery store clerks, warehouse and transit workers, and others are putting their own health at risk to keep food and supply chains going, and making sure essential employees can keep working. Tens of millions of people are out of work and families remain sequestered in their homes. When Leader McConnell called the Senate back into session this week, I’d hope it was so we could immediately get started on an additional package in response to this unprecedented public health and economic crisis. Instead, the week ends as it began. Our country is still hurting. Our people are still suffering. And Senate Republicans are blocking action on critical coronavirus legislation. Each day they refuse to act sets us further behind. Like you, I yearn for the day when all this is past us and we can finally return things to normal, or a ‘new normal.’ But we must have a national strategy for widespread testing so that everyone who needs a test can get a test, as President Trump promised over 2 months ago, as well as comprehensive contact tracing. Until then, consumers won’t have the confidence needed to jump-start our economy. It’s never been clearer that our nation’s wealth depends on our nation’s health. No matter how quickly we want to rejoin society, reopen our economy, and return to normal, the reality is, folks just aren’t going to venture out until they know for sure that they are COVID-free and anyone else they come in contact with is okay as well. Meanwhile, as we speak, our states, cities and towns are hemorrhaging money trying to defeat COVID-19 while revenues dry up. Talking this week with mayors in my home state of New Jersey, which has been ravaged by the coronavirus, they are running out of money to pay firefighters and police officers, teachers, and sanitation workers. Building permits aren’t being processed. Lifeguards aren’t being hired to patrol the beaches, or part-time staff to run summer camps. This isn’t a blue state or red state issue, this is an American issue. If we ever want to get back to normal, to see businesses thrive, we need to ensure that our police officers and firefighters have the resources they need, we need to keep the lights on at city hall, our public workers on the job, our kids in school, our streets safe, the trash picked up, and the buses and trains running on time. Contrary to Senator McConnell’s solution, we cannot bankrupt our way out of this crisis. That’s foolish and downright dangerous. Congress must pass, without delay, a robust state and local aid package that delivers the flexible funding our frontline states and communities need. Congress must also ensure that the trillions of dollars it has already authorized to defeat the coronavirus are being spent properly by the Trump administration. That small mom and pops aren’t being shut out of help in favor of big Fortune 500 companies. That unemployment and stimulus checks are being paid. That hospitals, community health centers and nursing homes have the resources they need. That the American people are getting what they paid for. They are counting on us. Democrats are eager to do the people’s business. It’s time for Republicans to join us and get to work. Thanks for listening, and stay healthy.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett  

Several members of the U.S. Secret Service agency have reportedly tested positive for the Chinese coronavirus, Yahoo News said Friday. “In March, the Secret Service, which is responsible for the protection of President Trump and other leaders, acknowledged that a single employee tested positive in March,” the article noted. The report continued: However the problem is currently far more widespread, with 11 active cases at the agency as of Thursday evening, according to a daily report compiled by the DHS. … According to the DHS document, along with the 11 active cases there are 23 members of the Secret Service who have recovered from COVID-19 and an additional 60 employees who are self-quarantining. No details have been provided about which members of the Secret Service are infected or if any have recently been on detail with the president or vice president. Wednesday, President Trump’s personal valet tested positive for the disease, according to Breitbart News. However, the president and Vice President Mike Pence have since tested negative and remain in good health, the report noted. Following news of his valet, President Trump said the White House would up the frequency of tests given to its staffers. “So we test once a week. Now we’re going to go testing once a day, but even when you test once a day, somebody could — something happens where they catch something,” he stated. Friday, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) referred requests for comment on the number of employees who contracted the virus to the Secret Service. However, the agency declined to release the numbers of those who had tested positive or who had been or were currently in quarantine. “Since the beginning of this pandemic, the Secret Service has been working with all of our public safety partners and the White House Medical Unit to ensure the safety and security of both our protected persons and our employees,” said spokesperson Justine Whelan. “The Secret Service continues to follow guidance issued by the CDC to ensure the health and welfare of our employees and those they come in contact with,” she concluded.

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s plan to reopen his state calls for bans of gatherings of more than 50 people, including worship services, until a vaccine or treatment for the coronavirus is “widely available.” The Democrat governor released his five-phase plan, titled “Restoring Illinois,” Tuesday, which says even at Phase 4, called “Revitalization,” “50 or fewer” would be permitted at any gatherings as long as testing and tracing are widely conducted. The state is currently in Phase 2, or “Flattening” the curve, as the rate of infection is slowing. According to the most recent data, Illinois is the fourth most affected state in the nation, with 73,760 total cases of COVID-19 and 3,241 deaths. As of May 1, nursing home deaths accounted for 44 percent of Illinois fatalities due to the coronavirus. “We have to figure out how to live with COVID-19 until it can be vanquished – and to do so in a way that best supports our residents’ health and our healthcare systems, and saves the most lives,” Pritzker said, reported NBC5 Chicago: Even if we’re one of the best states in the nation on testing, we know it’s not enough to be where we need to be on a longer timeframe. I’m committed to continuing our success because it’s fundamental to our economic future and to keeping Illinoisans safe from this virus. — Governor JB Pritzker (@GovPritzker) May 8, 2020  According to the plan, it is not until Phase 5, or “Illinois Restored,” when “testing, tracing and treatment are widely available throughout the state,” and “either a vaccine is developed to prevent additional spread of COVID-19, a treatment option is readily available that ensures health care capacity is no longer a concern, or there are no new cases over a sustained period,” will gatherings, including religious services, of more than 50 people, be permitted. On Friday, Romanian churches in Illinois filed a federal lawsuit against Pritzker, claiming his executive orders discriminate against churches by restricting worship services to ten people while other commercial entities, such as liquor and “big box” stores are permitted to accommodate larger groups. Liberty Counsel is representing Elim Romanian Pentecostal Church and Logos Baptist Ministries in the lawsuit. The nonprofit Christian firm stated in a press release: Governor Pritzker has made it clear that churches will not be able to hold in-person gatherings of more than 10 people until Phase 4 of his Restore Illinois Plan, and that gatherings of more than 50 cannot take place until Phase 5, which he has stated may take more than one year to achieve, and will only be available if there is some vaccine widely available. “Governor Pritzker has clearly discriminated against churches by limiting in-person services to only ten people while allowing other commercial and secular businesses to operate with large gatherings of people,” said Liberty Counsel chairman Mat Staver, adding: In addition, the governor states it may be more than a year until this limit on churches can be lifted. This is unconstitutional as churches have the First Amendment right to exist, but businesses do not. In the land of the free, these Romanian pastors and church members should never have to fear arrest or sanction for attending worship services in church. As Catholic News Agency reported, on May 1, the Archdiocese of Chicago announced public Masses with ten or fewer people could resume. Illinois, however, had previously banned not only all religious services, but also “drive-in” services, including drive-in confessions. Pritzker’s plan says the state’s response to the coronavirus crisis “has been guided by data, science, and public health experts.” The plan comes as Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Wednesday the coronavirus lockdowns have been effective. Fauci cautioned against lessening social distancing practices and added state and local governments should look to the White House task force’s guidelines to make decisions for reopening. Fauci and other public health officials have also said a vaccine for the coronavirus infection is at least 12 to 18 months from being developed and tested sufficiently to be made widely available. Pritzker’s reopening plan echoes these statements. “The risk of spread remains, and modeling and data point to a rapid surge in new cases if all mitigation measures were to be immediately lifted,” it states, adding the “path forward is not what everyone wants or hopes for, but it will keep Illinoisans as safe as possible from this virus as our economy is reopening.”

The Chinese Communist Party (CCP), in the wake of the economic collapse triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, is ignoring debt relief calls by African countries targeted by Beijing’s predatory lending practices, a leader of a bipartisan American congressional commission suggested on Friday. U.S. taxpayers may have to bail out the African countries unable to meet their financial obligations from Chinese “debt traps,” Carolyn Bartholomew, the chairwoman of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission established by Congress, declared in opening remarks prepared for a hearing Friday. The coronavirus illness (COVID-19) originated in China where the CCP mismanaged its response and hid the severity of the lethal and highly contagious disease during its early stages, a move that slowed the globe’s response, U.S. officials believe. American officials have also accused China of spreading disinformation that has contributed to the spread of the viral pandemic. The United States has long accused China of using its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) as a vehicle for predatory economic diplomacy to undermine the sovereignty of financially vulnerable African countries by burying them in unsustainable debts often collateralized with strategic assets and natural resources. On Friday, the U.S.-China commission held a hearing on Beijing’s strategic aims in Africa, particularly the communist country’s growing influence on the continent and its implication for the United States. In her written testimony, Bartholomew declared: China’s funding [for Africa] comes at a price, contributing to an unsustainable buildup of debt in many African countries. These lending practices have led to accusations of a “new colonialism,” and in the wake of the economic slowdowns caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, African countries have increasingly called for debt relief. China has so far been silent to these requests, raising the question of whether the United States and other responsible donors will be left footing the bill. While China has publicized its humanitarian public health efforts in Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic, many Africans are skeptical, and have expressed concern that the equipment donated by China may be of poor quality. American taxpayers are the dominant stakeholders of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the top contributors to the World Bank. Both organizations offer loans to developing countries. The United States is also the top source of funding for the United Nations. It also provides other forms of assistance through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Department of State, among other federal entities. Nevertheless, China’s diplomatic attention and resources devoted to Africa exceed that of the United States, some witnesses noted during the hearing. China is Africa’s largest trading partner, with the trade mainly concentrated on the continent’s oil- and mineral-rich countries. In Africa, China is robbing “an emerging generation of young people of the birthright of their natural resources,” Christopher Maloney, the acting administrator for Africa at USAID, wrote in his testimony. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Chinese communist party has also reportedly engaged in racist practices against foreigners of African descent accused of spreading the virus, allegedly including Americans. U.S.-China commission chief Andreas Borgeas declared in his opening remarks: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic presents new challenges for China-Africa relations and may alter China’s relationships and image on the continent. In recent weeks, African leaders have spoken out against China in unusually frank terms for its reported mistreatment of Africans living in China, including actions forcing evictions of some Africans living in Chinese hotels and preventing Africans from entering restaurants and shops—actions ostensibly taken to stop the spread of the virus. African leaders have also called for Chinese debt relief in light of the global economic slowdown caused by COVID-19. China has reacted by stressing themes of Sino-African solidarity, and has used the pandemic as an opportunity to enhance its image through relief efforts and public diplomacy. The ultimate success of this campaign remains to be seen, but it is clear that China cannot afford to allow COVID-19 to damage the reputation it has spent so long building in Africa and risk jeopardizing its economic investments on the continent as a result. “Coronavirus may slow down or even disrupt” China’s efforts to become a global power through growing military engagements in Africa and the BRI, former Amb. David Shinn, who is now an adjunct professor at George Washington University, noted in his written testimony. In 2000, Congress reportedly established the U.S.-China body “to monitor, investigate, and submit to Congress an annual report on the national security implications of the bilateral trade and economic relationship between the United States and the People’s Republic of China” and provide recommendations for legislative action where appropriate. Communist China is using its financial clout in Africa to promote its model of governance that promotes corruption, a lack of human rights, increased authoritarianism, and undercuts America’s pro-democracy efforts, some of the witnesses said, echoing other assessments.

Hillary Clinton (D) on Friday issued a sterling stamp of approval to Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), who ordered vote-by-mail in California for November’s election, expressing hopes that governors around the country follow his lead. “I hope other governors around the country follow @GavinNewsom’s lead,” Clinton said on Friday. “No voter should be forced to choose between their safety and exercising their civic duty this fall”: I hope other governors around the country follow @GavinNewsom’s lead. No voter should be forced to choose between their safety and exercising their civic duty this fall. https://t.co/kNkSQ5quw8 — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) May 8, 2020  On Friday, Newsom signed an executive order allowing all registered voters in the Golden State to receive a mail-in ballot for the general election in November, appealing to the fears around the Chinese coronavirus. “I signed an executive order that will allow every registered voter in California to receive a mail-in ballot,” the governor said. “That mail-in ballot is important, but it’s not an exclusive substitute to physical locations.” “People that are otherwise not familiar with mail-in ballots, are uncomfortable with them, may have disabilities, may have other issues that may preclude that as an appropriate option, we still want to have the appropriate number of physical sites for people to vote as well,” Newsom added. He said: There’s a lot of concern and excitement around this November’s election in terms of making sure that you can conduct yourself in a safe way and to make sure your health is protected and to make sure we are reaching out to all registered, eligible voters. And giving them the opportunity, giving them the choice not to feel like they have to go into a concentrated, dense environment where their health may be at risk but provide an additional asset and additional resources by way of voting by mail. Newsom’s decision comes as Democrat Party leaders increase their attempts to seize on the fear and uncertainty caused by the coronavirus to pass party agenda items. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) wasted no time in attempting to advance her party’s longterm goal of instituting vote-by-mail — which GOP critics say invites a host of voter fraud issues — packing a Democrat-penned coronavirus package with progressive agenda items such as ballot harvesting and vote-by-mail in March. Several Democrats have used Wisconsin, which held its in-person primary in the wake of the pandemic, as a pitch for pushing vote-by mail. However, the results do not appear to justify their calls, as just 52 of 400,000 individuals who either worked at the polls or showed up to vote later tested positive for the virus. Additionally, it remains unclear if those individuals contracted the virus as a result of Election Day activities, as several of them “also reported other ways they may have been exposed to the virus,” according to the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. “At best, then, the infection rate amounts to approximately 0.013% of those who voted in person with a 0.00% fatality rate,” as Breitbart News reported. Still, Democrat leaders, including Clinton and the Obamas, have upped their calls for vote-by-mail. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said during a Friday appearance on MSNBC’s All In that vote-by-mail provisions “will be a very important part of the legislation that [they are] going to put forward” and added that they are “going to fight like the devil for it.” Clinton has been clamoring for vote-by-mail since the start of the crisis, touting election reforms offered by her former campaign attorney Marc Elias, who has proposed mail-in voting, curbside voting, and ballot harvesting. The Trump campaign slammed Newsom’s executive order on Friday. “This is a thinly-veiled political tactic by Gov. Newsom to undermine election security,” Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh said in part. “There’s a vast difference between people voting absentee by mail because they can’t be at the poll on Election Day versus mailing everyone a ballot – even those who didn’t request one – is a wide open opportunity for fraud,” he added. The Republican National Committee (RNC) recently launched a digital platform called “Protect the Vote” as a response to the “Democrats’ assault on the integrity of our elections” and their effort to “use coronavirus and the courts to legalize ballot harvesting, implement a nationwide mail-in ballot system, and eliminate nearly every safeguard in our elections”: Democrats have a radical plan to change our elections.  *Remove election safeguards *Eliminate signature verification*Increase risk of voter fraud  We are fighting back.

A significant group of cardinals, bishops, and Catholic leaders have signed a declaration denouncing unjustified government coercion of citizens over coronavirus. Under the “pretext” of the Covid-19 epidemic, “the inalienable rights of citizens have in many cases been violated and their fundamental freedoms, including the exercise of freedom of worship, expression and movement, have been disproportionately and unjustifiably restricted,” states the text, which bears the signatures of three cardinals, nine bishops, seven priests and theologians, 20 journalists and writers, ten medical doctors, 16 lawyers and judges, 28 university professors and intellectuals, and 14 associations. “Public health must not and cannot become an alibi for infringing on the rights of millions of people around the world, let alone for depriving the civil authority of its duty to act wisely for the common good,” the document warns. “This is particularly true as growing doubts emerge from several quarters about the actual contagiousness, danger and resistance of the virus,” the text continues. “Many authoritative voices in the world of science and medicine confirm that the alarmism about Covid-19 by the media appears to be absolutely unjustified.” Not only has the reaction to the pandemic been overblown and wrongheaded, the authors assert, it also conceals murky motivations other than the health of citizens. “We have reason to believe, on the basis of official data on the incidence of the epidemic as related to the number of deaths, that there are powers interested in creating panic among the world’s population with the sole aim of permanently imposing unacceptable forms of restriction on freedoms, of controlling people and of tracking their movements,” they claim. “The imposition of these illiberal measures is a disturbing prelude to the realization of a World Government beyond all control,” they warn. The leaders agree with a growing number of observers that the negative effects of lockdowns on public health and well-being will far outweigh the destruction wrought by the virus itself. The demolition of entire sectors of the economy “encourages interference by foreign powers and has serious social and political repercussions,” the authors note. “These forms of social engineering must be stopped by those with governmental responsibility, by taking measures to protect their citizens, whom they represent and in whose interests they have a serious obligation to act.” The criminalization of personal and social relationships must also be judged as “an unacceptable part of the plan of those who advocate isolating individuals in order to better manipulate and control them,” the text proposes. The document warns against the dangers of new forms of surveillance being adopted to monitor the movements of citizens under the guise of better ensuring public health. “Forms of control over people, whether through tracking systems or any other form of location-finding” must be “rigorously avoided,” the text reads, and the fight against the coronavirus “must not be the pretext for supporting the hidden intentions of supranational bodies that have very strong commercial and political interests in this plan.” In particular, the authors continue, “citizens must be given the opportunity to refuse these restrictions on personal freedom, without any penalty whatsoever being imposed on those who do not wish to use vaccines, contact tracking or any other similar tool.” The authors also decry the tendency to hand political responsibility over to so-called “experts,” who can claim a kind of immunity from prosecution, a phenomenon the authors find “disturbing.” Among the many phenomena the authors criticize, they underscore a tendency by those in the media to penalize dissent from the accepted narrative by resorting to forms of censorship, which “is happening widely on social media, in the press and on television.” “Providing accurate information requires that room be given to voices that are not aligned with a single way of thinking,” they observe. “This allows citizens to consciously assess the facts, without being heavily influenced by partisan interventions.” “A democratic and honest debate is the best antidote to the risk of imposing subtle forms of dictatorship, presumably worse than those our society has seen rise and fall in the recent past,” they insist. As a final note, the Catholic leaders assert the Church’s autonomy in its own realm, insisting that the State “has no right to interfere, for any reason whatsoever, in the sovereignty of the Church.” Ecclesiastical collaboration with the State “does not authorize civil authorities to impose any sort of ban or restriction on public worship or the exercise of priestly ministry.” “Let us not allow centuries of Christian civilization to be erased under the pretext of a virus, and an odious technological tyranny to be established in which nameless and faceless people can decide the fate of the world by confining us to a virtual reality,” they conclude.

During a recent interview on the Joe Rogan Experience, Tesla CEO Elon Musk called recent Wuhan coronavirus shelter-in-place orders “unconstitutional” just days after reports appeared implying that Tesla’s Fremont plant may begin production again soon in violation of lockdown orders. In an appearance on episode number 1,470 of the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, Tesla CEO Elon Musk discussed a number of topics including the recent Wuhan coronavirus shelter-in-place orders which he believes are “unconstitutional.” Musk stated during the interview that some of the restrictions violate freedom of assembly and that Americans should be concerned about the “massive infringement” on civil liberties. Musk stated that people fought and died for freedom and democracy and that “we should treasure that and not give up our liberties too easily. I think we probably did that.”  During the interview, Musk claimed that he knew people that had been infected by the Wuhan coronavirus but none that had died, and advised that “proper hygiene is a good thing, no matter what,” and that sick children should avoid the elderly regardless of their illness. Musk stated: “My opinion is, if somebody wants to stay home, they should stay home, and if somebody does not want to stay home, they should not be compelled to stay home. That’s my opinion. And if somebody doesn’t like that, well, that’s my opinion.” Breitbart News reported this week that a source recently told the San Francisco Chronicle that Tesla is preparing to restart car production at its factory in Fremont, California, potentially violating local and state shelter-in-place orders. Workers reportedly returned to the Fremont plant on Wednesday to prepare for a reopening of some production lines between now and next week, a source familiar with factory operations told the SF Chronicle. The source stated that a handful of employees returned to the factory floor to prepare and that additional safety measures have been put in place to guard against Wuhan coronavirus transmission. A spokesperson for the Fremont Police Department stated that there were no plans to visit the factor when informed by the SF Chronicle of reports of the partial return to work. Department spokesperson Geneva Bosques stated: “We’re all sort of in a little bit of a gray area,” referring to Governor Gavin Newsom’s announcement this week that some retail, manufacturing, and logistics businesses would be allowed to operate on a limited basis if safety measures were put in place and local authorities approve. Breitbart News reported last month that Musk attacked government lockdowns as “fascist” during a rant on the firm’s Q1 2020 earnings call. Musk called lockdown orders “forcibly imprisoning people in their homes against all their constitutional rights.” Musk stated that he was concerned about not being able to resume operations at Tesla’s factory in Fremont, California, stating that the possibility of not resuming production should be considered “a serious risk,” given that Tesla produces most of its cars there in addition to its production factory in Shanghai. Musk attempted to continue operations at the Fremont facility but was ordered to close by the Alameda county Sherrif. Musk recently spoke out about government restrictions on Twitter but during Wednesday’s earnings call encouraged government officials to invest in infrastructure while praising China for having “much better” infrastructure than the United States. “This is the time to think about the future, and also to ask, is it right to infringe upon people’s rights as what is happening right now?” Musk said. “I think the people are going to be very angry about this and are very angry. It’s like somebody should be, if somebody wants to stay in the house that’s great, they should be allowed to stay in the house and they should not be compelled to leave. But to say that they cannot leave their house, and they will be arrested if they do, this is fascist. This is not democratic. This is not freedom. Give people back their goddamn freedom.” Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

A 77-year-old Michigan barber said he won’t stop working “unless he is tasered by the police or Jesus Christ himself walks in” and will continue defying Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s executive orders. Karl Manke, owner of Karl Manke’s Barber & Beauty Shop in Owosso, has remained open despite the stay-at-home order. Manke told ABC 12 he reopened after unemployment benefits were denied three times. He has been cited for violating the shutdown order, and supporters have stepped up to pay the fines. On Friday, state police showed up with an order from Whitmer’s administration to close. “Today Michigan Department of Health and Human Services Director Robert Gordon acted under the authority granted to him by state law to issue an order that is necessary to correct conditions that pose an imminent threat to the health or lives of people in Michigan,” the department said in a statement to NBC 25. “The order requires Karl Manke’s Barbershop in Shiawassee County, which overtly defied Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s order, to immediately close to the public.” Despite the legal threats, Manke vowed to stay open as long as he can. “Whatever way it is, they’re going to have to drag me kicking and screaming out of this building,” he told ABC 12. “If the barbershop does not comply with the order, the state will ask a judge in Shiawassee Circuit Court to issue a temporary restraining order,” the department said. “If such an order is issued and the barbershop owner fails to comply, he can be held in contempt of court.” Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel also weighed in: Mr. Manke was given every opportunity to voluntarily comply with the Governor’s Executive Order and the order of the Michigan Department of Health & Human Services Director. As a result of his continued operation, today his business was deemed an imminent danger to the public health and ordered to be shut down by the DHHS Director. If he refuses, the Department of Attorney General will request an order from the Shiawassee County Circuit Court on Monday to close his business. Mr. Manke’s actions are not a display of harmless civil disobedience. His actions are counterproductive to the collective effort businesses and communities everywhere have made to slow the spread of COVID-19, and by opening the doors to his business, he’s putting the lives of many more Michiganders at risk. “I just couldn’t live with myself if I didn’t do that,” Manke told radio host Steve Gruber about continuing to work. “I don’t care really if I have to spend all of the money I’m making right now to pay my fine, it’s worth it,” he said. He said he will only leave “if they drag me out in the street or Jesus comes.” Manke said he has fielded calls from other barbers about what to do. “You have to have courage,” he said. Manke’s attorney, Bill Amadeo, told The Argus-Press that his client would be seeking a jury trial.
 Amadeo said Manke would be pleading “not guilty” during a June 6th court hearing. Kyle Olson is a reporter for Breitbart News. He is also the host of “The Kyle Olson Show,” found on Michigan radio stations on Saturdays. Follow him on Twitter and like him on Facebook.

Robot dogs named “Spot” have reportedly been dispatched to parks in Singapore to remind citizens of safe social distancing measures. The Straits Times reports that four-legged robot dogs will be patrolling Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park in Singapore from Friday, May 8, to remind citizens of safe social distancing measures. The robots, named Spot, will reportedly be patrolling gardens and nature reserves managed by National Parks Board and at parks managed by Singapore town councils. Coronavirus in Singapore — A four-legged robot called Spot will be patrolling at parks, gardens, and nature reserves to remind people of safe distancing measures, starting at Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park from May 8Via @STcom pic.twitter.com/tFE6fdKwVr — Alfons López Tena (@alfonslopeztena) May 8, 2020  The robot patrol is part of a pilot trial being jointly conducted by NParks and the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (SNDGG). The Spot robot will be broadcasting a recorded message to park visitors reminding them to observe safe social distancing measures. The robot is fitted with cameras, enabled by GoveTech-developed video analytics, that will help to estimate the number of visitors at the parks. The firm claims that the cameras will not be tracking park goers or be capable of recognizing specific individuals and will not collect personal data. The Spot robot will be deployed over a two-mile stretch in the River Plains section of the Bishan-Ang Mo Kio park during off-peak hours over the course of two weeks and will be accompanied by at least one NParks officer. The robot was originally developed by the American firm Boston Dynamics and is capable of navigating obstacles more effectively compared to wheeled robots. Breitbart News has reported on these robots before, a video of one in action can be found here.  Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

Nearly three-fourths of U.S. adults say China bears responsibility for American coronavirus deaths, a Morning Consult tracker poll released Friday revealed. Morning Consult’s latest tracker survey, polling 2,200 U.S. adults across the country, found that the majority, 73 percent, at least partially hold China responsible for American coronavirus deaths. The consensus held steady along partisan lines, with 80 percent of Republicans and 71 percent of Democrats stating the belief that China is “‘somewhat’ or ‘very’ responsible for the current death toll in the U.S. from the COVID-19 pandemic.” “Of the 12 groups and organizations listed in the survey, China is the most blamed entity among Republicans, and the fourth most among Democrats,” the survey found. Seventy-three percent of U.S. adults surveyed also laid responsibility at the feet of “Americans who didn’t socially distance,” with Democrats outpacing Republican in the blame 84 percent to 67 percent. Additionally, the survey found that 66 percent blame Americans who travelled internationally and 58 percent blame immigrants who travelled to the U.S. after the outbreak started. Fifty-six percent placed blame on the World Health Organization (W.H.O.), and 60 percent on the governments of other countries. Sixty-two percent said the federal government bears some responsibility, 55 percent said the same of state governments, and 49 percent said local governments. Fifty-nine percent said the Trump administration bears responsibility — a finding with sharp differences along party lines, with 81 percent for Democrats and 37 percent for Republicans.  Slightly over a quarter of those surveyed, 27 percent, said doctors and medical professionals bear responsibility. The survey also found: Furthermore, a message test shows that Americans are more likely to say China gave the United States insufficient warning about the outbreak than they are to say the United States squandered time after China first alerted the global community. Asked which statement is most correct, 26 percent selected “The Chinese government gave the U.S. plenty of warning about the pandemic, but the U.S. did not use that time to better prepare for the pandemic,” while more than twice as many (56 percent) selected “The Chinese government did not give the U.S. enough warning about the pandemic, so the U.S. could not better prepare for the pandemic.” While conservative leaders have urged President Trump to hold China accountable, the president said last month that his administration is conducting “serious investigations” to hold the communist country accountable for the spread of the virus. “There are a lot of ways you can hold them accountable. We’re doing very serious investigations, as you probably know. And we are not happy with China,” Trump said. “We are not happy with that whole situation, because we believe it could have been stopped at the source. It could have been stopped quickly, and it wouldn’t have spread all over the world,” he continued. “And we think that should have happened.” “So we’ll let you know at the appropriate time, but we are doing serious investigations,” Trump added.

Rep. Gregory Murphy (R-NC), who is also a physician, said on Friday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow that “draconian” lockdown measures in many areas across the nation are no longer necessary and may even be harmful.  In his state, for example, where a lockdown order has been in place since March 27, Democrat Gov. Roy Cooper has yet to loosen the government’s grip on the population. “Restrictions should be lifted, and, unfortunately, they’re not,” Murphy said. “That’s causing a lot of just downright despair across the state, and, I believe, unnecessarily.” Marlow asked Murphy about the goal of the stay-at-home agenda, which at first seemed to be to “flatten the curve,” but that even though the curve has been flattened, the goal has morphed. Murphy said flattening the curve was the right goal not only to save lives, but, moreover, to allow the medical establishment to get ready for a potential surge of coronavirus patients. “We’ve accomplished that goal, and we stand ready to get a surge that I pray, and I don’t think, is going to happen,” Murphy said. “But now, it’s turned into what I believe is more of a control freak kind of thing,” Murphy said. “They want to manipulate and make sure that they are in control with every step of this process and the data. The objective science does not warrant that.” Marlow also noted that the divide between those who want to open up their states and those who want to continue lockdowns has turned into a political issue, with conservatives wanting to loosen restriction and Democrats in favor of more government control. “I did not want this to turn political,” Murphy said.”Unfortunately, I believe the Democrats have made it political, which is just nonsense. I actually believed that this would be a great thing to bring our country together rather than tear it apart.” Murphy used his state as an example of how more rural parts of the United States with low cases of the coronavirus can start getting back to normal. Approximately 87 percent of people who died from the virus in North Carolina were 65 or older with comorbid diseases — or underlying conditions such as heart disease or diabetes — and 58 percent of those people who died were in nursing homes. “And we know people who are in nursing homes are very sick or they wouldn’t be there,” Murphy said. “Half of the individuals who go to nursing homes die in the first six months.” “But scaring the rest of the 99 plus percent of the population who are younger and healthier into thinking that if they walk out onto the sidewalk, they’re going to die is just wrong,” Murphy said. “It’s morally wrong, I believe.” Murphy also addressed the issue of some governors saying it will not be safe to reopen until a vaccine is found. He explained that the virus will be around until enough people get it and beat it and develop antibodies that make them immune, meaning the population gains “herd immunity.” “It’s going to be a while until we have a vaccine — if we have a vaccine. Nothing is guaranteed on this,” Murphy said. Murphy also noted that he does not believe there have been any successful vaccines for other coronavirus, including the common cold. “Instead of running from it, I think we should learn to live with it,” he said. What that looks like to Murphy is allowing small businesses to operate with safeguards in place, including hair and nail salons — use masks, stagger appointments, and routinely sanitize surroundings and equipment. Murphy said small businesses “have every reason to make sure their clients and their customers are protected, or they will go out of business.” People “desperately want to go back to work,” Murphy said. “There is no reason we can’t get those places back to work.” Speaking as a lawmaker, Murphy said he would rather get Americans back to work than have the government dole out more money. “I’m going to have a hard time voting for more money to be printed by the Treasury to give out to people when we should actually be going back to work and generating the income organically,” Murphy said.

Afghanistan’s government has freed 933 Taliban prisoners since the terrorists agreed to a peace deal with the U.S. in February, Pakistani newspaper Dawn reported on Friday. The jihadis were released as part of an ongoing prisoner-exchange program that came about after the United States and the Taliban signed a peace deal on February 29. The agreement stipulates that the U.S. will gradually withdraw from Afghanistan if the jihadis provide certain security assurances, but requires communication from both sides in the form of peace talks. An exchange of prisoners was devised as a way to build trust between the two sides — the U.S.-backed Afghan government and the Taliban — in the hope of starting the peace talks. The U.S. participated in the deal because the Taliban does not recognize the official government of Afghanistan as legitimate. Instead, it considers itself the only true government ruling Afghanistan. “So far, 933 Taliban detainees have been released from Afghan jails,” Javed Faisal, spokesman for Afghanistan’s National Security Council, said on Thursday, Dawn reports. “In return, the Taliban have released 132 Kabul [government] administration prisoners,” Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said. Under the conditions of the prisoner swap, the Afghan government will eventually release 5,000 Taliban jihadis and the terrorists will free 1,000 members of Afghanistan’s security forces, according to the report. A March 10 date was originally proposed as the deadline for the prisoner exchange, but the jihadis have repeatedly refused to cooperate with the peace deal, demanding extra concessions and stalling progress. According to the Afghan government, the Taliban have asked for 15 of their “top commanders” to be freed, which was not part of the deal, as Dawn reports. The Taliban has also pressured the government to release jihadis early claiming they are worried the prisoners may contract the coronavirus in Afghan prisons, according to the report. So far, Afghan government officials claim they have only released “low-risk” Taliban prisoners who have “vowed to abstain from fighting,” Dawn reports. According to the report, the U.S. has encouraged both sides to complete the prisoner swap as soon as possible so that peace talks may begin. The talks are necessary to facilitate America’s withdrawal from Afghanistan. Afghan officials have reported a “surge in violence” from jihadis across the country recently, hindering efforts to start peace talks between the two sides, according to the newspaper. The February peace pact called for the terrorists not to target members of the U.S.-led coalition, but Afghan soldiers were not given a promise of protection. On April 8, Afghanistan released 100 Taliban jihadis as a gesture of goodwill and to jumpstart peace talks, after the Taliban halted planned peace talks days earlier.

Data released from the California Departments of Health and Social Services on Friday show that nursing home deaths represent almost half of the coronavirus fatalities in the state. The San Francisco Chronicle reported on the development: There were at least 11,344 confirmed cases among staff and residents at California’s skilled nursing facilities and residential care facilities for elderly as of Thursday, according to state data. These cases account for 18.1 percent of the state’s total 62,512 cases. Meanwhile, 1,276 staff and residents at such facilities have died of the disease, making up 49.4 percent of the state’s 2,585 deaths as of Thursday. Given those numbers — which the state said are “provisional” — an alarming 11.2 percent of people infected with the coronavirus at a nursing home has died. The information confirms that elderly people with underlying health conditions — the demographic in nursing homes — and the workers who care for them represent the most vulnerable population during the coronavirus outbreak. “All data in this chart is provided to offer a snapshot of COVID-19 in skilled nursing facilities in California and does not imply wrongdoing on the part of the facility,” state officials said. Michael Connors of the California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform said in the Chronicle report that he thinks the death toll is higher than the reported numbers, calling the number of reported deaths “horrific.” “COVID-19 is like a viral wildfire in nursing homes,” Connors said. “It’s way past time for all public health authorities in California to start treating it that way.” Follow Penny Starr on Twitter.

Mexican health officials admitted to surpassing 3,100 COVID-19 related-deaths as cases continue to rise nationwide. The reports come despite repeated accusations of the government downplaying the true scope of the coronavirus pandemic. The most recent statistics released by Mexico’s Undersecretary of Health Hugo Lopez Gatell point to a total of 3,160 fatalities, 31,522 confirmed cases, and 20,571 suspicious cases undergoing testing. Mexico’s federal government has only accounted for 123,446 tests during the pandemic — a figure that is exponentially lower than most other countries facing the coronavirus crisis. Al 08 de mayo de 2020 hay 31,522 casos confirmados, 8,048 confirmados activos y 20,571 sospechosos por #COVID19. Se han registrado 71,351 negativos, 3,160 defunciones confirmadas, 254 defunciones sospechosas y fueron estudiadas 123,446 personas. 1/3 pic.twitter.com/eCM8oo0yiA — Hugo López-Gatell Ramírez (@HLGatell) May 9, 2020  In previous conferences, Lopez Gatell claimed that the low number of tests is part of an epidemiology model called Sentinel where confirmed cases were multiplied by population-based factors to reach an estimate of the real number of cases. The health official said that his model would account for asymptomatic individuals and those whose symptoms are not serious enough to require hospitalization. However, as Breitbart Texas reported, once the estimated number of cases surpassed 55,000 in early April and the figures were doubling on a weekly basis, Lopez Gatell stopped releasing the reports. Breitbart Texas reported that Lopez Gatell admitted that the figures released on a nightly basis are only from government hospitals and do not include the cases from private hospitals. Due to the discrepancies in the stats and claiming Lopez Gatell has been downplaying the cases, several states began releasing their own statistics that include figures from both government and private hospitals. Those statistics in some states show twice as many cases as the numbers acknowledged by Lopez Gatell. On Friday, multiple U.S. outlets released scathing reports on Mexican federal health officials undercounting the number of deaths in Mexico City. During his nightly news conference, Lopez Gatell said he welcomed the debate and dismissed the reports claiming that most of the criticism was politically motivated.

LONDON (AP) – From resounding applause to ostracization and isolation. That’s essentially the journey Lieutenant Commander. Robert Embleton, who served 34 years in Britain’s Royal Navy, took by ambulance when discharged from Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, southwestern England, on April 8th following his near-month sickness with Covid-19. Arriving at his retirement home, he immediately went into self-isolation with his wife of 55 years, Jean, who has shown no symptoms of the virus. Soon after, Embleton realized he was carrying some new baggage – the stigma of the virus. He even considered buying a bell to warn of his presence. “I was regarded as a sort of leper, a plague carrier. Some people when they spotted me, they recoiled,” the 79-year-old told the Associated Press. “I was particularly regarded as a menace.” That’s some contrast to his final moments at Derriford Hospital, when the “somewhat embarrassed” Embleton received a round of applause from all the front-line staff from the cleaners to the doctors. Embleton, who received an MBE honour from Queen Elizabeth II in 1993 for outstanding service to the Royal Navy, thinks the lockdown rules are too strict for some elderly people. He understands the need to shield those elderly with underlying health conditions, but says others should be treated with much more “common sense.” Queen Elizabeth Honours War Dead: 'They Died So We Could Live as Free People' https://t.co/hH73VvSzbU — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 9, 2020  The prospect of this type of stigmatization was something he had discussed in Derriford with the 57-year-old Poorna Gunasekera when they were in a ward together recovering from the virus. Gunasekera, who unbeknownst to Embleton was a doctor and had been treated by three of his former students, thanks the former naval officer for “single-handedly” lifting his spirits. The fact that Embleton had visited Gunasekera’s hometown of Kandy, Sri Lanka, forged a connection, and the two have reconnected on Facebook since their brushes with death. “I’ve always been a morale officer,” Embleton explains. Gunasekera remembers that all four in the ward shared the same anxiety — of becoming fresh sources of outbreaks after leaving the hospital. “It is a dreadful fear and we expected to be somewhat stigmatized, and that would be normal because I suppose I would do the same if the roles were reversed,” he said. Time is a great healer and the stigma slowly abates. On a gloriously sunny early spring Sunday afternoon, there was a breakthrough. As is his wont for a traditional Sunday lunch, Embleton decided to open one of his finest bottles of wine — a Châteauneuf-du-Pape — and offered a glass to the lady next door, who is also 79. “Then, blinking in the sunshine, all along the top floor, the others came out with their glasses filled and gave all a wave and a smile,” he said. “Cheer and optimism.” British charities for the elderly, like Age UK, have heard similar tales and hope that a ramped-up testing program will provide some reassurance. “It just adds another layer of tragedy to the situation that residents who recover – something that should be celebrated as a much-needed piece of good news – are feeling isolated and ostracized as a result,” said Ruthe Isden, head of health influencing at Age UK. The ostracization may now have gone, but the isolation may be in its infancy, especially if social distancing restrictions on the elderly remain in place for longer, until a vaccine is, if ever, produced. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has also recovered from Covid-19, is set to extend the lockdown restrictions on Sunday, bar a couple of minor tweaks. Embleton says the lockdown is “sapping the equanimity and self-confidence” of most elderly people and is “increasingly intolerable” for those like him who have no underlying health conditions and who are hugely active members of their local communities. “It is not right to treat all old people as children, incapable of assessing risk,” he said. Luckily, both he and Jean have the upheavals and separation of the naval years to help them get through the weeks and months ahead. Embleton said the isolation reminds him of the time he spent aboard the HMS Galatea, a Leander-class frigate, near the Arctic Circle, during the Cod War of 1976 – confrontations between Britain and Iceland over North Atlantic fishing rights. “Doing things like a best part of the year in the Arctic, just you and your ship, it’s rather like being in the over-70s lockdown for Covid-19,” he said. “You start thinking differently, you’ve got to get on with it, you won´t be going home, you won´t be seeing your family.” The same applies for Jean, who endured her husband’s brush with death in self-isolation at home. “It’s not pleasant but as a serviceman’s wife, particularly a naval wife, then you get used to these periods of time that you are on your own so I probably weathered it rather better than some people,” she said. “I was brought up to think that husbands went away and that they came back.” Well, Lt. Cmdr. Robert Embleton did come back and he’s planning a lot more long walks, gym workouts, and drinking fine wines. And hopefully before he turns 80 in November.

Michigan state Rep. Steve Johnson is calling on Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to investigate a fake line of patients waiting to be tested for coronavirus in a CBS News report.

Rapidly developing: https://t.co/bHSWdGLNO8#ExposeCBS pic.twitter.com/CP3q75x5Fj — James O'Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) May 8, 2020  Writing May 8, Johnson said, “I am calling on you today to instruct the necessary agencies in the State of Michigan to open a formal investigation into the incident that took place at Cherry Health.” On Wednesday, Project Veritas published a report claiming CBS News and Cherry Health had staged a fake line of cars to appear as though there were demand for coronavirus testing. BREAKING: Insider Reveals @CherryHealthMI & @CBSNews Staged FAKE #COVID19 Testing Line on @CBSThisMorning “We knew they(CBS) were coming, had no clue we were going to have to like do FAKE PATIENTS” – RN, Cherry Health "There were real patients which made it worse"#ExposeCBS pic.twitter.com/tA4LoS7P22 — James O'Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) May 6, 2020  “Apparently the news crew wanted more people in the line because they knew it was scheduled,” an individual identified as Nick Ross said in the Project Veritas report. “We knew they were coming,” an unnamed registered nurse said in the video. “We had no clue that we were going to have to, like, do fake patients.” In the Project Veritas undercover video, staffers said they “pretended” to test patients for the CBS crew to film. The news outlet denied any knowledge of the false report, instead pointing the finger at Cherry Health. Tasha Blackman, CEO of the organization, denied any knowledge either. “Though the Project Veritas report claims the CBS video showing a line of cars was staged; to my knowledge CBS This Morning did not stage any part of their visit, and I did not instruct any of our staff to get in their cars as part of the line of vehicles,” she said, WWMT reported. An employee of Cherry Health told Breitbart News employees were encouraged to watch the CBS News report when it aired. “Cherry Health is a taxpayer funded entity,” Johnson noted in his letter, “and as such should receive proper oversight. “This has only amplified the growing negative national attention Michigan has received.” Johnson ended, “I demand you take immediate and decisive action and prevent such behavior from happening again.” Kyle Olson is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Jeff Haste, Pennsylvania’s Dauphin County Board chairman, slammed Gov. Tom Wolf (D) in a letter on Friday for keeping a bulk of businesses closed, particularly in his county, and bluntly called on Wolf to “return our state to the people (as prescribed by our Constitution) and not run it as a dictatorship.” Twenty-four counties — Bradford, Cameron, Centre, Clarion, Clearfield, Clinton, Crawford, Elk, Erie, Forest, Jefferson, Lawrence, Lycoming, McKean, Mercer, Montour, Northumberland, Potter, Snyder, Sullivan, Tioga, Union, Venango, and Warren — moved to the “yellow” phase of reopening on Friday. The “yellow” phase, while still restrictive, allows limited nonessential retail operations but keeps a restaurant’s dine-in services, as well as salons and fitness centers, closed. While the state closed to “minimize the 54,238 positive cases, more than 1,793,200 Pennsylvanians have lost their jobs,” Haste wrote in the letter. “This decision has ruined the livelihood of millions of hard-working Pennsylvanians in exchange for 0.4 percent of our population,” he continued. He expressed “great sympathy for those who have lost loved ones to COVID-19” but added that he holds “great concern for the families that now have to struggle with financial concerns, mental health stress, addiction and more because of the shutdown.” “Again, our governor has pitted groups of Pennsylvanians against one another,” he continued. “For centuries, our people and businesses have shown they can adapt to changes to survive and prosper,” he said. “They cannot, however, do a thing when a dictator and an unelected secretary place them in lockdown.” He continued: I trust and have faith in the great people and businesses of Pennsylvania to operate in a manner that protects those of our population in harm’s way and allows our residents to go back to work, enjoy their communities, and have a quality of life. I, however, have no faith in Gov. Wolf and Secretary Levine’s ability to do the right thing, “Open the state and return our Commonwealth to the people,” he added. “Enough is enough.” Wolf on Friday said 13 additional counties will be able to move to the “yellow” phase of reopening next week, but Dauphin County was not included. Similarly, Pennsylvania’s Beaver County Commissioner Chairman Dan Camp ripped the governor on Friday for refusing to allow the county to move into the next phase of reopening alongside its neighboring counties. “The governor’s double-talk means that Beaver County finds itself singled-out as the only Western Pennsylvania county in his administration’s red category, surrounded by a sea of yellow counties,” he said on Friday. “Our business owners and residents cannot become prisoners of our county because of this unwarranted double-talk,” he continued, stating that the Board of Commissioners will “stand behind our District Attorney in his decision not to prosecute any case against a business that chooses to open following the mandated guidelines as laid out in the yellow phase of reopening PA.” Wolf’s stay-at-home order, which extends to counties that remain in the “red” phase, has been extended to June 4.

Kenya’s regional governors are calling on national authorities to close the country’s borders as illegal migration from surrounding countries has caused an increase in imported coronavirus cases, Kenyan newspaper the Nation reported on Thursday. According to Kenya’s Council of Governors (CoG), the illegal entry into Kenya of people from Tanzania, Uganda, and Somalia has led to a rise in coronavirus infections in border regions. Last week, across nine Kenyan counties that border other countries, 205 people were quarantined and 249 people were tested for coronavirus after crossing into the country illegally, according to the newspaper. At a regional leadership meeting in Machakos County on Wednesday, the CoG’s chairman urged Kenya’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs to address the illegal migration, the Nation reported. Governor Wycliffe Oparanya, from western Kenya’s Kakamega, requested the ministry design a “protocol for dealing with neighboring countries, that will only allow limited access, if any, in order to contain the disease [Chinese coronavirus].” “It is the responsibility of the national government because there are protocols on how to deal with foreign countries. We hope we can scale up the issue with the National Coordinating Committee,” the governor added. Oparanya also pointed out that the cost of quarantining people in border counties is met by the county and the persons quarantined, suggesting the national government should contribute to the effort. In response, the national government announced Wednesday that it would begin paying for targeted coronavirus testing and quarantine services at “public facilities” starting this week, according to the report. The governor of Kajiado County, which shares 80 percent of its border with Tanzania, said that recent illegal border crossings into his county had “caused fear” for a subsequent spread of coronavirus, the Nation reports. “We want a complete shutdown [of the border with Tanzania] and for the national government to address the issue. The same goes for [Kenya’s borders with] Somalia and Uganda,” Governor Joseph ole Lenku demanded. In the central county of Isiolo, Governor Mohammed Kuti said local officials were worried that coronavirus lockdown restrictions had caused unforeseen health problems, such as a decrease in child vaccination, according to the report. Governor Kuti said women in Isiolo had stopped going to hospitals to give birth amid Kenya’s coronavirus lockdown causing a decrease in the number of babies being immunized. Additionally, higher incidents of child malnutrition have been recorded since the closure of schools cut off kids from their school lunches. “We cannot afford to go back from the miles made in maternal care due to the [Chinese coronavirus] pandemic,” Kuti warned. On Monday, the Nation reported that Kenyan Muslims have been sneaking over the country’s border into Somalia to pray in mosques still open there during Ramadan, Islam’s holiest month. As part of Kenya’s current coronavirus lockdown, mosques are closed. Kenyan government officials called for authorities to closely monitor the country’s border with Somalia for these illicit crossings, which have also been blamed for an increase in imported coronavirus cases. On April 6, Kenya’s President Uhuru Kenyatta announced a partial lockdown of the country to curb the spread of coronavirus, expanding on a nighttime curfew that started on March 27. At press time on Friday, Kenya had officially recorded 621 infections and 29 deaths from the Chinese coronavirus.

Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) detailed guidelines on Friday for the state to begin reopening next week under strict restrictions. Under Phase One, nonessential retail will be able to increase capacity to 50 percent, up from a ten-person limit. Churches will also be able to operate at a 50 percent capacity. Restaurants and bars will continue to offer takeout or delivery and will be able to operate outdoor seating at a 50 percent capacity — a decision the governor said officials made after engaging in a “tremendous amount of discussion with [their] restaurant owners.” “We have had tremendous amount of discussion with our restaurant owners. A lot of their input we have listened to and taken into account and collectively we have made that decision,” Northam said on Friday. Under Phase One, beaches will stay open for exercise and fishing only. Hair salons and barbershops will be permitted to reopen, but employees must wear masks, and customers must make appointments ahead of time. “The restrictions on business operations such as distancing and masks are meant to protect workers as much as customers,” the governor said, emphasizing that businesses that cannot meet those restrictions “must remain closed.” Fitness centers and entertainment venues will remain closed, although gyms are permitted to hold outside classes of less than ten: UNDER PHASE 1: -Retail allowed to open to 50 % of capacity -Restaurants and Bars STILL limited to only takeout UNLESS they have outdoor seating. Then they can do table service at 50% capacity -Gyms can have classes OUTSIDE -Churches allowed to operate 50% @WAVY_News pic.twitter.com/U77oPhkIS8 — Brett Hall (@BrettHNews) May 8, 2020  The state is slated to enter the first phase of reopening next week, on Friday, May 15. “In many ways it will look like what we’ve been doing,” Northam said. “While there are a few more places to go, everyone should still only go there as needed and otherwise stay home as much as possible.” Virginia had 22,342 confirmed cases of the virus and 812 related deaths as of Saturday morning, per the Virginia Department of Health.

President Donald Trump on Friday afternoon met with House Republicans at the White House during the coronavirus pandemic. “We’re at a position where we have to start all over again, and we will start all over again, and we will build something that was even better than we had before,” Trump said. The president, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), and several Republican members of Congress met in the State Dining Room of the White House on Friday afternoon, carefully spaced six feet apart. House Republicans praised Trump’s handling of the virus, noting that he was right to shift to reopening the country as quickly as possible. They also mocked Democrats for refusing to return to work in Washington, DC, as Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) delayed reopening the House of Representatives. “The Democrats are cowering at home right now. And it makes no sense because we’ve learned so much,” Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) said. Nunes pointed to the meatpackers and the grocery store employees that continued to go to work to keep the national food supply chain going. “If we expect them to go to work, we ought to go to work as members of Congress,” he said. He singled out House Intelligence Committee Chairmen Adam Schiff (D-CA) for mockery, noting that he acted so “aggrieved” despite getting caught for perpetrating the Russia “hoax.” “Shifty Schiff, nine inches around the neck,” Trump said. “And I watched this guy — uses the world’s smallest collar, right?” Trump also thanked Republicans for fighting against the Russia hoax, which resulted in the ultimate exoneration against Gen. Mike Flynn. He singled out Nunes for praise. “I have to say that Devin was incredible. He understood it. He understood that it was a hoax before anybody else knew what was happening,” Trump said. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) warned his fellow Republicans that despite their victory in the Russia probe, the Democrats would continue to attack the president. “We just need to understand, guys, that they’re never going to stop,” he said. Trump noted that he was working well with Democrat governors but that Democrats in Congress had no interest in unity to fight the coronavirus. “You can’t work with these people. I think they’re stone-cold crazy,” he said. Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY) expressed his sadness that Pelosi was using her power to attack Republicans and the president during the coronavirus crisis. “We’re all here in the same foxhole with you, with our rifles pointed in the same direction,” Zeldin said. “But unfortunately, while you recognize that the enemy is coronavirus, the speaker believes that the enemy is you.” Rep. Louis Gohmert (R-TX) mocked the media for criticizing Republicans for failing to wear masks at the meeting, reminding them that they had all been tested for the virus. “The only reason we would wear masks is if we were trying to protect ourselves from you, in the media,” he said to the reporters in the room. “And we’re not scared of you. So that’s why we can be here like this.”

ROME — Italy’s Catholic bishops’ conference (CEI) announced this week that an accord has been reached with the government for the re-initiation of public worship, with a series of restrictions. The “protocol” agreement was signed on Thursday at the presidential palace by Cardinal Gualtiero Bassetti, president of CEI, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, and Interior Minister Luciana Lamorgese. The Italian government has decreed that no one can attend Mass without wearing a face mask, which has become a public sign of compliance and submission to the state. Italian Law Professor Warns Lockdown Presents Serious Abuse of Authority https://t.co/XtFc9ocd5v — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 27, 2020  Quotas will be established regarding how many persons can attend services at one time while still maintaining mandated social distancing, depending on the floor space of each church. Guards will be posted at church entrances to facilitate access and exit and supervise so that the maximum occupancy is not exceeded. A poster will be affixed outside the church door indicating the maximum number of participants allowed in relation to the capacity of the building. Priests celebrating Mass will be required to wear gloves and a mask when distributing holy Communion, avoiding contact with the hands of the faithful. Whenever possible, entrance and exit doors will be kept open so that the faithful do not have to touch the handles. The protocol stipulates that church buildings will be sanitized before and after worship services. An organist may be present during services, but without a choir, and songbooks and other paper aids will not be made available. No offertory collection will be taken up during Mass, but special containers will be placed near the church entrance for those who would like to donate to the church upkeep. Holy Water fonts will remain empty and the greeting of peace will be suspended. The accord also allows for the resumption of the sacrament of confession, on the condition that it occur in a “large and well-ventilated” space, and that both priest and penitent wear face masks. Pope Francis Asks Why Catholics in Rome Have Pizza Delivery But No Eucharist https://t.co/uCYNnMBZmW — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 15, 2020  “The security measures outlined in the text express the contents and modalities best adapted to ensuring that the resumption of liturgical celebrations with the people happens in the safest way,” said Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte following the signing of the accord. “I thank the Italian bishops for the moral and material support that they’re giving to the entire nation in this difficult moment,” he said.

Pressure is increasing on Gov. Tom Wolf (D) to reopen Pennsylvania, even among Democrats, as it is revealed that the vast majority of recent coronavirus deaths in the state occurred at nursing homes or personal care facilities, the Morning Call revealed this week. Roughly 80 percent of the recently reported deaths in the state of Pennsylvania, 247 out of the 310 reported on Thursday, occurred at either a nursing home or personal care facility. “There is no excuse for what is going on, okay?” Chester County State Sen. Andrew Dinniman, a Democrat, stated, contending that the Department of Health has failed the most vulnerable — those in nursing homes. “A total of 3,416 coronavirus deaths has been reported statewide through Thursday. Of those, 2,355, or nearly 69 percent, were associated with nursing or personal care homes,” the outlet reported: In the Lehigh Valley, the state reported 177 deaths in such facilities, with 77 in Lehigh County and 100 in Northampton County. This week, the nursing homes operated by Lehigh and Northampton counties, Cedarbrook and Gracedale, both reported sharp increases in deaths. … Over the past seven days, about 76% of deaths added to the state’s total — 850 of the 1,124 newly reported deaths — were at personal care homes or nursing homes. The statewide death toll has risen to 3,616 as of Saturday morning as the majority of healthy, low-risk individuals remain under stringent lockdown orders. On Friday, Gov. Tom Wolf (D) announced 13 counties that will be allowed to move into the “yellow” phase of reopening next week — a phase that continues to come with a host of restrictions. Twenty-four Pennsylvania counties moved into that phase on Friday. However, some local leaders of counties in “red” phase states are outraged over the governor’s decision. Dan Camp, commissioner chairman of Pennsylvania’s Beaver County, said on Friday that the governor’s decision to keep the county in the “red” phase is  “unwarranted and irrational,” noting that the vast majority of the county’s coronavirus-related deaths stemmed from nursing homes. “It’s no secret that nearly 70 percent of our COVID-19 cases and more than 90 percent of Beaver County’s COVID-19 related deaths are attributed to one nursing home within the county,” he said, essentially corroborating the greater findings. On Wednesday, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center’s (UPMC) chief medical officer, Dr. Steven Shapiro, also called for the state to reopen, noting that in Pennsylvania, the median age of death from the virus is 84. “The few younger patients who died all had significant preexisting conditions. Very few children were infected and none died. Minorities in our communities fared equally as well as others, but we know that this is not the case nationally,” Shapiro said during a roundtable discussion with Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA). “In sum, this is a disease of the elderly, sick and poor,” he added. The news coincides with a recent analysis of a provisional data set published by the Centers for Disease Control’s National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), which found that the average age of Americans who have died as a result of the coronavirus between February 1 and May 2 is 75.

The media criticized President Donald Trump on Friday for not wearing a mask during an outdoor ceremony marking the 75th anniversary of the World War II victory in Europe. The wreath-laying ceremony took place outdoors on Friday at the World War II Memorial in Washington, DC, where seven World War II veterans joined the president and first lady. “Mr. President, you were with seven American heroes earlier today — these World War II veterans–all in their nineties,” ABC News White House correspondent Jon Karl said to President Trump at a White House meeting with Republicans. “Did you consider wearing a mask when you were with them, given they’re in a vulnerable [position].” The president noted that he was “very far away” from the veterans and was outside, where the wind was blowing. “The wind was blowing so hard in such a direction that if the plague ever reached them, I’d be very surprised,” Trump said, and added, “The wind was howling, and I didn’t see anybody with a mask.” President Trump and the first lady spoke with each veteran from a distance after the ceremony. “I would’ve loved to have gone up and hugged them because they’re great,” Trump said. “I had a conversation with everyone, but we were very far away.” In a press briefing that day, Karl also asked White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany why the president did not wear a mask at the ceremony, as one of his valets tested positive for the virus. “Did he give any consideration to wearing a mask, given that his valet just tested positive, and he’s with some of those in the most vulnerable population?” Karl asked. McEnany said President Trump was regularly tested for the virus and that the veterans chose to be at the ceremony at the outdoor World War II Memorial. “They made the choice to come here because they’ve chosen to put their nation first,” she said. “They wanted to be with their Commander-in-Chief on this momentous day. She added, “I can tell you that the President always puts the safety of our veterans first and of the American people first.”

A Chechen migrant was arrested in the commune of Montereau-Fault-Yonne after dragging a police officer 60 feet with his vehicle while trying to escape a Wuhan coronavirus lockdown checkpoint. The 30-year-old Chechen national was intercepted by police in the Montereau industrial area and asked for his ID and driving licence after being pulled over by officers. The man was unable to produce either document and was told by a policeman leaning through his window he would be going to the police station. Instead, the Chechen turned his ignition key and accelerated, with the police officer being dragged along for sixty-five feet and another officer on the scene narrowly missing being hit, Le Parisien reports. After hitting a mound of earth, the Chechen migrant attempted to escape on foot and entered a disused warehouse in the industrial area. Officers called for reinforcements who encircled the warehouse and eventually arrested the 30-year-old. Following his arrest, the Chechen claimed he did not live in the area and was visiting family members. He is now under investigation for violence against a police officer, driving without a license along, and several other charges. He is not expected to be tried until January of next year, however.

A report released by newspaper Le Figaro this week claimed that between March 17th and May 5th, there have been at least 379 attacks on police, including 79 ambushes — an average of seven attacks per evening through the coronavirus lockdown. Certain no-go areas across the country have been the main locations for anti-police attacks, such as the department of Yvelines, where police claimed to have been attacked nearly every night over a two-week period.

The moment that UFC boss Dana White hoped would not happen, has happened: A UFC fighter preparing to fight in the first major live American sporting event in two months has tested positive for the coronavirus. ‘Jacare’ Souza, who was set to fight Uriah Hall at UFC 249 on Saturday night, tested positive for the coronavirus and has been pulled from the event. Two of Souza’s cornermen also tested positive. “UFC’s medical team examined Souza and his two cornermen and found them too be currently asymptomatic, or not exhibiting the common symptoms of COVID-19,” the UFC wrote in a statement. “As per UFC’s health and safety protocols, all three men have left the host hotel and will be self-isolating off premises, where UFC’s medical team will monitor their conditions remotely and will provide assistance with any necessary treatment.” UFC President Dana White sees the positive test as proof that his organization’s testing regimen is successful. “We administered 1,200 tests this week, on 300 people,” White explained to ESPN. “It’s not unexpected one person would test positive. “The system works. And what’s good about this, is now we know Jacare tested positive, he’s doing what he needs to do and we’re in a position to help him if he needs it.” Despite the positive test, the UFC plans to continue with the event scheduled to take place Saturday night in Florida.

On Friday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “All In,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) stated that vote by mail provisions “will be a very important part of the legislation that we’re going to put forward, and we are going to fight like the devil for it.” Host Chris Hayes asked, “[T]he last CARES Act…the big one, it had money for mail-in voting, but there’s no sort of federal requirement that states prepare themselves. It’s a very spotty system. Is that a must-have for Democrats? Is that something that is a kind of like a brightline for Democrats as a priority, to make sure we can have a safe and healthy election?” Schumer responded, “It is really important. I don’t underestimate the desire of Republicans to use the COVID crisis to prevent people from voting, particularly poor people, people of color. They’ve done that all along. Here’s a good one, in Alabama, if you want to vote by absentee ballot, you have to have a notary public sign that you did it. … It’s aimed at stopping people of color and poor people from voting. We feel extremely strongly that everyone should be able to vote, that the COVID crisis should not stand in the way of what is the hallmark, the wellspring of America, which is free, fair, and open elections, and that will be a very important part of the legislation that we’re going to put forward, and we are going to fight like the devil for it.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

LAS VEGAS (AP) — Magician Roy Horn of the famed Las Vegas act Siegfried & Roy has died of complications from the coronavirus. He was 75. Tawny Strelic said in a statement that Horn died Friday in a Las Vegas hospital. He was critically injured in 2003 by one of the act’s white tigers. Siegfried & Roy were an institution in Las Vegas, where their magic and artistry consistently attracted sellout crowds. The pair performed six shows a week, 44 weeks per year. Horn was attacked by a tiger during the duo’s act at the Mirage hotel-casino. He had severe neck injuries and later had a stroke. The attack ended the long-running production.

Friday on Fox News Channel’s “Your World,” Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) argued when determining how and whether or not China was responsible for coronavirus global pandemic, it was undeniable China allowed the virus to spread beyond its borders. He told FNC’s Neil Cavuto that for that reason, the Chinese Communist Party was “culpable” for allowing COVID-19 to become a global pandemic. “Whatever the origins of this virus — and, right now, I think the best circumstantial evidence points to those labs in Wuhan,” Cotton said. “But whatever the origins of it, it’s clear to me that, once China realized how deadly this virus could be to some people and how contagious this virus was, that they made the conscious decision to let it get outside of their borders. They didn’t stop international air travel. They pressured countries not to impose travel restrictions. “They pressured the WHO to oppose travel restrictions as well, even when they knew, as far back as early December, that this virus was highly contagious and very deadly,” he continued. “So, whatever the origins of this virus may ultimately be, even if it was an accident or a mistake, the Chinese Communist Party is culpable for turning what could have been a local public health challenge in Wuhan into the worst global pandemic in a century.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor

Acting Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli says border crossers are being almost immediately returned to Mexico after crossing into the United States. In March, President Trump halted all non-essential travel at the northern and southern borders of the U.S. through a Centers for Disease Control (CDC) statute allowing a suspension of migration if Americans’ health is at risk. Cuccinelli said, in an exclusive interview with SiriusXM Patriot’s Breitbart News Daily, that Trump’s order — coupled with the White House’s existing Remain in Mexico policy — has made returning border crossers quick and simple. LISTEN:  “Last month, the average number of people we had in custody was 150-a-day. which is about as close to zero as we ever get,” Cuccinelli said. “We got below 100 a number of days. And that’s because 80 percent of the people that [Border Patrol] is apprehending, they’re literally putting back across the Mexican border in under two hours. That’s the average time.” “It works to protect America and to keep our officers safe. And it is succeeding in that goal, both those goals,” Cuccinelli said. “This arrangement where we reduce travel on the Mexican border by agreement with Mexico has worked very well for both countries.” Cuccinelli said illegal immigration at the southern border is a “very, very dangerous situation” in terms of American public health, calling the journey through Mexico and up north “petri dishes” where border crossers “end up in stash houses” in the U.S. “At our peak last July, we were cohorting [quarantining] over 6,000 people who’d been exposed through transmittable diseases,” Cuccinelli said. “No one paid attention to the public health dangers until [coronavirus] rolled around … but now the rest of America is sort of getting an eye-opening view of what goes on at the border from a public health standpoint.” In April, as Breitbart News reported, border apprehensions dropped by 84 percent compared to the same time last year. In total, less than 16,000 border crossers were apprehended by Border Patrol agents last month — a 47 percent decrease from the more than 30,000 apprehended in March.

Rick Bright, the former head of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), proclaimed by some in the media to be a “whistleblower” against the Trump administration, told CBS News that he was not a disgruntled employee. Instead, he argued that he was “frustrated” with President Donald Trump’s “lack of leadership” amid the coronavirus pandemic. When asked by reporters about Bright’s ouster, President Trump said, “I never met Dr. Bright. I don’t know who he is. I didn’t hear good things about him. I did not hear good things about him at all. And to me, he seems like a disgruntled employee that’s trying to help the Democrats win an election.” Norah O’Donnell said, “The president called you a disgruntled employee.” Bright said, “I am not disgruntled. I am frustrated at a lack of leadership. I am frustrated at a lack of urgency to get a head start on developing lifesaving tools for Americans. I’m frustrated at our inability to be heard as scientists. Those things frustrate me.” He continued, “We see too many doctors and nurses now dying. And I was thinking that we could have done more to get those masks and those supplies to them sooner. And if we had, would they still be alive today? It’s a horrible thought to think about the time that passed where we could’ve done something, and we didn’t.” Bright refused to promote the use of two antimalarial drugs, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat coronavirus before being removed from his position. He filed a whistleblower complaint against the Trump administration. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Amnesty advocates are working overtime to portray illegal migrants as heroic essential workers in the national campaign to contain China’s coronavirus. “We have started talking about essential workers as a category of superheroes,” according to Andrew Selee, the president of the pro-migration Migration Policy Institute. The illegal aliens who work as “essential workers” deserve an amnesty if the epidemic continues, he suggested in a New York Times op-ed. “[We should think] in a bold way about how do we deal with essential workers who have put their life on the line for all of us but who don’t have legal documents,” he said. Illegal aliens in the healthcare sector, “regardless of their place of birth, these individuals undoubtedly represent the best of America,” Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) said April 28. “They’re the Face of COVID-19 Response,” claims a May 7 post by Mark Zuckerberg’s Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. They’re the Face of COVID-19 Response. They Also Have DACA Status. https://t.co/JSADaGghyi — Todd Schulte (@TheToddSchulte) May 8, 2020  The Zuckerberg post showcases the stories of four attractive college-educated illegal migrants who were brought as children to the United States and were then educated by American taxpayers. The initiative’s globalist theme is “A Future For Everyone,” even though recruiters at Zuckerberg’s Facebook company bypass U.S. graduates to instead hire foreign H-1B and OPT workers. Zuckerberg’s pitch was amplified by Todd Schulte, director of FWD.us, which is a pro-migration advocacy group founded by Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, and other wealthy investors. Many illegal aliens hold jobs that require hard work, diligence, and skill. A very small percentage of illegal aliens are trained medical experts, but most are unskilled laborers working for low wages in the food and hospitality industries. The illegal aliens are vastly outnumbered by roughly 280 million Americans and roughly 34 million legal immigrants — but these illegal aliens drive down the wages and salaries paid by companies to hardworking Americans. Yet the Democrats’ praise for illegal migrants exposes their dislike of the ordinary Americans, said Mark Krikorian, the director of the Center for Immigration Studies. For many progressives, he said, “immigrants are better than we are … immigrants are supermen of a sort, and we are whimpering people who need to curl up in our apartment and never leave again.” This biased view matches their political ambitions, he said. Progressives want to “use the virus to bootstrap an amnesty … [because] they are creeped out by ordinary Americans,” he said.  “Where would we be if 41,000 DACA protectees and 11,000 TPS holders [in the healthcare sector] picked up and left us?” Sen. Richard Durbin (D-IL) asked in a May 5 comment. “We’d be in much worse shape, and we know it …We need them today,” he said.  Durbin used the #ImmigrantHealthHeroes hashtag to push for the legalization of illegal aliens who are now temporarily legal under the Deferred Arrival for Childhood Arrivals [DACA] and the Temporary Protect Status [TPS] programs. “Let’s recognize that America is ‘a nation of immigrants,'” he added, referring to the 1960s claim that the United States is a place for migrants, not a nation for Americans.  “We need Congress to pass a comprehensive bipartisan immigration reform bill,” he said, promising to use the next coronavirus emergency bill to extend the temporary legal status for the DACA and TPS illegal migrants.  Consider this: one-sixth of our nation’s health care workforce are immigrants. Where would we be in this pandemic without these #ImmigrantHealthHeroes? pic.twitter.com/6fy41pPLnZ — Senator Dick Durbin (@SenatorDurbin) May 5, 2020  More than 200,000 DACA and 130,000 TPS migrants have jobs defined as “essential workers,” Durbin said. The “essential worker” term includes healthcare jobs as well as jobs on farms, in restaurants, food processing, transportation, and the security of critical facilities, such as waters, as well as banking, childcare workers, retail workers in hardware stories, janitors, and trash workers. The vast majority of workers in these sectors are native-born Americans, not migrants, and the essential jobs held by illegal aliens can be performed by millions of the suddenly unemployed American blue-collar and white-collar workers. The Center for Immigration Studies reported in August 2018: Among the 474 separate occupations defined by the Department of Commerce, we find only a handful of majority-immigrant occupations, and none completely dominated by immigrants (legal or illegal). Furthermore, in none of the 474 occupations do illegal immigrants constitute a majority of workers. For example, companies provide the reward of green cards to roughly 50,000 foreign visa workers each year after those foreign workers have taken technology jobs from Americans via the H-1B and other visa programs. DACA migrants provide a tiny share of U.S. medical workers, Camarota told Breitbart News. The claimed number of 29,000 DACA healthcare workers “translates to just 0.2% of the nation’s 14.5 million health care workers,” as CAP defines it. Moreover, many additional healthcare experts have volunteered to work on the disease in New York and California but have not been mobilized by the state government, according to press reports. The New York Times reported April 18: As of Wednesday, more than 90,000 retired and active health care workers had signed up online to volunteer at the epicenter of the pandemic, including 25,000 from outside New York, the governor’s office said. Putting them to work, however, has been a different story. New York City hospitals have only deployed 908 volunteers as of Wednesday, according to city health officials.

Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) an India-born advocate for migrants. House Democrats are “pushing very, very hard” to get an amnesty for younger illegal aliens, dubbed DACA migrants, she said, according to RollCall.com. Legal and illegal immigrants are “disproportionately represented in the very workers most essential in the U.S. right now,” said Laura Collins, the director of the George W. Bush Institute-SMU Economic Growth Initiative. “We need immigrants to help start new businesses, jump-starting entrepreneurship when many others will be too scared to risk opening a business again,” she said in a May 5 op-ed for the San Antonio Express-News. But “immigrants and the native-born will not compete with each other for opportunities in the post-pandemic economic recovery,” she insisted. “It’s time to offer all essential workers a path to legalization,” said a New York Times op-ed, which focused on the stoop-labor illegal migrants who harvest single asparagus sticks with a long knife, while ignoring the machines which rapidly harvest asparagus fields. “Immigrants were keeping America’s health care system afloat before the coronavirus,” an immigrant investor claimed in an Axios.com op-ed. “When we do get through this, we’ll be able to retell the story of America as a country built by fearless, men and women seeking a new beginning for themselves and their families. We’ll remind the world that, especially in a time of crisis, America remains a ‘nation of immigrants.'” “#ImmigrantHealthHeroes Is Highlighting The Immigrant Health Care Workers Keeping Us All Safe,” says a headline posted by a pro-migration website, WeAreMitu.com.

The coronavirus outbreak has impacted the U.S. food supply chain, including the disease infecting workers at meat processing plants, causing operations to shut down and resulting in slaughtering of livestock that can’t be processed and shipped to retailers. Some restaurant chains are also facing shortages, including Wendy’s, which announced it had run out of beef for burgers. But at the same time the U.S. is facing meat and protein shortages, pork and other exports to China have soared. Reuters published an analysis on the parallel phenomenon: Meatpackers and livestock producers in the United States have spent at least a year adjusting to the surge in business to China, which has faced a severe pork shortage in the wake of its battle against African swine fever. But now, as the United States is on the brink of its own meat crisis due to the coronavirus pandemic, American pork supplies are being shipped off to China at a breakneck pace, creating the perfect recipe for additional U.S.-China tensions. For some American consumers, the optics of this situation might be poor given how the virus originated in China late last year. But record U.S. meat exports to China have been the plan all along, to satisfy both China’s needs and to lift U.S. business. The Chinese connection is tied to trade deals with the United States, one of the main pillars of the Trump administration agenda, and agreements that pre-date the coronavirus outbreak, the Associated Press (AP) reported: The two governments have raised tariffs on billions of dollars of each other’s imports since 2018 in a fight over Beijing’s trade surplus and technology ambitions. Under the January agreement, Washington agreed to reduce some tariff hikes and postpone others in exchange for what Trump said was a Chinese commitment to buy American farm goods and other exports worth $200 billion. Beijing has resumed purchases of American soybeans but has yet to confirm the size of any commitment. On Sunday, Trump told Fox News, “If they don’t buy, we’ll terminate the deal. Very simple.” AP reported that Chinese and U.S. officials spoke by phone on Friday, according to the Chinese news outlet Xinhua. Chief Chinese envoy, Vice Premier Liu He, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin agreed to “create a favorable atmosphere and conditions” for implementing the “phase one” agreement signed in January. The Reuters analysis said: The U.S. meat shortage and the Phase 1 goals of increasing exports to China seem to be opposing forces, raising the question of whether sales and shipments will or should be limited. Some restrictions would not be surprising given U.S. President Donald Trump’s more combative tone in his recent comments on trade with China. Trump also last week ordered meat-processing plants to stay open to protect U.S. meat supply, but this has sparked some backlash from unions and lawmakers over the safety of workers, and it is not clear if the mandate will have the desired effect on production. The Reuters piece said the preliminary U.S. export data for April “suggests that pork exports to China were comparable with March while beef shipments were likely higher” and that most of the sales and exports to China accumulated before the U.S. meat shortage spiked. “The value of all U.S. pork, beef, poultry and products exported to China in the first three months of 2020 totaled $781 million,” the Reuters analysis reported.

For the first time in eight weeks, Hawaii has reported no new statewide cases of COVID-19, leaving the total case count since the beginning of the pandemic at 629. The last time the tropical state reported no new cases of the coronavirus was earlier this year on March 13. “We have seen a steady decline in new cases over the past several weeks. Although today we’re at zero, we want to maintain these declines,” said Dr. Sarah Park, state epidemiologist. “As businesses reopen, as people become more active and travel more freely, we will inevitably see more cases,” Park added, warning that travel to the mainland also creates a risk. Hawaii, which had reported double-digit case increases in late March and early April, has witnessed its new daily case count remain under ten for three weeks. While residents of Hawaii remain socially distanced and take precautions like wearing face coverings, some businesses have began to reopen. On Thursday, retail stores and shopping malls were allowed to reopen on the Big Island and Kauai. Those same types of businesses will be allowed to reopen in Maui on Monday and Oahu on May 15. While certain businesses in Hawaii have been given the green light to reopen, restaurants will have to continue offering takeout orders and barbershops, nail salons, and bars will remain closed for the time being. Hawaii’s unemployment rate sits at around 35 percent, the highest in the nation. Before the pandemic, Hawaii’s unemployment rate was among the lowest in the nation at three percent. As of Friday, there have been 629 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Hawaii with 17 deaths as a result. Follow Kyle on Twitter @RealKyleMorris and Facebook.

The Hong Kong government stated that a local textile company with ties to Vietnam will produce its new reusable coronavirus masks, rejecting the option of masks made in China, the Hong Kong Free Press (HKFP) reported on Friday. Hong Kong has launched a government program to produce and distribute free, reusable masks to the public in an effort to contain its coronavirus outbreak, which has been smaller than many other regions of comparable size and population. On Friday, Hong Kong began easing restrictions on public gatherings as the city’s coronavirus cases have remained stable for weeks. On Thursday, Hong Kong’s Secretary for Innovation and Technology Annie Choi confirmed to Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) that the reusable face masks will be manufactured by a Hong Kong company called the Crystal International Group (CIG), adding that CIG maintains a production line in Vietnam. “The company had some orders on their hands, but when they heard about this special project for Hong Kong, they freed up their factory to make a special dust-free area,” Choi told reporters. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam visited a CIG production workshop on Wednesday to oversee the production of the masks, HKFP reported. CIG is run by a director of the government-funded Hong Kong Research Institute of Textiles and Apparel (HKRITA), which reportedly designed the masks. With six layers, the mask can reportedly “immobilize” bacteria and viruses, stopping them from entering the mouth and nose when worn properly. The antibacterial action will be effective for up to 60 washes, after which the mask will require a filter replacement, according to a government statement. Nearly 1.4 million Hong Kong citizens had already pre-registered online for the masks as of Wednesday, according to the city’s Innovation and Technology Bureau. The masks’ online registration system has drawn criticism from some citizens concerned over data privacy. The system requires applicants to provide their “Hong Kong Identity card numbers, dates of birth, and local mobile numbers of all registrants, as well as a local delivery address,” HKFP reports. A former member of Hong Kong’s Progressive Lawyers Group, a pro-democracy civil group, expressed his concern this week over the government’s handling of citizens’ private data. Writing on Twitter, Craig Choy said: “Privacy policy on [mask] website by Hong Kong government to distribute face masks fails to tell Hong Kongers what information it collects, the purposes, if data [will] be transferred to [a] third party, or outside Hong Kong.” Hong Kong’s decision to use a local manufacturer for its mask program comes as several countries around the world have condemned Chinese-made masks and other coronavirus medical gear as faulty or contaminated in recent weeks, including Tanzania, India, and many others. China has shipped coronavirus medical aid — including personal protective equipment (PPE) like masks, and testing kits — to regions around the world recently. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has advertised the move as a humanitarian effort to aid countries as they battle the coronavirus pandemic. The CCP has also been the subject of criticism lately amid emerging evidence of its cover-up of China’s initial coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China, late last year, which subsequently caused the virus to spread to the rest of the world and into a global pandemic. Thus, many countries, have denounced China’s defective PPE and testing kits as adding insult to injury.

South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster announced Friday that restaurants throughout the state will be allowed to reopen for limited dine-in services starting on Monday after they were shut down due to the coronavirus pandemic. In an effort to assist the state’s economic reopening process, McMaster has implemented guidelines for restaurants to follow should they decide to reopen. Those guidelines include only allowing 50 percent capacity inside at a time, tables must be spread six to eight feet apart, social distancing, and health checks for employees must be practiced. The guidelines were based on advice and input from AccelerateSC, as well as  the Department of Health and Environmental Control and the South Carolina Restaurant and Lodging Association. McMaster is leaving the responsibility of reopening in the hands of those who own food businesses if they would like to reopen. “This doesn’t mean that everyone has to open,” McMaster said. “It means that restriction has been lifted. Every restaurant owner or every manager will have to make decisions based on their customers, their clients, their staff, and the safety of those people.” McMaster also announced that boating restrictions would be lifted immediately. However, the governor urged social distancing practices and precautions. “As we gradually and methodically lift restrictions aimed at combating the coronavirus, it is incumbent upon South Carolinians to follow to the guidance and recommendations provided by our public health experts to keep themselves and their loved ones safe,” McMaster said. “This virus still presents a serious threat to South Carolinians, but I have faith in the people of our state and their ability to act responsibly and in the best interest of the communities they live in,” he added. The governor also stated he will likely address businesses that involve person-to-person contact, like barbershops, nail salons, and gyms on Monday. “We hope to have a decision made and announced as early as Monday on those,” McMaster said. As of Friday, South Carolina has 7,367 positive cases of COVID-19, with 320 total deaths. Follow Kyle on Twitter @RealKyleMorris and Facebook.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis shared a video to social media on Friday that announced that most barbershops, hair salons, and nail salons will open on Monday in parts of the state after they were shut down due to the coronavirus pandemic. The video featured Orlando barbershop owner John Henry, who made the announcement. “We are ready to get back to work and make some money,” said Henry, who operates J Henry’s Barber Shop. “But getting back to work, we want to be safe to continue to wear gloves, wear masks, bookmark appointments and continue to keep the community safe. Here’s a major announcement from my friend J Henry, owner of J Henry’s Barber Shop in downtown Orlando. ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/KnXFaMRVns — Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) May 8, 2020  “I know everyone is happy to come out and support the barbershop, and we want to continue to keep one thing in mind, safety is always first,” Henry added. The video shared by DeSantis came shortly after he announced that Palm Beach County will be included in Monday’s first phase of the state’s economic reopening process. The only two counties that will remain out of the first phase are Miami-Dade county and Broward county. In a push to be included in the first phase of reopening, Henry, along with other barbers and cosmetologists in the state, sat down for a discussion with DeSantis last Saturday. Throughout the discussion, Henry and others highlighted their plans to safely resume operations, which included sanitation and health protocols and social distancing measures for customers. Speaking in Jacksonville on Friday, DeSantis concluded that the industry proposals reviewed by physicians and the Department of Health were “going in a really good direction.” DeSantis said: Look, I practically have a mullet. So, I haven’t had a haircut in a long time. But you know, we just want to make sure we’re going in a safe, smart, step-by-step approach. We’re being very judicious on everything we’re doing. But I absolutely see a path. And I think if people watch out, I think that you’ll be hearing something on that very soon. While in Jacksonville, DeSantis also said he would like to eventually move Miami-Dade and Broward into phase one, which could possibly begin May 18, saying they have “good trends” to combat the virus.

As President Trump plots how to return the country to the playing field and back to work, he will be closely monitoring how the UFC handles its return this weekend, according to UFC President Dana White. During an interview on TMZ Live, White was asked if the president would have his eyes on how White’s organization handles UFC 249 on Saturday night. The UFC chief’s answer left no room for doubt. “Absolutely,” White said. “His whole philosophy was let’s get sports back first, figure out how to do that safely. Then let’s start figuring out how do you get people back in the office? How do you get people in cubicles? And, then how do you get kids back in school? “So, this is something we’ve been working on and yes, he’s absolutely watching what we’re doing this weekend.” White insists that testing will be a central part of the plan to keep his athlete’s safe. “Health and safety is something we worry about every single weekend … there’s gonna be a lot of testing going on here. It’s really expensive,” White concluded. If UFC 249 should provide more than its fair share of fireworks. The headlining bout features two of the most exciting fighters in the game, in Tony Ferguson and Justin Gaethje. In the co-Main Event, the dynamic Henry Cejudo will face Dominick Cruz who makes his long-awaited return the Octagon. Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn

Afghan farmers claim to have “no other choice” but to illegally grow poppies – a lucrative opium crop that fuels the country’s Taliban terror group – amid the economic downturn caused by the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) reported on Friday. Farmers in Afghanistan growing poppies, a flower cultivated for the illicit opium trade, are blaming their illegal activities on the current coronavirus pandemic, which has caused a disruption in global supply and demand chains resulting in economic hardship for many countries. They argue that they have no profitable alternative to poppy cultivation. In the country’s southern Kandahar Province, which borders Pakistan, farmers from Zhari district explained to RFE/RL why they grow the flower. “We are growing poppies out of poverty. If we didn’t have to, we wouldn’t,” a farmer named Bahauddin told the news site. “We grow them because there are no factories, the drought has hurt us, the [Chinese] coronavirus has hit the economy. We have no other choice but to grow poppies,” farmer Noor Agha said. Afghanistan is the world’s top producer of opium, which in turn is used to make heroin. In 2018, the country produced 82 percent of the world’s opium supply, according to a 2019 U.N. drug report. The recent drought referred to by farmer Agha has affected Afghanistan’s economy, according to the report, but not in the way he suggests. In 2018, a drought caused a decline in the cultivation and production of opium in Afghanistan, meaning the drought would not have forced Agha into poppy farming, but away from it. According to the U.N. data, opium prices in Afghanistan decreased between 2016 and 2018, likely due to overproduction in previous years, “making the crop less lucrative for farmers.” The report insisted that despite the drought, “the area under [poppy] cultivation today [649,887 acres] is more than 60 percent larger than it was a decade ago and the estimated cultivation area in Afghanistan in 2018 [was] the second-largest estimate ever.” The Taliban profits tremendously from Afghanistan’s illegal opium trade, worth up to $6.6 billion in 2017 according to the U.N. The terror group encourages farmers to plant poppies illegally, offering them protection from government authorities who try, in vain, to halt the practice. The militants then charge farmers taxes on the crop and use the funds to finance their operations. The farmers interviewed by RFE/RL grew their poppies in Kandahar Province, technically controlled by Afghanistan’s government. However, as the report points out, the opium trade has fueled corruption within the government, with authorities either unwilling or unable to stop poppy farming while it is still controlled by the Taliban. Afghanistan’s farmers have been encouraged by the U.S.-backed government to grow alternative food crops like wheat, fruit, and saffron in an attempt to move them away from poppy production. “Kandahar’s provincial government, together with the Agriculture Ministry, has worked on policies to convince the farmers to find less dangerous, more long-term income sources,” Bahir Ahmad, spokesman for Kandahar Province’s governor, told RFE/RL. These efforts have largely failed, however, because the opium trade, propped up the Taliban, is much more lucrative.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying floated the idea Friday that deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes, or vaping, in America in 2019 may have been secret Chinese coronavirus cases caused by a U.S. Army laboratory leak. The Chinese coronavirus pandemic began in Wuhan, China, late last year. While the Chinese government initially accepted that the origin of the new virus was a wild animal and seafood market in Wuhan, it has since refuted that assertion, instead suggesting that the virus originated in America. The earliest known case of Chinese coronavirus was documented, according to leaked Communist Party data, on November 17, 2019. No cases of infection are known to have occurred before then. More recently, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has stated that “enormous evidence” exists linking the pandemic to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a biological laboratory located near the meat market. While no evidence has surfaced, nor has any American official suggested, that the virus could have been engineered in the laboratory, some have suggested an accident or the illegal sale of laboratory animals may have resulted in the initial human exposure to the pathogen. A reporter asked Hua to comment on Pompeo’s repeated comments linking the pandemic to the Wuhan Institute of Virology on Friday and she responded with suspicions that American laboratories on the other side of the world from the origin of the virus could be responsible for it. She noted, in particular, a U.S. Army research base at Fort Detrick, Maryland, shut down last year, which the Communist Party has insisted is the source of the virus. “The safety of biolabs in the US now poses the biggest risk to the US regulatory authority,” Hua claimed. “There are also reports that soon after the closure [of the Fort Detrick laboratory], ‘E-cigarette disease’ broke out in the surroundings,” Hua claimed. “According to data released by the US CDC in late February, the flu season that begins in the winter of 2019 has infected at least 32 million people in the United States, including 18,000 deaths from flu-related illnesses. CDC Director Michael Redfield has publicly acknowledged that some of the deaths from influenza were actually caused by COVID-19. These are all public records in US media reports available online.” Hua concluded with a demand to allow an “international inspection” of the Maryland location. Hua’s claim of an outbreak of “e-cigarette disease” is a reference to what the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have dubbed “newly identified lung disease linked to vaping,” or EVALI. Doctors have traced the disease, which impairs lung function, back to the use of vapes. As of February, the latest statistics on the CDC website, the United States has documented 2,807 cases of EVALI and 68 deaths associated with it. The CDC describes the symptoms of EVALI as “respiratory symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, or chest pain” as well as fever and, sometimes, gastrointestinal issues. These symptoms are similar to some Chinese coronavirus symptoms, but the CDC noted that studies have found no lung infection in patients with EVALI, meaning no pathogen appears present in their bodies. American medical authorities also found no incidents of EVALI patients infecting anyone else or of anyone not using e-cigarettes with the disease, suggesting it is not caused by a contagious pathogen. There is no evidence that more recent EVALI patients, those diagnosed after the announcement of a discovery of a new coronavirus, have tested positive for it. The Chinese coronavirus is highly contagious and believed to spread through water droplets in the air. The distribution of cases of EVALI throughout the United States does not corroborate Hua’s contention that the shutdown of the Fort Detrick laboratory occurred prior to a massive outbreak of EVALI in the region. According to the CDC, Illinois, Texas, New York, and California have documented the highest numbers of cases. Hua’s remarks on Friday were not the first time that the Chinese government attempted to link vaping illnesses to the Chinese coronavirus. In March, the Global Times, a state propaganda outlet, claimed that “some have connected the cases with novel coronavirus,” without specifying who, exactly, had done so. One thing the EVALI cases and the pandemic have in common is that both may have originated in China. Prior to the sweeping ban by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on many vaping products in January, China produced about 90 percent of the world’s e-cigarettes, according to the Global Times. Over 80 percent of those available for purchase in the United States and European Union originated in China. As the Global Times explained in 2018: Its invention is also deeply connected with China. Chinese pharmacist Hon Lik reportedly invented the device in the early 2000s, hoping that it could help him quit smoking. But it soon gave rise to a multi-billion-dollar industry. He is now employed as a consultant by Fontem Ventures, a subsidiary of British multinational tobacco company Imperial Brands, which specializes in vaping technology. The Times admitted that the industry in China was “highly” unregulated. Shenzhen, a southern Chinese city considered one of its largest industrial centers, is home to a booming counterfeit vaping product industry. Juul, the largest U.S. vaping company, traced all counterfeit Juul products on the market back to China in a 2019 study. Raids triggered by this research revealed that many factories making these products in China did so under unsafe, unsanitary conditions that may have resulted in contaminated e-cigarette liquids. Many of these products contained THC, the active ingredient in cannabis, which is not considered safe to consume through e-cigarettes. The state-run Global Times admitted in October that counterfeit products were behind many EVALI cases. “While Juul Labs Inc dominates the North American market for pod e-cigarettes, many reports of deaths and injuries in the US have been tied to makeshift brands with no identifiable owner,” the newspaper reported. “The most prominent, Dank Vapes, was linked to 24 patients with lung illness, according to a study from the New England Journal of Medicine. The products contained THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana.” Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.

Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin announced on Thursday that lockdown measures in the Russian capital will be extended until at least May 31, warning that the real number of Chinese coronavirus cases is likely three times that of the official figures. Sobyanin, who has effectively led Russia’s response to the pandemic as head of the country’s coronavirus task force, wrote in a statement on his website that it is still too early to lift most restrictions. “Temporary restrictions on the functioning of trade, public catering, services, culture, education, sports, and other non-productive industries, as well as the regime of self-isolation of citizens, will be extended until May 31,” Sobyanin said in a statement on his website. “It is still too early to open restaurants, theaters, and sports facilities.” “From May 12, 2020, we begin the first stage of easing the restrictions imposed and returning to a normal lifestyle, of course, while maintaining maximum caution and enhanced measures to protect human life and health,” he continued. Moscow has been in a state of lockdown since the end of March, with residents only allowed to venture outside for groceries, walking dogs, or traveling to essential jobs with the necessary permit. From Monday, Muscovites will be required to wear masks and gloves when traveling around the city. Sobyanin also confirmed that some industries, such as construction, would be allowed to resume work from May 12th. The Russian capital remains one of the hardest-hit places by the coronavirus. Although the official number of infected is close to 100,000, Sobyanin estimates that around 300,000 of its residents, equivalent to around 2.5 percent of the city’s population, have contracted the virus. He also pointed out that this substantial increase is not necessarily evidence of the virus spreading more aggressively, but the fact that medical authorities have significantly ramped up testing. The number of hospitalizations with severe and moderate pneumonia, a stronger indicator of the virus’s spread, has not risen over the past fortnight. Beyond Moscow, Russia as a whole appears to be increasingly struggling with the pressure imposed by the virus. Many medical professionals have complained about a lack of resources, particularly personal protective equipment (PPE), with many choosing to quit their jobs. Three doctors opposed to the Kremlin’s approach have also fallen out of windows in mysterious circumstances. On Thursday, the White House revealed that Russian President Vladimir Putin had accepted his offer to provide the country with additional ventilators to help curb the pandemic. “President Trump reiterated that the United States is … ready to provide assistance to any country in need, including Russia,” Washington said in a statement.

North Korean media reported on Friday that dictator Kim Jong-un sent a message to his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, congratulating Xi for achieving “victory” over the Wuhan coronavirus.  Kim’s timing was a little awkward since Xi had just admitted to Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leaders the previous day that the coronavirus threat has not been neutralized in China. South Korea’s Yonhap News on Friday quoted a North Korean state media report of Kim’s congratulatory message to Xi: In the message, Kim “congratulated him, highly appreciating that he is seizing a chance of victory in the war against the unprecedented epidemic,” according to the Korean Central News Agency. “Kim Jong-un wished Xi Jinping good health, expressing conviction that the Chinese party and people would cement the successes made so far and steadily expand them and thus win a final victory under the wise guidance of Xi Jinping,” it added. It did not specify when and how the message has been delivered to the Chinese leader. The Pyongyang Times, a state outlet, noted that Kim made a point of congratulating himself for a splendid coronavirus response as well since North Korea risibly claims it has absolutely zero cases of the disease: [Kim] was pleased with the successes made in China like his own, he said, wishing Xi Jinping good health, after expressing the belief that the Chinese Party and people would cement the successes already made and steadily expand them and thus win a final victory under the wise leadership of General Secretary Xi Jinping. Another North Korean state media report at KCNA, the communist newswire service, found the regime in Pyongyang “intensifying” what it described as “anti-epidemic work,” even though the regime officially claims it has no epidemic to deal with: The emergency anti-epidemic headquarters at all levels are intensifying the control and guidance on quarantine, lock-down, inspection and sterilization to thoroughly check the inroads of COVID-19 while making exact demands for preventing any factors that may lead to other infectious diseases at the turn of the seasons. Officials of the Party and power organs, working people’s organizations and in the field of public health and hygienic and anti-epidemic work across the country are intensifying the hygienic information service, medical observation, education and control to let the working people and residents keep a high sense of awareness and consistency in action with utmost care. The Ministry of Public Health has established the state emergency anti-epidemic information system and stockpiled materials necessary for emergency anti-epidemic work to the maximum while actively pushing ahead with the development of vaccine against the virus. As positive state efforts are being directed to agriculture, preventive measures are being taken for the people aiding farming. South Korean analysts quoted by Yonhap interpreted the message as Kim signaling to Xi that political and economic cooperation between their two countries can resume as soon as the coronavirus threat recedes sufficiently. There was some speculation early on that the Wuhan pandemic could create some hard feelings between Pyongyang and Beijing, but Kim seems intent on stressing that their relationship has not been damaged.

Commissioner Chairman Dan Camp of Pennsylvania’s Beaver County on Friday slammed Gov. Tom Wolf (D) over his order excluding the county from moving into the next phase of reopening. On Friday, 24 counties moved from Wolf’s “red” phase to “yellow,” allowing in-store retail operations but barring bars and restaurants from offering dine-in services and requiring salons, barbershops, theaters, and fitness centers to remained closed. Counties that moved to the “yellow” phase on Friday include Bradford, Cameron, Centre, Clarion, Clearfield, Clinton, Crawford, Elk, Erie, Forest, Jefferson, Lawrence, Lycoming, McKean, Mercer, Montour, Northumberland, Potter, Snyder, Sullivan, Tioga, Union, Venango, and Warren. Noticeably absent in the cluster of counties is Beaver County – a decision that drew frustration from residents and the county commissioners. “While the Governor has consistently preached a regional approach to reopening, it has become evident that his previous comments were merely another example of saying one thing and doing another,” Camp said on Friday, explaining that local officials can no longer remain silent and ignore the cries of residents. “The governor’s double-talk means that Beaver County finds itself singled-out as the only Western Pennsylvania county in his administration’s red category, surrounded by a sea of yellow counties,” he continued, lamenting the “invisible wall surrounding and isolating Beaver County residents and businesses. “ “Our business owners and residents cannot become prisoners of our county because of this unwarranted double-talk,” he continued, slamming the governor for forcing them into an “exiled economic island.” The governor’s decision is both “unwarranted and irrational,” Camp said, because “our hospital systems are not being overrun by COVID-19 patients, nor is there some communal spread within our community. And, those are the ignored facts!” he exclaimed, adding that the governor’s decision is “simply based solely on one outbreak” in a county nursing home. “It’s no secret that nearly 70 percent of our COVID-19 cases and more than 90 percent of Beaver County’s COVID-19 related deaths are attributed to one nursing home within the county,” he emphasized. Because of that, the Board of Commissioners announced that they will “stand behind our District Attorney in his decision not to prosecute any case against a business that chooses to open following the mandated guidelines as laid out in the yellow phase of reopening PA.” Beaver County had 479 confirmed cases of the virus as of Friday. Wolf on Friday announced 13 additional counties that will be permitted to move to the “yellow” phase of reopening next week, on Friday, May 15. Those include Allegheny, Armstrong, Bedford, Blair, Butler, Cambria, Fayette, Fulton, Greene, Indiana, Somerset, Washington, and Westmoreland. The stay-at-home order remains in place for counties that remain in “red” phase. That order expires June 4.

China is employing thousands of Twitter bots as part of its disinformation campaign to portray itself as the leader in global coronavirus recovery efforts instead of the source of the pandemic, according to an analysis by the State Department’s Global Engagement Center. “We have identified a new network of inauthentic accounts on Twitter, most likely designed to amplify [People’s Republic of China] propaganda and disinformation related to the pandemic,” said State Department Press Secretary Morgan Ortagus during a conference call with reporters on Friday. She said the accounts are used to paint China’s response to the coronavirus in a positive light and to criticize anti-PRC content. “From promoting conspiracy websites to the use of trolls and bot networks to pushing false narratives…Beijing is engaged in an aggressive media campaign to try and reshape the global narrative around COVID,” said Lea Gabrielle, State Department special envoy and coordinator of the GEC. The GEC looked at the most recent followers for 36 Twitter accounts run by Chinese foreign ministry officials or Chinese embassies, and found that many of those accounts experienced a “major surge” in the number of new followers since March, when Beijing’s overseas messaging efforts on coronavirus kicked off, she said. The GEC’s analysis found that starting in March, the number of recently-created new followers for these accounts went from an average of 30 per day to over 720 per day — a 22-fold increase. Gabrielle said: Both the sudden increase of followers and a very recent creation of many of these accounts points to an artificial network being established to follow and to amplify narratives from Chinese diplomats and foreign ministry officials, especially at a time when China is adopting Russian style disinformation techniques to sow confusion and to try to convince people that COVID didn’t originate in China. The analysis found that nearly every Chinese diplomatic account shares at least one follower with every other account, with some of them sharing more than 1,000 followers — suggesting that those followers are bots, not authentic people. For example, two accounts linked to the foreign ministry — @zlj517 and @spokespersonCHN — share 3,423 of their most recent 10,000 followers. Further, nearly 40 percent of the most recent followers were created in just a six-week-period between the first of March and the 15th of April 2020, the analysis found. “It is our assessment that this network could be deployed to allow the CCP to rapidly amplify and spread messages around the world, skewing the conversation to its benefit,” Gabrielle said. She compared China’s disinformation campaign to a “one way megaphone” from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) into “free, open, and democratic societies” comparable to its decades-long efforts to control information within its own borders. But, she said, its global efforts are largely backfiring. “In many places, we see that foreign governments, academics, and media call out CCP disinformation and propaganda,” she said. “It’s critical that we continue to draw attention to the CCP’s increasing use of disinformation and other Russian-style tactics like these inauthentic social media amplification networks to prevent these behaviors from becoming the norm in Beijing,” she said. The GEC also continues to track a growing convergence between false Chinese and Russian narratives and tactics. Gabrielle said at the beginning of coronavirus pandemic, Chinese allowed Russian disinformation claiming that the U.S. was the source of the virus to spread around on Chinese social media. Then, she said, the CCP began raising questions themselves on state media about the virus’s origin, and then began promoting disinformation that the U.S. is the source of the virus. “At the same time, we saw Beijing unleashing a drumbeat of pro-PRC content across its global media networks and from its overseas missions that included increasingly vocal criticism about democratic countries and how they’re responding to the crisis,” she said. Gabrielle said she could not speak as to what Twitter is doing, but that State Department has shared information with the company. But, she added, the GEC is looking not at any one platform, but the “entire disinformation ecosystem.” “The disinformation ecosystem problem is much bigger than any one platform,” she said.   Follow Breitbart News’s Kristina Wong on Twitter or on Facebook.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) on Friday got a haircut at the salon of the Dallas business owner who was fined and jailed this week for reopening in violation of the state’s restrictions. Cruz received a haircut from Salon Á la Mode, just one day after owner Shelley Luther was released from jail at the ultimate direction of the Texas Supreme Court. “Hair salons & barbershops are open in TX today. Just got my hair cut for first time in 3 months at Salon ALa Mode to support Shelley Luther, who was wrongly imprisoned when she refused to apologize for trying to earn a living,” Cruz said on Friday. “Glad Shelley is out of jail & her business is open!” he exclaimed: Hair salons & barbershops are open in TX today.

The district court judge ordered Luther fined and jailed for seven days — a decision that sparked a national firestorm. “7 days in jail for cutting hair?? This is NUTS,” Cruz said at the time. “And government officials don’t get to order citizens to apologize to them for daring to earn a living”: 7 days in jail for cutting hair?? This is NUTS. And government officials don’t get to order citizens to apologize to them for daring to earn a living. https://t.co/3rulRlN0gE — Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) May 6, 2020  The harsh enforcement invoked a response from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R), who called for the salon owner’s immediate release: Bravo. https://t.co/ffMGCcnaHD — Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) May 6, 2020  Gov. Greg Abbott (R) also signaled he disapproved of the judge’s “excessive action” and announced that salons and barbershops would be able to open Friday, May 8. He also “amended his executive order on essential businesses and removed the provision allowing for violators to be punished by up to 180-days in jail,” as Breitbart News reported. “Powerful. Inspirational. God bless Shelley and God bless the Texas Supreme Court for standing up for Liberty and common sense,” Cruz said following Luther’s release: Powerful. Inspirational.

A nurse in Yardley, Pennsylvania, who recently won her battle with the Chinese coronavirus is determined to help her patients do the same. When ManorCare Health Services nurse Maria Philipps contracted the disease not long ago, she thought the night of April 2 would be her last, according to ABC 6. “I pulled out my phone and started to write, I just wanted to write a goodbye. I didn’t know if I was going to make it through the night. That’s how terrifying it was,” she recalled. Even though she has worked as a nurse for more than 30 years, Philipps said she had never fought any illness quite like COVID-19. “It hit us all at one time. It was like we were mugged. There was no warning, no nothing, it’s just there,” she said of the virus that infected her even while wearing personal protective equipment (PPE). Thankfully, Philipps was able to take the treatments that have saved so many lives. “I took that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin immediately, and it went great,” she explained. April 27, doctors with the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS) said there was a nearly 92 percent chance that anti-malaria drugs chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) could help patients infected with the virus, according to Breitbart News. “We believe that there is clear and convincing evidence of benefit both pre-exposure and post-exposure,” the AAPS stated. Following her recovery and two rounds of quarantine, Philipps was eager to get back to work on Wednesday and help those fighting their own battles with the disease. “I wanted to make sure I could see their eyes again – wanted to make sure I was there to see a recovery,” she said, adding that her team members also inspired her to keep going. “The nurses out there are not just providing healthcare, they’re providing emotional and mental care,” she concluded.

Vice President Mike Pence’s press secretary, Katie Miller, has tested positive for the Chinese coronavirus, revealed President Donald Trump said during a roundtable discussion on Friday afternoon. “She’s a wonderful young woman, Katie, she tested very good for a long period of time,” President Donald Trump told Republican lawmakers at the White House. “Then all of a sudden today she tested positive. She hasn’t come into contact with me. She’s spent some time with the vice president.” “This is why the whole concept of tests aren’t necessarily great,” the president continued. “The tests are perfect, but something can happen between a test where it’s good and then something happens and all of the sudden. She was tested very recently and tested negative, and then today I guess for some reason she tested positive. “Mike knows about it and Mike has done what he has to do,” he added. “I think he is on an airplane, going to some faraway place, but you’ll be able to ask him later on. But they’ve taken all of the necessary precautions. I understand Mike has been tested, vice president, and he tested negative.” Politico confirmed Katie is Katie Miller, who is married to Stephen Miller, a senior advisor for policy to President Trump. The development comes one day after the White House confirmed that a personal valet to President Trump contracted the deadly illness. In March, a Pence staffer tested positive for the coronavirus. Their identity remains unknown. 

The head of the World Health Organization (W.H.O.), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, applauded Venezuela’s socialist regime for “sharing [its] staged approach” towards the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, omitting the fact the country is responsible for one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world. Tedros, the first non-medical doctor running the public health agency, made the remarks on Twitter, where he thanked the leadership of various countries around the world for cooperating with the W.H.O. as part of their response to the outbreak.  “My thanks to Carlos Alvarado Gonzalez, Venezuelan Health Minister, for sharing Venezuela’s staged approach for fighting #COVID19 [the Chinese coronavirus]: before and after cases, comprehensive measures to identify and control these, and educating and informing the public,” he wrote. My thanks to Carlos Alvarado Gonzalez, 🇻 Health Minister, for sharing #Venezuela's staged approach for fighting #COVID19: before and after cases, comprehensive measures to identify and control these, and educating and informing the public. — Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (@DrTedros) May 7, 2020  Since the outbreak this year, Adhanom has transformed from a relatively unknown figure to a source of major international criticism, severely damaging the W.H.O.’s reputation as a result and causing the Trump administration to pull funding from the organization. A former Marxist official in the Ethiopian government, the 55-year-old has repeatedly sided with communist China on its handling of the crisis, attempting to deflect scrutiny away from Beijing regarding its responsibility in covering up the pandemic in its early stages. Following the initial outbreak of the virus, Chinese officials arrested doctors for sharing tips on protecting oneself from infectious diseases. One of these, Dr. Li Wenliang, mysteriously died, allegedly after contracting the coronavirus, following his detention. As it began to spread, China also pressured countries against introducing travel bans on Chinese citizens, a measure that would have likely significantly slowed its spread. Even now, Beijing will not allow the W.H.O. to inspect the city of Wuhan where the outbreak began. The state of Venezuela’s “universal” healthcare system is one of the driving factors behind the country’s humanitarian crisis. Many hospitals have chronic shortages of medicine, staff, and medical equipment, meaning thousands of patients are going without necessary treatment. In 2017, the country’s leading national newspaper, El Nacional, described the situation in Venezuelan hospitals as a “health Holocaust.”  The only possible reason for congratulating the Venezuelan Health Ministry could be the allegedly low number of coronavirus cases. According to official data, there have only been 381 cases and ten deaths as a result of the pandemic, an astonishingly low number given the size of the country’s population, barely functioning healthcare system, and vulnerability of its poverty-stricken people. There remain serious doubts about the reliability of such figures, given the Maduro regime’s spread of lies and disinformation on an almost daily basis, as well as the claims of other socialist nations such as North Korea, who says it has recorded no cases whatsoever.

Dean Reuter said during Friday’s episode of Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM that the 75th anniversary of Victory in Europe “marks the triumph of good over evil”, and that parents should teach their children about the sacrifices made, as well as the stories of triumph and courage. Speaking to Breitbart News Network Editor in Chief and show host Alex Marlow, Mr Reuter, general counsel of the Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy, remarked on the lack of coverage in the media of this milestone in modern history. He said: “Nobody’s covering the 75th anniversary of Victory in Europe, which really marks the end of one episode in human history that was in many ways tragic and in many ways a great triumph. It marks the triumph of good over evil in an international, global way that we rarely get to see in this country or anywhere abroad.” Delving into what it may have felt like for Americans in the final days leading up to VE Day, the author of The Hidden Nazi: The Untold Story of America’s Deal with the Devil said that while the world was “somewhat ravaged”, victory “began to feel inevitable”. The historian said: “For fully a year before the end of the war, the Allies knew that Germany was living on borrowed time, the Third Reich was living on borrowed time.”  Americans were not trepidatious but joyful when the Allies announced the surrender of Nazi Germany, Mr Reuter said, telling Alex Marlow: “Millions of people poured into the streets. This was a grand moment. We had been fighting the war for less time than the Brits, the French that remained, and the Russians. But we had been in it for a very long time, before that with Lend-Lease and watching from the sidelines. “Having said that, even for the period we were in it from Pearl Harbour on, we experienced death in the hundreds of thousands. Our young men were subject to the draft. They were fighting overseas in countries most people had heard of but most Americans at the time had never visited. There was this tenuous relationship to American interests felt, even then, because the world really wasn’t quite as global as it is today.” Mr Reuter, who is also the vice president and director of the Practice Groups of the Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy, distinguished the experiences of those currently living during the coronavirus pandemic and those who had spent years fighting in foreign countries or existing under a cloud of war. On the “level of sacrifice”, he said, “I don’t think it’s close to what we went through to what we’re going through today. There’s a good lesson there: the level of sacrifice these people made, the astounding stories of bravery and courage that have come out of the war, and triumph, are just extraordinary.” Despite the significance of VE Day at 75, coronavirus lockdown around the world has meant that celebrations and commemorations have been severely curtailed. But Mr Reuter said that now more than ever, people should be made aware of it and remember soldiers. Pics: Europe Marks 75th Anniversary of VE Day Despite Coronavirus Lockdown https://t.co/uEexjtXINe — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 8, 2020  Reflecting that people of his generation knew those who fought in the Second World War or survived the Holocaust, he said: “People of a younger generation don’t have that personal connection to the war. Even students of the war, it becomes a textbook exercise. It’s nice to have some temporal distance from the war, but it’s important to remember exactly what these people have accomplished.” “I would just try and tell the story to the generation coming up, to the extent you know it,” Mr Reuter said, adding that parents should take advantage of the ability to take control of their children’s education during lockdown by teaching them about World War Two. “They get probably a day’s worth of information in their grade school education about World War Two, and that’s tragic,” he said. “Everybody’s doing this homeschooling… so there’s an opportunity there to spend some time educating yourself and bringing your kids into the loop.” Asked what lessons he fears may become lost from World War Two, Mr Reuter said: “One is what man is capable of doing to man, in both directions. There are stories of triumph, of unbelievable courage, and there are stories of massive evil… That’s one thing you can lose very quickly.” Nigel Farage Salutes War Generation in VE Day Tribute https://t.co/bdchNFQUvB — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 8, 2020 

The National Association of Scholars, a non-profit advocacy group for American professors, has called on universities and colleges to cut back on administrative bloat before they accept federal coronavirus relief. American universities and colleges added approximately 500,000 highly paid administrative jobs between 1987 and 2012. A report recently published by the National Association of Scholars asks universities and colleges to respond proactively to the financial burdens imposed by the ongoing Chinese virus pandemic. Breitbart News reported in 2019 on an analysis by the New England Center for Investigative Reporting which revealed that American universities and colleges had drastically increased the number of administrators between 1987 and 2012. In fact, as many as 500,000 administrative positions were created in that time period. Although the National Association of Scholars concedes that some coronavirus relief may be necessary, they urge universities to cut administrative bloat and affirm American principles of freedom before accepting federal aid. 1. They must significantly reform their unsustainable finances, above all by immediately reducing administrative overhead by 50% or more. 2. They must adhere to American principles of freedom and avoid activities that threaten the American national interest. The organization argues that American higher education has exploited students by charging exorbitant tuition prices that have been justified by an ever-expanding class of administrators. The report claims that more than 50 percent of higher education’s payroll costs now go to administrators. For far too long, American higher education has exploited the hopes of students and their families, as well as the goodwill of legislators and the American public. Millions of Americans have been plunged deeply into insupportable debt in order to fund huge increases in college administrative costs over the last 30 years. Administrative positions, including non-instructional staff, now consume more than 50% of higher education payroll costs. At the same time, colleges and universities offer a trivialized curriculum marked by animosity to America. Our country deserves much better—and we can get it. Breitbart News reported in April that the University of Southern California will accept $20 million despite its$5.5 billion endowment. The university claims that the aid will go directly to students that are struggling as a result of the Chinese virus pandemic. Stay tuned to Breitbart News for more updates.

Thursday on CNN’s Unfiltered, host S.E. Cupp said she would be afraid for her personal safety if President Donald Trump were her work colleague.  A partial transcript is as follows:  S.E. CUPP: A Republican Trump opposition group released a scathing new ad this week exposing the president’s failures during the COVID-19 crisis. […] Now, Trump lashed out in a rambling, incoherent, insult-laden tirade in the middle of the night on Twitter. It was needless to say unhinged, even for him. We’ve come to accept this bizarre behavior over the years, but as we face a pandemic that threatens to wipe out hundreds of thousands of Americans, to put millions out of work, the president seems more dangerously incapable of managing his emotions and anything else. […] I feel like we’ve become a little numb to Trump’s obvious instability. That’s why I think it’s helpful to reframe some of what we’re seeing. If we saw this behavior in our child, for example, I know as a parent I would be really concerned. The descent into unfounded conspiracy theories, the late-night ad hominem attacks on social media, lashing out at women, in particular, women reporters, delusional statements, an inability to focus on tasks to compartmentalize, paranoia, pathological insecurity. I’d get my kid help. If this were a coworker, I’d be afraid for my safety at work and I’d probably tell HR. And yet, this is the president of the United States unraveling at a very precarious time for our country. Shouldn’t we all be worried about this? TOM NICHOLS: Absolutely, and I think your point about if this were your child or someone in your family, of course, you’d sit down with them and say, “What’s wrong with you?” and “What can we do to help you?”  

Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro announced a trip to Beijing “soon” this week to “hug our brother Xi Jinping,” that nation’s tyrant. Most governments in the world, including China and Venezuela, are currently discouraging hugs as a violation of “social distancing,” a policy in which people keep from physical proximity to avoid the spread of the Chinese coronavirus. China is the origin of the current pandemic, while Venezuela has documented a steady growth in the number of cases. Scientists around the world have expressed distrust towards both China’s and Venezuela’s official coronavirus case numbers. Maduro made the comment on state television Wednesday, one of his first remarks this week not regarding the alleged failed “coup” attempt against him claimed by the head of an American private contractor. Maduro has vowed to take President Donald Trump and the government of Colombia to The Hague for his involvement in the operation, though no evidence exists indicating any such involvement and the alleged head of the operation, Jordan Goudreau, lamented to the Associated Press that Washington has completely ignored him. Some reports have tied Goudreau to a former chavista general whose brother continues to represent the Maduro regime in Iran. “I will soon go to Beijing to give a hug to our brother Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, in China,” Maduro announced, according to Venezuelan state television. He reportedly did not offer any specific dates or clarity on how he would be allowed to enter China given its current stringent travel limitations. He also did not explain how hugging someone after taking one of the world’s longest international flights complies with social distancing measures both Maduro and Xi have implemented in their respective countries. VTV, the Venezuelan state propaganda network, noted that China and the illegitimate Maduro regime have signed deals for over 700 currently ongoing projects, largely economic ones and that Maduro has visited China ten times. Maduro last paid a state visit to Beijing in late 2018, in one of the regime’s most difficult circumstances. The visit resulted in China agreeing to lend Maduro $5 billion in financial relief after several years of careful distancing, the first major loan in years after Beijing began expressing mild discontent with Maduro’s inability to pay it back.    China has also invested deeply in the Maduro’s regime’s repressive apparatus. As it has done throughout Latin America, China has lent Venezuela its surveillance technology to create a Maduro equivalent of the “social credit system,” which assigns every Chinese citizen a point value based on their loyalty to the Communist Party. “They are single-handedly helping conduct the Internet control operation,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) explained last year. “They have basically taken a commercial version of their great Internet firewall and given it to Maduro, and it is a service they are providing him, so they are the ones that are shutting down the Internet and access to social media.” China has received in return significant profits from suspect government projects it has spearheaded in the country. One of the most egregious examples, revealed by Reuters last year, was the deal cut with the Chinese company CAMC, which allegedly promised to build “rice paddies twice the size of Manhattan” to ease the socialism-created hunger in the country. Reuters found that the rice paddies never materialized, CAMC made at least $1.4 billion, and “locals are hungry.” Maduro and Xi last spoke in mid-April, according to the Chinese state newspaper Global Times. In that conversation, Xi reportedly told Maduro he was “ready to boost cooperation with Venezuela in COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] prevention and control and continue to help the Latin American country combat the coronavirus disease.” More recently, the Chinese Foreign Ministry expressed its support for Maduro’s legitimacy, despite the fact that his presidential term ended in January 2019, and condemned the alleged failed “coup” against him this week. “According to international law and basic norms governing international relations, a country’s sovereignty, security and territorial integrity should be respected,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters on Wednesday. “China firmly supports the efforts of the Venezuelan government to safeguard sovereignty, maintain stability and improve people’s livelihood, opposes any external interference in Venezuela’s internal affairs under any pretext and firmly rejects any form of military intervention.” The Maduro regime, at press time, claims to have confirmed 381 cases of Chinese coronavirus and ten deaths, a significantly lower number than some of its free neighbors. Maduro initially attempted to impose a “voluntary” lockdown on the country in March. Due to widespread shortages of food, gasoline, and water, among other basic items, many ignored the lockdown to gather in large lines outside of essential businesses. Maduro then continued to call the lockdown “voluntary” but began enforcing it, leading to protests and violence. Some have continued to gather in crowds, arguing that it is impossible for them not to get on lines for food or water. Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.

Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA) told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview on Friday that American political leaders are “overstating the danger” of coronavirus to most Americans while “underestimating” the economic “carnage” that lockdowns nationwide are causing. Toomey, a key U.S. senator from a Rust Belt battleground state, conducted this interview with Breitbart News after rolling out a plan to much more quickly reopen Pennsylvania than the plan the state’s Democrat Gov. Tom Wolf has begun. Toomey, a widely respected Republican who serves alongside a Democrat, Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA), is not known for making outlandish claims so his statements here that the panic driving policy decisions around the country instead of science—which shows the disease is much less severe than originally thought—are a huge step for the country as the conventional wisdom behind the lockdowns nationwide is challenged ever so more. He is the first U.S. senator to offer such criticism of the conventional wisdom that keeps much of the country—and much of Pennsylvania—in a state of perpetual pseudo-lockdown limbo. Toomey in recent days hosted a roundtable with medical and economic experts presenting for U.S. senators actual data about the virus, bringing together top medical and scientific officials from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC)—Pennsylvania’s largest hospital system—and Stanford University, Duke University, and New York University. “Let me start with my starting premise and that is there was a very specific reason why we shut down our economy,” Toomey told Breitbart News on Friday. “Think about how drastic and draconian a step that was. It was completely unprecedented in American history to just forbid economic activity. We did it for one reason. That was to slow down the rate of the transmission of the virus, not to stop it altogether—nobody thought that was possible, but to slow it down so that we wouldn’t have such a rapid surge of sick people that they would overwhelm our hospitals’ capacity to treat them. That was the reason. It is now absolutely clear that there is no danger of overwhelming our hospitals. In fact, the vast majority of hospitals in Pennsylvania are mostly empty. UPMC is the biggest hospital system in all of Pennsylvania, and one of the bigger systems in the country. They have 5,500 hospital beds. They have 40 COVID patients. So, there is no chance of overwhelming the hospitals. Therefore, since the whole reason of depriving everyone in Pennsylvania of an income and a livelihood is no longer a risk, why are we still doing it?” Toomey’s state of Pennsylvania has begun, under Democrat Gov. Wolf’s plan, a long, slow reopening process as of Friday. On Friday morning, Wolf rolled back restrictions in about a third of the state—in 24 counties total—mostly in the northwestern rural part of the state. Wolf’s reopening plan has three color-coded phases. The lockdown phase, where most of the state remains, is the red phase. The first phase of reopening is yellow, and then eventually certain counties will move to green after some time in the yellow phase. Toomey told Breitbart News that Wolf’s plan does not move fast enough, and that he believes the science supports safely reopening the vast majority of Pennsylvania right now. “We need to get on with the business of reopening our economy,” Toomey said. “Here’s another very important factor in all of this, it’s now increasingly obvious what was not entirely obvious when this outbreak began and that is this is a disease of the elderly and the ill. In Pennsylvania, 68 percent of all fatalities have happened inside nursing homes. So it’s the most vulnerable subset of the most vulnerable subset—in other words, the nursing home residents of the elderly population, those are the ones who are extremely vulnerable. By all means, we should be doing everything we can to protect them. But the vast majority of people are not vulnerable. So I’ve advocated a phased reopening of our economy. I think that actually most of Pennsylvania, a large majority of Pennsylvania, could be substantially reopened. We’re not moving as quickly as we should and could and need to to allow people to restore their livelihoods.” Toomey said that scientifically the virus has not been even close to what many doom-predicting experts had feared would be the worst case scenario. He said that while it clearly poses a high risk for elderly and vulnerable communities, especially for people in nursing homes, he believes U.S. policymakers have not effectively balanced the science—especially as new information, data, and facts have changed the way doctors are looking at the bigger picture—with economic impact. “I think that’s hard to say and I don’t want to speak for him,” Toomey said when asked if Wolf is denying the scientific data that is informing his push to reopen Pennsylvania faster. “The science is an essential ingredient in our decision-making, in our input, but it doesn’t have the answer. The question that we’re posing is how do we weigh these tradeoffs between a maybe slightly lower rate of infection that’s going to happen anyway if we stay locked down versus all the carnage we’re doing by virtue of staying locked down including increases in diseases of despair like depression and alcohol and drug abuse and suicide that comes from people who have lost their livelihoods and lost their prospects of getting a job? How about all the businesses who are failing and will never come back? Medical science doesn’t have an opinion about how you weigh those things. But for elected officeholders, that’s our job—to weigh these competing claims or demands or interests and try to make a judgment about how to go forward. I think we are not making a good judgment about that right now, because we’re overstating the danger of the virus—that’s not to minimize it. Obviously, it’s lethal for people who are vulnerable to it. But it’s not lethal to everyone and in fact it’s not lethal to the vast majority of people. The danger is we’re overstating the risks of that, and we’re underestimating the damage that’s being done by a closed economy and I’m trying to strike what I think is an appropriate balance.” On that note, regarding the lethality of coronavirus for the elderly in nursing homes, Toomey has put forward a bipartisan op-ed with his state’s Democrat Sen. Casey to aim to reduce nursing home deaths. Toomey is correct that the virus has not met expectations of the worst of much of the scientific community’s original projections. Modelers from Imperial College U.K. to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington—and more—have been consistently wrong throughout the process. IHME has even changed its models repeatedly. But perhaps most importantly, as Toomey’s roundtable with the doctors about the science of this disease showed in particular with regard to the greater Pittsburgh area, the data from reality shows that most of the predictions were wrong. During that roundtable, Dr. Steven Shapiro, the executive vice president and chief medical and scientific officer for UPMC, laid out how a “surge” of COVID-19 patients never came to the state of Pennsylvania. “As we prepared for the pandemic, we radically transformed our hospital operations to create a safe environment for patients and staff, we delayed non-urgent surgery, reducing it by 70%, and we scaled up telemedicine 38-fold, performing 250,000 visits in April,” Dr. Shapiro said of UPMC’s COVID-19 preparations in a release about Toomey’s roundtable. “We indeed saw a steady stream of patients but never ‘surged.’ At peak in mid-April, COVID-19 patients occupied 2% of our 5,500 hospital beds and 48 of our 750 ventilators. Subsequently, admissions have been decreasing with very few patients now coming from the community, almost all now being from nursing homes. Of note, in the 36 UPMC-owned senior facilities we have had zero positive cases.” Also during the roundtable, Dr. John Ioannidis of Stanford University—a world-renowned epidemiologist—laid out how the science demonstrates that many more people than thought have been infected with COVID-19, which means the mortality rate and risk to the broader population is significantly less than originally predicted. Dr. Ioannidis cited a number of serology surveys that show much broader swaths of the population had COVID-19 and did not even know it, which means the disease is far less deadly than some had originally thought. Toomey told Breitbart News he is of the belief that when making decisions that are so impactful on people’s lives, lawmakers should have all these facts and views—rather than selectively cherry-picking ones that fit their worldview. While Toomey invited his Democrat colleagues in the U.S. Senate to participate in the roundtable to get advice and information from the scientists and medical and economic experts, only Republican senators ended up joining him. “In the end it was only Republicans,” Toomey said. “We had Dr. Romer, who’s a Nobel-winning economist. We had Dr. Ioannidis. We had Dr. Shapiro who is in a senior position at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, a practicing medical doctor and also administers a very substantial part of their portfolio. So you’re right, these four scientists, these four professionals and we ought to be listening to a wide range of opinions. Dr. Ioannidis, he made some very interesting observations. He said we are over counting the number of COVID deaths and he had a very cogent explanation for why that’s likely to be the case. He also believes that we are probably dramatically underestimating the number of people who have been infected. But so many people are infected and are asymptomatic you’d never know they were infected. That’s actually very good news because it suggests that the lethality of this virus is very much less than we’ve been thinking. Not all doctors share his views, but he is an eminently qualified trained professional universally cited in epidemiological studies. We ought to be listening to what he has to say also. So that was part of my purpose, let’s have this discussion. I thought it was a very constructive conversation, and it also points in the direction that we ought to be in the process of reopening.” WATCH THE WHOLE ROUNDTABLE HERE FROM SEN. TOOMEY’S YOUTUBE PAGE:  Toomey also is one of if not the only member of Congress who has released a plan to reopen his or her state’s economy, and his plan would open Pennsylvania much more quickly than Wolf’s plan is doing. He thinks that in some places, members of Congress will start following his lead and challenging their governors to be more responsive to the emerging science demonstrating that it is safe to reopen their economies. “I think it really varies state by state,” Toomey said when asked if he expects others in Congress to follow his idea of offering a counter-plan to the governor’s plan. “There’s states that have had virtually no impact at all from the coronavirus and other states have been hit hard and governors have responded very differently. I would say it really depends on the state.” In the case of Pennsylvania, particularly, Toomey also noted that Wolf had no plan before Toomey developed and was rolling his out all the way back in mid-April—and that the news of his then-forthcoming plan forced Wolf’s hand into moving to reopen some of the state from the perpetual lockdown. As such, while Wolf did ease restrictions in some of Pennsylvania on Friday, this week he also extended the lockdown in other parts of the state all the way out until early June—something Toomey says makes not much sense as he believes most of Pennsylvania is ready to reopen now and all of it should be ready sooner than Wolf is saying. “In my case, I began working on my plan because the governor had not released one. There was no plan,” Toomey said. “And, I completed my plan and announced that I would be releasing it the next day, and that afternoon that we started lining up the press conference for the following day the governor then announced a press conference that night and he then released a plan. Well, okay, that’s good and that’s progress. But part of the impetus of my doing a plan is because Pennsylvania did not have one. Then the reason I’ve continued to weigh in on this is I think our governor’s plan moves just way too slowly. Look, as you know, having never been through this before, there’s no plan on the shelf. Nobody ever contemplated the government shutting down our economy. It’s just so bizarre and so unprecedented. So there’s no plan for how you restore the economy. I think it’s something we’ve got to have a vigorous debate about, and I feel like I have a point of view and I have an opportunity to get input from a tremendous wide range of really valuable sources all over Pennsylvania and beyond and so I’ve got a responsibility to lay out a vision, a process, a mechanism by which we restore our ability to have a livelihood.”

Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) urged Congress on Friday to pass a jobs bill to support businesses to rehire Americans that have been laid off and support payrolls to protect American jobs. “Jobless numbers soar to century-long high,” Hawley wrote on Friday. “I urge Congress to take up jobs legislation now along the lines I have proposed: support for business to rehire all workers laid off and support for payrolls to protect jobs through this crisis. Workers need help now.” Jobless numbers soar to century-long high. I urge Congress to take up jobs legislation now along the lines I have proposed: support for business to rehire all workers laid off and support for payrolls to protect jobs through this crisis. Workers need help now https://t.co/xP6nRyIkET — Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) May 8, 2020  Hawley’s comment follows as the American economy lost over 20 million jobs in April, and the American unemployment rate rose to 14.7 percent. This surpasses the 2008 Great Recession. Hawley proposed his phase four coronavirus bill in April, which would put Americans back to work and bring back American manufacturing. Hawley’s proposal would offer immediate payroll support for the duration of the coronavirus outbreak by: Hawley wrote in his proposal: As layoffs mount, the time has come for bold action by the federal government to halt the damage to American workers and position the American economy for a comeback once the nation has defeated COVID19. This effort should include a major initiative to rehire workers now—and to keep them on payroll for the duration of this crisis. And it should include new measures to bring critical supply chains back to this country from China and elsewhere and to encourage domestic production. The rationale is simple. Workers should not be forced into unemployment because of the government’s health measures prompted by this crisis. Workers should be able to keep their jobs, and be ready to get back to work as soon as practicable. Art Laffer, a member of President Donald Trump’s economic recovery task force and former economic adviser to President Ronald Reagan, endorsed Hawley’s plan to rehire American workers. Laffer and Jon Hartley wrote in April: Senator Josh Hawley, R-Mo., has now proposed a payroll tax rebate that covers 80 percent of payroll expenses while Canada and the UK are now implementing wage subsidies where employees receive 75 percent and 80 percent of their paycheck respectively albeit in the form of tax credits. A recurring biweekly payroll subsidy (rather than a one-time tax credit) would be faster and likely help boost spending because of what behavioral economists call “mental accounting,” that is people are more likely to spend something that they see as a permanent income boost to their income. “The moment for action is now,” Hawley concluded in his proposal. “It’s time to end the partisan bickering over special interest giveaways and ideological wish lists. There can be only one priority now: facilitating the American comeback.” Sean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter @SeanMoran3.

The number of fatalities tied to Coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to rise in Mexico as the nation braces for its projected peak this coming weekend. The most recent figures from Mexico’s Health Secretariat show a total of 2,961 fatalities and 29,616 confirmed cases. Al 07 de mayo de 2020 hay 29,616 casos confirmados, 7,802 confirmados activos y 18,812 sospechosos por #COVID19. Se han registrado 68,783 negativos, 2,961 defunciones confirmadas, 245 defunciones sospechosas y fueron estudiadas 117,211 personas. 1/3 pic.twitter.com/pZGs0AA35o — Hugo López-Gatell Ramírez (@HLGatell) May 8, 2020  Even though Mexico’s Undersecretary of Health has admitted to undercounting confirmed cases, Lopez Gatell forecasts the coming weekend of May 8-10 as the peak of the pandemic. The figures released daily by Lopez Gatell only reflect government hospital patients. The practice has led several state governments to release local figures, which can show nearly twice the confirmed federal cases. During his nightly news conferences, the health official said the time of maximum contagion will start on Friday, May 8, and then begin to decline. Those claims come as Lopez Gatell and President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador claimed to have “flattened the curve.” The claims are questionable since Mexico, which has an estimated population of 129 million, has only conducted 117,211 tests. In comparison, Texas with an estimated population of 29 million, has conducted four times as many tests and shows 35,390 confirmed cases. Even with four times the number of tests and more confirmed cases, Texas has one-third of the fatalities of Mexico. Ildefonso Ortiz is an award-winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.

The New York Times came under fire Friday for an article and an accompanying tweet in which it claimed that Israel’s defense ministry “is best known for pioneering cutting-edge ways to kill people and blow things up.” The remark came in the lede paragraph of an article by David M. Halbfinger, the Times‘ Jerusalem bureau chief, about how Israel’s Ministry of Defense is leading national research and development efforts on the coronavirus. The article, headlined “Israeli Army’s Idea Lab Aims at a New Target: Saving Lives,” begins (emphasis added): JERUSALEM — The Israeli Defense Ministry’s research-and-development arm is best known for pioneering cutting-edge ways to kill people and blow things up, with stealth tanks and sniper drones among its more lethal recent projects. But its latest mission is lifesaving. Since March, it has been spearheading a sprawling, high-speed effort to unleash some of the country’s most advanced technologies against an enemy of another kind: Covid-19. The Times echoed that language in a tweet promoting the article: The Israeli Defense Ministry’s research-and-development arm is best known for pioneering cutting-edge ways to kill people and blow things up. Now it is turning to saving lives. https://t.co/uxIvDLf4nB — The New York Times (@nytimes) May 8, 2020  Critics suggested on social media that the Times‘ flippant language evoked false claims by Israel’s enemies that it tries to kill people. There’s a lot of debate going on over this tweet. https://t.co/JSgYHsqpjN — The Forward (@jdforward) May 8, 2020  Media coverage in the Arab world routinely accuses Israel of killing Palestinian civilians, for example. In 2002, Palestinian official Saeb Erekat falsely claimed that Israel had massacred 500 civilians in the town of Jenin. The United Nations — no great friend of Israel — investigated and confirmed that Erekat’s claim was a lie. Even more notorious was the supposed murder by Israel of a Palestinian child, Muhammad Al-Dura, during the opening days of the second Palestinian intifada. Years of investigation led to the Muhammad Al-Dura that Al-Dura’s death was likely a hoax. However, the false claim became accepted dogma throughout the Arab world, entrenching anti-Israel hostility. However, some cautioned against reading too much into a sentence that may have been merely flippant: The critics of the tweet seem to me to be implying, ironically, that Israel doesn't have the right to kill people and blow things up in self defense, or to be arguing, wrongly, that the New York Times can't point out that it does. — Batya Ungar-Sargon (@bungarsargon) May 8, 2020  Israeli scientists have announced several breakthroughs this week in discovering antibodies to coronavirus, which many hope will lead to new treatments to contain the illness.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) declared the “climate crisis” the “greatest challenge facing humanity” on Thursday, as millions of Americans — and billions of people across the globe — attempt to rebuild and economically recover from the ravages of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. “The climate crisis is the greatest challenge facing humanity, and the Trump administration is doing all it can to cause as much damage as possible,” Sanders said on Thursday, appealing to a New York Times piece tallying the Trump administration’s rollbacks of environmental rules. “We need a Green New Deal,” the former presidential hopeful added: The climate crisis is the greatest challenge facing humanity, and the Trump administration is doing all it can to cause as much damage as possible. We need a Green New Deal. https://t.co/2itGZjJtQS — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) May 7, 2020  Several social media users balked at the Vermont senator’s suggestion. “Have you met #COVID19 or better yet the Wuhan Chinese virus???” one asked. “Dude we need to make sure people don’t die of corona right now! Climate can wait,” another remarked. “Is this a joke???????” one asked. This is hardly the first time progressives have tried to shift the focus during the pandemic and economic crisis to their climate change agenda. In March, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) offered the Democrats’ version of a coronavirus relief bill. It included Green New Deal initiatives, such as “increased fuel emission standards for airlines receiving funds and carbon offsets” and the “expansion of wind and solar tax credits,” as detailed by Breitbart News. Green New Deal advocate and Sanders supporter Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) on Thursday lamented the scheduled JetBlue flyover in New York to salute healthcare workers, citing air pollution and its effects on vulnerable communities. “Nothing like a corporate PR campaign that burns jet fuel at low altitudes over vulnerable communities dying from a respiratory virus that compounds on our preexisting and disproportionate exposure to air pollution to show healthcare workers we care,” she wrote: Nothing like a corporate PR campaign that burns jet fuel at low altitudes over vulnerable communities dying from a respiratory virus that compounds on our preexisting and disproportionate exposure to air pollution to show healthcare workers we care https://t.co/xyCr3tojgn — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) May 7, 2020  The New York lawmaker came under fire last month after praising the historic drop in oil prices, using it as a pitch for the investment of green infrastructure to “save our planet.” “You absolutely love to see it,” she said in a now-deleted tweet. “This along with record low interest rates means it’s the right time for a worker-led, mass investment in green infrastructure to save our planet.” The progressive calls to take aggressive climate action come as Americans slowly move to recover from the weeks-long economic standstill spurred by the coronavirus and subsequent lockdown orders. The unemployment rate jumped to 14.7 percent last month. The U.S. lost 20.5 million jobs in April alone, according to Department of Labor data released Friday.

An elderly woman in Webster, New York, is feeling loved after her community gave her a huge surprise on Thursday. When Mary Jane Hastings tested positive for the coronavirus nearly two weeks ago, her family began to worry, according to USA Today.  “We were scared to death. It was our worst nightmare,” said Hastings’ daughter Linda, who is one of her eight children. Prior to her diagnosis, Hastings’ brother, Joe Maid, passed away after contracting the illness. He was 98-years-old. Although Hastings was in overall good health, she did have mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) which caused Linda and her siblings concern that if their mom got the virus, she would not recover. “Older adults and people who have severe underlying medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes seem to be at higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness,” according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, following ten days at Highland Hospital, the great grandmother made a full recovery and was sent home on Tuesday to the Sage Harbor at Baywinde assisted living facility, according to WHEC. “She really is remarkable,” Linda said of her beloved mom. To celebrate Hastings’ monumental birthday and her victory over the disease, friends and family members organized a huge parade that took place on Thursday. Video footage showed a line of cars decorated with signs and balloons as they drove past the facility to honor her. Included in the parade was a West Webster fire truck, a Monroe County Sheriff’s vehicle, and ambulances from Penfield Ambulance and North East Quadrant ALS. During the event, Hastings watched from her window and waved as the drivers honked and wished her a happy birthday. “Just so happy that she’s pulled through this,” said Hastings’ son, Paul. “She’s such a strong woman, and it’s not exactly the birthday party we wanted to throw for her, but the turnout so far is great,” he concluded.

German police in Berlin raided the homes of several known Islamic extremists on suspicion of involvement in fraudulently claiming Wuhan coronavirus aid benefits. The raids involved at least five suspects, all of which are said to be hardcore members of the Islamist Salafist community. They are also linked to the radical Fussilet mosque that was also connected to Berlin Christmas market terrorist and Tunisian failed asylum seeker Anis Amri. A suspect named Walid S., according to a report from Tagesspiegel, was a close confidant of Amri. Walid S. was also said to have been at the scene of the terror attack shortly after it had occurred. He had also been investigated in 2018 by police who believed he was plotting an attack on the Berlin half-marathon. Radical Swiss Imam Faces Allegations of Welfare Benefit Fraud https://t.co/gemWUEC1Ka — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 5, 2019  In total, investigators say that the five suspects defrauded the German government of around €94,000 (£82,100/$102,000). The Attorney General stated on Thursday that the suspects had been “fraudulently requesting and receiving partial emergency corona help for small businesses from Investitionsbank Berlin, even though they were not entitled to such aid payments”. Salafist Yunis M. is said to have requested money for a hairdresser and sushi restaurant. Another suspect applied for €9,000 (£7,900/$9,800) five times for an internet cafe business and received €14,000 (£12,000/$15,000) from the government. The investigation into the fraud began with information gained from another case of benefit fraud involving an Islamist hate preacher. Abul Barra and his partner had received €18,000 (£15,700/$19,500) in aid for a shop that had been closed since 2019. Norbert Cioma, head of the police union in Berlin, praised the cooperation between police and Investitionsbank Berlin (IBB) but also added: “On the other hand, it becomes clear once again that organised crime and terrorism have strong points of contact.” Benefit fraud is nothing new for radical Islamic extremists across Europe and has been used by many as a tactic to fund their activities. Terror Trial Suspects Radicalised at Same Mosque Attended by Berlin Terrorist  https://t.co/PRwKeePK2z — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 16, 2018  Last year in Switzerland, radical imam Abu Ramadan was accused of engaging in fraud to the amount of 590,000 Swiss francs (£455,335/$596,700) between 2003 and 2017. Sweden has had similar problems, particularly with Islamists who left the country to join Islamic State overseas but who were still able to claim welfare benefits from the Swedish state.

Today is the 75th anniversary of VE Day — Victory in Europe Day — and to read some of the comments on social media, you’d think that the defeat of the Nazis was a uniquely left-wing achievement. Conservatives, they seem to imagine, had nothing to do with it because conservatives are literally Hitler. 75 years ago today Berlin fell.. by no means the end of fascism or Nazism but a key moment for #antifascism pic.twitter.com/9UlH35swzQ — John Colbert – #SHEDLIFE (@swlondonbloke) May 3, 2020  But that’s certainly not how it seemed at the time to the economist and political philosopher FA Hayek. In his book The Road To Serfdom — published in 1944, while the war was still raging — Hayek made little distinction between Nazism and Communism. Both, he argued, were ‘totalitarian’, ‘collectivist’ ideologies inimical to freedom and prosperity. Nazis and Communists, as far Hayek was concerned, were just different ends of the same turd. Since today is not just VE Day but also Hayek’s birthday, it might be worth speculating on what he would have made of the strange, strange world we inhabit today. There are lots of clues in The Road To Serfdom, which he wrote partly as a warning to Britain that its wartime regime was itself straying dangerously close to the authoritarianism of the Axis powers it was trying to defeat. He wrote: The conviction grows that if efficient planning is to be done, the direction must be ‘taken out of politics’ and placed in the hands of ‘experts’, permanent officials or independent autonomous bodies. This, of course, is exactly what is happening now: governments from Britain to the U.S. are contracting out decisions that should be made by democratically elected politicians to unelected experts such as Anthony Fauci and the SAGE committee. He wrote: The belief is becoming more and more widespread that, if things are to get done, the responsible authorities must be freed from the fetters of democratic procedure. Even before the 2020 pandemic crisis, this view was becoming increasingly fashionable not just on the left but among centrists and squishy conservatives too: the idea that maybe free markets were too messy, chaotic, unfair, inefficient and that perhaps we ought to look to countries like China for our political and economic example. Since the pandemic, this tendency has become even more widespread with lots of people strangely addicted to being put under effective house arrest by their governments, despite a worrisome lack of evidence that this is the best response to the problem. In 1944, the pretext for abandoning democracy was the war; today, it’s the coronavirus. Hayek, I’m sure, would have been tempted to mutter to himself: “Any excuse will do.” Maybe this is the real lesson we should learn from the Second World War on the 75th anniversary of VE Day. We may have defeated Hitler but the authoritarian, collectivist tendency he embodied is alive and well and thriving everywhere from the hard left to fake conservative governments like cuddly Boris Johnson’s. Hayek was right. Why didn’t we listen? James Delingpole is the Host of the Delingpod podcast; support his Patreon here.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) on Thursday identified a nail salon as the first instance of community spread of the Chinese coronavirus in the state. “This whole thing started in the state of California, the first community spread, in a nail salon,” Newsom said during Thursday’s press briefing in Sacramento, explaining his reasoning for ordering salons to remain closed in the first two phases of the state’s reopening. “I just want to remind everybody of that, and that I’m very worried about that,” he continued, adding that many salons had already added additional safety precautions like masks, gloves, and increased sanitization. “That has to all be factored in, and candidly our health directors — the experts, the council that I’ve received — are very worried about moving precipitously into that next phase,” he said. “We hope to get it in the next new phase shortly, but right now all of our health indicators and health directives that I received from health directors across the state put some red flags in that space,” Newsom added. Michelle Saunders James, owner of Saunders & James Nail Care in Oakland, was taken aback by the governor’s explanation of the first case of community spread occurring at a nail salon. “Had they known that this was the situation, absolutely zero information was ever sent to any nail care people in the industry at all,” she said, according to CNBC. “It was very scary to hear that.” The Golden State moved into the second phase or reopening on Friday, which opens “lower risk” workplaces and public spaces. However, the state warns that this “isn’t a return to normal”: CA will begin moving into stage 2 of modifying the stay-at-home order starting tomorrow. 🚫 This isn't a return to normal.✅ Retail, with curbside pickup, and associated supply chains can reopen with modifications that follow NEW state guidance.https://t.co/snYe5v55Rw pic.twitter.com/Pif27PubYL — Office of the Governor of California (@CAgovernor) May 7, 2020  NEW: Today CA released guidance for some lower risk industries to begin re-opening.

It’s a new normal with adaptations and modifications, until we get to immunity and a vaccine,” he said on Tuesday. California had 60,614 confirmed cases of the virus and 2,504 related deaths as of Thursday, according to the California Health and Human Services Agency.

Former Vice President Joe Biden sounded class warfare themes in an economic speech streamed live on Twitter on Friday, accusing President Donald Trump of favoring “the wealthy” even before the coronavirus pandemic. Biden was speaking in the wake of the April jobs report, which reported that 20.5 million Americans had lost their jobs that month, spiking unemployment to 14.7% (from a 50-year low of 3.5% just two months before).  Holding a face mask draped over a pen in his left hand, and reading from a script evidently placed slightly off-camera, Biden labored through a presentation that sought to portray Trump as a plutocrat serving his cronies. He claimed that Trump’s economic policies had “three unmistakable failings.” First, he said, Trump viewed the economy “only” through the stock market’s performance, claiming Trump had delayed reacting to the virus “to protect the Dow Jones average.” Second, he said, Trump’s “entire economic strategy is focused on helping the wealthy and big corporations,” citing the 2017 tax reform bill (which, in fact, raised taxes on the rich in places). He claimed Trump had created incentives to shift jobs overseas (when, in fact, Trump had done the opposite). Third, Biden said, Trump had failed the middle class. He claimed Trump had neglected the “unforgotten middle class” — then corrected himself, declaring that Trump “immediately forgot them once he got elected.” Biden seemed to admit that Trump had started out well, but claimed his economic policies were failing before the coronavirus pandemic struck: “The numbers looked good, but underneath those numbers, things were eroding.” He accused Trump of running a “corrupt recovery,” alleging that the president had steered relief funds to his political donors and cronies, while the “mom and pop shops that needed help got the most shut out.” Biden did not offer an alternative plan of his own. He promised to produce a “detailed plan” at a later time, promising that it would be devoted to “rebuilding the backbone of this country: a stronger, more inclusive, more resilient middle class.” His economic plan would include “making sure everyone has paid sick leave, and child care support,” Biden said, and would “rip out race-based inequities from every part of our society.” “We can choose who our economy … works for: just the wealthy, or everyone else as well,” Biden concluded.

Friday on ABC’s “The View,” Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) accused President Donald Trump of being “repulsively ridiculous” in his tweets and demeanor, which the New Jersey senator claimed is turning the country into a “perverse Hunger Games.” Booker said, “We need to listen to medical professionals. Listen to the scientists. We have a CDC for a reason. And to ignore the common sense things that they’re saying that even — I have talked to people in the private sector who are abiding by so many of those rules and concern that if we open too early like we did back in 1918, the second wave was worse than the first which cost your economy even more. We have got to do this right. What really frustrates me is that I hear people using militaristic terms. This is a war. I’ve heard people say that. If that’s the case, what we should be doing is not having this kind of perverse Hunger Games where you have literally governors competing against each other for the critical resources they need. We didn’t do that in World War II. We had a national mobilization to meet the threat to our nation. ” He continued, “This is a president who is trying to say, this is still like the articles of Confederation, all the states are on their own. No. We’re the United States of America. This president should be stepping up, using the Defense Production Act, and more to make sure that we are producing the materials we need to get out of this. Everybody knows we need testing, contact tracing, to make sure that we are apportioning it correctly, making sure we are actually having supply chains that serve the purpose of this country which should be, yes, to get back to business, but first and foremost, to protect human life.” He added, “This is a failure of leadership. It’s a shame because I’ve seen 9/11, Hurricane Sandy —I don’t care Republican or Democrat, Chris Christie rose to the challenge, even Giuliani who was at dead approval ratings in New York, during that challenge at least he could rise up to the call to the patriotism of this nation. Our president now is demeaning, degrading, divisive, insulting people, calling out governors, tweeting out the most repulsively ridiculous things about liberating states when we want to keep human lives safe. He seems to want to try to trigger partisan animosity to better help his re-election. We need leadership on the national level, and I’m frustrated how this president is not rising to this occasion, one of the few world leaders whose approval rating is actually going down.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

ABC’s left-wing late-night host Jimmy Kimmel is getting blasted for airing a deceptively edited video implying that Vice President Mike Pence was faking his recent effort to help a healthcare facility. In addition to social media backlash, journalists at NBC News and BuzzFeed News called out Kimmel for putting out “misleading” and “selective” video, adding that the original C-SPAN footage disproves his claim. Vice President Pence was seen on Thursday delivering boxes of personal protection equipment to a healthcare facility in Alexandria, Virginia. At the end of the version that aired on ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel Live!, the vice president is heard saying, “Well, can I carry the empty ones? Just for the camera?” Kimmel then chimed in: “Mike Pence pretending to carry empty boxes of PPE’s into a hospital is the perfect metaphor for who he is and what he’s doing — a big box of nothing delivering another box of nothing.” But the longer C-SPAN version of the video tells a different story than the one Kimmel was spinning. In the original footage, Pence appears to make his remark as a joke before closing a van door and leaving the empty boxes for someone else to carry. NBC News investigative reporter Emmanuelle Saliba tweeted: “I went back to the original @cspan footage and sounds like @VP was making a joke about the empty boxes. He doesn’t carry those last boxes. He shuts the van doors and turns to speak CEO of @fedresources.” Edit is misleading.  I went back to the original @cspan footage and sounds like @VP was making a joke about the empty boxes.  He doesn't carry those last boxes. He shuts the van doors and turns to speak CEO of @fedresources I isolated the clip here:   https://t.co/GQQTE2D6Ki https://t.co/1apBTVlBw3 — Emmanuelle Saliba  (@_esaliba) May 8, 2020  Likewise, BuzzFeed deputy director of breaking news David Mack noted that Kimmel’s version of the video omits crucial context. “The clip cuts out at a selective point. When you watch the CSPAN footage (9 min in), Pence makes the crack about carrying the empty ones and the guy says ‘Absolutely. They’re a lot easier!’ Pence laughs then immediately shuts the van door.” This isn't true. The clip cuts out at a selective point. When you watch the CSPAN footage (9 min in), Pence makes the crack about carrying the empty ones and the guy says "Absolutely. They're a lot easier!" Pence laughs then immediately shuts the van door. https://t.co/SOD5KAAPkH https://t.co/1ZODmvg2PG — David Mack (@davidmackau) May 8, 2020  Kimmel’s deceptively edited video went viral after it aired late Thursday thanks in large part to a tweet by a pollster named Matt McDermott who wrote, “Mike Pence caught on hot mic delivering empty boxes of PPE for a PR stunt.” McDermott works for the polling and political advisory firm Whitman Insight Strategies, which has close ties to Democrat candidates. He is also on the campaign board for the LGBTQ Victory Fund, a PAC dedicated to electing gay public officials. In the past, McDermott has used his Twitter account to accuse Vice President Pence and his wife, Karen Pence, of homophobia and bigotry toward gays. Karen Pence literally works at a school where Pete Buttigieg isn’t allowed to be employed, simply because he’s gay.  Karen Pence is a homophobe and the press should start saying so frankly. https://t.co/cCr5J8oEuP — Matt McDermott (@mattmfm) April 10, 2019  Mike Pence uses his religious beliefs to justify his bigotry towards gay people. That’s his prerogative, but it’s still bigotry. — Matt McDermott (@mattmfm) April 11, 2019  Still, the political and Hollywood left fell for Kimmel’s deception and attacked Pence. I see Mike Pence is full of shit as usual… https://t.co/6p6utItmz2 — James Carville (@JamesCarville) May 8, 2020  *chefs kiss https://t.co/414LC7o6K7 — Zach Braff (@zachbraff) May 8, 2020  Jimmy Kimmel has often used his perch at Disney-owned ABC to mock President Trump as well as member of his administration and family.

Neighbors in Wilkes County, North Carolina, made sure a young man had a birthday to remember on Tuesday. When the coronavirus pandemic ruined Evan Daemer’s plans to celebrate his 23rd birthday at a park with his friends from school and the Special Olympics, his family decided to ask the community for help, according to WBAL-TV. “We posted a Facebook status about everyone sending him birthday cards since we were not able to do a party. He received over 70 plus cards and packages,” said his sister, Felisha Daemer. Since her brother loves cars and birthdays, the Daemer family got the idea to combine the two into one big surprise for Evan and asked their neighbors for help on Facebook. “We then thought a car parade would be perfect for him,” Felisha explained. Video footage caught the moment when neighbors and friends drove past Evan’s home on Tuesday in vehicles decorated with brightly colored signs and streamers. “People showed up to the parade that we didn’t even know. They just saw the Facebook post and showed up. There were about 15-20 cars packed with people screaming, ‘Happy Birthday!’ as they drove by,” Felisha recalled. “Evan was so happy to see everyone driving by and wishing him a happy birthday. He even cried from happiness,” she continued. The North Wilkesboro Police Department (NWPD) and firefighters from the North Wilkesboro Fire Department also took part in the surprise parade. “This quarantine has been so rough on everyone. I can only imagine how tough it would be to have a birthday and not have friends and family to gather in celebration. I was happy to participate and help spread a little joy in someone’s life,” said NWPD Patrol Officer Allison Sheets. Following the event, Evan could not find the words to describe how wonderful his birthday had turned out. “Was that awesome?” Felisha asked as she hugged him and smiled. Thursday, Evan expressed his gratitude to everyone for making his day so special in a video posted to YouTube. “Thank everybody and their cars,” he said.

The overwhelming majority of Americans who lost their jobs in April say they have only been temporarily laid off or furloughed. The government’s report on employment for April showed a loss of 20.5 million nonfarm jobs and unemployment rose to 14.7 percent, both record highs. Out of the around 20.6 million Americans who lost their jobs in April, nearly 18 million say they have only been temporarily laid off. Just 2 million said they believe their layoff is permanent. That’s 78.3 percent of the newly jobless who say they expect to get their job back. Typically, most workers describe their job loss as permanent. In January, 2.6 million people reported losing a job and just 742,000 described the loss of temporary, a 12.6 percent expected return rate. The headline figure of job losses is taken from the government’s “establishment” survey. It is a net figure that includes both jobs eliminated and jobs added. It can differ from the total number of people losing jobs for the month, which comes from a survey of households. This month the establishment survey had total employment contracting by 20.5 and the household survey had 20.6 million losing jobs on a seasonally adjusted basis. The high number of the newly unemployed who expect to be rehired could provide additional support for the economy. People who consider their own joblessness only temporary and have access to unemployment benefits are more likely to maintain higher levels of economic activity and consumer spending that those who see the loss of their job as permanent. That’s even more true now that the federal government is bolstering unemployment benefits so that many workers will see little or no income loss despite being laid off–and some will actually be paid more while unemployed. That spending will likely support the incomes of still-employed workers and help keep businesses from failing, which would keep job losses lower than they otherwise would have been.

A staffer to Vice President Mike Pence has tested positive for the Chinese coronavirus Friday, one day after the White House confirmed that a personal valet to President Donald Trump contracted the deadly illness, according to Bloomberg News. The infection has delayed Pence’s planned visit to Iowa by an hour. Several staffers temporarily disembarked Air Force 2, though it’s reportedly “wheels up now” for the key battleground state. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue along with Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Joni Ernst (R-IA) are traveling with the vice president to the Hawkeye State from Washington, D.C. NEWS: Pence flight to Iowa delayed an hour after a staffer tested positive for coronavirus, I’m told. Some aides disembarked AF2. Wheels up now for Iowa. — Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) May 8, 2020  On Wednesday, President Trump was briefed that one of his valets tested positive for the coronavirus, prompting him and the vice president to once again get tested for the disease. Both have since tested negative for the virus. “We were recently notified by the White House Medical Unit that a member of the United States Military, who works on the White House campus, has tested positive for Coronavirus,” White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley told CNN in a statement. “The President and the Vice President have since tested negative for the virus and they remain in great health.” The White House is using Abbott Labs tests that can deliver results in under 15 minutes. In March, a Pence staffer tested positive for the coronavirus. Their identity remains unknown.  The White House has taken a series of precautions to protect White House officials from the virus, including administering tests to individuals working closely with President Trump and Vice President Pence. 

The NFL is determined to play its 2020 regular-season schedule, and as proof of that, the league released its schedule Thursday night. However, that doesn’t mean they’re not planning for contingencies related to the coronavirus. Along with releasing the schedule, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell released a statement saying that the league “will continue to make our decisions based on the latest medical and public health advice, in compliance with government regulations, and with appropriate safety protocols to protect the health of our fans, players, club and league personnel, and our communities.” “The release of the NFL schedule is something our fans eagerly anticipate every year, as they look forward with hope and optimism to the season ahead,” Goodell wrote. “In preparing to play the season as scheduled, we will continue to make our decisions based on the latest medical and public health advice, in compliance with government regulations, and with appropriate safety protocols to protect the health of our fans, players, club and league personnel, and our communities. “We will be prepared to make adjustments as necessary, as we have during this off-season in safely and efficiently conducting key activities such as free agency, the virtual off-season program, and the 2020 NFL draft.” The NFL has openly talked about holding games without fans, at least at the beginning of the season. However, as Pro Football Talk reports, the question of fan attendance will largely be determined by the amount of coronavirus testing available at the start of the season.

Melinda Gates, co-chairman of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, harshly graded President Donald Trump’s response to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, giving his administration a  “D-minus.” “We need leadership at the national level. We lost two months almost now in terms of our national response,” Gates said in a Thursday interview with Politico. Rather than have a national strategy, the United States is employing “50 different homegrown state solutions instead of a national response,” the philanthropist continued. “You know, if we were doing the things that the exemplar countries are doing, like Germany, we would be testing,” she added. “We would be testing, first, health care workers and then the most vulnerable, and you’d be doing contact tracing. And we would be able to start thinking about slowly, slowly reopening places in society in safe and healthy ways, but we have a lack of a coordinated effort. That’s just the truth, across the United States.” The White House issued a statement running counter to Gates’ remarks, saying President Trump has undertaken an “unprecedented approach“ to working with governors and local officials to combat the pandemic.  “The ongoing response to this global pandemic has been about close coordination and partnerships with State and local governments,” said White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere. “The White House has been working with Governors and their teams since January on this whole-of-government response, including supply chains, testing, data-driven guidelines for social distancing, and now a responsible plan to open America again.” This is not the first time that Gates has criticized the Trump administration during the pandemic. In April, the Gates Foundation co-chair said the president’s decision to halt U.S. funds for the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) “makes no sense, while announcing an additional $150 million in funding for coronavirus relief efforts, bringing her foundation’s total contribution to $250 million. “I think it’s worth saying, we’ve been working with the W.H.O. for over 20 years as a foundation. And no institution is perfect, but it’s the global response that’s going to get us through this, and W.H.O. was created after World War II to deal with exactly these kinds of issues around the world. So halting funding right now, that just doesn’t make any sense,” she told ABC News anchor David Muir. As Breitbart News reported, “The W.H.O. claimed in January that ‘preliminary investigations’ by China found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the virus in Wuhan. Further, the organization called on countries to keep borders open despite labeling the massive outbreak a global emergency.” Bill Gates also criticized President Trump’s decision to freeze funding of the W.H.O., labeling the decision as “dangerous.” “Halting funding for the World Health Organization during a world health crisis is as dangerous as it sounds,” Gates wrote on social media. “Their work is slowing the spread of COVID-19 and if that work is stopped no other organization can replace them. The world needs @WHO now more than ever.”

Coronavirus hospital patients in Nigeria broke their quarantine this week to protest the conditions under which they are being kept, including being deprived of food, medicine, and care, Nigerian newspaper Vanguard reported on Wednesday. Two separate demonstrations against the poor treatment of coronavirus patients took place in Gombe, located in northeastern Nigeria, on Tuesday. The first protest occurred at Gombe’s Federal Teaching Hospital. According to Vanguard, the demonstration grew rowdy and some hospital equipment in the patients’ ward was destroyed. The patients who staged the protest are all currently under quarantine at the hospital while they seek treatment there for the Wuhan coronavirus. The protesters complained of negligence by hospital authorities but were reportedly “pacified” by hospital staff after 30 minutes of demonstration. After the event, some officials promised to improve “their welfare,” Nigerian newspaper the Cable reports. The second protest commenced outside Gombe’s Kwadon Isolation Center. There, more coronavirus patients took to the streets claiming they had been ill-treated by hospital staff. This demonstration was larger than the first; participants reportedly blocked a major city intersection while singing anti-government songs. Some patients appeared to use the demonstration as a chance to escape their quarantine, reportedly going to “unknown locations after the protest.” Others returned to the medical facility, Vanguard reports. According to the newspaper, one patient said health officials from the Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) brought him to the Kwadon Isolation Center three days prior and had since “abandoned” him. He said he had not received any medical treatment or drugs and was left alone to share a space with other coronavirus-positive patients. Another patient told Vanguard the only treatment he had received was a Vitamin C supplement given to him once as he entered the facility several days ago. A female patient told the newspaper she was being deprived of food and forced to fast like a Muslim patient during the current Islamic holy month of Ramadan, which prohibits eating and drinking from dawn to dusk. “We that are fasting and those that are not fasting are fed at the same time. It is about 5:00 PM and they are just serving us lunch. This is not fair! They are infringing on our rights,” she said. On Monday, medical doctors in Nigeria went on strike over an insufficient welfare package for medical workers, which failed to protect them from the increased risks of treating coronavirus patients. Nigeria’s government has been accused of downplaying the country’s coronavirus outbreak, with some saying it has reported lower numbers of cases and deaths than exist. At press time on Thursday, Nigeria had officially reported 3,145 infections and 103 deaths from the Wuhan coronavirus.

President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have publicly said the coronavirus could have originated in a Chinese laboratory, leading taxpayer-funded National Public Radio (NPR) to compare that connection to intelligence underpinning the decision to invade Iraq after 9-11. NPR drew this comparison by using sources who question Trump’s relationship with the intelligence community and other critics of the president and his administration: Over the past week, President Trump and his team have repeatedly claimed to have intelligence showing that the new coronavirus accidentally escaped from a lab in China. But an official statement from America’s intelligence chief says there’s not yet conclusive evidence for that theory. Outside scientists, meanwhile, say that the chances of a lab accident are very small, while the odds of a natural infection are high. Some former intelligence officials and independent analysts now say that the disconnect echoes missteps that led to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. While the circumstances are different, the analysts warn that the administration’s continued pursuit of the lab theory could signal an unhealthy relationship between top administration officials and the agencies tasked with giving them information. “President Trump has put a lot of pressure on the intelligence community over the last three years to see the world the way he sees it,” Michael Morell, a former deputy director of the CIA and host of the Intelligence Matters podcast, said in the NPR report. “I am concerned that the president’s pressure may lead intelligence community leaders to say things publicly — or to say things to him — that reinforce what he thinks.” “This thing does not need to have come from a lab in order for there to be a perfectly legitimate case to be made that a lot of this illness and economic devastation is the fault of the Chinese government,” Rebeccah Heinrichs, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute said in the NPR report. “The Chinese city of Wuhan, where the pandemic began, is also home to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a top-tier Chinese research center that studies coronaviruses from bats,” NPR reported. “The SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 is 96 percent similar to a natural bat virus that the institute had on file — leading some to suspect the lab itself could have been the source.” NPR also cited an intelligence community statement that says, while not completely denying the laboratory scenario, concedes the likelihood is small. “The [intelligence community] will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan,” the statement read in part. NPR also interviewed John McLaughlin, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of International Studies. who served as deputy and acting director of the CIA from 2000 to 2004. “What it reminds me of is the dispute between the CIA and parts of the Bush administration over whether there was an operational relationship between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida,” McLaughlin said. “Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Project at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey says that in the case of Iraq, the administration’s interests warped intelligence,” NPR reported. “He fears it could be happening again.” “They are creating these enormous incentives within the intelligence community to tell them what they want to hear, so they can do what they want to do,” Lewis said.

A smaller share of American adults were employed in April than ever before in records going back to 1948. The employment-population ratio, which measures the share of Americans above the age of 16 who are employed, fell to 51.3 percent, the Department of Labor said Friday. A year ago, it was 60.6 percent. The previous low was 55 percent in the summer of 1954. In November 2007, the employment-population ratio was 62.9 percent. This rate fell consistently during the subsequent recession and several months beyond, before stabilizing around 58.5 percent in October 2009. Between October 2009 and March 2014, the ratio remained stubbornly low, fluctuating within 0.3 percentage points of 58.5 percent. It began to climb again in 2014, hitting its post-2008 peak of 61.1 in February of 2020.  The labor force participation rate fell by 2.5 percentage points over the month to 60.2 percent, the lowest rate since January 1973 (when it was 60.0 percent). The unemployment rate jumped to 14.7 percent in April and the economy shed 20.5 million jobs, according to data released by the Department of Labor on Friday. Over the past seven weeks, more than 33 million Americans have filed claims for unemployment benefits. But the number of claims has been declining for five consecutive weeks. The Trump administration successfully pushed Congress to authorize direct payments to U.S. households to support incomes and to raise the amount paid by unemployment benefits by $600 a week, making it possible for some Americans to earn more through losing a job than they made working. The federal government is also backing over $600 billion of loans to small businesses that can be forgiven if those businesses avoid layoffs. The Fed cuts its interest rate target to a range between 0 and 0.25 percent. In addition, it is in the process of launching a number of new lending facilities aimed at providing liquidity to struggling businesses. But loans and direct payments can only go so far to offset orders that many businesses close their doors entirely or dramatically reduce the number of customers they serve. The customers were told to stay at home and avoid going out except to purchase essential items. Bars, theaters, and gyms were shuttered in much of the country. Restaurants were required to close dining rooms, remaining open only for take-out and delivery. Manufacturers often had to shut down altogether, including the plants of most automakers in the U.S. Health care establishments found themselves bereft of businesses as patients canceled elective procedures and even regular check-ups.  

The beaches of Los Angeles are closed. At least in theory. At night, and in the early morning, you will find people there, quietly enjoying the forbidden, ordinary pleasures of the sand and sea. For the past week, there has been a red tide in Southern California, which has brought the rare spectacle of bioluminescent waves. Tiny plankton glow a serene blue as the waves crash, creating ripples of fluorescent lightning in the foam. This week’s supermoon — a full moon that occurs near the closest point in the moon’s orbit around the earth — has brought dramatic tides. At low tide, the beaches extend spread outward into the ocean, the damp brown sand reflecting the sky as clearly as calm water on a pond. Rocky stretches of coastline that are normally hidden beneath the water are revealed, strange new worlds that disappear again beneath the waves in a few hours’ time. The dolphins are back. They had been scarce since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, as if they, too, were socially distant. But now they can be seen cruising the far break, their dorsal fins breaking the surface, their glistening bodies cutting through the water. Sometimes there are seals, too, darting back and forth, creating little whirlpools as they circle one another. Crabs scuttle across the sand — perhaps pushed out by the red tide. The surfers — well, they never really left. Some are rebels by nature. Some are law-abiding citizens in their normal, daylight lives. But all respect a higher law than mere municipal ordinances. And surfers do not have to be told to be “socially distant” from one another. They are already territorial and resist crowding in the best of circumstances. Woe to the newcomer who paddles presumptuously into an empty space between the regulars. The police have to enforce the law, and they will do so during normal working hours. But they seem to be content to look the other way, for now, as long as no one makes themselves too conspicuous. Besides, the beaches of Los Angeles are so wide that they seem empty even when they are open, even on weekends. And scientists have already concluded that the chances of casually transmitting coronavirus outdoors are slim. The State of California, in its wisdom, decided to close the beaches of Orange County because news photos appeared to show lots of people turned up on a hot weekend in April. Aerial photographs seemed to tell a different story than the telephoto lenses of news photographers, which suggested a crowded scene. Governor Gavin Newsom condemned those irresponsible beachgoers for their reckless, selfish, antisocial behavior. So, too, did Representative Harley Rouda, a first-term Democrat from the 48th district. He criticized local communities for keeping their beaches open — then frolicked with his family at an exclusive private beach. When caught on camera, Rouda claimed he had observed proper social distancing. It’s tough to believe the voters cast aside the pot-legalizing Dana Rohrabacher for this hypocrite. (“Ballot harvesting” helped, no doubt.) Newsom has closed the beaches of Orange County. But it won’t last, and it can’t, because even in California, people will only put up with so much bullshit. They won’t vote for a Republican government, at least not statewide, but they will defy the Democratic one.

Pakistan says it will lift its coronavirus lockdown starting Saturday. Thursday’s announcement comes hours after the country reported its highest daily increase in new Wuhan coronavirus cases, Reuters reported. On Thursday, Pakistani health authorities said that in the last 24 hours they had recorded 1,523 new coronavirus cases and 38 more deaths, bringing the nation’s totals to 24,073 cases and 564 deaths. Global health authorities and regional Pakistani leaders believe the true number of cases to be higher. They doubt the country’s official coronavirus statistics, arguing that deficient testing has resulted in fewer cases reported than actually exist. “We’re deciding that we are ending this lockdown now,” Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan said in a national TV address. “We know that we’re doing it at a time when our [coronavirus] curve is going up … but it is not edging up as we were expecting.” Pakistan’s Planning Minister Asad Umar said that “small markets and shops” will be allowed to open with limited hours. Large shopping malls and other spaces that “attract large crowds” will remain closed, he added, according to the report. “Since we started this lockdown, we had this fear that these people who are daily wagers, who feed their kids on daily earnings, what will happen to them?” Khan asked, implying that Pakistan’s poor need the lockdown lifted to survive. In his speech, the Prime Minister explained that the shutdown would be “lifted in phases.” He warned Pakistanis that the coronavirus outbreak could get “out of control” if they failed to heed some restrictions that will remain in place to slow the virus’s spread. Khan announced a lockdown of Pakistan in late March in response to the coronavirus pandemic, but it has been loosely enforced. In late April, at the start of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, Khan conceded to pressure from powerful local imams, Islamic religious leaders, and allowed mosques to remain open for communal prayer during the holy month. This defied his lockdown measures, which originally ordered mosques to remain closed during Ramadan to reduce coronavirus transmission. Pakistan’s government has faced criticism from its own members for failing to contain the spread of the coronavirus. In March, regional Pakistani leaders said national authorities failed to properly test and quarantine thousands of citizens returning to Pakistan over a land border with Iran. The majority of the group were Muslim pilgrims who had visited Islamic shrines in Iran. Pakistan has suffered from a lack of sufficient testing kits and medical supplies throughout the coronavirus pandemic. This is due, in part, to the country’s failing medical system, which was already struggling before the coronavirus outbreak. “We are concerned about pressure that will come on the hospitals,” a spokesperson for Pakistan’s Young Doctors’ Association told Reuters when the lifting of Pakistan’s lockdown was announced. “It will definitely lead to an increase in the number of cases, the number of critical cases,” he said of the lockdown easing.

A coalition of more than 260 Massachusetts clergy sent a letter to Gov. Charlie Baker (R) Thursday, urging him to recognize churches as “essential” and to include them in the first “reopening” phase in the state. Massachusetts Family Institute forwarded the letter and a press release in an email to Breitbart News. “We recognize the risks and uncertainties surrounding COVID-19, and the extraordinary measures we are all having to take, and we have continued to serve, especially in feeding the hungry and comforting the many who are suffering now,” read the letter sent to Baker and members of his Reopening Advisory Board. Update about the Worcester pastor who has resumed holding church services.https://t.co/jDo274IqIf — MA Family Institute (@MAFamilyInst) May 7, 2020  The clergy members, mostly Protestant pastors along with several Catholic priests, expressed disappointment that the governor’s executive order regarding the coronavirus lockdown banned religious services at which more than ten people are present. They are requesting that churches be “swiftly and publicly” acknowledged as “essential” and that “they be included in the first phase of the reopening on May 18,” stated the press release. “[C]hurch IS essential for us,” the clergy members wrote. “Your order of March 23rd would forbid us from gathering together to worship God, but the word of God commands us to not forsake the assembling of ourselves together. We have done our best to temporarily adapt to extraordinary circumstances, but this must not continue.” The faith leaders continued in expressing their discontent that “marijuana dispensaries, liquor stores and abortion clinics have all been deemed ‘essential,’ but churches and other places of worship have not.” They also reminded Baker and the members of his advisory board that the freedoms of religion and assembly are protected by both the U.S. and Massachusetts Constitutions. The signers added: When the phased reopening of our Commonwealth begins, the reopening of our churches must be in the first phase. It is upsetting that, unlike roughly half the states across our nation, churches in Massachusetts were not deemed “essential” at the outset, but this must come to an end. This is consistent with the federal guidelines for a phased reopening, where in phase one, “places of worship can operate under strict physical distancing protocols.” The clergy noted they are “fully prepared to exercise extraordinary care and precaution” to protect the health of their congregations through the use of social distancing, “just as other businesses Massachusetts has deemed essential.”

The unemployment rate jumped to 14.7 percent in April and the economy shed 20.5 million jobs, according to data released by the Department of Labor on Friday. April was the second consecutive month of job losses for the U.S. economy following the record 113 months run of expanding employment rolls. Economists had forecast that the economy would lose 21 million jobs and that the unemployment rate would climb from 4.4 percent to 16 percent. So the April figures were better than expected. March’s job losses were revised up from a loss of 701,000 to 870,000. February, which saw job gains, was revised down by 45,000 from 275,000 to 230,000, a reminder of how just how strong the jobs market was prior to the onset of the coronavirus crisis. Employment fell sharply in all major industry sectors, with particularly heavy job losses in leisure and hospitality, the Labor Department said. Both average hourly earnings and average hours worked moved up in April, likely reflecting businesses shedding newer and lower-paid employees first and attempting to make do with smaller payrolls by increasing hours. Manufacturing shed 1.3 million jobs, including 381,500 in the auto sector. Construction lost 975,000 jobs. Health care and social assistance shrank by more than 2 million jobs. White-collar positions have not been immune to the coronavirus jobs catastrophe. Information technology and financial services sectors shrank by more than one-quarter of a million jobs. Business services lost 2.1 million jobs. The scale of the job loss has been breathtakingly sudden despite an unprecedented level of support for the economy from the federal government and the Federal Reserve. Over the past seven weeks, more than 33 million Americans have filed claims for unemployment benefits. But the number of claims has been declining for five consecutive weeks. The Trump administration successfully pushed Congress to authorize direct payments to U.S. households to support incomes and to raise the amount paid by unemployment benefits by $600 a week, making it possible for some Americans to earn more through losing a job than they made working. The federal government is also backing over $600 billion of loans to small businesses that can be forgiven if those businesses avoid layoffs.

But loans and direct payments can only go so far to offset orders that many businesses close their doors entirely or dramatically reduce the number of customers they serve. The customers were told to stay at home and avoid going out except to purchase essential items. Bars, theaters, and gyms were shuttered in much of the country. Restaurants were required to close dining rooms, remaining open only for take-out and delivery. Manufacturers often had to shut down altogether, including the plants of most automakers in the U.S. Health care establishments found themselves bereft of businesses as patients canceled elective procedures and even regular check-ups. In the five weeks covered by the U.S. jobs report for April, 26.5 million people applied for unemployment benefits. The job loss reported Friday is lower than that because the two are measured differently: The government calculates job losses by surveying businesses and households. It’s a net figure that also counts the hiring that some companies, like Amazon and many grocery stores, have done. By contrast, the total jobless claims is a measure of just the layoff side of the equation. Even Friday’s numbers don’t fully capture the scope of the damage the coronavirus, social distancing, and government shutdown orders has inflicted on jobs and incomes. Many people who are still employed have had their hours reduced. Others have suffered pay cuts. Some who lost jobs in April and didn’t look for a new one in light of their bleak prospects won’t even be counted as unemployed. During the Great Recession of 2008-2009, the nation lost 6.5 percent of its jobs over a two-year span. It was the worst loss in any recession since World War II. The unemployment rate hit 10 percent in the fall of 2009, the highest level since 1982’s 10.8 percent unemployment. Few economists expect a rapid turnaround. The Congressional Budget Office has forecast that the unemployment rate will still be 9.5 percent by the end of next year. A paper by economists at the San Francisco Federal Reserve estimates that under an optimistic scenario that assumes shutdowns are lifted quickly, the unemployment rate could fall back to about 4 percent by mid-2021. But if shutdowns recur and hiring revives more slowly, the jobless rate could remain in double-digits until the end of 2021, the San Francisco Fed economists predict. Raj Chetty, a Harvard economist, is tracking real-time data on the economy, including consumer spending, small business hiring and job postings. Chetty noted the economy’s health will hinge on when the viral outbreak has subsided enough that most Americans will feel comfortable returning to restaurants, bars, movie theaters and shops. The data suggests that many small businesses are holding on in hopes that spending and the economy will rebound soon, he said. Small business payrolls have fallen sharply but have leveled off in recent weeks. And job postings haven’t dropped nearly as much as total jobs have. But it’s unclear how much longer those trends will persist. “There’s only so long you can hold out,” Chetty said.   –The Associated Press contributed to this report.

The Grand Mosque of Paris has threatened to file a discrimination lawsuit against the French government if it is not allowed to open to worshippers before the end of Ramadan. Head of the Grand Mosque Chems-Eddine Hafiz expressed anger at the announcement that mosques, churches, and other places of worship under lockdown due to the Wuhan coronavirus would not be opened earlier than May 29th, several days after the end of the Muslim holy month. Mr Hafiz, who is also a lawyer, called on President Emmanuel Macron’s government to open places of worship on May 24th to coincide with the Islamic holiday of Eid to celebrate the end of Ramadan and said that legal action would be undertaken otherwise, Le Figaro reports. “The holiday of Eid which closes the holy month of Ramadan is as important as Jewish or Christian Pentecost,” he said and added he was prepared to “use all legal means to defend the moral interests of Muslims in France”. Pentecost, also called Whitsun, takes place on May 31st, two days after the lifting of the lockdown measures for places of worship. While the Jewish holiday of Shavuot begins at sunset on May 28th and ends at sundown on May 30th. The timing of the lifting of the lockdown Hafiz argued was “de facto excluding Muslim worship”. Merkel's Party Backs Public Islamic Prayer Broadcasts During Ramadan https://t.co/Gu8zSEabDm — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 2, 2020  “Muslims, linked to the National Federation of the Great Mosque of Paris (GMP), which I have the honour to represent, would not understand this unfair measure of the ‘double standards’, the feast of Eid being separated from Jewish and Christian Pentecost by only four days,” he added. Many other countries have prohibited worship during their own coronavirus lockdown measures, but some have made concessions to Muslims by allowing the Islamic call to prayer to be broadcast during the month of Ramadan. In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and several other parties supported the public broadcast of the Muslim call to prayer. CDU religious policy spokesman Christoph de Vries argued that he “therefore considers temporary permission to allow the call to prayer as a symbolic sign of solidarity and common ground to be justifiable”. In Canada, Mississauga Mayor Bonnie Crombie also amended local bylaws to allow for the broadcast, saying the move “will provide inspiration, familiarity, and comfort to our city’s Muslim community during this challenging time”.

As Australia gradually emerges from its successful coronavirus lockdown, government priorities have been set. One of those began Friday with the urgent dispatch of beer kegs to remote outback pubs. “I understand there’s a whole bunch of kegs on their way to Darwin as we speak, running up the highway — much eagerly anticipated, I’m sure,” Prime Minister Scott Morrison told media in Canberra announcing the move, AFP reports. On Thursday, Northern Territory chief minister Michael Gunner welcomed the first shipment of 40,000 gallons of “the good stuff” with the promise of more to come. “The beers are here and the jobs are back,” Gunner said at a press conference surrounded by some freshly delivered cases of the amber nectar. Beer drinkers in the outback like the rest of Australia will have much to toast. Chinese coronavirus cases in the nation have slowed in past weeks, with close to 7,000 confirmed cases and 97 deaths connected to COVID-19 since the pandemic began. Australia effectively shuttered its border from February 1 when the government said it would bar non-citizens arriving from mainland China from entering the country until further notice. This was broadened in March to all entry from anywhere else in the world bar returning Australian citizens who were sent into an obligatory tw0-week quarantine on arrival back home – no exceptions. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> Morrison said then only “Australian citizens, Australian residents, dependents, legal guardians or spouses” would be permitted to cross the border. That tough line worked so well that Australia is now well advanced on re-opening its economy, with more beer being top of the list. The beer market has dipped 20 percent since the lockdown with the loss of keg sales hitting brewers and pubs hard, said Lion Beer Australia — one of the largest brewers in a country that has never sought to hide its love of beer. “March 23 was the most devastating and soul-destroying day our industry has ever experienced,” the firm’s Managing Director James Brindley said of the day pubs and restaurants across Australia were ordered closed as part of sweeping lockdown restrictions. “For many of us being able to get back to the local and have a beer with our mates is the morale boost that we’ve all been waiting for,” he said. This is not the first time the Australian government has officially designated beer an essential to modern life. During the devastating bushfires in January, the Royal Australian Navy was applauded after one of its ships completed an emergency beer run to help resupply a pub besieged by a deadly conflagration. As Breitbart News reported, that emergency sea run included 20 kegs and four pallets of beer and cider for a town with a population of around 1,000. “A pub with no beer is bad enough at the best of times,” said Carlton and United Breweries CEO Peter Filipovic. “After what Mallacoota residents and firies have been through the least we could do is make sure they could enjoy a beer.” “We’re not sure if the Navy has ever shipped beer to civilians before but these fires are an extraordinary disaster,” he added.

Seven French agricultural organisations have called on the government to increase food sovereignty as a response to dangers revealed by the Wuhan coronavirus crisis. The organisations focused on several points to make France’s agricultural sector less reliant on globalisation and said that the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak had revealed weaknesses in the country’s food independence. “Beyond the economic weaknesses caused by this pandemic, it is today our structural weaknesses that need to be corrected because they directly threaten our food independence, and therefore our sovereignty… our imports, mainly ‘low cost’, are growing faster than our exports. The situation of dependence is growing dangerously,” the letter, published in L’Opinion, said. The letter went on to note the demographic issues facing France’s farmers, stating that more than half of French farmers are set to retire in less than ten years and called on the government of President Emmanuel Macron to promote agricultural professions to young people. The organisations also called for restructuring and even relocating production chains, ensure the public knows where French products are coming from, and educate the public regarding costs and a “fair price of food”. French Govt Blamed For Not Saving Factory That Produced Millions of Medical Masks https://t.co/UTM0XRgOsB — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 2, 2020  “Rebuilding food sovereignty will be the work of a generation. It will only be possible if it is part of a real process of solidarity. We have always supported the idea that agriculture is an opportunity for France and for Europe. Circumstances brutally demonstrate this today,” they said. Shortages of certain foods have been feared in the United States, particularly of meat with John Tyson, chairman of Tyson Foods Inc., the largest U.S. meat producer, warning of fractures in the supply chain due to the coronavirus outbreak. The issue of globalisation and French reliance on it was also highlighted by those who noted that France once had one of the largest manufacturing facilities of FFP2 respirator masks in Europe in the commune of Plaintel near the city of Saint-Brieuc until its closure in 2018. According to French union Solidaires Côtes d’Armor, the U.S. conglomerate Honeywell, which owned the factory, shipped it overseas and destroyed the machines used to make the masks. “They undoubtedly thought as good liberals, that an intervention of the State would be useless, since that in a globalised and happy world, the invisible hand of the market would end up showing its efficiency to preserve the general interest,” the union said.

Attorney General William Barr has made it clear by his words and actions that civil liberties are “not suspended in times of crisis.” And for the sake of religious people everywhere, I pray that it continues. Today the biggest threat to the nation is totalitarianism under the guise of safety and protection. It was just 3 years ago that President Trump signed an Executive Order allowing religious groups greater freedom in political speech at the National Day of Prayer, saying, “We will not allow people of faith to be targeted, bullied, or silenced anymore.” Just last week, AG Barr released a memo titled, “Balancing Public Safety with the Preservation of Civil Rights.” He highlighted the DOJ’s priority in defending people of faith against the potential dangers of government overreach and discriminatory policies.  We have already witnessed this take place in numerous places. In Virginia, Governor Ralph Northam threatened to jail or fine Pastor Kevin Wilson of Lighthouse Fellowship Church for holding a worship service on Palm Sunday with 16 people in an auditorium built for 293. Pastor Wilson had violated a state-imposed restriction not applicable to many businesses . In a statement on Sunday, the Justice Department sided with Lighthouse Church, saying, “The Commonwealth of Virginia has offered no good reason for refusing to trust congregants who promise to use care in worship in the same way it trusts accountants, lawyers, and other workers to do the same.” Elsewhere, the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Maryville Baptist Church for violating Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear’s stay-at-home order. Their crime was holding service in a church parking lot while congregants remained in their cars. Mayor Erick Simmons of Greenville, Mississippi also made headlines in a similar case in April by ordering that $500 tickets be issued at drive-in church services. Knox County, Tennessee, officials last week forbid communion and baptism as they were not deemed “core worship.” The assumption was that local bureaucrats could determine the rule and standard for free religious practice.   Thankfully, Governor Bill Lee issued an executive order to override the county ban. In Kansas City, Missouri, Mayor Quinton Lucas issued an ordinance requiring churches to record and report on people who attended services out of concerns for public health and safety. And in perhaps one of the most provocative and irreverent statements to date, Governor Andrew Cuomo declared at a press conference concerning the flattening of the coronavirus curve, “God did not do that. Faith did not do that. Destiny did not do that. A lot of pain and suffering did that.” What is the common trend in each of these scenarios? In almost every case, statist politicians cannot understand why their self-imposed orders could be seen as antagonistic to people of faith.   For them, faith is not existential nor necessary. Religious practice is a mere novelty, an ancillary experience that could easily be shared or felt in other ways – no less trivial than a holiday greeting card. For people of faith, defending religious liberty and free religious exercise in the ultimate sense it is a matter of life and death. Just ask the early apostles. The American founders understood that when framing the Constitution, because freedom came at the highest price possible and it is worth defending.   There is still even greater work to do to ensure that religious liberty flourishes in this country. Our nation’s health, economy, and religious freedom are never mutually exclusive.   We all owe AG Barr and President Donald Trump our gratitude for making this a major public policy issue. They have kept religious liberty safe — for now. Ryan Helfenbein is the Vice President of Communications and Public Engagement at Liberty University and Executive Director of the Falkirk Center for Faith & Liberty.


The most useless metric in America today is “new coronavirus cases.” Nevertheless, the fake news media are using this useless metric to spread panic, intimidate states into keeping us locked down, and destroy the economy in the hopes that destruction will also damage President Trump’s reelection chances. “Daily Coronavirus-Case Count Surges” screams Thursday’s Wall Street Journal headline. The sub-headline adds this: “New confirmed infections on Wednesday topped 92,700, the most since April 24 and the fourth-highest daily total ever.” Here’s just a taste of what else we’re seeing, and this doesn’t include the hysteria on cable news: A personal favorite: States that have seen at least 2 consecutive weeks of decline in #COVID19 cases: FLHILAMIMTNYOHPASDWV — Reid Wilson (@PoliticsReid) May 4, 2020  Within the context of how it’s being reported, all of this represents an absolutely meaningless statistic being spread by a fake news media determined to terrify and intimidate you… Here’s the truth… The primary reasons we are seeing such a huge spike in reported cases is because the United States is performing millions — literally, millions — of tests. Per capita, according to the White House, we are testing more than any other country by far. We have also tested more total people than the rest of the world combined, and we are testing more people every day. So, obviously… The more we test, the more reported cases we find, and since a large number of those with the coronavirus don’t require hospitalization (many hardly feel sick), this number has nothing to do with anything that matters as far as the country reopening, and reopening our country is exactly what the fear-peddlers in the media wish to prevent. The media make it sound like these “new cases” are massive new outbreaks when they’re not. And how do we know they’re not? How do we know this massive testing program is skewing reality? Because the number that matters within the context of reopening is the number of “new hospitalizations.” And we are not seeing spikes in “new hospitalizations.” We are not seeing headlines about “increases” or “spikes” in hospitalizations because those numbers are either leveling out or decreasing. California. New York. Florida. Michigan. You can look up each state on your own here. That’s not to say the infection numbers are not important in other ways. Testing for the number of infections is important when it comes to containing a new outbreak. Testing will tell us when the coronavirus first hit, how close we are to herd immunity (which is probably our only real hope of returning to full normal), and most importantly, testing will tell us what the true death rate of the virus is. One thing the media don’t want you to know is how low America’s per capita death rate is when compared to comparable countries. Another thing the media won’t tell you is that, without a vaccine, it makes no scientific or moral sense not to reopen right now. Waiting a week or two weeks or two months in no safer than opening today when there’s no cure. The virus is still out there. The health system is in no danger of being overrun. The curve has been bent, probably for good, so panic and fake news are the only things to justify keeping us at home. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.

For the third time in as many months, far-left CBS News has been caught broadcasting fake coronavirus footage to manufacture a crisis narrative. In March, the fake news outlet was caught using film footage from an overwhelmed hospital in Northern Italy in a report about New York City hospitals. After CBS was busted for this, the network apologized and said it would never do it again. The following month, CBS did it again — used the exact same Italian footage as a stand-in for New York. This month, CBS has been caught broadcasting staged footage involving coronavirus testing at Cherry Medical Center in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The segment aired on Friday, May 1, on CBS This Morning and featured a video of a long line of cars waiting to get a coronavirus test. The agenda, obviously, was to attack President Donald Trump for having failed to provide adequate testing facilities. According to a whistleblower, who spoke with James O’Keefe of Project Veritas, the long line was staged. Only one or two of the cars in the line featured actual patients. The other cars were employees from the medical facility who pulled into the line to make it look longer. “So, the people in the cars are not patients?” O’Keefe asks the whistleblower. “Majority of them,” the disguised whistleblower said. “I do know, from talking with the testers that one, one of them, one or two of them were real patients, which added to their frustration because this line sat there for a while so they could organize the shot.” BREAKING: Insider Reveals @CherryHealthMI & @CBSNews Staged FAKE #COVID19 Testing Line on @CBSThisMorning “We knew they(CBS) were coming, had no clue we were going to have to like do FAKE PATIENTS” – RN, Cherry Health "There were real patients which made it worse"#ExposeCBS pic.twitter.com/tA4LoS7P22 — James O'Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) May 6, 2020  “A CBS News crew pulled medical professionals off the floor at the Cherry Medical Center in Grand Rapids, Michigan, to line up in their vehicles so a CBS film crew would have a long line for their COVID-19 coverage,” Project Veritas reports. “The insider told us that medical personnel were taken away from treating patients and making the line longer for actual patients wait for the COVID-19 test.” On top of that, according to the Project Veritas report, because of the fake patients, the actual people who were in line to be tested had to wait a much longer than normal time to have their tests completed. In a statement, CBS News was forced to admit that at least one of the cars in the line was staged but denied having anything to do with it or knowing about it at the time: CBS News did not stage anything at the Cherry Health facility. Any suggestion to the contrary is 100% false. These allegations are alarming. We reached out to Cherry Health to address them immediately. They informed us for the first time that one of their chief officers told at least one staffer to get in the testing line along with real patients. No one from CBS News had any knowledge of this before tonight. They also said that their actions did not prevent any actual patients from being tested. CBS said it would remove the “Cherry Health portion from the piece,” but that’s what CBS said about the Italian hospital footage before fraudulently using it again. Tasha Blackmon, the president and CEO of the Cherry Health, told Project Veritas, “I did see the line of cars in the video that you shared with me. I can assure you that I did not instruct any staff to get in their cars and line up and I have no idea when it was filmed or who was in each car.” In March of this year, along with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI), Joe Biden toured Cherry Health as a guest of the facility. He also held a short news conference there.  So CBS News says Cherry Health did it. Cherry Health says, nyuh-uh — wasn’t us. What we do know, though, is that CBS does agree the footage was faked to some degree and the network has been forced to pull it. What we do know is that this is the third time CBS News has broadcast fake news that makes things look worse than they are. What we also know is that these so-called mistakes only ever fall one way — in a way that is meant to damage Trump. That means they are not honest mistakes. Honest mistakes would sometimes fall the other way. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.

May 7 (UPI) — The NFL revealed its 2020 regular-season schedule Thursday, with the Kansas City Chiefs kicking off their Super Bowl title defense against the Houston Texans in Week 1. The league announced its schedule in anticipation of playing a normal season despite the coronavirus pandemic. However, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell told all 32 teams in a memo this week that adjustments could happen if necessary. “We will continue to work in a deliberate and thoughtful way to plan for the 2020 season, including with [Thursday’s] schedule release,” Goodell said. “We will be prepared to address any contingencies as they arise.” The Chiefs will open the season by hosting the Texans in a Thursday Night Football matchup on Sept. 10 at Arrowhead Stadium. It will be a rematch of last season’s AFC Divisional Round game, in which Kansas City rallied from a 21-0 deficit in the first quarter en route to a 51-31 victory. In other Week 1 action, the Super Bowl runner-up San Francisco 49ers will host second-year quarterback Kyler Murray and the revamped Arizona Cardinals. The Dallas Cowboys will travel to Los Angeles for a matchup against the Rams on Sunday Night Football. Also in Week 1, Drew Brees and the New Orleans Saints will host newcomer Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in a late afternoon game on FOX. Meanwhile, Brady’s former team — the New England Patriots — will host rookie quarterback Tua Tagovailoa and the Miami Dolphins in the opening week of games. The Atlanta Falcons will take on the Seattle Seahawks in a battle of high-octane offenses, while the Green Bay Packers will renew their NFC North rivalry with the Vikings in Minnesota.

Thursday on CNN, former Vice President Al Gore accused President Donald Trump of “recklessly rolling the dice” with Americans’ lives in an attempt to bring back the economy and win reelection. Gore said, “Not much joy in answering your question because, you know, I try to navigate away from a partisan dimension of this. We’re in an election year, and I’m in a different political party than the president. So you can take what I say with that as background. Really what’s at stake here is so much more important than that. And honestly, he has failed as president, particularly on this challenge. The warnings were ignored. I spent eight years starting every single day with a lengthy report from the intelligence committee, and there are very few occasions where there was a stark warning about grave danger to the country. And whenever there was such an occasion we stopped and said hold the show here, get the FBI, get the CIA, get whoever was involved over. We need to learn about this.” He continued, “Then after the warnings were missed, he has failed to mobilize the resources of the federal government to straighten out this testing catastrophe. To get the swabs and the so-called reagents, they need to do the tests and the gowns and masks and all the other stuff, he has not done that. And now I think we’re in grave danger. I have to tell you both, I think we are seeing the start of a botched reopening. I think that the president appears to be engaging in magical thinking again. And what I mean by that is, you know, a couple of months ago he said one day it’s just going to magically disappear. It seems as if he may be recklessly rolling the dice, hoping that he can goose the economy just enough in the third quarter of this year to enhance his reelection prospects. Hoping that he can divert the blame for the extra tens of thousands of Americans who the doctors tell us will die as a result of this and blame it on the Chinese or former President Obama or whoever.” He added, “Instead of doing what a president needs to do. First of all, be a watchman on the tower looking for danger, then responding to it, mobilizing the government, reaching out, not just to your political base, but to all Americans. Empathizing, showing some empathy because people are grieving and suffering. And then when there’s a problem that can only be resolved with the leadership of the president of the United States. He needs to take ahold of that, but instead, he said, literally, I take no responsibility. It is unfathomable to me. I’m sorry to get wound up about this, but I see what he’s doing and it is the complete opposite of what the United States of America needs in the presidency right now.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

A woman was arrested Wednesday after she allegedly shot at three McDonald’s restaurant employees in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, after they told her the dining room was closed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Wednesday evening, the Oklahoma City Police Department (OKCPD) received a call about a shooting at the restaurant located at 9001 S. Pennsylvania Ave., the department wrote on its Facebook page. The post continued: The suspect, Gloricia Woody, entered the restaurant and was told by employees the dining area was closed. Ms. Woody was asked to leave but refused. A physical altercation ensued between Ms. Woody and an employee. Ms. Woody was forced out of the restaurant by employees. She reentered the restaurant with a handgun and fired approximately three rounds in the restaurant.  One employee was hit in the arm, a second was hit with shrapnel in the neck/shoulder and a third employee was hit with shrapnel in the side. The employee who was in this initial physical confrontation sustained a head injury, the cause of this injury in [sic] unclear.
 Following the alleged crime, officers located the 32-year-old suspect just south of the restaurant and took her into custody without incident, the department said. “Injuries to the four employees were non-life threatening. Three of the employees were transported to a local hospital,” the post read. Later, a McDonald’s spokesperson said the safety and security of employees and customers were the company’s top priorities, adding that the restaurant workers are expected to make a full recovery. “This is a heinous crime on our restaurant employees who were trying to support public health efforts. We are fully cooperating with law enforcement as they continue to investigate this matter,” the spokesperson noted. Wednesday, Shannon Watts, the founder of gun control advocacy group Moms Demand Action, commented on the shooting and claimed the United States is making it easier for people to get a firearm during the health crisis. “Every high-income country is home to dangerous people. Only America is making access to guns even easier during the pandemic,” she concluded.

San Francisco’s health department confirmed on Wednesday that it is providing drugs and alcohol to addicts to keep them from breaking quarantine. The San Francisco Department of Public Health has sparked a citywide debate with a decision to provide various substances to addicts, in hopes of preventing unnecessary breaches of the city-wide lockdown. Approximately 270 members of San Francisco’s homeless population have been temporarily housed in private hotels, and the department’s “harm reduction” approach intends to keep them there. “With regard to supporting people who are at risk, or who need to be in quarantine or isolation because they’re COVID positive, our focus needs to be on supporting them,” said Dr. Grant Colfax from San Francisco’s Department of Public Health. “Meeting them where they are so that they can be cared for in the most appropriate way. In the way that’s good for them and for our community.” “They’re doing San Francisco a great service by staying inside,” department spokesperson Jenna Lane said, further describing measures to provide clinicians and social workers to anyone who would like to begin addiction treatments. “We’re saying, ‘We’re doing what we can to support you staying inside and not have to go out and get these things.’” For alcohol specifically, Lane said rationing is being carefully supervised: “The DPH medical staff are calculating the minimum medically appropriate amounts of alcohol and distributing it with meals,” Lane said. “Alcohol withdrawal is the only one you can die from.” Not everyone is supportive of the measure. “I have it from a pretty reliable source that weed and booze are being given to people in the hotels, and I have a real problem with that,” said Thomas Wolf, a case manager who works with addicts in San Francisco. There’s an ethical issue there. Alcohol kills more people than any other drug. And I understand the risks of having people detox in hotel rooms, but my understanding is the people who are quarantined in the hotels can leave for 30 minutes for essential services. “We want them to stay inside, but, man, you’ve got to draw the line somewhere and ask for more accountability,” said Wolf, who has lived experience as a former homeless addict himself. “Don’t be enabling people.”

Convicted child sex abusers are among the roughly 450 prison inmates in Illinois that are being released every week, state records confirm. Between March 1 and May 6, more than 4,500 inmates in Illinois have been freed from prison — many have been convicted of sex crimes against children, drug trafficking, assault, and various murder-related charges — over concerns of the Chinese coronavirus spreading. The data indicates that every week for the last two months about 450 inmates are released from Illinois prisons. The full list of prison releases thus far reveal that nearly 150 of the more than 4,500 released inmates have been convicted of sex crimes. Steven Haberkorn, 31-years-old, is one of the child sex abusers who was allowed to parole out of prison on March 2. Around 2011, Haberkorn was convicted of predatory criminal sexual assault and aggravated criminal sexual abuse. At the time of the incident, Haberkorn was 21 years old and his victim was nine years old. Gustavo Covarrubias, a 59-year-old child sex abuser, was also allowed to parole out of prison on March 24. Around 2014, Covarrubias was convicted of predatory criminal sexual assault. At the time of the incident, Covarrubias was 53 years old and his victim was 11 years old. Likewise, 47-year-old Charles Shumard was allowed to parole out of prison on March 9. Around 2016, Shumard was convicted of aggravated criminal sexual abuse. At the time of the incident, Shumard was 43 years old and his victim was 15 years old. About 520 of the more than 4,500 Illinois inmates released since March 1 have been convicted for “Class X” felonies — the most serious violent crimes on the books aside from first-degree murder. While thousands of inmates are released, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) has threatened that violators of the state’s stay-at-home order can be arrested, charged, and prosecuted.

Thursday on Fox Business Network’s “The Evening Edit,” White House trade adviser Peter Navarro discussed how China could be using the coronavirus pandemic to strengthen its position around the globe. Navarro laid out a timeline for host Liz MacDonald explaining how at once, China became an importer of personal protective equipment (PPE). As the virus has spread, it has used that PPE to earn a profit, or as a diplomatic tool to advance diplomacy. “We get patient zero probably mid-November, probably from the Wuhan bioweapons lab,” Navarro said. “Gets sick early December, we get all sorts of people infected. China knows there’s human-to-human transmission in early December, but for six weeks, they hide that from the world behind the shield of the World Health Organization. What did they do during that? According to their own Chinese customs data, they went from a net exporter of personal protective equipment to a huge net importer. They basically vacuumed up all the PPE, particularly the masks, the gloves, the goggles, in the world. What did that mean, Liz? It meant when the people Milan, or New York, or Detroit, or New Orleans needed that there wasn’t enough for them. That’s all on China.” “Now, what were they doing?” he continued. “Middle of January they were coming here and signing a trade deal without telling us about the virus. And then, they were also secretly trying to get a patent for this drug Remdesivir which has significant therapeutic potential. And what are they doing now? Yes, they want to maybe hoard all the PPE. Use it — use it, basically sell it to us at profiteering prices or use it as a diplomatic weapon to force countries in Europe to do — to deny that this is — the virus is from China. And there’s a paper that they did, a whitepaper that everybody should read that goes back to right after the crisis, Liz — the financial crisis, where it explains what China needs to do after a crisis in order to consolidate power and take over the world. “This is what we’re up against,” Navarro added. “And obviously, it’s very difficult to believe anything the Chinese Communist Party tells us. But we are in perilous times. In the meantime, what’s really important, I think, for us to focus on is getting the economy back on its feet at the same time that we do our best to protect the men and women at the frontlines — the health care workers — as well as everybody else here in America. And that’s — that’s what I’m focused on. I’m focused on supply chain issues. I’m focused on helping this president create jobs for America.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor

A Chinese journalist residing in the U.S. blamed President Donald Trump for a recent “wave of hate” against Asians amid a global backlash against China for its role in spreading the Wuhan coronavirus. The op-ed was published in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) newspaper Global Times on Thursday. Some outlets have reported an increase in alleged hate crimes against Asians in the U.S. and other countries since the world learned that China covered up its initial coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan at the end of last year, greatly contributing to the rise of the deadly coronavirus pandemic. The Global Times blamed Trump’s use of the term “Chinese virus” for the crimes: The wave of hate was encouraged by President Donald Trump’s description of COVID-19 as the “Chinese virus.” According to the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, which has been tracking hate crimes against Asians … incidents surged to 650 in the week when the president insisted on using the term in mid-March. Trump has dropped his use of the description now, but in recent weeks he has stepped up his anti-China attacks. “[T]he average [American] racist hater out there on the street? They normally do not have the intelligence to differentiate between people by anything other than their skin color,” the New York-based author tells her readers, most of whom reside in China. The op-ed, entitled “Love and hope amidst ignorant racism,” comes as reports this week revealed that the CCP has resumed a forced labor program for ethnic Uyghur Muslims in China’s western Xinjiang region. The program has been criticized as a form of slave labor; its unwilling participants are detainees of concentration camps, which the CCP calls “re-education camps,” targeted for their ethnic Muslim heritage. The Muslim Uyghurs, a Turkic people, and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang are the victims of a decades-long campaign of ethnic cleansing executed by the majority Han Chinese, who want absolute control and cultural assimilation of the region bordering Central Asia. The CCP has implemented a standardized program of oppression including security surveillance and concentration camps, where they arbitrarily detain Muslim Uyghurs for offenses including outward displays of their cultural heritage. Uyghurs can be charged and jailed for these signs of religious “extremism,” as the CCP calls them. Examples include altering the “color of their hair” – Muslim men who complete an Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, dye their beards red to mark the accomplishment – and “women who wear religious clothes to work” during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, which is currently underway and officially banned by the CCP in Xinjiang. Uyghurs, who speak a Turkic language, are also forced to learn and speak Mandarin Chinese as part of political and ideological indoctrination programs run in the “re-education camps.”

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Wednesday demanded a “jump in production” from his country’s threadbare economy to stave off the effects of U.S. sanctions, which he compared to the Wuhan coronavirus. Khamenei took the occasion of Iran’s “Labor Week” to roll out his “Jump in Production” slogan for the coming year (which, on the Iranian calendar, began in March). He told a group of manufacturing executives via teleconference that Iran could fight off sanctions the same way it fought the coronavirus, which is actually a rather unfortunate choice of metaphor, given the carnage caused by the Iranian regime’s coronavirus policies. As reported by Iran’s state-run PressTV, Khamenei left those unpleasant details aside to compare a strong economy with a strong immune system: “This very coronavirus entered people’s bodies, but many did not fall ill. How did that happen?” Ayatollah Khamenei explained that a strong immune system was what enabled a successful fight against viruses. “Should we want to liken the economy to human body, the defense system that provides the economy with security would be production,” the Leader pointed out. “In other words, the element that can neutralize invasive viruses and microbes targeting the economy and keep it healthy is production,” Ayatollah Khamenei stated. The Leader categorized  the invasive economic factors into “natural viruses” and “manufactured viruses such as sanctions and [the manipulation of] the oil price.” “However, if we have good production [levels], we can resist these viruses,” Ayatollah Khamenei said. Khamenei stressed that “genuine cooperation” between employees and employers would be needed to achieve this economic miracle, which he described as a “resistive economy” that could counteract “enemy maneuvers” from the United States. Iran has experienced several major labor strikes over the past few years, in addition to protests about the generally lousy state of the ayatollah’s economy and the government’s tendency to blow public money on foreign military adventures instead of domestic relief. Some observers suspect the pandemic has only slightly delayed another major protest by labor, and when it finally arrives, it could be much worse due to seething public resentment of how the regime botched its coronavirus response plus mounting anxieties over the Iranian economy. Working forward from a February column on the subject by David Ignatius at the Washington Post, one might wonder if the all-consuming menace of the pandemic delayed a political reckoning for the aging revolutionary regime that began with America’s killing of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Gen. Qasem Soleimani and the IRGC’s subsequent murder of a planeload of civilians.  Soleimani was the avatar of everything that angers many Iranian workers about their rulers’ habit of splurging on foreign troop deployments and terrorism, and the airliner shootdown created a good deal of domestic anger at the regime, especially given Tehran’s embarrassing efforts to cover it up. The Iranian resistance anticipates even greater public anger when the Iranian people realize how extravagantly their rulers have lied about the extent of the coronavirus pandemic. On Wednesday, the opposition PMOI/MEK charged that the regime failed to conceal an enormous new wave of infections caused by sending Iranians back to work too soon, with insufficient emphasis on social distancing techniques: By forcing people back to work, the number of people contracting the Coronavirus has accelerated across the country and the spokesman for Rouhani’s Health ministry was forced to admit it. Today, he announced the number of new patients in the last 24 hours as 1,680, which is more than double the number on May 4, which was 802, and its consequences will appear in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, last night, the state-run TV broadcast Rouhani’s meeting with Health Ministry’s officials on May 4, during which he tried to justify the regime’s fake statistics. “There are people who are not aware of their infections; neither is any hospital, nor any toll centers. So we have to accept that number of patients in all countries around the globe may be more than what their statistics say … the same goes for the death toll … When a person (infected with Coronavirus) with an underlying disease dies, should we mention that underlying disease as the cause of death, or should we consider Coronavirus as the cause? … We can do both ways, and countries do the same.” Saeid Namaki, regime’s Health Minister, addressing the same meeting, said, “We expected the virus would be contained as the weather gets warmer, but now our tropical provinces, like Khuzestan, Hormozgan, or Bushehr, are taking on an upward trend.” Farhad Abol-Nejadian, president of Khuzestan University of Medical Sciences, told the state- TV’s news network, “Due to the decrease in social distancing since April 11, 2020, we have an increasing trend starting from April 20, 2020. The highest rate of infection is in Ahvaz, Bavi, Dezful, Shooshtar, and Karun… The major concentration of the outbreak is in the suburbs of the cities, where there is more economical and living restraint.” The MEK said Rouhani is too focused on generating a sense of public optimism to help the economy recover and too confident that his officials could conceal the true number of infections and deaths. Iran’s official death toll stood at 6,486 on Thursday, but the MEK has long insisted the real number is at least five times as high, currently counting over 39,500 fatalities spread across 314 Iranian cities.

University of Pittsburgh Medical Center’s (UPMC) Chief Medical Officer Dr. Steven Shapiro on Wednesday called for Pennsylvania to reopen, laying out statistics showing that the coronavirus pandemic did not overwhelm hospitals in the UPMC system and explaining that “this is a disease of the elderly, sick and poor” and warning that “extended social isolation” cannot continue. Dr. Shapiro issued the remarks during a roundtable discussion with Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA) detailing the experiences and findings gleaned from the UPMC hospital system’s battle with the virus. Shapiro explained that they took steps to prepare for a surge in coronavirus patients by “radically” transforming their hospital operations “to create a safe environment for patients and staff,” delaying non-urgent surgeries, and ramping up telemedicine “38-fold.” While they saw a “steady stream” of patients, a surge never came to fruition. In fact, during the peak, coronavirus patients occupied just two percent of their 5,500 hospital beds and 48 of their 750 available ventilators. “Subsequently, admissions have been decreasing with very few patients now coming from the community, almost all now being from nursing homes. Of note, in the 36 UPMC-owned senior facilities we have had zero positive cases,” he said, explaining that the outcomes in the hospital system are “similar to the state of Pennsylvania” and noting that the median age of death from the virus in the state is 84-years old. “The few younger patients who died all had significant preexisting conditions. Very few children were infected and none died. Minorities in our communities fared equally as well as others, but we know that this is not the case nationally,” he continued, adding, “In sum, this is a disease of the elderly, sick and poor.” He explained that the hospital system is “actively bringing back our patients for essential care following CMS guidelines,” using PPE and testing all, “even asymptomatic, preoperative patients for active viral infection with PCR.” “To date, 0 out of 1,000 tested positive in western Pennsylvania, New York and Maryland,” he revealed. “Three of 500 are positive in central Pennsylvania. Our community prevalence is low, which we will soon confirm with antibody testing.” While Shapiro said virus hotspots, like New York, must “open up in a measured step-wise manner with extensive testing, tracing and treatment,” other areas should be able to keep virus rates low as long as vulnerable people, particularly seniors in nursing homes, remain protected. That could buy time for a “potential resurgence as we bolster our supply chain and find effective intervention.” “COVID-19 is a disease that ravages those with preexisting conditions – whether it be immunosenescence of aging or the social determinants of health,” he reaffirmed. “We can manage society in the presence of this pathogen if we focus on these preexisting conditions,” Shapiro added. “What we cannot do,” Shapiro warned, “is extended social isolation,” noting the social makeup of mankind and highlighting the “adverse mental health consequences of loneliness.” “That is before the much greater effects of economic devastation take hold on the human condition,” he added. Calling the coronavirus pandemic a “wake-up call for our health care system and our nation in general,” the medical chief said pandemics “will be part of our future, and we must be better prepared” but warned that the country cannot be placed in a position where it has to “choose between death by pathogen or death by our economy.” He continued: In this particular case, the problem we’re not going to be able to fix in the short term is the complete eradication of the virus. The problem we can fix is to serve and protect our seniors, especially those in nursing homes. If we do that, we can reopen society, and though infectious cases may rise as in the Theodore Roosevelt, the death rate will not, providing time for the development of treatments and vaccines. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D) is only allowing 24 counties to move into the “yellow” phase of reopening, effective Friday, May 8. Those include Bradford, Cameron, Centre, Clarion, Clearfield, Clinton, Crawford, Elk, Erie, Forest, Jefferson, Lawrence, Lycoming, McKean, Mercer, Montour, Northumberland, Potter, Snyder, Sullivan, Tioga, Union, Venango, and Warren counties. On Wednesday, the Keystone State reported less than 1,000 new cases of the virus for the fourth day in a row. “Trends mean more than any specific day, but it’s starting to form a trend, so I think that that’s very positive news,” Health Secretary Rachel Levine said. Wolf on Wednesday announced the creation of the “Commonwealth Civilian Coronavirus Corps,” described as a “​a public service initiative that will support efforts ​this fall to increase testing and contact tracing and provide critical new job opportunities in the public health sector.” “‘The Commonwealth Civilian Coronavirus Corps will serve as a public service program that will expand our ability to conduct contact tracing and testing and mobilize Pennsylvanians to contain COVID-19,” the governor said.

Coronavirus diagnoses fell below 1,000 for the fourth straight day in Pennsylvania on Wednesday, according to Health Secretary Rachel Levine. The health secretary said the numbers were starting to form a trend, which was positive news, according to Fox 29. She continued: As of 12 a.m. this morning, we have 888 new cases of COVID-19. This brings our statewide total to 51,845 Pennsylvanians who have tested positive for COVID-19 in all 67 counties. This includes 3,316 positive cases and healthcare workers. It includes 2,062 positive cases in workers within the food industry at 122 facilities statewide. And it includes 10,010 positive cases among residents of 502 long-term care living facilities, which include nursing homes and personal care homes. Tragically, we now have 3,106 patients who have passed away who have tested positive for COVID-19. To date, all of our deaths have been in adult patients. As of 10 a.m. today, hospitals are reporting that approximately 2,553 patients are currently hospitalized due to COVID-19. Five hundred and forty-nine of those patients are currently requiring the use of a ventilator or a breathing machine. The state’s healthcare system also had approximately 46 percent of its hospital beds, 40 percent of intensive care unit beds, and almost 75 percent of its ventilators still available, the secretary noted. As of Thursday, Pennsylvania recorded 52,915 total cases of the virus, according to the Department of Health’s website.  “All 67 counties in Pennsylvania are under a Stay at Home Order through May 8. All of Pennsylvania is currently in the red phase. Beginning at 12:01 a.m., Friday, May 8, 24 counties will move from red to yellow,” the site read.  Wednesday, Gov. Tom Wolf (D) announced the creation of the Commonwealth Civilian Coronavirus Corps to increase testing, contact tracing, and “provide critical new job opportunities,” once the economy reopened. The press release stated: The Wolf Administration’s continued measured and careful efforts to reopen Pennsylvania will depend on our ability to expand the availability of COVID-19 testing and develop a robust infrastructure to conduct surveillance and contact tracing. This work will allow Pennsylvanians to effectively monitor and respond to new cases and quantify mitigation efforts. It will help our phased reopening efforts while ensuring that the health care system does not become overwhelmed and that the transmission of disease continues to slow. Despite the governor’s stay-at-home orders, Gorilla House Gym owners Ray and Angela Ross reopened their business Friday in Blair County. “No one allowed us to do this,” Ray said. “We did this on our own. We just decided to do it. We didn’t ask permission to do it. We just did it, and we’re going to keep doing it. Someone had to take a stand. Enough is enough.” Tuesday, Blair County reported just 25 cases of the disease, according to Breitbart News. “The governor keeps pushing back the opening day, and it’s pretty obvious this has turned political. Nurses are being laid off, and the hospitals are not overrun,” Ray concluded.

State-run China Daily on Wednesday censored an article cosigned by the European Union (EU) ambassador to China, Nicolas Chapuis, and the ambassadors of 27 EU member states.  The op-ed was blacklisted by China even though the EU agreed to cut a sentence that offended the Chinese Foreign Ministry from the English-language version of the piece, an act of self-censorship that drew sharp criticism from across the Western world without appeasing the Chinese. The article, which had the upbeat title “EU-China Ties Vital Amid Global Crisis,” was written in the style of an open letter and intended as a bit of diplomatic outreach to Communist China on the 45th anniversary of its establishment of formal relations with the EU.  A sample from the English-language version reveals a celebration of Euro-Chinese relations that could not be much more complimentary to the brutal regime in Beijing, laced with fervent hopes that business as usual can resume once these “true partners” finish helping each other deal with that pesky pandemic: We have come a very long way since 1975. At that time, the EU was made up of just nine member states. China was only beginning to open up and had yet to undergo its formidable economic transformation. Trade between our two sides was miniscule; now, in normal times, the EU and China engage in 1.8 billion euros of trade per day with each other. We cooperate in more areas than ever before, including political, economic, financial, scientific, educational and cultural. We both have obvious shared interests in the peaceful resolution of global conflicts, climate change mitigation, sustainable development, food and energy security, nuclear non-proliferation and social justice. And we share a common aspiration to bring our relationship to an even more productive level in the years to come, as connectivity increases between Europe and Asia. While we have our differences, notably on human rights, our partnership has become mature enough to allow frank discussion on these issues. We both see merits in upholding and defending multilateralism, with the United Nations and World Trade Organization at its core. As recently as mid-January, the year 2020 had been hailed as a crucial one for EU-China relations, with numerous high-level meetings aimed at deepening EU-China cooperation. But the outbreak of the coronavirus has meant that our pre-existing plans have been temporarily side-tracked as both the EU and China are fully mobilized to tackle what has now become a challenge of truly global proportions. However, we are currently rescheduling the annual EU-China summit, which was originally due to take place in Beijing in March, and plans for a special summit of leaders of EU Member States and China in Leipzig in September are on track. The EU ambassadors rhapsodized about how the pandemic “will reshape our world” but hoped it would be shaped in a way mutually beneficial to their nations and Communist China. The latter paragraphs celebrated all the ways Europe and China have helped each other during the crisis and then hoped they could “cooperate to make this a green recovery,” which is grimly amusing considering how much carbon China pumps into the atmosphere and how little Beijing cares about any European or American’s opinion of its practices.  Politico on Wednesday characterized the article as part of the EU’s “pivot to China,” a signal that European capitals are ready to take China’s side instead of America’s in the post-pandemic global power struggle, almost a continental letter of surrender to Beijing’s political narrative of the coronavirus. It still was not good enough for the tyrants Europe is trying so desperately to flatter and appease because the original draft dared to obliquely mention where the virus came from. The “offending” line read, “But the outbreak of the coronavirus in China, and its subsequent spread to the rest of the world over the past three months, has meant that our pre-existing plans have been temporarily side-tracked.” That was enough to get China Daily to refuse to publish the article in Chinese, as it has promised the EU ambassadors it would. The EU decided to allow Chinese censors to remove the line from the English-language publication of the piece, although they grumbled impotently about it.  From the South China Morning Post on Thursday: “The EU delegation to China was informed that the publication could only take place with the agreement of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs,” Virginie Battu-Henriksson, EU spokeswoman on foreign affairs, said in an emailed reply. “The EU delegation to China made known its concerns to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in no uncertain terms, both on the process and on the request to remove part of a sentence related to the origins and spread of coronavirus to allow publication,” Battu-Henriksson said. The EU diplomats decided to proceed with the publication “with considerable reluctance”, she said, so that the article, titled “EU-China ties vital amid global crisis”, could coincide with the 45th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the EU and China. The Chinese responded by taunting the Europeans and the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) that they will never be allowed to investigate the true origins of the virus, and made it clear that anything less than full endorsement of Beijing’s propaganda will be dismissed as “politicizing” the pandemic: The ambassador to United Nations Geneva, Chen Xu, told reporters on Wednesday that China will not invite international experts to investigate the source of Covid-19 until the “final victory” against the virus has been secured. China’s priority is first beating the pandemic – and countering the “absurd and ridiculous” politicization of the new coronavirus, Chen said. The World Health Organisation says it is waiting on an invitation from China to take part in its investigations into the animal origins of the virus, first reported in the city of Wuhan in December. Asked when the WHO could expect an invitation, Chen replied: “The top priority, for the time being, is to focus on the fight against the pandemic until we win the final victory.” China Daily then offered the Europeans a little pat on the head for at least trying to play ball with the CCP: Since the start of the outbreak, the pandemic has brought China and Europe closer together, which has been demonstrated by the mutual support and aid between China and the EU and its members. President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang have been in contact with European leaders－including European Council President Charles Michel, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron－on the outbreak as well as bilateral and international issues. A report titled “Covid-19 in Europe-China Relations” released on April 29 by the European Think Tank Network on China said the COVID-19 crisis was the first time that China has figured so prominently in an issue of immediate critical importance to European people and governments. “The way that relations with China evolve over the course of the crisis will likely have a lasting effect on the Europe-China relationship,” said the report. China and the EU both support and uphold multilateralism in addressing global challenges, and through various dialogue mechanisms. They are stepping up cooperation on diagnostics, treatment, pharmaceutical and vaccine development, as well as regular exchanges of information and expertise. By Thursday, EU Ambassador Chapuis was sufficiently irked to complain about Chinese (and Russian) efforts to spread disinformation in Europe and meddle in European politics.  “We are documenting this and we think it should be stopped,” he said. The Financial Times noted that it has exposed videos produced by Chinese state media that were deceptively edited to make it “appear that Italians on their balconies were applauding the Chinese national anthem,” and recalled that China was accused in April of pressuring the EU to “tone down a report on disinformation.” All of which was already known to EU ambassadors when they decided to write their obsequious open letter to the Chinese Communist regime and were surprised to discover they are no longer permitted to mention which country the coronavirus came from if they want their “partnership” with it to flourish.

The Department of Defense on Wednesday enacted a new policy medically disqualifying potential recruits who have been hospitalized for coronavirus (COVID-19), a defense official told Breitbart News on background. The policy states that individuals diagnosed or confirmed with coronavirus “but NOT hospitalized” are “medically QUALIFIED” to process for accession into the military 28 days following home isolation. However, it states that individuals diagnosed or confirmed with COVID19 “but HOSPITALIZED” are “medically DISQUALIFIED” for accession, subject to further review of their hospitalization and comorbidity records, and a waiver by a Service Medical Waiver Authority. In other words, anybody that has been hospitalized with COVID-19 will be medically disqualified and would need a service waiver to join the military. The policy began on May 6, 2020, — and does not apply to any currently serving service member who has already been diagnosed or confirmed to have coronavirus, or hospitalized from coronavirus. A memo describing the new policy began circulating on social media earlier this week, as first reported by Military Times. The defense official said that version was updated on Wednesday. The official said the Pentagon has enacted this policy because there is still much to learn about how coronavirus — especially for those hospitalized — affects an individual’s pulmonary system and organs. The official noted that there are a number of disqualifying conditions for military service subject to medical waiver, such as asthma. A full list of disqualifying conditions can be found here. COVID-19 hospitalizations will be added to the list, the official said. The policy is “interim guidance.” Permanent guidance will be issued at some point, the official said.

The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) revealed on Thursday that faulty coronavirus test kits imported to Tanzania – which produced positive samples for a goat and a pawpaw, a papaya-like fruit – came from China, Reuters reported. Prior to the revelation, the origin of the imported test kits was unknown. On Sunday, Tanzania’s President John Magufuli ordered an investigation into imported coronavirus test kits after announcing that the tests returned positive results for samples taken from a goat and a pawpaw. At the time, the president did not say where the test kits had been imported. On Thursday, John Nkengasong, head of the Africa CDC, responded to the investigation. Nkengasong said that the test kits in question were imported to Africa from China, and then sent to Tanzania by the Africa CDC. China donated the test kits to Africa through the Jack Ma Foundation, a charitable organization founded by Chinese billionaire and Communist Party member Jack Ma. Ma founded the Chinese multinational technology company Alibaba Group. In a speech broadcast on Tanzanian-state TV on Sunday and reported on by Reuters, Magufuli explained how the imported tests came to produce positive results for an animal and a fruit. The president said he requested the goat and pawpaw samples – along with several other non-human samples – be submitted for testing at a Tanzanian laboratory, in an attempt to verify the testing kits’ accuracy. The non-human samples were assigned human names and ages and lab technicians were left intentionally unaware of their true origins. On Sunday, the president called for an investigation of the imported testing kits and the Tanzanian laboratory in which the kits were used. He said he suspected a “dirty game” had taken place in the laboratory, according to a report by Al Jazeera. “The equipment or people [lab technicians] may be compromised and sometimes it can be sabotage,” Magufuli said, according to the report. On Monday, the director of the laboratory that produced the positive goat and pawpaw tests was suspended “to pave way for the investigation,” which is now underway. On Thursday, Nkengasong commented on Magufuli’s allegation that the Africa CDC sent defective Chinese test kits to Tanzania, Reuters reports. “We are very instrumental in training, providing training to nearly all countries, and providing them with test kits. We’ve also in the last couple of weeks and months distributed tests from the Jack Ma Foundation that have been validated and proven to be very, very reliable,” the Africa CDC chief said. Matshidiso Moeti, leader of the World Health Organization’s (W.H.O.) Africa office, also reacted to Tanzania’s investigation of the imported test kits. “We are convinced that the tests that have been provided … both through procurement through [W.H.O.’s Africa office] and those that came through Jack Ma donations, were not contaminated with the [Chinese corona]virus,” Moeti said in a teleconference with journalists on Thursday, according to Reuters. Recently, Magufuli’s administration has drawn criticism for its alleged failure to contain Tanzania’s coronavirus outbreak. The country’s reaction to the coronavirus has been relatively lax, with most public institutions and businesses remaining open, with the exception of schools and universities. In March, the president encouraged Tanzanians to pray away the coronavirus in lieu of wearing protective masks. Opposition leaders have accused Magufuli of hiding Tanzania’s true coronavirus statistics, implying that they are higher than reported. At press time on Thursday, Tanzania had officially reported 480 infections and 16 deaths from the Chinese coronavirus.

FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) — IndyCar has gotten the green flag to finally start its season in Texas next month with a night race without spectators. The June 6 race at Texas Motor Speedway was the next on the series schedule that hadn’t been postponed or canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic. IndyCar and track officials announced the race Thursday. IndyCar President Jay Frye said IndyCar worked closely with TMS President Eddie Gossage, his track and public health officials on a plan to “ensure the safety of our event participants alongside an exciting return to competition for our drivers, teams and viewers tuning in from around the world.” Texas has hosted IndyCar races since the 1 1/2-mile track opened in 1997. The track used to have the first race after the Indianapolis 500, and hosted two races a year from 1998-2004, including the series finale the last six years of that stretch. The June season opener will run a condensed schedule with practice, qualifying and the race taking place on the same day. There will be strict access guidelines limiting the number of personnel on site, with health screening system administered to all participants and personal protection equipment provided to everyone entering the facility. Social distancing protocols will be in place and carefully maintained. “America needs live sports and they are not going to believe what they see when the Genesys 300 storms into their living rooms on TV from Texas,” Gossage said. “One of the world’s greatest sporting events, the Indy 500, has been postponed until August by coronavirus, so all of that pent-up energy, anticipation, frustrations and anxiety will be pounding through the drivers’ nervous systems.”

Republicans will be punished by their voter base if they side with “globalist” interests and fail to hold China accountable for the one-party state’s predatory mercantilism and negligence related to the coronavirus outbreak, said Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN), offering his warning on Wednesday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with host Rebecca Mansour and special guest host Ed Martin. Banks warned of the coronavirus’s spread via Twitter on January 31, cautioning against accepting the Chinese Communist Party’s epidemiological claims at face value: #Coronavirus is spreading as quickly as Spanish flu, which infected ~500 Million. And the #CCP is likely under-reporting cases.   W/out reliable info, a pro-active response is needed. Quarantine is a good 1st step, @HHSGov.  https://t.co/SyB61jkG4C — Jim Banks (@RepJimBanks) January 31, 2020  Banks described China’s geopolitical ambition to usurp America as the world’s leading superpower. “I wish I wasn’t right about all of this, but any of us who have been following China for very long at all understand that it’s China’s design to seize on moments like these, like what we’re enduring at the moment, to capitalize on the moment as part of their longer-term strategy is dominate the United States militarily and economically.” Banks’ earliest awareness of China’s predation upon American industry came from his father in the nineties. “I come from northeast Indiana. We’re a very blue-collar working class district. My dad retired from an automotive factory. He made axles all of his life, and all of my childhood I grew up hearing about what my dad intuitively knew, [which was] that China was stealing our jobs even back then in the nineties and disrupting our economy and that has led us down the perilous path that we’re on today.” President Donald Trump ushered in a sea change regarding policy and popular opinion towards China and the status quo of international trade, observed Banks. “President Trump is the first president in my lifetime to get tough on China while every other president in my lifetime has sought to appease and — sort of as I put it — hug the panda bear, rather than hold China accountable for their egregious behavior,” Banks said. Banks introduced legislation to limit the Chinese government’s ownership share of U.S.-based companies to 51 percent. His website describes the Restricting Predatory Acquisition During COVID-19 Act as law “that would prevent predatory investments of American companies by the Chinese government. Rep. Banks’ bill would expand the scope of CFIUS to review purchases by companies with ties to the Chinese Communist Party during the COVID-19 pandemic.” “]My legislation] would prevent companies with ties to the the PRC from owning more than 51 percent of the shares in different types of companies, especially companies that are related to our national security,” Banks said. Banks highlighted Hunter Biden’s financial relationship with the Chinese state as illustrative of weakness at the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). “We need to build [CFIUS] up and give it more teeth, especially at a time like this where our economy is suffering because of the pandemic, and we know that China is trying to seize the moment.” Strengthening CFIUS “could prevent these types of situations from occurring, the type of corrupt activities that Hunter Biden was involved with related to Chinese investments through the private equity funding he was a part of. This is the story I’m hearing out of Silicon Valley all the time with with these types of activities. It’s happening right in broad daylight as China comes in and steals our companies, our ingenuity, our intellectual property, our innovation, and turns around and takes it back to China views to serve their best interests.” The Republican base is growing increasingly concerned about China as an adversary relative to previous years, assessed Banks. Banks said, “I’ve been working on the China issue since I’ve been in Congress — for four years — introducing bills long before the pandemic, but today, now, you have almost — maybe over — half of Republicans in Congress who are introducing bills addressing the China threat. I applaud that and I’m glad about that.” “Now it’s a larger issue,” added Banks. “The reason for that, though, is because — what you’re hitting on is so important — the Republican base isn’t going to stand for this any longer, and that’s why … I  don’t have to convince [my constituents] that we should hold China accountable. They’re holding me accountable to hold China accountable, and I think you’re going to find that at large among the Republican base nationwide.” Banks went on, “We’ve seen recent polling that shows that even the American population at large hold China accountable for what we’re experiencing today. We must hold them accountable, and if we don’t, it’ll be a true leadership failure that the voters will seek retribution at the ballot box for, so I hope my party — the Republican Party — gets it right, and I hope we won’t be persuaded by some of the more globalist so-called pro-business entities out there who have who recognized in the moment that public pressure is there against entangling ourselves further with China’s economy.” Banks recommended Republican adoption of a “Made-in-America” campaign. “I hope that a year from now, those groups don’t come back and try to pressure Republicans to bend and give in to China’s demands, but rather the Republican Party does the right thing and forecasts a vision. A big part of our plan moving forward will be to do that, to disentangle our economy rather than further entangle our economy.” Banks shared, “What I’m hearing from my constituents over and over is that we’re willing to pay an extra quarter for this product or an extra dollar for this appliance if it’s made in America versus being made in China. That’s a message that I remember hearing so clearly from my dad in the nineties when it came to be made in Mexico versus made in America. Now we need a new Made-in-America campaign related to purchasing American goods versus Chinese goods.” “Will we reelect a president that’s tough on China, or will we turn to the opposite direction and elect a Democrat candidate in Joe Biden who we know is going to seek to appease China?” asked Banks. “That’s what’s at stake in the selection in November.” Breitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.

A 93-year-old California man was hitchhiking on the side of the road if it meant he could do one thing: buy his sweetheart chocolate, as they have done for almost two decades. Mike Cain was hitchhiking near his retirement center in Lake San Marcos when he ran into real estate agent Richard Farmer, NBC 4 Los Angeles reported. “I paused, and I was like, ‘Is that guy hitchhiking?’ So, I made a U-turn, immediately went back and asked him if he was OK,” Farmer said. It turns out that Cain was trying to get a lift to go to the 99 Cents Only Store that was 1.5 miles away from his retirement center to buy Hershey’s chocolate bars for his sweetheart, Do Jerman. Cain has been eating chocolate with Jerman nearly every night for almost 20 years and was not about to let the coronavirus pandemic stop that tradition. “We don’t eat the whole bar — just a couple pieces,” Cain said. Cain and Farmer developed a kinship, and Cain later called up Farmer to ask if he could take him grocery shopping. “He’s very unique,” Cain said of Farmer. “I’ve gotten rides before like that, but they take me and drop me off. But that Rich – he does it 100%.” Farmer said he was amazed at how much Cain was in love with this girl. “I was amazed. I’m like, ‘This guy must really be in love with this gal,'” Farmer said. Farmer eventually got to meet Cain’s girl when he dropped him off. “He can go wherever he wants to go; I probably have to send the police after him,” Jerman said when she discovered how far Cain was going to walk to get her chocolate. The couple said they were touched by Farmer’s kindness, adding that there are not too many people like him in the world. Some 93-year-old men pay tribute to their sweethearts in other ways. One 93-year-old man eats lunch next to a picture of his late wife’s photo daily. Still, other 93-year-old men are out on the golf course, like this one man who made a hole-in-one in 2018 after 65 years of golfing.

Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), the co-chair of the House Progressive Caucus, said in an interview with Vox on Wednesday that Americans’ “enormous suffering” is her leverage to enact leftist causes such as the Green New Deal. Vox Editor-at-Large Ezra Klein noted that Sen. Brian Schatz (D-HI) recently said that Republicans, not Democrats, have used leverage during the coronavirus response. Schatz told Klein: Democrats have had to step into the breach to minimize suffering. There are a lot of keyboard pundits who view this as a forfeiture of leverage. And I understand what they’re saying. But we have to be very clear: They’re talking about using suffering as leverage. That is what the Republicans do, not what we do. Klein asked Jayapal what kind of leverage progressives and Democrats have to reduce “human suffering.” Jayapal responded, charging that progressives need bold ideas to counter the spread of suffering. She said: That is exactly the point: How do we respond to the scale of the suffering if we are just responding to one piece of it? If we are giving away the thing that Republicans are hanging their hat on, then what brings them back to the table for negotiation? So I think it depends on how you use the word leverage. For me, the leverage is that there is enormous suffering, and if we do not respond with the boldness and the scale that this crisis demands, then that suffering will continue. I think it’s important for us to not allow ourselves to be pulled into a place where we don’t define the agenda, given that we are the ones that seem to be put in the position of really defining what the solution is going to land on. [emphasis added] House Republican Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) slammed Jayapal’s move to use Americans’ suffering as “political opportunism.” Sean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News.

Pop star Madonna announced that she has recently tested positive for coronavirus antibodies. Madonna took to Instagram on Wednesday to share with her 15.1 million followers that she believes she had been infected with the Chinese coronavirus earlier this year after getting her antibodies test back, which reveals that she has them. “[I’m] Grateful that I can be a part of supporting Research to Find the cure for Covid -19!!” said Madonna in her Instagram caption. The singer has also previously donated $1 million to help find a vaccine for the Wuhan virus. “And just to clear things up for people who would rather believe sensationalist headlines than do their own research about the nature of this virus — I am not currently sick.”     Im Grateful that I can be a part of supporting Research to Find the cure for Covid -19!! 🙏🏼 And just to clear things up for people who would rather believe sensationalist headlines than do their own research about the nature of this virus— I am not currently sick. When you test positive for anti-bodies it means you HAD the virus which I. clearly did as I was  sick at the end of my tour in Paris over 7 weeks ago along with many other artists in my show but at the time  We  all thought we had a very bad flu.  Thank God we are all healthy and well now. Hope that clears  things up for the band wagon jumpers!! Knowledge is Power! #covid19 A post shared by  Madonna (@madonna) on May 6, 2020 at 10:18am PDT “When you test positive for anti-bodies it means you HAD the virus which I clearly did as I was sick at the end of my tour in Paris over 7 weeks ago along with many other artists in my show but at the time,” continued Madonna. “We all thought we had a very bad flu,” the Grammy-winner added. “Thank God we are all healthy and well now. Hope that clears things up for the band wagon jumpers!! Knowledge is Power! #covid19” Madonna had drew criticism in March after she posted an Instagram photo of herself sitting nude in a bathtub full of rose petals, captioning the photo with a statement about how she believes the Chinese coronavirus is “the great equalizer.” “That’s the thing about COVID-19,” wrote Madonna. “It doesn’t care how smart you are, where you live, how old you are, what amazing stories you can tell.” “It’s the great equalizer and what’s terrible about is it what’s great about it,” she added. “What’s terrible about it is that it’s made us all equal in many ways and what’s wonderful about is, is that it’s made us all equal in many ways.” Then there was the bathroom video of her reimagining her hit “Vogue” which included lyrics about eating fried fish. Living in Special Times…………thank GOD for imagination and fried fish! ὂὂὂ #quarantine #covid_19 #staysafe #becreative pic.twitter.com/AsStqQObOO — Madonna (@Madonna) March 20, 2020  “Come on! Go!

Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) has filed a joint resolution to withdraw the United States from the World Trade Organization (WTO) in the wake of the Chinese coronavirus crisis. This week, Hawley penned an op-ed in the New York Times where he called for the abolishment of the WTO, as Breitbart News reported. On Thursday, Hawley filed a resolution that would remove the U.S. from the WTO. The resolution can be read here: Josh Hawley WTO Resolution by John Binder on Scribd  Hawley said in a statement: The coronavirus pandemic has exposed deep, long-standing flaws in our global economic system that demand reform. International organizations like the WTO have enabled the rise of China and benefitted elites around the globe while hollowing out American industry, from small towns to once-thriving urban centers. We need to return production to America, secure critical supply chains, and encourage domestic innovation. Pulling out of the WTO is a good first step. The resolution, officials told Breitbart News, will inevitably have to come up for a vote in the U.S. Senate due to rules passed by Congress in 1994. Those rules dictate that a report be sent to Congress every five years on the impact the WTO has had on the American economy. The rules allow Congress to revoke U.S. participation in the WTO through a resolution within 90 days after the report is provided to lawmakers. Since the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was enacted and China entered the World Trade Organization (WTO), nearly five million American manufacturing jobs have been eliminated from the American economy — 3.4 million of which are due to U.S. free trade with China. The mass elimination of working and middle class jobs and depressed U.S. wages due to NAFTA and China’s entering the WTO have coincided with a more than 600 percent increase in trade deficits. Of the 3.4 million American jobs lost due to free trade with China, about 2.6 million — or about three-fourths — were lost in the crippled manufacturing industry. U.S. trade deficits with China have eliminated American jobs in all 50 states. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter at @JxhnBinder.

YouTube is scrambling to shut down a 26-minute vignette of the upcoming documentary Plandemic, which examines the response of global governments to the Chinese virus, and alleges that special interests including vaccine producers have the most to gain from the worldwide crisis. The viral video, which had over a million views and has been continuously reuploaded since its removal by YouTube,  features Dr. Judy Mikovits, a former medical researcher well known for her criticism of mass vaccination programs. It takes aim at Dr. Anthony Fauci and many of the advice offered by experts to contain the pandemic, including shelter-in-place and the use of masks. The clip implies that the pandemic is being overhyped to benefit vaccine companies. Mikovits also accuses Fauci of delaying her research into AIDS treatments in the 1980s. As of Wednesday, it had gone viral across multiple platforms including YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, and Vimeo. According to NBC, many of these platforms are now clamping down. Via NBC: A YouTube spokeswoman said the platform quickly removes flagged content that violate its community guidelines, including content that includes medically unsubstantiated diagnostic advice for Covid-19. According to the company, the video was removed for making claims about a cure for Covid-19 that has not been backed by health organizations. Vimeo said it “stands firm in keeping [its] platform safe from content that spreads harmful and misleading health information.” It said the video had been removed for violating those policies and added that it will be constantly monitoring and will continue to remove similar videos uploaded. Twitter, where users were sharing video links and clips, said it has blocked the hashtags ”#PlagueofCorruption” and #PlandemicMovie” from trends and search. According to the company, a video shared on Twitter by Judy Mikovits, who is featured in the video, is not in violation of its misinformation policy. Facebook has reportedly given out mixed messages, with one spokesperson telling NBC that the Plandemic video is “eligible for fact-checkers to review and rate,” and another saying “Suggesting that wearing a mask can make you sick could lead to imminent harm, so we’re removing the video.” Although it is being censored across multiple platforms, the Plandemic clip appears to be the beneficiary of the “Streisand Effect,” an Internet adage which explains that attempts to suppress information sometimes causes that information to be be shared wider and faster, as people who believe the information is important work to get it out to people before the net of censorship closes. The censored video is still available on alternative platforms like NewTube and Bitchute.

Thursday on MSNBC, while host Nicolle Wallace was discussing with Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) the decision by the Justice Department to drop the case against former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn for allegedly lying to the FBI amid the coronavirus pandemic, Wallace accused President Donald Trump of throwing around the COVID-19 death toll “with a callousness that’s just unimaginable.” Harris said, “We have 33 million people in America who just in the last few weeks have become unemployed. To have a work requirement that people are employed in order to get food stamps is outrageous because, of course, we now have 33 million people who are not working. So there’s a lot of work that needs to happen and needs to happen immediately, to your point, so that these children are not going hungry.” Wallace said, “What do you say about this whiplash? You look at the lines of cars in places like Dallas lining up for the food banks, and it’s clear that these were families on their way to carpool and offices 60 days ago, and now we have a president who throws around the death toll with a callousness that’s just unimaginable. What do you make of all the country has been through in the last 60, 70 days?” Harris replied, “Honestly, it breaks my heart. I know it does that for all of us. People are suffering right now. People are hungry. They’re standing in lines. There is a hunger crisis in America right now, and we need to come to terms with this, and this is again where we need a commander-in-chief who takes on the responsibility of lifting up the American people and meeting their needs while in this crisis people are suffering literally to get food to feed their families. The fact that in America today, we have so many hungry people and that this is our crisis is unconscionable, and it requires all leaders to step up and focus on what is important today. It’s not letting somebody like Flynn off who pled guilty because he is guilty. It’s about having people in a position of leadership who are addressing the needs of people who are suffering in America today. The coincidence that this happened that the Department of Justice does this on the same day that the most recent unemployment numbers come out, on the same day that we have a report that one in five mothers is explaining that their children are hungry, talk about misplaced priorities. It is about an abject failure of leadership, abandonment of leadership when the American people need their government the most.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

The San Francisco health department confirmed on Wednesday that the city is “administering alcohol, tobacco, medical canabis and other substances in a effort to prevent a handful of people quarantined or isolating in city-leased hotels from going outside to get the substances themselves.” The San Francisco Chronicle reported on the effort first noted by KTVU in the coronavirus era:  The hotel residents are also receiving medications such as methadone — delivered by methadone clinics — to tamp down heroin cravings. It’s all part of a widely used “harm reduction” approach to helping addicts stay inside and curb the spread of the novel coronavirus while coping with the loss or reduction of their core drugs. The city-rented hotels have been reserved for individuals who either have COVID-19 or are at heightened risk of catching it, and who have no space of their own to safely self-isolate or quarantine. And some of those individuals have substance-abuse issues or are already on a methadone regimen. The city’s health department is doing what it can to help those individuals through the duration of their self-isolation or quarantine period, said Jenna Lane, a spokeswoman for the Department of Public Health. “They’re doing San Francisco a great service by staying inside,” Lane said in the Chronicle report. “We’re saying, ‘We’re doing what we can to support you staying inside and not have to go out and get these things.’”  Lane also said that “hotel guests” can have access to addiction treatment, clinicians, and social workers. She also said taxpayers are not paying for the substances and that private donations are footing the bill. The Chronicle said there were about 270 people being housed in hotels. The Chronicle reported: Those receiving substances from the health department represent a small subset — a few dozen people — of the population staying in hotel rooms to safely self-isolate or quarantine. Eleven of those under isolation and quarantine have received alcohol from the health department and around 27 have received tobacco, according to Lane. The health department helped five people coordinate delivery of medical cannabis to their hotels. Lane said health workers are determining the proper amount of alcohol they are providing. “For those guests, the DPH medical staff are calculating the minimum medically appropriate amounts of alcohol and distributing it with meals,” Lane said. “Alcohol withdrawal is the only one you can die from.” The Chronicle included the remarks of one drug counselor who has a problem with the policy. Thomas Wolf, a case manager who works with addicts in San Francisco, said: I have it from a pretty reliable source that weed and booze are being given to people in the hotels, and I have a real problem with that. There’s an ethical issue there. Alcohol kills more people than any other drug. And I understand the risks of having people detox in hotel rooms, but my understanding is the people who are quarantined in the hotels can leave for 30 minutes for essential services. “So if they have to get what they think they need, that’s what they should do. But don’t deliver it to them,” he said. “We want them to stay inside, but, man, you’ve got to draw the line somewhere and ask for more accountability,” said Wolf, who was a homeless addict before getting sober and helping others. “Don’t be enabling people.” I just found out that homeless placed in hotels in SF are being delivered Alcohol, Weed and Methadone because they identified as an addict/alcoholic for FREE. You're supposed to be offering treatment. This is enabling and is wrong on many levels. @SF_DPH @sfbos @LondonBreed — T Wolf (@MyTwolffamily) May 2, 2020  ⁦@MyTwolffamily⁩. Great job. Quoted on Fox News. San Francisco gives drugs, alcohol to homeless addicts in hotels during coronavirus, sparking debatehttps://t.co/XUJzTCifwP — FoodieChix (@foodiechix) May 7, 2020  The Chronicle noted that Alameda, Santa Clara, and Contra Costa counties also use a “harm reduction approach in their hotels.” “San Francisco Health Director Dr. Grant Colfax said the city’s approach was underpinned by “decades of (medical) literature” supporting harm reduction approaches to addiction management,” the Chronicle reported. “Our focus is using the best evidence to help people manage their addictions,” Colfax said at a press conference on Wednesday. “In some cases, this will include helping them manage their alcohol and nicotine use so they can stay safe and in place as much as possible to help their communities and help themselves.” Follow Penny Starr on Twitter
