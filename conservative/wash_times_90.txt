Three days after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer urged Michiganders to “Google” how to cut their own hair during the ongoing coronavirus-related restrictions, the Democratic governor was spotted marching with her hands raised among throngs of George Floyd protesters in Detroit Thursday. A video tweeted by WXYZ Detroit showed Ms. Whitmer purportedly violating her own social distancing orders by marching shoulder-to-shoulder with protesters. In the video, the governor wore a face mask with her arms raised as protesters chanted, “Hands up, don’t shoot.” .@GovWhitmer @LtGovGilchrist and Bishop Charles Ellis lead a group of marchers in Detroit honoring the life of #GeorgeFloyd.

                               “Elections matter,” Ms. Whitmer said during the march, The Detroit News reported. “We cannot be  defeated. We must move forward together. When we do that, we cannot be  defeated.” According to the state administration’s website, “Persons  may engage in expressive activities protected by the First Amendment  within the State of Michigan, but must adhere to social distancing  measures recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,  including remaining at least six feet from people from outside the  person’s household.” But Whitmer  spokeswoman Tiffany Brown denied the governor broke any rules. “The governor took precautions for engaging in an  outdoor activity, including wearing a mask even though it is not  required outdoors under the order,” Ms. Brown told The Detroit News. “Nothing in this order shall be taken to abridge protections  guaranteed by the state or federal constitution.” “That includes the right to peaceful protest,” she added. Just Monday, Ms. Whitmer said she had a “high level” of  concern about the Floyd protests potentially spreading the new coronavirus. Last month, she repeatedly criticized the anti-lockdown protesters who advocated for the reopening of the state’s economy. “The  fact of the matter is these protests, in a perverse way, make it  likelier that we are going to have to stay in a stay-home posture,”  Ms. Whitmer said of the anti-lockdown protesters on May 13, The Detroit News reported. “The whole point of them, supposedly, is that they  don’t want to be doing that.” On Monday, after violent protests swept the country for the sixth straight night over Floyd’s death, Ms. Whitmer urged residents to Google how to cut their own hair while hair salons and barbershops remain closed. “If you’re one of those people that’s going to  Ohio [for a haircut], I hope and pray that  you are doing your part not  to bring COVID-19 home,” the governor said Monday, referring to the disease caused by the coronavirus. “If you haven’t  resorted to that,  Google how to do a haircut, or throw your hair in a  ponytail or curl it  and get through the next couple of weeks so we can  resume some of  these things.” While the entire state has moved onto phase 4 of  reopening, which  includes dine-in bars and restaurants and retail stores, salons and  barbershops remain closed. Ms. Whitmer will update the state on its COVID-19 response at 11 a.m. Friday.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the federal government’s top infectious diseases expert, on Friday urged caution for those attending the massive George Floyd protests across the country as the coronavirus continues to present a threat to public health. Dr. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that being in such large crowds, chanting, and the chaos that has come out from some of the demonstrations are setting up dangerous conditions to spread COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. “It’s a perfect set-up for further spread of the virus in terms of creating some blips that could turn into some surges,” he told WTOP. “There certainly is a risk.” TOP STORIES

                               National unrest sparked after the deaths of Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor have renewed the painful debate of racial tensions and police brutality in the U.S. Earlier this week, a group of 1,288 “public-health officials, infectious disease professions, and community stakeholders” published an open letter endorsing the widespread protests as “vital to the national public health.” “Staying at home, social distancing, and public masking are effective at minimizing the spread of COVID-19,” they wrote. “To the extent possible, we support the application of these public health best practices during demonstrations that call attention to the pervasive lethal force of white supremacy.” In his interview, Dr. Fauci endorsed peaceful protests, but he urged demonstrators to keep their masks on at all times. “It’s important to exercise your constitutional right to be able to demonstrate. But it’s a delicate balance because the reasons for demonstrating are valid, but the demonstration puts one at additional risk,” he said. As of Friday morning, there were 1,874,411 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 108,238  deaths  in the U.S., according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The U.S. population is more than 300 million.

The unemployment rate fell to a better-than-expected 13.3% in May, the Labor Department said Friday, in the strongest signal yet that the economy has turned the corner from the coronavirus shutdowns. “This recovery begins today,” Vice President Mike Pence declared in an interview on CNBC. The jobless rate was more than 1 point lower than April’s rate of 14.7%, as employers added about 2.5 million jobs. There were job gains in hospitality and retail, as almost every sector increased hiring. An exception was local governments, which shed about 500,000 jobs.

                               President Trump quickly scheduled a news conference at the White House on the jobs report. The turnaround has implications for his reelection prospects, suggesting that the economy could be in stronger-than-expected shape through the summer and fall. Mr. Trump tweeted Friday, “Really Big Jobs Report. Great going President Trump (kidding but true)!” The unexpectedly positive report prompted major stock indexes to soar. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose more than 900 points, or about 3.5%, by mid-day; the S&P 500 rose 2.8% and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 2.2%. Many economists, including some at the White House, had forecast the unemployment rate in May to climb to nearly 20% and for job losses to reach 7 million for the month. In March and April, employers shed 21.4 million jobs as nearly all states ordered nonessential businesses to close. Despite the encouraging report, top congressional Democrats renewed their call for the Senate to approve a $3 trillion coronavirus relief package passed by the House three weeks ago. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard E. Neal, Massachusetts Democrat, noted that expanded unemployment benefits are scheduled to expire next month and tens of millions of Americans are still out of work. “Our country is in crisis,” Mr. Neal said. “Nearly 110,000 Americans have died due to COVID-19, and more than 42 million are out of work. Longstanding systemic injustices in our nation are front and center; they’re the reason communities of color disproportionately feel the health and economic effects of this pandemic, and they’re what have prompted thousands of people in all 50 states to take to the streets in peaceful protest. Yet as millions remain out of work and American deaths continue to multiply, Senate Republicans look the other way and refuse to take action.” Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said of the report, “The great American comeback is underway after the economy was artificially interrupted by the global pandemic.” “Incredibly, Joe Biden is counting on more economic pain for Americans so he can capitalize on it politically,” he said of the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. “It is disgusting and sad that Biden and the Democrats are openly worrying that America will get back to work because it would be bad news for them.”

COLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France (AP) — At least the dead will always be there. All too many have been, for 76 years since that fateful June 6 on  France’s Normandy beaches, when allied troops in 1944 turned the course  of World War II and went on to defeat fascism in Europe in one of the  most remarkable feats in military history. Forgotten they will never be. Revered, yes. But Saturday’s  anniversary will be one of the loneliest remembrances ever, as the  coronavirus pandemic is keeping almost everyone away — from government  leaders to frail veterans who might not get another chance for a final  farewell to their unlucky comrades. TOP STORIES

                               Rain and wind are also forecast, after weeks of warm, sunny weather. “The sadness is almost too much, because there is no one,” said local  guide Adeline James. “Plus you have their stories. The history is sad  and it’s even more overwhelming now between the weather, the (virus)  situation and, and, and.” The locals in this northwestern part of France have come out year  after year to show their gratitude for the soldiers from the United  States, Britain, Canada and other countries who liberated them from  Adolf Hitler’s Nazi forces. Despite the lack of international crowds, David Pottier still went  out to raise American flags in the Calvados village of Mosles,  population 356, which was liberated by allied troops the day after the  landing on five Normandy beachheads. In a forlorn scene, a gardener tended to the parched grass around the  small monument for the war dead, while Pottier, the local mayor, was  getting the French tricolor to flutter next to the Stars and Stripes. “We have to recognize that they came to die in a foreign land,” Pottier said. “We miss the GIs,” he said of the U.S. soldiers. The pandemic has wreaked havoc across the world, infecting 6.6  million people, killing over 391,000 and devastating economies. It poses  a particular threat to the elderly  - like the surviving D-Day veterans  who are in their late nineties or older. It has also affected the younger generations who turn out every year  to mark the occasion. Most have been barred from traveling to the  windswept coasts of Normandy. Some 160,000 soldiers made the perilous crossing from England that  day in atrocious conditions, storming dunes which they knew were heavily  defended by German troops determined to hold their positions. Somehow, they succeeded. Yet they left a trail of thousands of casualties who have been mourned for generations since. Last year stood out, with U.S. President Donald Trump joining his  French counterpart Emmanuel Macron at the American cemetery in  Colleville-sur-Mer, on a bluff overlooking Omaha Beach. A smattering of  veterans were honored with the highest accolades. All across the beaches  of Normandy tens of thousands came from across the globe to pay their  respects to the dead and laud the surviving soldiers. The acrid smell of wartime-era jeep exhaust fumes and the rumble of  old tanks filled the air as parades of vintages vehicles went from  village to village. The tiny roads between the dunes, hedges and apple  orchards were clogged for hours, if not days. Heading into the D-Day remembrance weekend this year, only the salty  brine coming off the ocean on Omaha Beach hits the nostrils, the shrieks  of seagulls pierce the ears and a sense of desolation hangs across the  region’s country roads. “Last year this place was full with jeeps, trucks, people dressed up  as soldiers,” said Eric Angely, who sat on a seawall, dressed in a World  War II uniform after taking his restored U.S. Army jeep out for a ride. “This year, there is nothing. It’s just me now, my dog and my jeep,” the local Frenchman said. Three quarters of a century and the horrific wartime slaughter of  D-Day help put things in perspective. Someday the COVID-19 pandemic,  too, will pass, and people will turn out to remember both events that  shook the world. “We don’t have a short memory around here,” Pottier said with a wistful smile. ___ Virginia Mayo contributed.

SYDNEY (AP) — An Australian court sided with police in ruling Friday  that a Black Lives Matter protest planned for Sydney poses too much risk  for spreading the coronavirus and cannot be held. Thousands of people were expected to rally in Australia’s largest  city on Saturday afternoon to honor George Floyd and to protest against  the deaths of indigenous Australians in custody. But New South Wales state Supreme Court Justice Des Fagan ruled the  rally was not an authorized public assembly. Fagan said he understood  the rally was designed to coincide with similar events in other  countries. TOP STORIES

                               “I don’t diminish the importance of the issues and no one would deny  them in normal circumstances,” he said. “No one denies them that but  we’re talking about a situation of a health crisis.” In Sydney, outdoor gatherings are restricted to 10 people, while up  to 50 people can go to funerals, places of worship, restaurants, pubs  and cafes. State Premier Gladys Berejiklian said organizers initially proposed a  protest far smaller rally. She said protesters could not guarantee  social distancing protocols would be followed. “All of us have given up so much and worked so hard to make sure we get on top of the virus,” Berejiklian told reporters. Earlier Friday, demonstrators in the capital reminded the country that racial inequality is not a U.S. issue alone. Organizers of the Canberra rally that attracted about 2,000  demonstrators handed out masks and hand sanitizer. Most protesters kept a  recommended social distance but drew closer to hear speeches. Public  gatherings are limited to 20 in Canberra, but police did not intervene. School teacher Wendy Brookman, a member of the Butchulla indigenous  people, said Australia should not accept that more than 430 indigenous  Australians have died in police custody or prison in the past three  decades. “We’re not here to jump on the bandwagon of what’s happened in the  United States,” Brookman said. “We’re here to voice what’s happening to  our indigenous people.” One of the protesters’ signs read “I can’t breathe” and drew a  parallel between Floyd’s death in the U.S. on May 25 and the Australian  indigenous experience. Those words were among the last spoken by Floyd  and an indigenous Australian, David Dungay, who died in a prison  hospital in 2015 while being restrained by five guards. In South Korea, dozens gathered in front of the U.S. Embassy to  condemn what they described as police brutality toward protesters in the  U.S. They called for South Korea’s government to speak against the  “racial discrimination and state violence” of its ally and pushed for an  anti-discrimination law to improve the lives of migrant workers,  undocumented foreigners and other minorities. “As the U.S. civil society empowered and stood in solidarity with  Korean pro-democracy activists in the past, we will now stand in  solidarity with citizens in the United States,” said activist Lee  Sang-hyun, referring to South Koreans’ bloody struggles against military  dictatorships that ruled the country until the late 1980s. Holding a banner that read “Justice for Floyd,” most of the  protesters wore black and some brought flowers in honor of Floyd, who  died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his neck with a  knee for several minutes while he pleaded for air. Larger marches are planned in Seoul on Saturday to protest Floyd’s death.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Ten long weeks after a massive coronavirus outbreak  sidelined one of the Navy’s signature warships, the USS Theodore  Roosevelt has returned to sea and is conducting military operations in  the Pacific region. Lining the flight deck in their dress white uniforms, sailors wearing  white face masks stood a virus-safe 10 feet (3 meters) apart in a  final, formal thank you as the ship sailed out of port in Guam on  Thursday and headed into the Philippine Sea. “We manned the rail, which we don’t normally do. There was a lot of  symbolism in that,” Navy Capt. Carlos Sardiello told The Associated  Press in an interview from the ship Thursday. “They’re excited. They’re  fired up to be back at sea doing the mission.” TOP STORIES

                               The Roosevelt pulled into Guam on March 27, with a rapidly escalating  number of sailors testing positive for the virus. Over time, more than  1,000 were infected with COVID-19, setting off a lengthy and systematic  process to move about 4,000 sailors ashore for quarantine and treatment,  while about 800 remained aboard to protect and run the high-tech  systems, including the nuclear reactors that run the vessel. Slowly, sailors were methodically brought back on board, while the  others who had remained went ashore for their mandated two-week  quarantine. And in late March, the ship with only about 3,000 crew  aboard went out to sea for roughly two weeks of training, including the  recertification of the flight deck and fighter squadron, such as  takeoffs and landings on the carrier. Earlier this week, the Roosevelt wrapped up training and returned to  Guam to pick up nearly 1,000 sailors who had been left there to either  complete their quarantine or to manage and work with those still on the  island. As the ship sailed into the port, it was flying a flag with the  words “Don’t Give Up the Ship,” a famous Navy battle cry from the War of  1812. “Our sailors didn’t give up the ship. They fought and got it back. So  I thought it was appropriate,” said Sardiello, who asked one of the  other Navy ships to borrow their flag. “The ship was clean and the ship  was healthy with no COVID cases. So I said, OK, we’re going to fly that  one time on the way into Guam as a symbol to bolster their morale.” RS1 Katie VanDrimmelen was one of the sailors left ashore during the  two-week training. She had tested positive for the virus and was in  quarantine for about five weeks. Walking back onto the ship, she said,  was like being welcomed home from a deployment. “It was amazing,” said VanDrimmelen, of Ogden, Utah. “It was very  comforting to be back in our normal atmosphere. Everybody was happy.” Sardiello said that watching the sailors board the ship was a great  feeling, But he knows he’s not done yet. There are still about 350  sailors on Guam who are either in isolation or are there as support  staff. “More and more of those sailors are meeting the return-to-work  criteria, and we’re flying them on board every single day. So we’re  whittling down that number day by day,” said Sardiello. “But I really  want those 350 remaining back. And we’re working hard on that.” He said that any sailors who don’t recover in time will be  transported back to the U.S. The ship is expected to continue operations  in the Pacific, and then would likely head home to San Diego later this  summer. The Roosevelt has been at the center of a still unresolved  controversy that led to the firing of the ship’s previous captain, the  resignation of the Navy secretary and an expanded investigation into  what triggered the outbreak and how well top naval commanders handled  it. Sardiello, had previously captained the Roosevelt but was abruptly  sent back to the ship in early April to take command after Capt. Brett  Crozier was fired for urging his commanders to take faster action to  stem the virus outbreak onboard. After a preliminary review last month, Adm. Mike Gilday, the Navy’s  top officer, recommended that Crozier be reinstated as ship captain. But  the Navy decided to conduct the broader investigation. That review, which effectively delays a decision on Crozier’s  reinstatement, was finished and submitted to Gilday at the end of March  and he is still reviewing the extensive report, which includes several  hundred pages of interviews, documents and recommendations. Cmdr. Nate Christensen, spokesman for Gilday, said is will take time  for the admiral to finish his review and make any decisions.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: These days, the term “public education” seems to mean a little bit of this and a little bit of that, as if teaching and learning are the ingredients of a secret recipe. Education is no secret. What happens outside and inside schools, however, is multilayered systematic chaos. So-called education is dispensed by “educators” who are not necessarily teachers. Once one of the noblest of professions, teaching has become a complex grid of red tape controlled by federal bureaucrats safely embedded in Washington; governors, mayors and county executives who tether their policies to get-out-the-vote agendas; and unionists who knew our schools were closing before we did and didn’t prepare themselves, us or students. TOP STORIES

                               Yet they all pull, push, tug and demand at the same time. As a result, when COVID-19 struck, elected officials simultaneously channeled defiant Alabama Democrats George Wallace and Bull Connor and blocked schoolhouse doors. Students’ GPAs tanked, and grades, and ceremonies traditionally held at the end of the school year were canceled. Teachers didn’t even receive their shiny, red apples. Tsk, tsk, tsk. As we emerge from the darkness of the coronavirus, let’s look forward to the ringing of school bells in a different way. Politicians and unions are mostly focusing on what school facilities should look like when faculty and students return, mostly proposing the same health and safety mandates that have been followed since the COVID-19 lockdown. Fine. Let’s call it back to basics. Just as we need to disinfect classrooms, restrooms and eating areas, we need to disinfect teaching. Consider the academic mindset that all children must attend college. After that was embedded into the curriculum of public education, we should have asked what happens to home economics, industrial arts and physical education? Children are still taught the three Rs, but sewing was kicked to the curb. Perhaps too domesticated post-women’s movement? Ironically, one of the first stores recently looted in D.C. was pricey Moncler, which sells kids’ winter wear costing several hundred dollars and adults several thousands. Children and adults would know how to design and sew their own, if learning were an educational priority or even an option. Ditto the basics of industrial arts. The lack of basic, hands-on training in the industrial arts means school janitors and custodians can easily grasp the art of sweeping and mopping floors, and collecting and dumping trash. But what about welding and wood carving to build a jungle gym in the backyard? Do teachers teach the mechanics of plumbing and pipefitting? Basic instruction on the difference between a cubic and linear foot would allow phys ed and math teachers to piggyback lesson plans. Basic teaching piques the curiosity of children who want to move into STEM programs. Children learn and love to get their hands dirty when they’re young, and because of COVID-19 we’re reinforcing how important the basic lesson of hand washing: Do it and do it often. Our schools should teach and show how sometimes somebody’s got their hands dirty, and our schools can teach U.S. history along the way — the men, women and children who built America got dirty along the way, building infrastructure and tending to agriculture. But, hey, even our Founders’ hands were soiled by ink. • Deborah Simmons can be contacted at [email protected] Manage Newsletters Copyright © 2020 The Washington Times, LLC.

Roughly 80% of recipients of expanded federal unemployment insurance would get more money from the benefits than they could expect to earn from a job if the emergency program is extended another six months, Congress’ official budget scorekeeper said Thursday. In the second half of 2020, the U.S. economy would probably do better but employment would be lower if the benefits were to be extended through January, the Congressional Budget Office also found. In 2021, though, both economic output and employment would be lower if the benefits are extended, CBO projected. TOP STORIES

                               Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley, whose staff requested the analysis, said Democrats’ approach to the issue would “encourage unemployment, government dependence and reduced productivity.” “As we begin to safely reopen our economy, it should be the goal of Congress to get America back to work, while helping those who can’t in a more targeted and efficient way,” said Mr. Grassley, Iowa Republican. In March, Congress approved an additional $600-per-week in federal unemployment benefits on top of regular state benefits as part of an emergency $2.2 trillion package in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Republicans had raised concerns that the benefits, which are due to expire at the end of July, were structured in such a way that disincentivized work. The Democrat-led House included an extension of the benefits through January in a separate $3 trillion-plus bill the chamber passed last month. Rep. James Comer, Kentucky Republican, led a letter Thursday urging congressional leaders to allow the benefits to expire at the end of July. “The supplemental UI was intended to be a lifeline for those whose employer was unable to retain them, not set individuals on a path to continued reliance on government assistance,” Mr. Comer and more than 60 of his Republican colleagues said. With millions of Americans still out of work, some lawmakers have talked up the idea of a “return to work” bonus or a less lucrative extension as possible elements of the next comprehensive rescue package. If the program is extended through January, roughly five in six people receiving the benefits starting in August would get more money from unemployment than they could expect to earn from work during those six months, CBO said. Analysts also found that if the benefits were extended, U.S. economic output would probably be greater in the second half of 2020 as demand for goods and services picked up, even though employment would be lower than it would have been without the extension. But in 2021, both economic output and employment would be lower if the benefits continued because a reduced labor supply would last longer than the bolstered demand, CBO said. The Labor Department reported Thursday that another 1.9 million Americans filed for unemployment last week, with the total number of claims since the pandemic took hold in March now above 40 million.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director said Thursday he’s “very concerned” that his agency’s public health message isn’t resonating, citing uneven use of face coverings and lax compliance with social distancing at parties or other major events. Robert Redfield said people near his home in Baltimore tend to wear masks but he hardly sees anyone in Washington wearing them. He also said he shared Democratic lawmakers’ concerns about photos of people gathered at the Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri or the SpaceX launch in Florida without maintaining physical distancing.

                               “We’re very concerned that our public health message isn’t resonating. We continue to try to figure out how to penetrate the message with different groups,” he told House lawmakers tracking the pandemic response. “We will continue to try to message as well we can.” “These social distancing strategies that we’ve learned are something we’re going to need to perfect,” Dr. Redfield said. “Because we’re going to need them to be our major defense again in October, November, December.” As it stands, there is no vaccine for the coronavirus or widespread public immunity to the newly discovered disease. Experts say the dual threat of a second coronavirus wave and a bad flu season could be difficult to manage. Dr. Redfield said only 47% of the Americans avail themselves of the flu shot under ordinary circumstances, so everyone needs to do their part before a COVID-19 antidote is available. “This single act will save lives,” he told the subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee. “We’re really hoping the American public will see that the flu vaccine is one major way they can help this nation get through this fall.” The coronavirus discovered in Wuhan, China, last December has spread across the globe and infected 1.8 million people in the U.S., and killed over 107,000. Transmission is plateauing after months of drastic measures, including stay-at-home orders, business closures and physical distancing. The summer weather may slow transmission, though a fall resurgence is a major fear. States also fear flare-ups as businesses reopen and people gather in mass protests against police brutality. Rep. Mark Pocan, Wisconsin Democrat, said he is worried that chemical riot-control agents will cause coughing and potential disease transmission at the protests. Dr. Redfield said he would raise his concern at the next White House coronavirus task force meeting. “I think you raised an important point,” Dr. Redfield said. “We have advocated strongly the ability to have face coverings and masks available to protesters.” He also said marchers ought to get tested to ensure they don’t spread the virus in the community if they become infected. “I do think there is a potential, unfortunately, for this to be a seeding event,” he said. Dr. Redfield urged appropriators on the coronavirus subcommittee to fund improvements to the nation’s public health infrastructure, especially its data-reporting systems. And he acknowledged well-documented hiccups in developing a COVID-19 test that local health departments could use, which included a delay in engaging the private sector. Public health departments had to send test samples to the CDC in the early weeks of the pandemic, and contamination problems delayed the CDC’s effort to develop a diagnostic that state departments could use on their own. “Within five weeks, it was corrected,” Dr. Redfield said, saying the development of a test within five to six weeks from acquiring the genetic sequence of the pathogen was “still an accomplishment.” “That six weeks was the six weeks we had to get ahead of this virus,” Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, Washington Republican, interjected. Democratic lawmakers also said they’re concerned the CDC has dropped out of view amid the pandemic despite its expertise. Subcommittee Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro noted the CDC stopped doing media calls in March and that states tried to reopen before the CDC released detailed guidance on how to do it safely. “I am alarmed that this administration has sidelined the CDC in our response to the pandemic and chosen political expediency over public health,” said Ms. DeLauro, Connecticut Democrat. “As a result, the U.S. has had the worst response to the coronavirus of any country in the world.” Rep. Tom Cole, Oklahoma Republican, objected to the chairwoman’s suggestion the U.S. fared worse than other countries, citing European countries with sophisticated health systems that saw higher per-capita death rates. “In this case, we may not be the best but we’re not the worst,” Mr. Cole said. Ms. DeLauro said other countries, including Germany and South Korea, found ways to keep their populations relatively safe. “There is no national coordinated strategy,” she added. “It appears as if the United States is just admitting defeat.”

A serious multisystem inflammatory syndrome that might be linked to the new coronavirus appeared to affect an “unusually high proportion” of children of African ancestry, according to a small study from a Paris hospital. Out of 21 children and adolescents who were admitted to the hospital with the inflammatory syndrome, 12 patients (57%) were of African ancestry, says the study, published Wednesday in the BMJ. The patients ranged from 3 to 16 years of age, with an average age of 7 years. The disease has similar symptoms of toxic shock syndrome and Kawasaki disease, a rare illness of unknown origin that causes blood vessels to become inflamed. It can cause persistent fever, abdominal symptoms, rash and cardiovascular symptoms, as well as heart-related or blood vessel-related shock requiring intensive care.

                               Health experts have said that the inflammatory syndrome could be an “antibody mediated or delayed response” to COVID-19 that shows up several weeks after infection, the Science Daily reported. Cases of the pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome have also been seen in Italy, the United Kingdom and the U.S. All 21 patients in the study had noticeable gastrointestinal symptoms in the early stages of illness and “high levels of inflammatory markers,” the researchers noted. Twelve patients (57%) exhibited symptoms of Kawasaki disease shock syndrome, and 16 (76%) of them experienced heart inflammation. Seventeen (81%) of the patients required intensive care support. Nineteen children and adolescents (90%) in the study had evidence of a recent SARS-CoV-2 infection, the coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 disease. All of the patients were discharged home after an average of eight days spent at the hospital.

Nancy Messonnier, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official who caught the White House off guard by warning of major disruptions from COVID-19 in February, is an “outstanding leader” and remains a key figure in the government’s response to the virus, the nation’s top disease-fighter said Thursday. “She has not been sidelined,” CDC Director Robert Redfield told a House Appropriations Committee panel monitoring the response to the pandemic. Dr. Messonnier rose to prominence by warning Americans on Feb. 25 that COVID-19 could become a major problem in the U.S. and that families should gird for changes to their work life, child care arrangements and other parts of everyday life.

                               “We are asking the American public to work with us to prepare in the expectation that this could be bad,” she told reporters at the time. Her warning exacerbated a selloff on Wall Street and reportedly irked President Trump, who was returning to the U.S. from a brief trip to India. Upon returning, the president held a White House briefing in which he suggested the 15 known cases in the U.S. could be knocked back down to zero. The CDC stopped doing media calls in early March, as the White House held its own briefings, meaning the public no longer heard from Dr. Messonnier. Yet her warning seemed prescient by mid-March, as states issued stay-at-home orders and the administration called on Americans to work and learn at home and avoid large gatherings. State economies are beginning to reopen, though over 100,000 Americans have died from the virus. Asked if Dr. Messonnier’s initial warning was correct, Dr. Redfield on Thursday said, “Yes.” “Dr. Messonnier remains one of our outstanding leaders,” he said. “She is a great scientific ally of mine and other leaders.” He said Dr. Messonnier is the agency’s project-leader on Operation Warp Speed, the administration’s effort to land a vaccine to COVID-19 in record time.

The D.C. Department of Health said Thursday there was a new peak in the community spread of the coronavirus during phase one of the District’s reopening. The new peak in cases occurred May 30, and the District now is at a total of three days of sustained decrease in community spread. “Due to a backlog of lab results being reported after Memorial Day, and as new cases are identified through contact tracing, the number of cases attributed to a specific symptom onset date will be impacted,” the Health Department said. “This may result in a new peak, and a resetting of Day 0 in the upcoming days.” TOP STORIES

                               The department is relying on a community spread metric, which is determined by date of symptom onset, instead of when people were tested for coronavirus. The District entered phase one on May 29. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has yet to detail what criteria will determine entering phase two, including the significance of returning to Day 0 in the count of community spread.

Emergency department visits dropped by 42% from late March through April, the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, while the number of infectious disease-related visits increased fourfold during the same time frame, said a new federal report published Wednesday. There was an average of 1.2 million ER visits from March 29 to April 25 compared to 2.1 million visits per week from March 31 to April 27 of last year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The largest decreases in visits were among children 14 years and younger, women and people in the Northeast region. Visits for abdominal pain and other digestive issues, musculoskeletal pain, hypertension, chest pain, nausea, vomiting and other specified upper respiratory infections saw the biggest declines. There were also fewer visits for heart attacks (also called acute myocardial infarction). TOP STORIES

                               “Health messages that reinforce the importance of immediately seeking care for symptoms of serious conditions, such as myocardial infarction, are needed,” the study said. “The striking decline in ED (emergency department) visits nationwide, with the highest declines in regions where the pandemic was most severe in April 2020, suggests that the pandemic has altered the use of the ED by the public,” the report said. “Persons who use the ED as a safety net because they lack access to primary care and telemedicine might be disproportionately affected if they avoid seeking care because of concerns about the infection risk in the ED,” the researchers wrote. “To minimize SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, transmission risk and address public concerns about visiting the ED during the pandemic, CDC recommends continued use of virtual visits and triage help lines and adherence to CDC infection control guidance.” The CDC used data from the National Syndromic Surveillance Program, a network that collects electronic health data in real-time, from hospitals in 47 states or about 73% of emergency department visits in the U.S. to study trends. There were increases in ER visits for infectious disease exposure and screening, COVID-19, pneumonia not caused by tuberculosis, respiratory failure or insufficiency, other specified and unspecified lower respiratory disease, cardiac arrest and heart rhythm problems.

The editors of The Lancet, a London-based journal renowned for accurate medical research, are disclosing   “serious scientific questions” about a paper they published May 22 knocking the use of the Trump-endorsed hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19. The now-disputed research paper relied on the examination of hospital files for nearly 100,000  patients to conclude that the drug, in combination an antibiotic, is ineffective and can cause heart problems. More than 14,000 patients were given the drug, with or without, an antibiotic in 671 hospitals on six continents from December to April. Over 100 scientists quickly challenged the study’s methods, writing to The Lancet that in some cases medical records did not match the actual patient.

                               President Trump has championed hydroxychloroquine, bringing with it intense criticism from the liberal media — and a Fox News anchor — who painted the anti-malaria drug as dangerous. Mr. Trump disclosed he took a regimen of the drug as a preventative for the new coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 disease. A number of U.S. physicians have come forward to say they have seen success in the prescribing hydroxychloroquine to COVID patients. Backers say hydroxychloroquine has been used safely for 60 years to prevent and treat malaria by blocking parasites from invading red blood cells. Its anti-inflammatory properties have been proven effective in treating Lupus and some skin diseases. The Food and Drug Administration is one of many agencies and institutes conducting clinical trials. The May 22 Lancet article contained  this conclusion: “We were unable to confirm a benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, when used alone or with a macrolide, on in-hospital outcomes for COVID-19. Each of these drug regimens was associated with decreased in-hospital survival and an increased frequency of ventricular arrhythmias when used for treatment of COVID-19.” The report gained widespread news media coverage. Often missed was the study’s warning: “A cause-and-effect relationship between drug therapy and survival should not be inferred. These data do not apply to the use of any treatment regimen used in the ambulatory, out-of-hospital setting. Randomized clinical trials will be required before any conclusion can be reached regarding benefit or harm of these agents in COVID-19 patients.” The Lancet editor’s backtrack posted on Wednesday said that “important scientific questions have been raised about data in the paper. … We are issuing an Expression of Concern to alert readers to the fact that serious scientific questions have been brought to our attention. We will update this notice as soon as we have further information.” The article carried the bylines of four scientists at medical centers in the U.S. Data was analyzed by the firm  Surgisphere in Chicago. A French clinic in southern France has conducted trials that show hydroxychloroquine is effective in treating COVID-19.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Nearly 1.9 million people applied for U.S. unemployment benefits last week, evidence that many employers are still cutting jobs even as the gradual reopening of businesses has slowed the pace of layoffs. The total number of people who are receiving jobless aid rose slightly to 21.5 million, down from a peak of nearly 25 million two weeks ago but still at a historically high level. It shows that scattered rehiring is offsetting only some of the ongoing layoffs with the economy mired in a recession. Thursday’s latest weekly number from the Labor Department is still more than double the record high that prevailed before the viral outbreak. Still, the number of people who applied for benefits last week marked the ninth straight decline since applications spiked in mid-March. The job market meltdown that was triggered by the coronavirus may have bottomed out as more companies call at least some of their former employees back to work.

The total number of people receiving aid fell in 37 states and in D.C. and increased in 13 states. Applications for jobless benefits are falling in states that had reopened their businesses early, such as Georgia and Texas, and are also declining in those that are still early in the reopening process, such as New York and Massachusetts. With all states in the process of gradually reopening for business, more consumers are starting to return to restaurants, stores and hair salons. That trend has boosted consumer spending from exceedingly low levels and has likely encouraged some companies to hire again. In addition to the laid-off employees who applied for benefits last week, 623,000 others sought jobless aid under a new program for self-employed and gig workers, who now qualify for unemployment benefits for the first time. These figures aren’t adjusted for seasonal variations, so the government doesn’t include them in the overall data. The figures come one day before the government’s jobs report for May is expected to show that employers slashed 8 million jobs last month and that the unemployment rate jumped from 14.7% to 19.8%. If those forecasts prove accurate, it would mean that nearly 30 million people have lost jobs since the viral outbreak intensified in March and that joblessness has reached its highest point since the Great Depression. Since mid-March, 42.7 million people have applied for unemployment benefits. Not all of them are still unemployed, though. Some have since been rehired. And some laid-off people, it turns out, filed duplicate applications for benefits as they struggled with unresponsive state unemployment systems. Thursday’s report wasn’t affected by the protests over the killing of George Floyd, which in recent days forced some major retailers and small businesses to close, because it covers claims filed only through May 30. But some economists warn that applications for unemployment aid could rise in next week’s report, reflecting business closures amid the protests and scattered vandalism. “That’s going to kick up the claims again,” said Jane Oates, a former Labor Department official. The depth of the job cuts since the virus forced the widespread shutdown of businesses reflects an economy gripped by the worst downturn since the Great Depression. The economy is thought to be shrinking in the April-June quarter at an annual rate approaching 40%. That would be, by far, the worst quarterly contraction on record. Still, real-time private data on consumer behavior is showing signs that the economy is gradually reviving. Credit and debit card spending tracked by Chase Bank shows that consumer spending, though roughly flat last week, rebounded from its low point in mid-April, when it was 40% below year-ago levels. Now, it is down 20% from a year ago. Economists caution that most Americans will need to feel more confident about returning to their former habits of shopping, traveling and eating out before the economy can sustain any meaningful recovery. That will likely require the availability of a vaccine or a significant increase in testing. “What’s really going to move the needle economically is when consumers and businesses feel comfortable re-engaging with the economy the way they did before COVID-19,” said Adam Kamins, a senior regional economist at Moody’s Analytics. Some businesses that have reopened have seen only a limited number of customers so far. In Chattanooga, Tennessee, Nneka Ijeoma lost her job as a bartender at a whiskey bar when it closed in March. Though the bar has reopened, it has rehired only two of its 17 employees. In the meantime, Ijeoma is receiving $275 in state unemployment benefits each week, plus $600 a week in federal benefits “We were honestly so blessed by that,” she said of the federal aid, which will expire at the end of July. “I wouldn’t have been able to get by on $275.” Still, she is eager to return to work and to go back to school in the fall to finish her college degree. Yet she always regarded bartending as a long-term opportunity. “I always thought I could work in hospitality forever,” she said. “I thought it was recession-proof.”

A now-famous Michigan barber is taking his case to cut hair during the coronavirus pandemic to the state Supreme Court, as the Justice Department weighs in on the side of other businesses suing against the strict COVID-19 lockdowns there. Small businesses and Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer have been at odds for weeks over some of the most severe economic restrictions any state has imposed since the coronavirus pandemic swept across the U.S. this winter. She began relaxing those restrictions this week. TOP STORIES

                               The clashes led to peaceful protests in Lansing, one of which, Operation Haircut last week, featured 77-year-old barber Karl Manke clipping hair at the top of the state capitol’s steps. Mr. Manke wielded his scissors at his Owosso barber shop Tuesday despite rulings against his operation by a state appeals court and an administrative law judge, according to his attorney. But both orders should be stayed as Mr. Manke appeals both legal matters, one civil and one administrative, his attorney, David Kallman, said. “As an attorney, I have advised Karl that he needs to abide by the court’s decision, but if he elects to go ahead and cut hair while following proper sanitary and social distancing rules, then I’m going to defend him,” Mr. Kallman said. On May 29, the Justice Department said it would support seven companies that filed a federal lawsuit against Ms. Whitmer. The companies argue the restrictions had “significantly impaired in some instances their ability to maintain their economic livelihoods.” The department’s statement of concern in the case comes after Attorney General William Barr on April 27 asked federal prosecutors “to review state and local policies to ensure that civil liberties are protected during the COVID-19 pandemic.” The businesses are a real estate brokerage, a landscaping company, an automotive glass exporter, an engine oil and auto parts distributor, a jewelry store, a dentist, and a chain of car washes. The owners say that while some similar enterprises have been allowed to stay open, they have not. On May 22, Ms. Whitmer extended Michigan’s closures until June 12, although she has begun allowing some economic activity to return in parts of the state. She took that step one day after a state judge tossed a lawsuit from the Republican legislative majority that accused her of assuming excessive powers under the state’s Emergency Management Act. Ms. Whitmer has “issued over 100 executive orders that impose sweeping limitations on nearly all aspects of life for citizens of Michigan, significantly impairing in some instances their ability to maintain their economic livelihoods,” the Justice Department said in announcing its support. Several federal prosecutors called Ms. Whitmer’s slew of executive orders arbitrary and thus infringing on clear constitutional protections. “I have no doubt about the governor’s good intentions, but the executive orders arbitrarily discriminate by allowing some businesses to operate while similar businesses must close or limit their operations,” said Matthew Schneider, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan who oversees Mr. Barr’s April initiative. “Under the governor’s orders it’s OK to go to a hardware store and buy a jacket, but it’s a crime to go inside a clothing store and buy the identical jacket without making an appointment,” Mr. Schneider said. “That’s arbitrary.” Mr. Manke is cutting hair by appointment and consequently his barber shop is avoiding long lines and any violations of social distancing requirements, Mr. Kallman said. Nevertheless, shortly before the close of business Tuesday, a contempt motion was filed against Mr. Manke by the Michigan attorney general, Mr. Kallman said. A county judge has scheduled a hearing on that motion for June 11.

An autopsy released Wednesday showed that George Floyd, the black man killed by a white Minneapolis police officer, had the coronavirus. NBC News reported that the Hennepin County Medical Examiner said Mr. Floyd, whose death has sparked worldwide protests, tested positive for the virus on April 3. The medical report by Chief Medical Examiner Andrew Baker said Mr. Floyd seemed to have been asymptomatic — as many people who catch the virus are — and that his lungs appeared healthy.

                               An earlier, preliminary autopsy report from the county said Mr. Floyd died from “cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.” Mr. Floyd died saying “I can’t breathe” as a policeman kneeled on his neck for almost nine minutes. The full report Wednesday said Mr. Floyd had other “significant” conditions, including hypertension-related heart disease, fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use. However, these were not listed under the cause of death.

A June rally roared on Wall Street on Wednesday as private employers reported that job losses stabilized in May, raising hopes among investors and in Washington that the recovery from the coronavirus shutdown could be faster and stronger than predicted. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 527 points, or 2%, to close at 26,269. That was more than 8,000 points above the index’s low point in March, when the COVID-19 pandemic was forcing businesses to close and throwing more than 40 million Americans out of work. The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.7%, closing less than 1% below its record high on Feb. 19. The index has climbed more than 42% since its low point on March 23.

                               Investors were buoyed by optimism about states reopening from the shutdown and by a report from the payroll firm ADP estimating that U.S. private-sector jobs fell by about 2.8 million from April to May. That was significantly better than projections of about 9 million and well below the previous month’s record number of nearly 20 million. President Trump pointed to the “booming” stock market rally as more proof that the economy will bounce back significantly before Election Day in November. “I built this great economy, and I’m building it again,” Mr. Trump told Fox News radio host Brian Kilmeade. “By the time of the election, I believe the economy will be doing phenomenal numbers. Big job increases, big GDP increases, and that’ll be before the election.” The transportation sector, which stands to benefit more than most others from the economy’s reopening, led the rally. Shares of American, Delta and United airlines all gained at least 5.9%. White House senior adviser Kevin Hassett said the jobs report could mean the economy is recovering faster than expected after the coronavirus-related lockdowns. “This ADP report is a real positive sign, and it’s such a positive sign that I really have to grab my pencil and go back to my desk and see what’s going on. … It’s way lower than I expected, in a good way,” Mr. Hassett said on Fox Business. “We’re getting close to the bottom, for sure. The number is so good — it’s such good news — that I really have to dig deep into it and see if there’s not something funny going on.” More than 40 million unemployment claims have been filed since the pandemic took hold in March. Mr. Hassett said some projections have the gross domestic product contracting by 50% in the second quarter. “If you look at the states that have been opening up, then you can see that they are really getting back to normal quickly,” he said. “I do think that we’re going to see bottom. I was expecting June, but this ADP number does suggest that you’re very, very close to a turning point.” The Labor Department is due to release its unemployment figures for May on Friday morning. Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisers in Holland, Pennsylvania, cautioned that the May unemployment rate is likely to be about 20% and that some indicators point to more job losses this month. “I am not sure that will be the peak [of unemployment],” Mr. Naroff said in his report Wednesday. “We can open up the economy all we want, but if there is double-digit unemployment for an extended period, consumer spending levels will not be able to come close to where they had been. Will investors recognize that? Got me.” Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of economic activity. A report Wednesday from the Institute for Supply Management showed service providers began to emerge from the shutdown in May. Its non-manufacturing index rose 3.6 points, the most in more than two years, to 45.4, but the reading below 50 showed that most service-related industries were still contracting. ADP said the job losses in May hit small, medium and large businesses alike. “The impact of the COVID-19 crisis continues to weigh on businesses of all sizes,” Ahu Yildirmaz, co-head of the ADP Research Institute, said in a statement. “While the labor market is still reeling from the effects of the pandemic, job loss likely peaked in April, as many states have begun a phased reopening of businesses.” Conservative economist Stephen Moore, who advised the Trump campaign in 2016, said the stock market is engaging in “premature exuberance.” He said he is still predicting a “really bad summer” of business failures and a difficult job market. “I’m just not as bullish about the economy as the investment markets are,” he said, adding that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, isn’t likely to agree with Senate Republicans to “anything that helps the economy.” The House has approved a $3 trillion economic relief package, including expanded unemployment benefits and hundreds of billions of dollars in aid for states and cities. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, said last week that the Senate will consider another bill in about a month and it would be “narrowly crafted” compared with the House proposal. Mr. Moore said any compromise on the House bill “is bad for the economy.” He said the employment benefit program approved in March, with a $600 weekly federal payment on top of state benefits, is giving people too much incentive to stay home. “We’d be much better off just doing nothing,” Mr. Moore said. “The thing that needs to happen now is just go back to the old employment benefit program … and then the payroll tax cut. You do those two things, and you get some real juice in the economy. People really underestimate how much damage we’ve done to the economic infrastructure of the country, and I think it could take a long time to recover. I can’t see this [stock] market staying at this level.” White House advisers note that unemployment rates were at historic lows for all groups before the pandemic hit the U.S., with a national jobless rate of 3.5% in February. White House Domestic Policy Adviser Brooke Rollins said the U.S. was experiencing “unprecedented prosperity,” including the lowest jobless rates in a half century for blacks and Hispanics. “To get all of that back is really a priority,” she said this week in a forum hosted by Politico. She said the payroll tax cut is needed but the president isn’t necessarily opposed to another round of significant relief spending. “He is not in the typical Republican ‘box,’” she said. “He will do what he believes is right for the country. The long-term health of the country is at the top of the president’s mind.” Mr. Moore expects the unemployment rate to be around 10% by Election Day, but he said the president could benefit “if the direction is good.” He also sees two “silver linings” to the rioting that has roiled the nation for the past week that could help the president and hurt presumptive Democratic nominee Joseph R. Biden. “The lockdown lockdown is over now,” Mr. Moore said. “And No. 2 is, it’s increased Trump’s odds of getting reelected because the left has exposed how radical they are. That’s good for markets because the markets obviously want Trump over Biden.”

The COVID-19 pandemic is entering a complicated, hold-your-breath stage as states work to stamp out flare-ups and hope their hospitals can handle an anticipated rise in cases as their economies reopen and Americans socialize again. The New York City region that endured the worst of the pandemic is doing far better, though parts of California and Texas are reporting increases in cases. Hospitals in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area are filling with COVID-19 patients and are concerned about a spike in cases after protests over the death of George Floyd. Many of the protesters are young and less vulnerable to COVID-19, though marchers could catch the coronavirus while gathering and further spread it in minority communities that are already reeling from the pandemic, scientists say.

                               Newly confirmed cases are rising in more than a dozen states, sometimes because of increases in testing, and clusters of hot spots are erupting in rural areas with prison and meat-processing plants that are vulnerable to outbreaks. The U.S. is approaching 2 million confirmed infections and faces a complex struggle to hold down transmissions that increased with frightening speed earlier this year. “If I were to describe the pandemic in the United States overall now, it would be that there are low embers burning within the metropolitan areas and there are little sparking fires heading off all over the heartland,” said William Hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard University. “Numbers are hovering around steady, but we have to remember that is reflecting a decrease in the Northeast and a slow increase which is replacing that elsewhere.” Experts said they should be able to tell by the latter half of June whether efforts to reopen and mingle once again have resulted in a spate of new infections. “The metric that is most firm, even though it is delayed, is hospitalizations of people with lab-confirmed COVID-19,” said William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University. “If that starts to tick up, then we start to frown because it means there is, indeed, more transmission out there.” About 40,000 COVID-19 patients were in U.S. hospitals at the start of June, up from 34,000 in mid-May. Many states, especially in the Northeast, are reporting fewer hospitalizations, and more than a dozen have relatively steady numbers. A handful are showing upticks, however. Hospitalizations in Arizona surpassed 1,000 for the first time Monday, sparking debate about actions after lifting the state’s stay-at-home order in mid-May. “A state like Arizona is concerning. The scope of the rise and the velocity is concerning,” former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb told CNBC. “It’s going to be very hard, though, for a lot of these governors to go backward and start implementing mitigation again. “They’re probably going to tolerate a higher level of infection than we were willing to on the first go-round, and that just sets up more risk,” he said. Flare-ups in some states, he said, could “reseed” parts of the country with the coronavirus. Hospitals in Montgomery, Alabama, and in Minnesota also have been taxed recently with COVID-19 patients. “We are getting closer and closer to being overly full,” Caitlin Eccles-Radtke, an infectious disease physician at Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis, told MedPage Today. The national conversation has pivoted to protests after the death of Mr. Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Still, the coronavirus that dominated global headlines since the start of the year remains a challenge, infecting 1.8 million people and counting in the U.S. and killing more than 107,000. States are trying to make sure high-risk populations are tested. That includes prison inmates, meat processing workers and nursing home residents. The Trump administration recently announced data linking 26,000 deaths to nursing homes across the country. The pandemic also continues to have an outsized effect on minority populations. Federal data shows black Americans, who make up 13% of the population, account for 23% of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. and account for more than half of infections in multiple Southern states. Experts say the racial disparities are results of underlying health issues in minority populations, and frustrations with the U.S. response to COVID-19 are further fueling protests over racial injustice. Some parts of the country are reporting good news. New York, the hardest-hit state, reported fewer than 1,000 new cases on June 1, compared with about 4,000 on May 1 and 8,000 on April 1. Although the numbers in New York are still much higher than other parts of the country, the trend line is positive. “The tri-state region actually looks very good right now,” Dr. Gottlieb told CNBC. New York officials said buses and subway lines will have social-distancing decals and hand sanitizers in stations when the city begins to lift restrictions next week. In Pennsylvania, a large number of counties will move Friday to the “green phase,” which eases many restrictions and lets businesses move from 50% capacity under the yellow stage to 75%. Areas of southeastern Pennsylvania and Philadelphia will enter the yellow phase, in which some business may open but teleworking is mandated “where feasible.” “We continue to see around 500-700 cases a day, and these are among different populations, but long-term care facilities remain a concern that we are continuing to assist,” Pennsylvania Health Department spokesman Nate Wardle said. Scientists are worried that the coronavirus will strike in a “second wave” this fall after a potential lull in transmission because of hot and humid weather, yet it is starting to wreak havoc in Latin America as countries in the Southern Hemisphere enter winter. Disease trackers are looking backward to try to get a better sense of overall exposure to the coronavirus since the start of the outbreak. They are producing statistical averages based on serological testing that checks for antibodies. Exposure ranges widely, from an estimated 2% of the population in Boise, Idaho, to roughly 20% in New York City, based on figures compiled by the American Enterprise Institute. Elsewhere, antibody testing suggests roughly 17% of London’s population has been exposed, compared with 10% in Paris and Wuhan, China, about 6% in Miami and nearly 5% in Los Angeles. The virus was discovered in Wuhan in December and spread around the globe in the early months of this year, upending American life as President Trump urged people to work and learn at home and avoid large gatherings. Governors issued a patchwork of state-at-home orders that closed most businesses while allowing food and other essential services to continue. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said emergency department visits plummeted by 42% in the early pandemic period from late March to late April compared with similar dates in 2019 as people hunkered at home. The biggest declines were among children younger than 14, females and residents of the Northeast region, the CDC report said, suggesting the illness scared people away from seeking care. “The striking decline in ED visits nationwide, with the highest declines in regions where the pandemic was most severe in April 2020, suggests that the pandemic has altered the use of the ED by the public,” the agency said. The CDC said hospitals should maintain clear triage procedures to keep COVID-19 patients separate from other emergency room patients. Health care providers also should set up telephone lines to help people swiftly understand whether they need to report to the emergency room for injuries or other conditions, the agency said.

Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said Wednesday that the state will enter phase two of the reopening plan on Friday. “In the face of the most daunting challenge of our lifetime, the people of Maryland have been resilient, have never lost hope and they are showing what it truly means to be Maryland strong,” Mr. Hogan said Wednesday at a coronavirus briefing. The governor on Friday will lift his executive order requiring non-essential businesses to close. TOP STORIES

                               Under phase two, personal care businesses, like tattoo parlors and nail salons, can open at 50% capacity and strict safety protocols. Retail stores, technology firms, car dealerships, insurance agencies, travel agencies, real estate agencies, design studios and more will be able to reopen Friday. Starting Monday, state government offices will reopen with staff wearing face coverings and Plexiglass dividers at each station. Mr. Hogan said the next step of reopening will likely coincide with the end of the school year, when he will allow for the opening of outdoor amusement, fitness and sporting businesses. “Just because Marylanders can return to the office, doesn’t mean that they should,” he said, urging people to continue to telework.

A malaria drug President Donald Trump took to try to prevent COVID-19 proved ineffective for that in the first large, high-quality study to test it in health workers and others closely exposed to people with the disease. Results published Wednesday by the New England Journal of Medicine show that hydroxychloroquine was no better than placebo pills at preventing illness from the coronavirus. The drug did not seem to cause serious harm, though — about 40% on it had side effects, mostly mild stomach problems. “We were disappointed. We would have liked for this to work,” said the study leader, Dr. David Boulware, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Minnesota. “But our objective was to answer the question and to conduct a high-quality study,” because the evidence on the drug so far has been inconclusive, he said.

                               Hydroxychloroquine and a similar drug, chloroquine, have been the subject of much debate since Trump started promoting them in March. Hydroxychloroquine has long been used for malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, but no large studies have shown it or chloroquine to be safe or effective for much sicker patients with coronavirus, and some studies have suggested the drugs may do harm. Trump took a two-week course of hydroxychloroquine, along with zinc and Vitamin D, after two staffers tested positive for COVID-19, and had no ill effects, according to results of his latest physical released by his doctor Wednesday. Federal regulators have warned against their use except in hospitals and formal studies because of the risk of side effects, especially heart rhythm problems. Boulware’s study involved 821 people in the United States and Canada living with someone diagnosed with COVID-19 or at high risk of getting it because of their job — doctors, nurses, ambulance workers who had significant exposure to a sick patient while not wearing full protective gear. They were randomly assigned to get either placebo pills or hydroxychloroquine for five days, starting within four days of their exposure. Neither they nor their doctors knew who who was getting what. After 14 days in the study, 12% on the drug developed COVID-19 symptoms versus 14% in the placebo group, but the difference is so small it could have occurred by chance, Boulware said. “There’s basically no effect. It does not prevent infection,” he said of the drug. Even if it were to give some slim advantage, “we’d want a much larger effect” to justify its use and risk of side effects for preventing illness, he said. Results were no different among a subgroup of participants who were taking zinc or vitamin C, which some people believe might help make hydroxychloroquine more effective. “This fits with everything else we’ve seen so far which suggests that it’s not beneficial,” said Dr. Peter Bach, director of a health policy center at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. This study was in younger relatively healthy people, but the results “would make me very discouraged about trying to use this in older people” who are most vulnerable to serious illness from the coronavirus, Bach said. “If it does work, it doesn’t work very well.” Dr. Dan Culver, a lung specialist at the Cleveland Clinic, said there’s still a chance that giving the drug sooner than four days after someone’s exposure to the virus may help prevent illness. But the study “takes ‘home run’ off the table” as far as hopes for the drug, he said. The study was mostly funded by David Baszucki, founder of Roblox, a California-based game software company, and other private donors and the Minnesota university. Boulware also is leading a study testing hydroxychloroquine for treating COVID-19. The study is finished and results are being analyzed now. On Tuesday, the journal Lancet posted an “expression of concern” about a study it published earlier this month of nearly 15,000 COVID-19 patients on the malaria drugs that tied their use to a higher risk of dying in the hospital or developing a heartbeat problem. Scientists have raised serious questions about the database used for that study, and its authors have launched an independent audit. That work had a big impact: the World Health Organization suspended use of hydroxychloroquine in a study it is leading, and French officials stopped the drug’s use in hospitals. On Wednesday, the WHO said experts who reviewed safety information decided that its study could resume.

The metal detectors every sports fan has become accustomed to at the gate might soon be accompanied by thermal body scanners as part of the gargantuan task of preventing the spread of the new coronavirus and other airborne diseases. And that might be just one thing the public will need to be comfortable with in order to bring games back for in-person viewing. Tickets have widely transitioned from paper souvenirs to smartphone screens, but how about using your face as your proof of purchase Nascent forms of crowd monitoring - like laser-driven density detection and camera-based calculations of line length - will likely grow faster in a post-pandemic era of live sports that must highlight hygiene.

                               “The pandemic really ups the need for greater assurance of stadium safety,” said Bob Boland, an athletics official who teaches at Penn State and has more than two decades of experience in sports and law as an instructor, consultant and agent. “Vaccine treatments, containment, they all could be game-changers, but people will need to be comfortable with mass body temperature screening and other technology that could be in play.” Not unlike the aftermath from the 2001 terrorist attacks, when long waits to pass through magnetometers and have a security guard wave a wand over pants pockets became the norm. “After 9/11 we overdid it, meaning we were so intent on making every building be safe and everyone safe that we made it extremely inconvenient to go to games and events. But we said that it would get better over time, and it did,” said Marc Ganis, cofounder of the Chicago-based consulting firm SportsCorp. “Now how do you do that?” Technology will be a vital piece of the puzzle. It will also further test a fan’s willingness to potentially sacrifice a little more privacy in exchange for the opportunity to sit courtside or behind the plate again. “Can I say both?” said Jim Mueller, a Milwaukee Bucks season ticket holder who also buys partial packages to Milwaukee Brewers and Green Bay Packers games. “I understand it from the Bucks’ perspective and the NBA perspective, but as an American I don’t want to be traced.” Dave Karls has Bucks season tickets too, eager enough for his next visit to Fiserv Forum that having his location trackable in the arena would not interfere with the enjoyment. “I’d much rather have that than not be able to attend the game at all,” Karls said. Any concerns depend on an individual’s definition of surveillance, a word that carries a nefarious connotation in some corners. In some countries, the effort this year to stem the outbreak of COVID-19 with contact tracing has included citizen consent to location registration. Activity at a sporting event in the U.S. would likely only be collected in aggregate, like an elevated skin temperature flagged during a walk through a thermal scanner. That’s not a piece of data tied to someone’s actual identity that could run afoul of federal privacy laws. Perhaps QR codes will be used for patrons to self-report current health conditions. Carrying a smartphone and using it to shop already opens a user to some form of location tracking and direct marketing. Team-sponsored apps allowing fans to order burgers and beers directly to their seats and receive push notifications for merchandise already provide a framework for what could be next. “I think the stadiums could probably say, ‘Hey, we’ve got 50 people in the bathroom right now,’ in the aggregate because you already downloaded that app,” said Nerissa Coyle McGinn, a Chicago attorney with a practice in advertising, technology and privacy who has worked with sports teams including the Chicago Bulls, Detroit Red Wings and New York Giants. “You’ve agreed to their privacy policy, and sharing aggregate information isn’t considered sharing personal information.” The algorithms caused a bit of controversy at Alabama, where football coach Nick Saban’s frustration with students leaving blowout games early and a nationwide attendance decline prompted establishment of the “Tide Loyalty Points” program  that rewarded fans for their fourth quarter presence with prizes and priority purchasing for in-demand events. Bluetooth technology is used in that case for tracking; it’s only functional inside Bryant-Denny Stadium. “The more information you can give to somebody, the more likely they’re willing to consent to the question of this type of data,” said Nan Sato, a Philadelphia attorney with a focus on the intersection of technology and sports. “Who’s getting the data? How is it being stored and used, how long is the data going to be retained, and how the privacy of the fans is going to be protected?” Screening technology that scans a user’s eyes, face or fingerprint has multiplied in recent years, particularly in airports to speed up security lines. Two years ago, Major League Baseball struck a deal with a biometric identification system, Clear, to accelerate ballpark entry by body part - fingerprints, for now, but perhaps one day a fan’s face will serve as his or her ticket. “When you kind of pull back the layers, people aren’t fearful of the facial recognition technology itself. They’re fearful of what happens to that data after. It’s more a matter of transparency on our clients’ front: ’Hey, we’re not going to sell this data to a third party. It’s maintained in an encrypted way,” said Shaun Moore, a former SMU football player and the co-founder of Trueface, a software startup with customers in a variety of sectors including sports. “We never see any of the data. We don’t know who’s in the database. So that’s one way we keep privacy in mind when developing these tools. There needs to be transparency in how the data flows and who has access to it, how long it stays in the system. Is it 30 days? Is it two days? Where is it being used?”

D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser on Wednesday imposed the District’s fourth curfew amid nationwide protests and rioting over the death of George Floyd while in police custody in Minneapolis last week. Curfew will start at 11 p.m. Wednesday and end at 6 a.m. Thursday, Miss Bowser said at a press conference. The three previous curfews started at 7 p.m. “We have allowed peaceful protest every night, who we are concerned about is people who are not peaceful and destroying our city,” Miss Bowser said. “Our curfew is a tool for MPD [Metropolitan Police Department] to make sure that they can put their resources to finding those people and detaining those people.” TOP STORIES

                               Metropolitan Police Chief Peter Newsham said Tuesday evening’s peaceful protest persuaded officials to start the new curfew four hours later than previous ones. “The largest group of protesters we have seen to this point have been doing a little bit of self-policing,” Chief Newsham said, noting peaceful protesters chastising someone for trying to tear down a street sign. Chief Newsham said more than 5,000 people were protesting Tuesday evening in the District, which resulted in 19 arrests for curfew violations. Over the course of the protests, 19 people were arrested Saturday night, 92 on Sunday night, and 288 on Monday night. Of those arrested, 41% were from the District, 39% were from Maryland and Virginia, 1% were from other states and 9% had no fixed address. Chief Newsham said 63% arrests were for curfew violations, 11% for felony rioting and 11% for burglary.

It’s not OK to violate stay-at-home and social distancing orders if you’re protesting the economic shutdown from the coronavirus pandemic, but it’s fine to do so if you’re decrying “white supremacy,” according to some public health experts. An open letter signed by 1,288 “public health officials, infectious disease professionals, and community stakeholders” came out in support of the mass protests spurred by the death of George Floyd in police custody, refusing to denounce them as “risky” and calling them “vital to the national public health.” “Staying at home, social distancing, and public masking are effective at minimizing the spread of COVID-19,” said the June 1 letter. “To the extent possible, we support the application of these public health best practices during demonstrations that call attention to the pervasive lethal force of white supremacy.” TOP STORIES

                               The letter, spurred by infectious-disease specialists at the University of Washington, was signed by doctors and medical professionals from top universities such as Columbia, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, the University of Chicago and the University of Michigan, as well as community activists. “However, as public health advocates, we do not condemn these gatherings as risky for COVID-19 transmission,” the letter continued. “We support them as vital to the national public health and to the threatened health specifically of Black people in the United States.” They applied a different standard to those such as the “heavily armed and predominantly white protesters” who descended last month on the state capitol in Lansing, Michigan, to demonstrate against the stay-at-home orders. “This should not be confused with a permissive stance on all gatherings, particularly protests against stay-home orders,” the letter said. “Those actions not only oppose public health interventions, but are also rooted in white nationalism and run contrary to respect for Black lives.” In addition, “Protests against systemic racism, which fosters the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 on Black communities and also perpetuates police violence, must be supported.” Dozens of public health and disease experts have signed an open letter in support of the nationwide anti-racism protests.“White supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to COVID-19,” they wrote.https://t.co/EewPNgDSu3 The letter, with its apparent double-standard on a disease that does not discriminate between left- and right-wing protesters, drew a lengthy, outraged response on Twitter from Blaze managing editor Leon Wolf, who asked whether the entire pandemic shutdown had been a farce. Public health experts “didn’t really believe what they were saying all along. Because an infectious disease does not care about the reason you are gathering or how important it is. It has no social conscience, or conscience of any kind,” Mr. Wolf said. “Which leads me to believe they were doing it because of politics, or desire to control, or whatever.” That conclusion is that they didn’t really believe what they were saying all along. Because an infectious disease does not care about the reason you are gathering or how important it is. It has no social conscience, or conscience of any kind. 14/ Footage from the massive protests that have roiled U.S. cities shows that some of the tens of thousands of protesters are wearing masks, but many are ignoring social distancing rules, leading to fears that the demonstrations could trigger another COVID-19 outbreak. While most of the protesters appear to be peaceful, the demonstrations have been marred by violence, looting, fire-setting and mayhem by perpetrators who often wear masks, although that may be to avoid being identified by police. Even so, the letter urged local and state governments: “Do not disband protests under the guise of maintaining public health for COVID-19 restrictions.” At the same time, the signers said that authorities should anticipate “an increased number of infections in the days following a protest,” and increase access to testing and health care. The letter did not mention the assaults, property damage or destruction to communities, but focused on the public health danger from “white supremacy,” calling it “a lethal public health issue that contributes to and predates COVID-19.” “A public health response to these demonstrations is also warranted, but this message must be wholly different from the response to white protesters resisting stay-home orders,” the letter said. “Infectious disease and public health narratives adjacent to demonstrations against racism must be consciously anti-racist, and infectious disease experts must be clear and consistent in prioritizing an anti-racist message.”

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is facing backlash from the salon industry in the state after she suggested people start researching how to cut their own hair during the coronavirus pandemic. After violent protests swept the country for the sixth straight night over the police custody death of George Floyd, Ms. Whitmer stressed Monday that Michiganders needed to maintain proper social distancing to protect themselves and others from getting sick. “If you’re one of those people that’s going to Ohio [for a haircut], I hope and pray that  you are doing your part not to bring COVID-19 home,” she said. “If you haven’t  resorted to that, Google how to do a haircut, or throw your hair in a  ponytail or curl it and get through the next couple of weeks so we can  resume some of these things.” TOP STORIES

Members  of the Safe Salons for Michigan Coalition testified Tuesday before the Joint  Select Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic in Lansing, where they demanded that the governor apologize and lift the salon lockdown. Hair salons will still not be open, even though the stay-at-home order has been lifted. Governor Whitmer suggests people Google how to cut hair.

More than a third of people with lupus have struggled to fill their prescriptions of hydroxychloroquine, a drug largely touted by President Trump, during the coronavirus pandemic, a new survey found. Shortages of the drug in March and April occurred as media outlets and Mr. Trump reported possible benefits of hydroxychloroquine in treating or preventing COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. The survey, conducted by the Lupus Research Alliance, found that participants had been taking hydroxychloroquine for an average of 11.4 years and that 31% of respondents had issues getting refills. Respondents also reported not being able to take the full dose of the drug or splitting doses. Some said they were unable to get their prescriptions filled because the drugs were not in supply.

                               One patient said she was able to fill her prescription after three weeks of calling different pharmacies. Another said her physician advised her to halve her regular dose until the supply shortage passed. The survey included 334 people in the U.S. with lupus, a chronic autoimmune disease that affects millions worldwide. The survey collected responses from participants from 42 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, between March 1 and May 18. Last month, Mr. Trump claimed to be taking hydroxychloroquine briefly as a preventative measure. There are some clinical trials of the drug underway. On Wednesday, World Health Organization announced it would resume research of the anti-malarial drug in a global study of potential coronavirus treatments after temporarily halting it last week out of safety concerns. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has warned that hydroxychloroquine can cause serious heart rhythm problems for coronavirus patients. The agency advised the drug only be taken within a hospital setting or for a clinical trial. There is currently no approved treatment for COVID-19 although numerous trials of different drugs are in the works.

Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine on Wednesday said his state is unlikely to volunteer to host the Republican National Convention after President Trump said officials are looking for another state to hold the event. “I don’t know where we’ll be several months from now, but this would not be something that we think that we would volunteer to do,” Mr. DeWine said on “Fox & Friends.” “These mass gatherings are just a real problem, particularly those that are inside.” He said that while Ohio has flattened the curve on key metrics in the fight against the coronavirus, the virus “is still very much here.” TOP STORIES

                               “These mass gatherings are kind of the last things to come together and a mass gathering inside is frankly the thing that would scare us the most simply about the spread of the virus,” Mr. DeWine said. Other Republican state leaders such as Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said they’d be happy to host the late August event amid rising tensions between convention planners and North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat. Mr. Trump said late Tuesday that officials have been forced to seek another location because Mr. Cooper can’t guarantee the full use of an arena in Charlotte. Mr. Cooper has said a primary concern during the ongoing negotiations is looking out for public safety. Democrats have already postponed their convention in Milwaukee and are pondering ways to hold parts of it virtually. Mr. Trump had said in early April that there was no contingency plan in place for the Republican convention and that it would proceed as planned in late August.

Google tracked the locations of 300 million people and gave the data to a handful of scientists whom the company deemed worthy. But exactly who has the data, what data the scientists have and what they will do with it is a bit of a mystery. Google began handing over users’ data to the scientists before the coronavirus outbreak and has continued giving them special access during the pandemic. In May, the scientists published a paper revealing that the data was “aggregated from over 300 million smartphone users” and “cover nearly all countries and 65% of Earth’s populated surface.” The smartphone users were not aware they were being studied, according to the paper, which was published in Nature Human Behavior. In other scientific studies, participants are actively observed.

                               “We first apply machine learning to location data points to segment them into semantic ‘trips,’” the 11 scientists wrote. “The system automatically finds trips by taking into account a variety of signals, such as timing of location points, dwell times, and other factors. This, for example, includes stops at airports and other locations on a multi-stop international itinerary.” The scientists who have published on some of the data found that the U.S. and Mexico have “one of the busiest borders,” and the most restrictive borders are between Turkey and Armenia, Morocco and Algeria, and Israel and Gaza, according to the paper, which is accessible via ResearchGate. Weather and daylight patterns also affect physical movement, and the scientists said people are most active in July and August. “Peaks outside this period mostly coincide with national and/or religious holidays such as Easter, the Hajj, and Thanksgiving in the United States,” the scientists wrote. “Unsurprisingly the lowest frequency of movement is observed in January.” Otherwise, nobody besides the scientists and Google knows what else can be gleaned from the information. The scientists say the aggregated data is available to those who want access upon “reasonable request” by contacting the authors and filling out a request form that Google will approve or deny. Google said it provides data to research institutions, not governments, and enters into agreements with those using the data to block them from sharing it with others. “The mobility data set is based on aggregate, anonymized location data, and has been made available to a small set of academic researchers to help understand the spread of COVID-19,” a Google representative said in a statement. Google has allowed the public to see certain data in its “COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports,” which are compiled to help public health officials, doctors and others examine how to tailor social distancing policies during the COVID-19 pandemic. The mobility reports are searchable online by country and region. Rachel Bovard, senior adviser to the right-leaning Internet Accountability Project, said she has concerns about how Google handles users’ data. “Google has a troubling pattern of accumulating massive troves of personal data on individuals without any transparency regarding what they’re doing with it or with whom it is being shared,” Ms. Bovard said. “The company is a serial violator of user privacy and has largely been unaccountable for it. Congressional oversight isn’t just warranted; it is needed.” Arizona sued Google last week for allegedly using deceit and unfair business practices to get its users’ location data. Arizona’s complaint said people who disabled the location tracker still had their movements tracked and that Google confused users attempting to opt out of the location tracking. “While Google users are led to believe they can opt out of location tracking, the company exploits other avenues to invade personal privacy,” Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich said. “It’s nearly impossible to stop Google from tracking your movements without your knowledge or consent.” Some privacy experts are not fretting about Google’s data collection. Ryan Calo, a University of Washington law professor, said concerns could involve the fairness of access to the data and the terms involved in accessing it, but he thinks there is not much cause for concern. “I don’t see a lot of reason to worry. It is not as though Google is telling researchers where specific people are or have been,” Mr. Calo said in an email. “It looks like the data is aggregated and, as a researcher, I am in favor of access to industry data if the privacy harms can be mitigated.” Zach Graves, policy head at the Lincoln Network technology policy advocacy group, said he has not seen the data at issue but he favors making such information accessible to researchers. “I generally think it’s a good idea to allow broad public interest/research exemptions for use of this sort of data,” Mr. Graves said in an email. “Of course, it’s important they also adhere to industry best practices to remove personally identifiable information and limit the possibility of such information getting leaked.” Google also has collaborated with Apple on a contact-tracing project that uses a Bluetooth-based system on phones to monitor users’ potential exposure to coronavirus-infected people. The companies have said the technology does not collect location information and requires users to opt in to participate.

NEW YORK — New York City contact tracers hired to contain the spread of the coronavirus reached out to all of the roughly 600 people who tested positive for the virus citywide on Monday, the first day of the program, and succeeded in reaching more than half of them, officials said Tuesday. “On Day 1 of the program, seeking to reach several hundred people and have what could be an hour conversation with each of them was a tall order,” Dr. Ted Long, the head of the city’s contact tracing program, said at a briefing. Long said the fact that the contact tracers actually got through to more than half of the new cases “shows that the system we’re setting up is working.” The city has hired 1,700 people for its contact tracing effort and needs to reach 2,500 in order to meet Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s target for entering the first phase of the state’s four-step reopening process. The contact tracers are placing people infected with the virus in hotel rooms if they need to isolate themselves away from their families as well as reaching out to the close contacts of those who test positive for COVID-19.

                               Asked if the past week’s protests over the death of George Floyd might spark a new wave of infections, Long encouraged anyone who was at a protest to get tested for the coronavirus at one of the more than 150 free testing sites around the city. Floyd, who was black, died after a white police officer pressed a knee into his neck for several minutes. “It starts with the testing piece, which is why we’re extending the invitation we are to anybody that’s been out there at the protests, come in for a free test, it’s close to where you live,” Long said. “We’d love to have you.”

Oregon Republicans have launched a recall campaign against Gov. Kate Brown, the second in less than two years, accusing her of abusing her office and wrecking the state’s economy with her sweeping coronavirus shutdown orders. The campaign, Stop the Abuse — Recall Kate Brown, needs to gather 280,050 signatures from registered voters within 90 days to qualify for the November ballot. Oregon Republican Party Chairman Bill Currier said the recall was needed to “end her disastrous, unaccountable, and abusive tenure as the chief executive of our state.” TOP STORIES

                               “A year ago, citizens were angry, but now Oregonians are fighting for their livelihoods and their freedoms,” Mr. Currier said in a Monday statement. “Governor Brown’s unlawful executive orders stand in the way of restoring both.” The Washington Times has reached out to the governor, who has defended her executive orders on the shutdown and gradual reopening, calling them necessary to protect public health from the novel coronavirus threat. “There are no shortcuts for us to return to life as it was before this pandemic. Moving too quickly could return Oregon to the early days of this crisis, when we braced for overfilled hospitals and ventilators in short supply,” she said in a May 18 statement. In a state of 4.2 million, Oregon has recorded 4,302 cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, since March 13 and 154 deaths, according to the Oregon Health Authority. “Kate Brown still keeps us in her lockdown while our economy is tanking and Oregonians are losing their jobs and worrying about how to put food on the table and pay their mortgages,” said Solomon Yue, Republican National Committeeman for Oregon. Oregon Republicans sought last summer to recall the Democrat Brown, who was reelected in November 2018 with 50.1% of the vote, but the signatures fell 8% short of the 280,050 required to qualify for the ballot. Even so, Mr. Currier said that signature total was a record for any statewide recall petition in Oregon history and that 33% of those who signed petitions were not Republicans. The “round one” campaign also gave the party a database of names, phone numbers and email addresses that can be used for “round two,” he said. “In 2019, there was clearly buyer’s remorse about Kate Brown’s leadership that led hundreds of thousands of voters to seek to hold her accountable,” Mr. Currier said. “The conduct of the Governor during the events of 2020 has only served to reveal just how devastating Brown’s abuse of power could truly be upon Oregon.” Kate Brown has destroyed Oregon’s small businesses, the backbone of the state’s economy. #orpol #StopTheAbuse #RecallKateBrown https://t.co/vz3GOsCMm1 Oregonians did a great job staying close to home last weekend.

She agreed Monday to deploy 50 unarmed National Guard troops after repeated requests from Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler, but she stressed that they “will not be on the front lines, making arrests or doing crowd control.” “That’s basically a pathetic response,” said Mr. Currier, the mayor of Adair Village, Oregon. Ms. Brown is facing multiple lawsuits over her extensions of executive orders shutting down businesses and churches in response to the pandemic. A county judge declared last month her orders “null and void,” but the Oregon Supreme Court temporarily reinstated them pending a review by the full court.

Adm. Brett Giroir, the coronavirus “testing czar,” expects to transition back to his regular post at the Department of Health and Human Services in the coming weeks. Adm.

                               An HHS spokesperson said Adm. Giroir would remain engaged with COVID-19 testing and related efforts, but that much of the day-to-day management and operations of testing are being transitioned back to health and human services. The comments come as states across the country are increasingly relaxing their coronavirus-related restrictions and as the global pandemic has been knocked from the headlines by the national unrest in the wake of the killing of George Floyd in Minnesota on Memorial Day. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the federal government’s top infectious diseases expert, said in an interview published this week that the White House coronavirus task force meetings are not occurring as frequently as they used to. “And certainly my meetings with the president have been dramatically decreased,” Dr. Fauci told the health news website Stat.

More than a quarter of U.S. adults said they would be unlikely to get a coronavirus vaccine that was free of charge and protected them from infection, according to polling released on Tuesday. Overall, 27% of adults said they “definitely” or “probably” would not get the vaccine, according to the ABC News/Washington Post poll. Forty-three percent said they would definitely get a vaccine and 28% said they would probably get one. TOP STORIES

Eighty-one percent of Democrats, 71% of independents and 58% of Republicans said they would definitely or probably get a vaccine that protected them from the virus and that was available for free. The results are similar to other recent surveys gauging public interest in the U.S. on a vaccine. There are more than 1.8 million positive cases in the U.S. and more than 105,000 coronavirus-related deaths, according to a tracker from Johns Hopkins University. The survey of 1,001 U.S. adults was conducted from May 25-28 and has a margin of error of 3.5 points.

MONTCLAIR, N.J. (AP) — Joe Biden could seize the number of delegates  needed to formally clinch the Democrats’ presidential nomination on  Tuesday as seven states and the District of Columbia push through a  pandemic and exploding racial tensions to host the largest slate of  primary elections in almost three months. Voters will be asked to navigate curfews, health concerns and a sharp  increase in mail balloting as elections take place from Maryland to  Montana. Four states were originally scheduled to vote in April but  delayed their contests because of the coronavirus outbreak. Pennsylvania  offers the day’s biggest trove of delegates and represents a  high-profile test case for Republicans and Democrats working to  strengthen their operations in one of the most important general  election battlegrounds. “We think we’re prepared,” said state Democratic Party Chairwoman  Nancy Patton Mills. “Thank goodness we have the opportunity of working  this out in the primary because we don’t know where we’ll be with the  pandemic in November.” TOP STORIES

                               Biden needs to win 89% of all delegates at stake on Tuesday to clinch  the nomination, but his role as his party’s clear presidential nominee  is not in danger should he fall short. With a dominant showing on Super  Tuesday in early March, the former vice president pushed out all his  major opponents. He will almost certainly secure the needed delegates  later in the month if necessary. Still, Tuesday offers a historic opportunity for the 77-year-old  Democrat, who is waging his third presidential campaign and who hopes to  amass as many delegates as possible to show strength before going up  against President Donald Trump. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is not actively campaigning, having  suspended his operation and endorsed Biden, but his name will appear on  the ballots. On the eve of Tuesday’s primaries, senior adviser Jeff  Weaver encouraged progressives to vote for Sanders anyway. “People who support Bernie Sanders and his agenda, who want to  maximize the influence of progressives at the convention, should cast  their vote for Bernie Sanders,” Weaver said, reminding voters that the  Vermont senator is seeking leverage to shape the party’s platform and  rules. The comments serve as a reminder that Biden may have no legitimate  Democratic rivals remaining, but he must still win over skeptical  activists from his party’s far-left flank who worry he’s too close to  the political establishment. Party unity will likely be an afterthought this week, however, as  more immediate health and safety concerns dominate the national  conversation. The coronavirus death toll has surged past 100,000 nationwide, and  thousands of new cases are reported each day. At the same time, several  major cities, including some voting Tuesday, are grappling with protests  following the killing of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died  after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s  neck for several minutes. Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser ordered a 7 p.m. curfew, though  voting places will be open until 8 p.m. Voting has been deemed  essential, and city officials say voters will not be subject to arrest  if they cast ballots during the curfew. It’s much the same in  Philadelphia, where officials have promised that voters would not be  arrested should their city’s 6 p.m. curfew be extended for a fourth  consecutive night. “We are in unique times and voting is a unique challenge for people,”  said Josh Schwerin, chief strategist for the pro-Democrat super PAC  Priorities USA. He said that his organization and others will be  watching closely on Tuesday “to see how well it works, where issues are,  and where obstacles have been put in place.” Political groups have had to adjust as some states move to a system  that relies largely on voting by mail. They include Montana, where all  56 counties decided to vote entirely by mail. Voting rights watchdogs in  multiple states have expressed concerns about access to mail ballots,  confusion about deadlines and a shortage of poll workers that could lead  to long lines. Those voting Tuesday include the District of Columbia, Indiana,  Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South  Dakota. An eighth state holding primary elections, Iowa, chose its  presidential nominee early in the year and focused on other offices.

Throughout January, the World Health Organization publicly praised  China for what it called a speedy response to the new coronavirus. It  repeatedly thanked the Chinese government for sharing the genetic map of  the virus “immediately,” and said its work and commitment to  transparency were “very impressive, and beyond words.” But behind the scenes, it was a much different story, one of  significant delays by China and considerable frustration among WHO  officials over not getting the information they needed to fight the  spread of the deadly virus, The Associated Press has found. Despite the plaudits, China in fact sat on releasing the genetic map,  or genome, of the virus for more than a week after three different  government labs had fully decoded the information. Tight controls on  information and competition within the Chinese public health system were  to blame, according to dozens of interviews and internal documents.

                               Chinese government labs only released the genome after another lab  published it ahead of authorities on a virologist website on Jan. 11.  Even then, China stalled for at least two weeks more on providing WHO  with detailed data on patients and cases, according to recordings of  internal meetings held by the U.N. health agency through January — all  at a time when the outbreak arguably might have been dramatically  slowed. WHO officials were lauding China in public because they wanted to  coax more information out of the government, the recordings obtained by  the AP suggest. Privately, they complained in meetings the week of Jan. 6  that China was not sharing enough data to assess how effectively the  virus spread between people or what risk it posed to the rest of the  world, costing valuable time. “We’re going on very minimal information,” said American  epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove, now WHO’s technical lead for  COVID-19, in one internal meeting. “It’s clearly not enough for you to  do proper planning.” “We’re currently at the stage where yes, they’re giving it to us 15  minutes before it appears on CCTV,” said WHO’s top official in China,  Dr. Gauden Galea, referring to the state-owned China Central Television,  in another meeting. The story behind the early response to the virus comes at a time when  the U.N. health agency is under siege, and has agreed to an independent  probe  of how the pandemic was handled globally. After repeatedly  praising the Chinese response early on, U.S. President Donald Trump has  blasted WHO in recent weeks for allegedly colluding with China to hide  the extent of the coronavirus crisis. He cut ties with the organization  on Friday, jeopardizing the approximately $450 million the U.S. gives  every year as WHO’s biggest single donor. In the meantime, Chinese President Xi Jinping has vowed to pitch in  $2 billion over the next two years to fight the coronavirus, saying  China has always provided information to WHO and the world “in a most  timely fashion.” The new information does not support the narrative of either the U.S.  or China, but instead portrays an agency now stuck in the middle that  was urgently trying to solicit more data despite limits to its own  authority. Although international law obliges countries to report  information to WHO that could have an impact on public health, the U.N.  agency has no enforcement powers and cannot independently investigate  epidemics within countries. Instead, it must rely on the cooperation of  member states. The recordings suggest that rather than colluding with China, as  Trump declared, WHO was kept in the dark as China gave it the minimal  information required by law. However, the agency did try to portray  China in the best light, likely as a means to secure more information.  And WHO experts genuinely thought Chinese scientists had done “a very  good job” in detecting and decoding the virus, despite the lack of  transparency from Chinese officials. WHO staffers debated how to press China for gene sequences and  detailed patient data without angering authorities, worried about losing  access and getting Chinese scientists into trouble. Under international  law, WHO is required to quickly share information and alerts with  member countries about an evolving crisis. Galea noted WHO could not  indulge China’s wish to sign off on information before telling other  countries because “that is not respectful of our responsibilities.” In the second week of January, WHO’s chief of emergencies, Dr.  Michael Ryan, told colleagues it was time to “shift gears” and apply  more pressure on China, fearing a repeat of the outbreak of Severe Acute  Respiratory Syndrome that started in China in 2002 and killed nearly  800 people worldwide. “This is exactly the same scenario, endlessly trying to get updates  from China about what was going on,” he said. “WHO barely got out of  that one with its neck intact given the issues that arose around  transparency in southern China.” Ryan said the best way to “protect China” was for WHO to do its own  independent analysis with data from the Chinese government, because  otherwise the spread of the virus between people would be in question  and “other countries will take action accordingly.” Ryan also noted that  China was not cooperating in the same way some other countries had in  the past. “This would not happen in Congo and did not happen in Congo and other  places,” he said, probably referring to the Ebola outbreak that began  there in 2018. “We need to see the data. … It’s absolutely important at  this point.” The delay in the release of the genome stalled the recognition of its  spread to other countries, along with the global development of tests,  drugs and vaccines. The lack of detailed patient data also made it  harder to determine how quickly the virus was spreading — a critical  question in stopping it. Between the day the full genome was first decoded by a government lab  on Jan. 2 and the day WHO declared a global emergency on Jan. 30, the  outbreak spread by a factor of 100 to 200 times, according to  retrospective infection data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control  and Prevention. The virus has now infected over 6 million people  worldwide and killed more than 375,000. “It’s obvious that we could have saved more lives and avoided many,  many deaths if China and the WHO had acted faster,” said Ali Mokdad, a  professor at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the  University of Washington. However, Mokdad and other experts also noted that if WHO had been  more confrontational with China, it could have triggered a far worse  situation of not getting any information at all. If WHO had pushed too hard, it could even have been kicked out of  China, said Adam Kamradt-Scott, a global health professor at the  University of Sydney. But he added that a delay of just a few days in  releasing genetic sequences can be critical in an outbreak. And he noted  that as Beijing’s lack of transparency becomes even clearer, WHO  director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus’s continued defense of China  is problematic. “It’s definitely damaged WHO’s credibility,” said Kamradt-Scott. “Did  he go too far? I think the evidence on that is clear….it has led to so  many questions about the relationship between China and WHO. It is  perhaps a cautionary tale.” WHO and its officials named in this story declined to answer  questions asked by The Associated Press without audio or written  transcripts of the recorded meetings, which the AP was unable to supply  to protect its sources. “Our leadership and staff have worked night and day in compliance  with the organization’s rules and regulations to support and share  information with all Member States equally, and engage in frank and  forthright conversations with governments at all levels,” a WHO  statement said. China’s National Health Commission and the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs had no comment. But in the past few months, China has repeatedly  defended its actions, and many other countries - including the U.S. -  have responded to the virus with even longer delays of weeks and even  months. “Since the beginning of the outbreak, we have been continuously  sharing information on the epidemic with the WHO and the international  community in an open, transparent and responsible manner,” said Liu  Mingzhu, an official with the National Health Commission’s International  Department, at a press conference  on May 15. ___________ The race to find the genetic map of the virus started in late  December, according to the story that unfolds in interviews, documents  and the WHO recordings. That’s when doctors in Wuhan noticed mysterious  clusters of patients with fevers and breathing problems who weren’t  improving with standard flu treatment. Seeking answers, they sent test  samples from patients to commercial labs. By Dec. 27, one lab, Vision Medicals, had pieced together most of the  genome of a new coronavirus with striking similarities to SARS. Vision  Medicals shared its data with Wuhan officials and the Chinese Academy of  Medical Sciences, as reported first by Chinese finance publication  Caixin and independently confirmed by the AP. On Dec. 30, Wuhan health officials issued internal notices warning of  the unusual pneumonia, which leaked on social media. That evening, Shi  Zhengli, a coronavirus expert at the Wuhan Institute of Virology who is  famous for having traced the SARS virus to a bat cave, was alerted to  the new disease, according to an interview with Scientific American. Shi  took the first train from a conference in Shanghai back to Wuhan. The next day, Chinese CDC director Gao Fu dispatched a team of  experts to Wuhan. Also on Dec. 31, WHO first learned about the cases  from an open-source platform that scouts for intelligence on outbreaks,  emergencies chief Ryan has said. WHO officially requested more information on Jan. 1. Under  international law, members have 24 to 48 hours to respond, and China  reported two days later that there were 44 cases and no deaths. By Jan. 2, Shi had decoded the entire genome of the virus, according to a notice later posted on her institute’s website. Scientists agree that Chinese scientists detected and sequenced the  then-unknown pathogen with astonishing speed, in a testimony to China’s  vastly improved technical capabilities since SARS, during which a  WHO-led group of scientists took months to identify the virus. This  time, Chinese virologists proved within days that it was a  never-before-seen coronavirus. Tedros would later say Beijing set “a new  standard for outbreak response.” But when it came to sharing the information with the world, things began to go awry. On Jan. 3, the National Health Commission issued a confidential  notice ordering labs with the virus to either destroy their samples or  send them to designated institutes for safekeeping. The notice, first  reported by Caixin and seen by the AP, forbade labs from publishing  about the virus without government authorization. The order barred Shi’s  lab from publishing the genetic sequence or warning of the potential  danger. Chinese law states that research institutes cannot conduct  experiments on potentially dangerous new viruses without approval from  top health authorities. Although the law is intended to keep experiments  safe, it gives top health officials wide-ranging powers over what  lower-level labs can or cannot do. “If the virologist community had operated with more autonomy….the  public would have been informed of the lethal risk of the new virus much  earlier,” said Edward Gu, a professor at Zhejiang University, and Li  Lantian, a PhD student at Northwestern University, in a paper published  in March analyzing the outbreak. Commission officials later repeated that they were trying to ensure  lab safety, and had tasked four separate government labs with  identifying the genome at the same time to get accurate, consistent  results. By Jan. 3, the Chinese CDC had independently sequenced the virus,  according to internal data seen by the Associated Press. And by just  after midnight on Jan. 5, a third designated government lab, the Chinese  Academy of Medical Sciences, had decoded the sequence and submitted a  report - pulling all-nighters to get results in record time, according  to a state media interview. Yet even with full sequences decoded by  three state labs independently, Chinese health officials remained  silent. The WHO reported on Twitter that investigations were under way  into an unusual cluster of pneumonia cases with no deaths in Wuhan, and  said it would share “more details as we have them.” Meanwhile, at the Chinese CDC, gaps in coronavirus expertise proved a problem. For nearly two weeks, Wuhan reported no new infections, as officials  censored doctors who warned of suspicious cases. Meanwhile, researchers  found the new coronavirus used a distinct spike protein to bind itself  to human cells. The unusual protein and the lack of new cases lulled  some Chinese CDC researchers into thinking the virus didn’t easily  spread between humans - like the coronavirus that casues Middle East  respiratory syndrome, or MERS, according to an employee who declined to  be identified out of fear of retribution. Li, the coronavirus expert, said he immediately suspected the  pathogen was infectious when he spotted a leaked copy of a sequencing  report in a group chat on a SARS-like coronavirus. But the Chinese CDC  team that sequenced the virus lacked specialists in the molecular  structure of coronaviruses and failed to consult with outside  scientists, Li said. Chinese health authorities rebuffed offers of  assistance from foreign experts, including Hong Kong scientists barred  from a fact-finding mission to Wuhan and an American professor at a  university in China. On Jan. 5, the Shanghai Public Clinical Health Center, led by famed  virologist Zhang Yongzhen, was the latest to sequence the virus. He  submitted it to the GenBank database, where it sat awaiting review, and  notified the National Health Commission. He warned them that the new  virus was similar to SARS and likely infectious. “It should be contagious through respiratory passages,” the center  said in an internal notice seen by the AP. “We recommend taking  preventative measures in public areas.” On the same day, WHO said that based on preliminary information from  China, there was no evidence of significant transmission between humans,  and did not recommend any specific measures for travelers. The next day, the Chinese CDC raised its emergency level to the  second highest. Staffers proceeded to isolate the virus, draft lab  testing guidelines, and design test kits. But the agency did not have  the authority to issue public warnings, and the heightened emergency  level was kept secret even from many of its own staff. By Jan. 7, another team at Wuhan University had sequenced the  pathogen and found it matched Shi’s, making Shi certain they had  identified a novel coronavirus. But Chinese CDC experts said they didn’t  trust Shi’s findings and needed to verify her data before she could  publish, according to three people familiar with the matter. Both the  National Health Commission and the Ministry of Science and Technology,  which oversees Shi’s lab, declined to make Shi available for an  interview. A major factor behind the gag order, some say, was that Chinese CDC  researchers wanted to publish their papers first. “They wanted to take  all the credit,” said Li Yize, a coronavirus researcher at the  University of Pennsylvania. Internally, the leadership of the Chinese CDC is plagued with fierce  competition, six people familiar with the system explained. They said  the agency has long promoted staff based on how many papers they can  publish in prestigious journals, making scientists reluctant to share  data. As the days went by, even some of the Chinese CDC’s own staff began  to wonder why it was taking so long for authorities to identify the  pathogen. “We were getting suspicious, since within one or two days you would  get a sequencing result,” a lab technician said, declining to be  identified for fear of retribution. ___________ On Jan. 8, the Wall Street Journal  reported that scientists had  identified a new coronavirus in samples from pneumonia patients in  Wuhan, pre-empting and embarrassing Chinese officials. The lab  technician told the AP they first learned about the discovery of the  virus from the Journal. The article also embarrassed WHO officials. Dr. Tom Grein, chief of  WHO’s acute events management team, said the agency looked “doubly,  incredibly stupid.” Van Kerkhove, the American expert, acknowledged WHO  was “already late” in announcing the new virus and told colleagues that  it was critical to push China. Ryan, WHO’s chief of emergencies, was also upset at the dearth of information. “The fact is, we’re two to three weeks into an event, we don’t have a  laboratory diagnosis, we don’t have an age, sex or geographic  distribution, we don’t have an epi curve,” he complained, referring to  the standard graphic of outbreaks scientists use to show how an epidemic  is progressing. After the article, state media officially announced the discovery of  the new coronavirus. But even then, Chinese health authorities did not  release the genome, diagnostic tests, or detailed patient data that  could hint at how infectious the disease was. By that time, suspicious cases were already appearing across the region. On Jan. 8, Thai airport officers pulled aside a woman from Wuhan with  a runny nose, sore throat, and high temperature. Chulalongkorn  University professor Supaporn Wacharapluesadee’s team found the woman  was infected with a new coronavirus, much like what Chinese officials  had described. Supaporn partially figured out the genetic sequence by  Jan. 9, reported it to the Thai government and spent the next day  searching for matching sequences. But because Chinese authorities hadn’t published any sequences, she  found nothing. She could not prove the Thai virus was the same pathogen  sickening people in Wuhan. “It was kind of wait and see, when China will release the data, then we can compare,” said Supaporn. On Jan. 9, a 61-year-old man with the virus passed away in Wuhan -  the first known death. The death wasn’t made public until Jan. 11. WHO officials complained in internal meetings that they were making  repeated requests for more data, especially to find out if the virus  could spread efficiently between humans, but to no avail. “We have informally and formally been requesting more epidemiological  information,” WHO’s China representative Galea said. “But when asked  for specifics, we could get nothing.” Emergencies chief Ryan grumbled that since China was providing the  minimal information required by international law, there was little WHO  could do. But he also noted that last September, WHO had issued an  unusual public rebuke of Tanzania for not providing enough details about  a worrisome Ebola outbreak. “We have to be consistent,” Ryan said. “The danger now is that  despite our good intent…especially if something does happen, there  will be a lot of finger-pointing at WHO.” Ryan noted that China could make a “huge contribution” to the world  by sharing the genetic material immediately, because otherwise “other  countries will have to reinvent the wheel over the coming days.” On Jan. 11, a team led by Zhang, from the Shanghai Public Health  Clinical Center, finally published a sequence on virological.org, used  by researchers to swap tips on pathogens. The move angered Chinese CDC  officials, three people familiar with the matter said, and the next day,  his laboratory was temporarily shuttered by health authorities. Zhang referred a request for comment to the Chinese CDC. The National  Health Commission, which oversees the Chinese CDC, declined multiple  times to make its officials available for interviews and did not answer  questions about Zhang. Supaporn compared her sequence with Zhang’s and found it was a 100%  match, confirming that the Thai patient was ill with the same virus  detected in Wuhan. Another Thai lab got the same results. That day,  Thailand informed the WHO, said Tanarak Plipat, deputy director-general  of the Department of Disease Control at Thailand’s Ministry of Public  Health. After Zhang released the genome, the Chinese CDC, the Wuhan Institute  of Virology and the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences raced to  publish their sequences, working overnight to review them, gather  patient data, and send them to the National Health Commission for  approval, according to documentation obtained by the AP. On Jan. 12, the  three labs together finally published the sequences on GISAID, a  platform for scientists to share genomic data. By then, more than two weeks had passed since Vision Medicals decoded  a partial sequence, and more than a week since the three government  labs had all obtained full sequences. Around 600 people were infected in  that week, a roughly three-fold increase. Some scientists say the wait was not unreasonable considering the  difficulties in sequencing unknown pathogens, given accuracy is as  important as speed. They point to the SARS outbreak in 2003 when some  Chinese scientists initially - and wrongly - believed the source of the  epidemic was chlamydia. “The pressure is intense in an outbreak to make sure you’re right,”  said Peter Daszak, president of the EcoHealthAlliance in New York. “It’s  actually worse to go out to go to the public with a story that’s wrong  because the public completely lose confidence in the public health  response.” Still, others quietly question what happened behind the scenes. Infectious diseases expert John Mackenzie, who served on a WHO  emergency committee during the outbreak, praised the speed of Chinese  researchers in sequencing the virus. But he said once central  authorities got involved, detailed data trickled to a crawl. “There certainly was a kind of blank period,” Mackenzie said. “There  had to be human to human transmission. You know, it’s staring at you in  the face… I would have thought they would have been much more open at  that stage.” _________________ On Jan. 13, WHO announced that Thailand had a confirmed case of the virus, jolting Chinese officials. The next day, in a confidential teleconference, China’s top health  official ordered the country to prepare for a pandemic, calling the  outbreak the “most severe challenge since SARS in 2003”, as the AP  previously reported. Chinese CDC staff across the country began  screening, isolating, and testing for cases, turning up hundreds across  the country. Yet even as the Chinese CDC internally declared a level one  emergency, the highest level possible, Chinese officials still said the  chance of sustained transmission between humans was low. WHO went back and forth. Van Kerkhove said in a press briefing that  “it is certainly possible there is limited human-to-human transmission.”  But hours later, WHO seemed to backtrack, and tweeted that “preliminary  investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear  evidence of human-to-human transmission” — a statement that later  became fodder for critics. A high-ranking official in WHO’s Asia office, Dr. Liu Yunguo, who  attended medical school in Wuhan, flew to Beijing to make direct,  informal contacts with Chinese officials, recordings show. Liu’s former  classmate, a Wuhan doctor, had alerted him that pneumonia patients were  flooding the city’s hospitals, and Liu pushed for more experts to visit  Wuhan, according to a public health expert familiar with the matter. On Jan. 20, the leader of an expert team returning from Wuhan,  renowned government infectious diseases doctor Zhong Nanshan, declared  publicly for the first time that the new virus was spreading between  people. Chinese President Xi Jinping called for the “timely publication  of epidemic information and deepening of international cooperation.” Despite that directive, WHO staff still struggled to obtain enough  detailed patient data from China about the rapidly evolving outbreak.  That same day, the U.N. health agency dispatched a small team to Wuhan  for two days, including Galea, the WHO representative in China. They were told about a worrying cluster of cases among more than a  dozen doctors and nurses. But they did not have “transmission trees”  detailing how the cases were connected, nor a full understanding of how  widely the virus was spreading and who was at risk. In an internal meeting, Galea said their Chinese counterparts were  “talking openly and consistently” about human-to-human transmission, and  that there was a debate about whether or not this was sustained. Galea  reported to colleagues in Geneva and Manila that China’s key request to  WHO was for help “in communicating this to the public, without causing  panic.” On Jan. 22, WHO convened an independent committee to determine  whether to declare a global health emergency. After two inconclusive  meetings where experts were split, they decided against it - even as  Chinese officials ordered Wuhan sealed in the biggest quarantine in  history. The next day, WHO chief Tedros publicly described the spread of  the new coronavirus in China as “limited.” For days, China didn’t release much detailed data, even as its case  count exploded. Beijing city officials were alarmed enough to consider  locking down the capital, according to a medical expert with direct  knowledge of the matter. On Jan. 28, Tedros and top experts, including Ryan, made an  extraordinary trip to Beijing to meet President Xi and other senior  Chinese officials. It is highly unusual for WHO’s director-general to  directly intervene in the practicalities of outbreak investigations.  Tedros‘ staffers had prepared a list of requests for information. “It could all happen and the floodgates open, or there’s no  communication,” Grein said in an internal meeting while his boss was in  Beijing. “We’ll see.” At the end of Tedros’ trip, WHO announced China had agreed to accept  an international team of experts. In a press briefing on Jan. 29, Tedros  heaped praise on China, calling its level of commitment “incredible.” The next day, WHO finally declared an international health emergency.  Once again, Tedros thanked China, saying nothing about the earlier lack  of cooperation. “We should have actually expressed our respect and gratitude to China  for what it’s doing,” Tedros said. “It has already done incredible  things to limit the transmission of the virus to other countries.”

The coronavirus pandemic that upended everyday life and killed more than 104,000 Americans no longer leads the newscasts as protests against police brutality roil major cities, sparking concern that the public may let up its guard against the insidious disease. Disease trackers already feared a second wave of transmission as businesses slowly reopened and people eager to socialize crowded into beach towns and summertime party hubs. Now, people marching or rioting in the wake of George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis aren’t practicing social distancing, either, creating fears that protests will become “superspreader” events.

                               “Don’t snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. We’re talking about reopening in one week in New York City, and now we’re seeing these mass gatherings over the past several nights that could, in fact, exacerbate the COVID-19 spread,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. “We spent all this time closed down, locked down, masks, socially distanced — and then you turn on the TV and you see these mass gatherings that could potentially be infecting hundreds and hundreds of people, after everything that we have done. We have to take a minute and ask ourselves, ‘What are we doing here?’ “ The Democratic governor said he shares the protesters’ outrage and noted that America’s struggle with racism extends far beyond the Minneapolis incident. Still, he is concerned about the gatherings. “How many superspreaders were in that crowd?” he said before addressing the fact that many protesters weren’t in the most vulnerable age group. “How many young people went home and kissed their mother ‘hello’ or shook hands with their father or hugged their father or their grandfather or their grandmother or their brother or their sister and spread a virus?” Protesters in cities across America are shouting, potentially releasing virus-laded droplets. Although they are outside, allowing viral particles to drift off, demonstrators are so close together that there is plenty of risk. “The single thing that I am most worried about is a lot of these folks aren’t wearing masks or have them down around their neck, and a lot of police aren’t wearing masks,” said Jordan Strauss, managing director for business intelligence and investigations at Kroll, a global risk consultancy. Personal protective equipment “is already in short supply, and we are dealing with an extremely transmissible virus hitting minority communities particularly hard,” he said. “I’m concerned about legitimate protesters and their families getting sick.” Some violent provocateurs don’t live in the places where protests are happening, so “they could carry the virus into places it hasn’t been before. It is a huge risk right now,” said Mr. Strauss, who once served as a director at the White House National Security Council specializing in incident management. The coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China, in December and has spread around the globe. It has infected 1.8 million people in the U.S. and killed more than 104,000. Nursing homes have been hit incredibly hard. Federal officials have obtained reports of nearly 26,000 nursing home residents dying from COVID-19, according to materials prepared for the nation’s governors and provided to The Associated Press. As transmission slows across the country, however, states have begun to reopen restaurants, shops and offices to get the economy revving again. The protests are “another one of these things that we have to balance as a society. We’re balancing economics against prevention of transmission. In this case, we’re balancing freedom of speech and freedom to protest against epidemic parameters around the infectious disease,” said Michael Mina, assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Although some of the protesters are wearing face coverings that can slow transmission, many aren’t. Asymptomatic people can spread the coronavirus, so they might not know it when they hit the streets. “There’s no doubt in my mind that these can become breeding grounds for this virus,” Mr. Mina said. “The one benefit is that they tend to be outside.” Hopefully, he said, breezes and other outdoor conditions will distribute many viral particles away from the crowds. The New York City Department of Health tweeted tips to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19. It urged those who “plan to protest” to wear face coverings, use hand sanitizer and use noise-makers instead of yelling. It also advised protesters to stick to small groups and stay at least 6 feet away from other groups. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser told local residents to get tested for the virus after mingling with other protesters. “A mass gathering is a mass gathering,” said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “When people are socially interacting and unable to social distance, shouting and being sprayed with agents that caused them to cough, it is a simple biological fact the transmission events are going to occur.”

Health officials say their fledgling efforts to trace and stem the spread of the coronavirus could be hampered by protests across the country. The situation could mean more bad news for businesses seeking to recover from coronavirus shutdowns and recent rioting: Contact tracing is a key element of many states’ plans to further reopen their economies. A lack of contact tracing could result in uptick in COVID-19 cases and delay reopening plans. Large groups of protesters in numerous cities are causes for concern for infectious disease experts.

                               “Whenever you have people in crowded places and close proximity, you have an increased possibility of spread from person-to-person,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute on Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “I think if you have the element of public disruption where people are gathering in a disruptive way without any control over crowds and people are intermingling, clearly there is a chance there will be an uptick in infections …” State and local officials have been attempting to gradually reopen after weeks of stay-at-home orders, but health experts say widespread testing, contact tracing and isolation must be in place to prevent new outbreaks of infections. “A mass gathering is a mass gathering. When people are socially interacting and unable to social distance, shouting, and being sprayed with agents that caused them to cough, it is a simple biological fact the transmission events are going to occur,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar for Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. ” … The sheer numbers of exposures in some cities may be above the threshold that a health department can handle in terms of contact tracing. “If these protests lead to surges in cases and transmission chains that spill into hospitals and cause stress on the system, it will be a setback to reopening safely,” Dr. Adalja said. Thousands of people across the country have protested the death of George Floyd, a black man who died on Memorial Day after a white Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck for nearly 9 minutes. The protests’ impact on the spread of COVID-19 is unknown. Most demonstrations were outside, where the chance for spread is lower, and some protesters have been properly wearing masks, noted Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University. He said the demonstrations could accelerate or lead to spikes in infections in parts of the country, particularly among people of color. “That’s exactly the population that has been disproportionately affected by COVID-19, and I have concerns that some new infections may be acquired during these demonstrations and then taken home to family and friends to spread even further,” said Dr. Schaffner. He added that mistrust in government officials and authority figures could disrupt contact tracing. People could be “leary” about providing the contact information of individuals they have been demonstrating with, Dr. Schaffner said. The protests also are disrupting coronavirus testing efforts in parts of the country. Some of the testing clinics in Minneapolis have been damaged during riots, according to a city government spokesperson. Two sites in Jacksonville, Florida, cancelled coronavirus testing on Sunday due to concerns about riots in the downtown area, and they remained closed Monday. All community-based coronavirus testing sites in Illinois were closed Monday following an announcement that public transportation and businesses across the state shut down over the weekend due to protests and looting in Chicago and other cities, Patch reported. On Saturday, Los Angeles’ mayor announced the closure of COVID-19 testing centers out of safety concerns from violent protests. “When you try to do public health measures, when you have disruptions like this, this could get in the way of the effectiveness of public health measures,” Dr. Fauci said. χ This article is based in part on wire service reports.

Two Democratic lawmakers on Monday called for federal prison officials to explain why two of President Trump’s former associates have been released into home confinement amid the coronavirus crisis, while “low-risk, vulnerable individuals” remain in prison. Sens. Kamala D. Harris of California and Hakeem Jeffries of New York sent a letter to Attorney General William P. Barr and Federal Bureau of Prisons Director Michael Carvajal saying they are concerned Trump associates are receiving favorable treatment. They pointed to the cases of Paul Manafort, who briefly served as Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman, who had been serving a sentence for financial fraud, and Michael Cohen, Mr. Trump’s former fixer, who pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations.

                               Both men were released to thin the prison population and stop the spread of the coronavirus. The lawmakers cite the case of Andrea Circle Bear, who was the first federal prisoner to die from COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. She was sentenced to two years on a drug charge and died weeks after delivering a baby via cesarean section. In another case, a 67-year-old man with coronary artery disease was denied home confinement because he had not served half of his sentence. “These examples make clear that there are two systems of justice in our country — one for President Trump and his associates, and another for everyone else. These examples also heighten our concern about the politicization of the Department of Justice,” the lawmakers wrote. Ms. Harris and Mr. Jefferies want to know if the White House asked to have Manafort or Cohen transferred to home confinement and a list of individuals involved in those decisions. The lawmakers asked Mr. Barr to provide details on how the Justice Department and Bureau of Prisons determine who is picked for home confinement.

Gun sales surged in May as shops reported an uptick in interest and demand amid national protests after the Memorial Day killing of George Floyd and as the COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc and stoke fear across the country. “Almost, you couldn’t even keep up with it. That’s how crazy it was,” said Joe Hawk, owner of Guns & Roses in New Jersey. “After Memorial Day, it spiked again. It just went crazy again.” Small Arms Analytics & Forecasting, a private research firm, estimated that more than 1.7 million guns were sold in May, an 80% jump from May 2019.

                               “Yet again, firearms sales have surged in unprecedented ways,” said Jurgen Brauer, the group’s chief economist. The stock prices for several gunmaking companies, including Sturm, Ruger & Co., jumped Monday. Larry Hyatt, owner of Hyatt Guns in Charlotte, North Carolina, said the gun demand prompted by COVID-19 was already straining suppliers. “Then you have this looting and rioting causing another demand, and it’s really putting pressure on inventory,” Mr. Hyatt said. Gun sales typically increase during presidential election years and during periods of national unrest, including after mass shootings, but Mr. Hyatt said the confluence of factors is unique. “There’s economic worry, there’s crime worry, and then you got the worry of the coronavirus — it’s [a] triple whammy,” he said. More than 3 million checks were run through the FBI’s national instant check system last month, which was a record for May and about a 32% increase from May 2019. The FBI numbers don’t match gun sales perfectly but are used as a general approximation to gauge the health of the market. Small Arms Analytics & Forecasting and other market analysts subtract from their reports permit checks and other data unlikely to be related to gun sales. “Now what you’re seeing happening across the country is only going to fuel concerns about personal safety,” said Mark Oliva, a spokesman for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the leading trade group for the gun industry. Sales were booming this year before the Floyd killing sparked national protests and tense standoffs between law enforcement and protesters this past week. Five of the 10 top days for FBI checks were in March, and five of the top 10 weeks were in periods covering February, March and April. Mr. Oliva said recent surveys of their retailers found that as many as 40% were first-time buyers. Small Arms Analytics & Forecasting reported that handgun sales likely clocked in at about 1 million in May, a 94% increase from last year, and the 535,000 long gun sales marked an increase of about 66%. “They’re buying predominantly handguns — small, defensive-use handguns — and they’re telling the retailers that they’re coming in to buy guns to be able to provide for their own safety, which was our suspicion as these sales started,” Mr. Oliva said. “I expect that those will continue as we go forward.” He said election-year politics can figure into the numbers. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, has pledged to push for strict gun controls if elected. Mr. Biden was among a number of officials across the country urging a de-escalation Monday as tensions over Mr. Floyd’s killing flared. He suggested that police could be trained to engage potential threats with non-lethal uses of firearms. “The idea that instead of standing there and teaching a cop when there’s an unarmed person coming at them with a knife or something to shoot them in the leg instead of the heart is a very different thing,” he told a gathering of black leaders at a church in Wilmington, Delaware. “There’s a lot of different things that could change.” During the post-Newtown gun control push, Mr. Biden suggested that people could scare off attempted intruders by firing a shotgun into the air. More than 4,000 arrests have been made across the country in recent days on charges including stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a tally from The Associated Press. More than 60 Secret Service officers and special agents were injured over the weekend as protests rocked the nation’s capital near the White House. D.C. Metropolitan Police Chief Peter Newsham said Monday that the department made 88 arrests Sunday and overnight and that seven officers sustained minor injuries.

The Democratic Republic of Congo has detected a new Ebola outbreak in its northwest Équateur province, adding to global health woes. Lab tests confirmed six cases. Four patients have died and two are receiving care, according to the World Health Organization. The outbreak in the health zone around the city of Mbandaka comes as the globe battles the COVID-19 pandemic. TOP STORIES

                               Also, the DRC is trying to stamp out the last embers of an Ebola outbreak in a war-torn, eastern province that’s been going on since 2018. “This is a reminder that COVID-19 is not the only health threat people face,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus said. “Although much of our attention is on the pandemic, WHO is continuing to monitor and respond to many other health emergencies.” The new Ebola outbreak is the 11th one recorded in the DRC since the disease was discovered in 1976. The ninth one occurred in the same area from May to July in 2018. WHO said it has personnel on the ground in Mbandaka to test samples and trace the contacts of infected persons.

The District has opened two more COVID-19 testing sites, one of which will accept walk-ups without an appointment required. The walk-up site opened in Northwest on F Street between 4th and 5th streets. “We’re going to be shutting down this part of the street so that we can have this walk-up testing site,” Mayor Muriel Bowser said at a press conference at Judiciary Square. “You can walk up here without an appointment if you need a COVID test.” TOP STORIES

                               Additionally, the District is replacing the former virus testing site at United Medical Center with one at 2241 Martin Luther King Jr. Ave. in Southeast. The District reported 56 new cases of the coronavirus Monday, bringing its total to 8,801 positive cases. It has tested 46,483 people in all out of a population of just more than 700,000. Two more District residents have died from the virus, for a total of 466. Miss Bowser noted that many of the protesters who have demonstrated in the District in recent days have worn masks, but D.C. health director Dr. LaQuandra Nesbitt said that masked gatherings, even peaceful protests, were “not something we would support at this time” due to the pandemic. “If you think were exposed at the protests or elsewhere, please get tested,” the office of D.C. Council member Elissa Silverman tweeted.

The public approval rating of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe fell over the weekend to its lowest point in roughly two years. The latest polling by Kyodo News shows Mr. Abe’s approval rating stands at 39.8% after widespread criticism of his government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. With a population of 126.5 million, Japan has reported 16,787 confirmed cases of COVID-19, 899 deaths and 14,422 recoveries, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker.

Mr. Abe moved to lift coronavirus restrictions last week after seeing a downtrend in new cases. 47.2% of respondents said the timing was too early, while 38.7% supported the timing. It also marks the first time the president’s approval rating has dipped below 40% since May 2018 after allegations of favoritism regarding school building projects, according to Japanese news reports.

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Tuesday’s primaries in eight states are the  biggest test to date of campaigning during the coronavirus era, a way  for parties to test-drive new ways of getting out the vote during a time  when it can be dangerous to leave your home. Voters from Pennsylvania to Iowa to New Mexico will cast ballots in  both the Democratic presidential contest, where former Vice President  Joe Biden is the only contender with an active campaign, and a host of  down-ballot primaries for everything from governors to state  representatives. Many states postponed elections scheduled between  mid-March and May to the date because of the coronavirus outbreak. Unable to send candidates out to barnstorm the states or volunteers  to knock on voters’ doors, campaigns have had to improvise. One  Pennsylvania Republican congressional campaign recruited 100 people,  including its candidate’s large extended family, to hand-write thousands  of letters to voters urging support. Another organized “pop-up food  banks” for the needy. Others moved up television advertising to  capitalize on a captive audience locked down at home. Democrats have  created a phone banking model almost along the lines of a technology  support hub, where knowledgeable volunteers and staffers can guide  confused voters, step by step, through the process of voting by mail.

                               “Any plan you had three months ago is out the window,” said Brock  Lowrance, a Republican strategist working on two Montana races - Sen.  Steve Daines’ reelection bid and Rep. Greg Gianforte’s bid for the GOP  gubernatorial nomination. “Campaigns are having to adapt in the ways  they’re talking to voters but also in the ways voters are going to  vote.” Some voting experts predict half or more of all ballots cast in the  November election will be sent through the mail, as the Centers for  Disease Control recommends as a way to lessen risk of exposure to the  virus at polling stations. States have scrambled to adjust to the new  reality with some sending every voter an absentee ballot request. In Iowa, the traditional frenzy of pre-primary  barbecues and rallies has shifted to twice-a-week Zoom training of  volunteers for Democratic Senate candidate Theresa Greenfield, who then  start dialing voters to ensure they’ve requested and returned their mail  ballots. “Just because we’re staying home doesn’t mean we’re standing still,” said Sam Newton, communication director for Greenfield. In Montana, where the populace is more accustomed to voting by mail,  the outbreak has still altered the rhythm of the political season.  Lowrance says he’s noticed far more down-ballot races advertising on  television, a reflection of how campaigns have fewer ways to reach  voters and more eyeballs glued to the screen during quarantine. Lowrance said campaigns, including his own, have had to watch their  budgets as the pandemic and economic crash have crimped fundraising and  refrained from hiring the legion of door-knockers who usually hit the  streets before elections. And now they are having to plan for two  possibilities - that November will resemble the intense lockdowns of the  past two months, or the more mixed reality of reopened states. “It’s really trying to build two different plans and execute them,” Lowrance said. The greatest attention is on Pennsylvania, however. It’s  simultaneously the biggest state voting on Tuesday, the only one that is  likely to be a presidential battleground in November and the state  that’s seen the biggest shift in voting in the COVID-19 era. That’s because this is the first statewide election under a new, more  permissive mail voting law passed last year. In 2016, only 4.6% of the  state’s voters cast a ballot by mail. Now 21% of all the state’s 8.5  million voters have already requested absentee ballots. Democrats are overwhelmingly the ones asking to vote by mail - 1.3  million have filed requests, compared with 525,000 Republicans, state  records show. That’s partly a reflection of GOP distrust of mail voting  that’s been stoked by President Donald Trump, who’s claimed without  evidence it will lead to widespread fraud. Even the Trump campaign,  recognizing that getting supporters to mail ballots in is key to winning  elections, has been pushing Republicans to use the technique. Some Pennsylvania Republicans have worried Trump is hobbling the  party by making its voters distrust the easiest method of voting during  the pandemic. Others argue the gap will close in the fall, when  Democrats aren’t the only ones to have a presidential candidate on the  ballot. “They had that Bernie and Biden thing going, and it drove some  enthusiasm, as it naturally would,” said Dave Feidt, the party chairman  in Dauphin County, home to the state capital of Harrisburg. “But to come  full circle, you’ll see a very different dynamic in the fall when  things are R against D.” Democrats are elated with their mail ballot lead, saying it reflects  their voters’ excitement. “They’re willing to crawl through broken glass  to make sure they participate,” said Democratic National Committee  spokesman David Bergstein. The party has also shifted its campaign tactics, building upon its  success in Wisconsin, where the state party pushed mail voting heavily  and Democrats won a contested state supreme court election in April. The  party has distributed new call scripts to volunteers with detailed  instructions on mail voting and ensured there are experts who can walk  confused voters through requesting ballots. People marooned at home are  answering phones and texts at a notably higher rate, Bergstein said. Pennsylvania has revealed one potential weak spot for Democrats in  the mail voting era - African Americans voters, who operatives say have  been requesting ballots at lower rates. Claudette Williams, a black  Democrat running for a state legislative seat in eastern Pennsylvania,  has had to replace her regular circuit of black churches with regular  Zoom calls with black ministers and their parishioners. Her campaign has  also organized “pop-up food banks” to distribute food to the needy, at a  distance, during the outbreak. Normally Williams would be frantically meeting voters in the days  before a primary. “Today I have to pick up 60 pounds of meat for a  pop-up pantry,” she said Friday. Republicans have also been testing new ways of reaching voters. Once  the lockdowns began, it switched its Trump Victory organizing push to  online meetings, says it recruited 300,000 new members who have made  millions of calls, often with the aid of the campaign’s app that helps  target voters in key states. “Within just 24 hours, our teams transitioned to an entirely virtual  campaign,” said Republican National Committee spokeswoman Mandi Merritt. Also conducting primaries Tuesday are Indiana, Maryland, Rhode Island and South Dakota.

CAIRO (AP) — Aid organizations are making an urgent plea for funding  to shore up their operations in war-torn Yemen, saying they have already  been forced to stop some of their work even as the coronavirus rips  through the country. Some 75% of U.N. programs in Yemen have had to shut their doors or  reduce operations. The global body’s World Food Program had to cut  rations in half and U.N.-funded health services were reduced in 189 out  of 369 hospitals nationwide. “It’s almost impossible to look a family in the face, to look them in  the eyes and say, ‘I’m sorry but the food that you need in order to  survive we have to cut in half,’” Lise Grande, resident U.N. coordinator  for Yemen, told The Associated Press.

                               The dwindling funds are the result of several factors, but among the  top reasons is obstruction by Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who control the  capital, Sanaa, and other territories. The United States, one of the  largest donors, decreased its aid to Yemen earlier this year, citing  interference by the Houthis. It’s yet to be seen whether the Houthis will allow monitoring and  oversight or give U.N. agencies the space to operate. A U.N. pledging  conference for Yemen on Tuesday seeks $2.41 billion to cover essential  activities from June to December. Grande said the Houthis are working to become more transparent, and  that she hopes this will encourage donor countries to give aid. Her optimism, however, comes as the Houthis face heavy criticism for  suppressing information about the number of COVID-19 cases and  fatalities in areas they control, while putting no mitigation measures  in place. Tuesday’s conference will be co-hosted for the first time by Saudi  Arabia - a major player in Yemen’s civil war since it first unleashed a  bombing campaign in 2015 to try to push back the Iranian-backed Houthis  who had seized the northern half of the country. Critics question the Saudis’ high-profile role in rallying  humanitarian support even as they continue to wage a war - as do the  Houthis - that has created the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Maysaa Shuja al-Deen, a Yemeni researcher and a non-resident fellow  at the Sana’a Center for Strategic Studies, said the kingdom is trying  to repair its international image by changing the conversation. Saudi Arabia “has always tried to change the narrative of the war and  present itself as a backer of the legitimate government, not part of  the conflict,” she said. In past years, the kingdom has been one of the top donors for U.N.  humanitarian aid operations in Yemen. The Saudi ambassador to Yemen,  Mohammed al-Jaber, said the kingdom will allocate half a billion dollars  this year to support U.N. programs, including $25 million for a  COVID-19 response plan. The U.N. itself has also investigated allegations of corruption and diversion of aid in Yemen in its own ranks. Reports indicate that the coronavirus is spreading at an alarming rate throughout the country. Among the slashed programs is financial support to thousands of  health workers who haven’t received salaries from the government for  nearly three years. Grande said that just a week before the first  coronavirus case was announced in Yemen, aid agencies had to stop paying  health workers. Without salaries, medical staff won’t be able to provide health services to patients amid the pandemic. The U.N. received around $3.6 billion in 2019 in international  donations for its campaign, short of its $4.2 billion goal. For its 2020  plan, it has so far received only 15% out of the needed $3.5 billion. Yemen has been caught in a grinding war since 2014 when Houthi rebels  descended from their northern enclave and took over Sanaa, forcing the  internationally recognized president to flee. In the spring of 2015, a  U.S.-backed, Saudi-led coalition began a destructive air campaign to  dislodge the Houthis while imposing a land, sea and air embargo on  Yemen. The air war and fighting on the ground has killed more than 100,000  people, shut down or destroyed half of Yemen’s health facilities, and  driven 4 million Yemenis from their homes. Cholera epidemics and severe  malnutrition among children have led to thousands of additional deaths. As the war enters its sixth year, with no sign of a viable  cease-fire, the suffering looks set to continue. Fighting has continued  unabated along several front lines in Yemen, including in Marib, an  oil-rich eastern province, threatening new waves of displacement. The U.N.’s massive aid program, totaling $8.35 billion since 2015, is  vital to keeping many Yemenis alive. Ten million people are on the  brink of famine and 80% of the 30 million population are in need of aid,  according to the U.N. With the coronavirus spreading, more money is needed. Since April, authorities in areas controlled by Yemen’s  internationally recognized government reported 283 cases, including 85  deaths. The Houthis declared only four cases, including one death. The World Health Organization believes that there is a significant  underestimation of the outbreak, which could further hinder efforts to  get supplies into Yemen that are needed to contain the virus. Richard Brennan, the WHO’s regional emergency director, told the AP  that he believes the deaths are in the hundreds and cases in the  thousands, based on what he’s heard from numerous health care providers.  But he said the lack of funding means the organization’s health  programs are hanging by a thread. The International Rescue Committee, an aid group, said Yemen is  conducting just 31 tests per one million people, among the world’s  lowest scores. With increasing needs and fewer funds, the U.N. refugee agency will  have to stop cash assistance and shelter programs for more than 50,000  displaced families by August, said spokeswoman Heba Kanso. She said the  agency will be forced to end its partnership with dozens of Yemeni NGOs  that will have let go more than 1,500 national staff. Relief agencies worry that donors will give less as many countries  struggle their own virus outbreaks. But they warn that the world’s worst  humanitarian crisis can indeed get much worse. “The world’s attention is diverted elsewhere and these are the  vulnerable among the most vulnerable on the planet, and we need a  commitment,” said Brennan.

ROME (AP) — The first day of June saw coronavirus restrictions ease  from Asia to Europe on Monday, even as U.S. protests against police  brutality sparked fears of new outbreaks. The Colosseum opened its  ancient doors in Rome, ferries restarted in Bangladesh, golfers played  in Greece, students returned in Britain and Dutch bars and restaurants  were free to welcome hungry, thirsty patrons. Countries around the Mediterranean Sea began tentatively to kickoff a  summer season in which tourists could bask in their famously sunny  beaches while still being protected by social distancing measures from a  virus that is marching relentlessly around the world. “We are reopening a symbol. A symbol of Rome, a symbol for Italy,”  said Alfonsina Russo, director of the Colosseum’s archaeological park.  “(We are) restarting in a positive way, with a different pace, with a  more sustainable tourism, compatible with our cities.” TOP STORIES

                               Greece lifted lockdown measures Monday for hotels, campsites,  open-air cinemas, golf courses and public swimming pools, while beaches  and museums reopened in Turkey and bars, restaurants, cinemas and  museums came back to life in the Netherlands. A long line of masked visitors snaked outside the Vatican Museums,  which include the Sistine Chapel, as they reopened for the first time in  three months. Italy is eager to reboot its tourism industry, which  accounts for 13% of its economy. The Vatican Museums’ famous keyholder - the “clavigero” who holds the  keys to all the galleries on a big ring on his wrist - opened the gate  in a sign both symbolic and literal that the Museums were back in  business. Still, strict crowd control measures were in place at both the  Vatican and the Colosseum: visitors needed reservations to visit the  landmarks, their temperatures were taken before entering and wearing a  mask was mandatory. The Dutch relaxation of coronavirus rules took place on a major  public holiday with the sun blazing, raising immediate fears of  overcrowding in popular beach resorts like Scheveningen, near The Hague.  The new rules let bars and restaurants serve up to 30 people inside if  they keep social distancing, but there’s no standing at bars and  reservations are necessary. Britain, which with over 38,500 dead has the world’s second-worst  death toll behind the United States, eased restrictions despite warnings  from health officials that the risk of spreading COVID-19 was still too  great. Some elementary classes reopened in England and people could now have  limited contact with family and friends, but only outdoors and with  social distancing. In Asia, Bangladesh restarted bus, train, ferry and flight services  Monday, hoping that a gradual reopening revives an economy in which  millions have become jobless. Traffic jams and crowds of commuters  clogged Manila, as the Philippine capital embraced a high-stakes gamble  to kickstart the economy. Around 6.18 million infections have been reported worldwide, with  over 372,000 people dying, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins  University. The true death toll is believed to be significantly higher,  since many victims died without ever being tested. In the U.S., the often-violent protests over the death of George  Floyd, a black man pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police  officer, are raising fears of new virus outbreaks in a country that has  more confirmed infections and deaths than any other. Protests over Floyd’s death have shaken the U.S. from New York to Los  Angeles. Demonstrators are packed cheek by jowl, many without masks,  many chanting, shouting or singing. The virus is dispersed by  microscopic droplets in the air when people cough, sneeze, talk or sing. “There’s no question that when you put hundreds or thousands of  people together in close proximity, when we have got this virus all over  the streets … it’s not healthy,” Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said. The U.S. has seen more than 1.7 million infections and over 104,000  deaths in the pandemic, which has disproportionately affected racial  minorities in a nation that does not have universal health care. South Korea and India offered cautionary tales Monday about just how hard it is to halt the virus. South Korea reported a steady rise in cases around the capital after  getting praise earlier from around the world for appearing to bring its  outbreak under control. Hundreds of infections have been linked to  nightspots, restaurants and a massive e-commerce warehouse near Seoul,  the capital. The 35 new cases reported Monday include 30 around Seoul,  and the resurgence is straining the country’s ability to test patients  and trace their contacts. “We have been seeing an increased number of high-risk patients who  have been infected through family members or religious gatherings,” said  Jeong Eun-kyeong, director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention. “There’s a particular need for people over 65, pregnant  women and those with chronic medical conditions to be alert.” Incheon, a port city west of Seoul, on Monday said it’s considering  banning gatherings at 4,200 churches and other religious facilities. In India, cases increased rapidly even as it eased restrictions  Monday on shops and public transport in more states. Subways and schools  remain closed and experts said India is still far from reaching the  peak of its outbreak. The government was easing the lockdown to help  millions of day laborers who have lost their jobs and are unable to feed  their families. China, where the global pandemic is believed to have originated late  last year, reported 16 new cases on Monday, all travelers from abroad.  With local transmissions having fallen to virtually zero, much of China  has reopened for business and Monday saw the further restart of classes  in middle and high schools. Kindergartners and fourth- and fifth-graders  will be allowed back next week. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa says China has pledged to  make available 30 million COVID-19 testing kits per month to African  countries, which are facing a shortage. The U.S. has sent Brazil more than 2 million doses of a malaria drug  touted by President Donald Trump as potential treatment for coronavirus,  despite a scientific study that shows it can actually harm patients.  Brazil is Latin America’s hardest-hit nation in the pandemic, with  nearly 515,000 confirmed cases, second only to the U.S. Japan, meanwhile, started blood tests Monday in three areas including  Tokyo to check to what percentage of its people have developed  antibodies, a sign of past coronavirus infections. The tests will be  conducted on 10,000 randomly selected people over 20 years old and  results are expected at the end of the month. ___ Gorondi reported from Budapest and Kennedy reported from Miami.

NEW YORK (AP) — Protests erupting across the nation over the past  week - and law enforcement’s response to them - are threatening to upend  efforts by health officials to track and contain the spread of  coronavirus  just as those efforts were finally getting underway. Health experts need newly infected people to remember and recount  everyone they’ve interacted with over several days in order to alert  others who may have been exposed, and prevent them from spreading the  disease further. But that process, known as contact tracing, relies on  people knowing who they’ve been in contact with — a daunting task if  they’ve been to a mass gathering. And the process relies on something that may suddenly be in especially short supply: Trust in government. TOP STORIES

                               “These events that are happening now are further threats to the trust  we need,” said Dr. Sandro Galea, dean of the Boston University School  of Public Health. “If we do not have that, I worry our capacity to  control new outbreaks becomes more limited,” he said. Government officials have been hoping to continue reopening  businesses, churches and other organizations after months of  stay-at-home orders and other infection-prevention measures. But health  experts also hoped that any reopening would be accompanied by widespread  testing, contact tracing and isolation to prevent new waves of illness  from beginning. Over the past week, protests sparked by the death of George Floyd, a  black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pinned a  knee to his neck, have involved thousands of people gathered tightly  together in large crowds in more than 20 cities nationwide. It’s unclear if the protests themselves will trigger large new  outbreaks. The protests were outside, where infections don’t spread as  readily as indoors. Also, many of the protesters were wearing masks, and  much of the contact was likely less-hazardous “transient” moments of  people moving around, passing each other, said Dr. William Schaffner, an  infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University. But, still, experts worry that public efforts to contain the disease in the future could be undermined. In Los Angeles, the city’s mayor announced Saturday that COVID-19  testing centers were being closed because of safety concerns related to  violent protests. Testing in Minneapolis will be affected because some  of the clinics that provide the service have been damaged in the  protests, according to a city government spokesperson. Reduced testing could “be giving the virus another head start,” Schaffner said. And contract tracing, which is only just getting going in several  states, is an even bigger concern. It involves people who work for or  with health departments asking intimate questions about where a person  has been and who they’ve been talking to - and getting full, truthful  answers in return. “In this current environment which has enhanced or brought forth a  mistrust of governmental authority, it might make them disinclined to  speak with anyone in government,” Schaffner said. That is especially true in black communities trying to cope with  episodes of police violence and longstanding frustrations with how they  have been marginalized and mistreated by people who work for government  agencies. And those are the communities that have been hardest hit by  the coronavirus in the U.S. and most in need of public health measures  to help control it. In a press conference Saturday, Minnesota Public Safety Commissioner  John Harrington used the term “contact tracing” when describing an  investigation into arrested protesters there. He said the goal is to  “see if there are crime or white supremacy organizations that have  played a role” and “to understand how do we go after them, legally,”  Harrington said. But Harrington’s use of “contact tracing” by law enforcement may  complicate the job of health workers as they try to track the virus’s  spread, some experts said. “That was an abuse of the word ‘contact tracing.’ That is not what  contact tracing is,” said Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the  federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Contact tracing is a service to patients and their contacts to  provide services for patients and warning for contacts. It has nothing  to do with police activity. Nothing,” said Frieden, who is currently  president of Resolve to Save Lives, a nonprofit that works to prevent  epidemics. Galea said he hopes many people will separate in their minds the  contact tracing done by public health workers from crime investigations  by the police. But, he added, “I do think sometimes it’s difficult to  make a distinction when you feel marginalized by, and targeted by, the  entire government.” ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support  from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science  Education.

The Justice Department has added its support to a federal lawsuit challenging Maine Gov. Janet Mills‘ banning out-of-state residents from using state campgrounds during phase one of its reopening plan. The owners of two campgrounds and two restaurants in Maine filed a federal lawsuit against Ms. Mills, saying her reopening plan unconstitutionally violates people’s right to travel from state to state. Ms. Mills has ordered out-of-state residents coming to Maine to quarantine for 14 days before renting space at a campground or RV park.

                               She has also only allowed Maine residents to use the campgrounds until June 1. The plaintiffs say the order has hurt their businesses and is discriminatory because it treats Maine residents more favorably than nonresidents. Siding with the plaintiffs, the Justice Department said the order infringes upon Americans’ right to travel throughout the country. “Here, Maine likely has transgressed the Constitution’s limits by discriminating between Maine residents and out-of-state residents with respect to the ability to patronize campgrounds and RV parks within the state,” attorneys with the Department’s Civil Rights Division wrote Friday. Ms. Mills defended the restrictions, saying they are necessary to protect residents’ health. She also slammed the Justice Department for bringing the lawsuit. “I am deeply disappointed — and frankly disgusted — that the U.S. Department of Justice is making a concerted effort to undermine the health of the people of Maine — objections they never raised when the president and his own task force took steps to limit travel. It seems to me that their only actual ‘interest’ here is, at best, political or, at worst, to harm Mainers, not defend them,” she said in a statement. The businesses — Bayley’s Camping Resort, the Little River Bar & Grille and the Seaside Square Cafe, all in Scarborough, and the Little Ossipee Campground in Waterboro — say the order has hurt their business. Canceled reservations have cost the Little Ossipee Campground over $90,000 and Bayley’s Campground has received over 700 canceled reservations, refunded over $150,000 in reservation fees and lost over $26,000 in revenue, according to the lawsuit. The Justice Department said the losses could have been avoided and Ms. Mills hasn’t offered a good reason for why she’s banned non-Maine residents from campgrounds. “It is not obvious why a 14-day self-quarantine in a New Hampshire home, for instance, is any less effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19 than undergoing the same isolation in a house in Maine,” the department said. “Put simply, the mere fact that a traveler has recently been outside Maine is not a good proxy for the risk that he will spread COVID-19.” Maine Attorney General Aaron M. Frey also rebutted the Justice Department, saying the reopening plan is lawful and necessary. “The Executive Orders and the Restarting Plan at issue in this lawsuit were carefully crafted and have been reviewed and updated in order to protect Mainers’ health during the COVID-19 pandemic,” he said in a statement. “Specifically, the requirement for individuals traveling into Maine from out of state to self-quarantine for 14 days (with exemptions for essential workers) was examined by my office, which determined it was a lawful requirement consistent with Maine’s public health challenges.”

The U.S. and the World Health Organization do not agree on two major virus blockers — masks and social distance — resulting in inconsistent public advice on how to prevent COVID-19 infections. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a set policy on its website: “Stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arms’ length) from other people.” But WHO’s Dr. Michael Ryan, who directs its health emergency program, recommends about half that space — at least 1 meter, or a little over 3 feet, allowing people to mingle closer together.

                               “Our recommendations are 1 meter or more distance between individuals,” Dr. Ryan said at a press conference last week at WHO’s Geneva headquarters. “We recently had a systemic review that’s been conducted to look at influence, influence-like illness, coronavirus and COVID-19 which has found a strong protective effect of a distance of 1 meter or more so that’s important.” The CDC also splits with WHO on masks worn to block viruses expelled in sneezes, coughs and speech. In March, the CDC recommended coverings only for sick people and those caring for them. But in early April, it reversed course after studies showed that infected people without symptoms could spread the germ. “Everyone should wear a cloth face cover when they have to go out in public, for example to the grocery store or to pick up other necessities … The cloth face cover is meant to protect other people in case you are infected,” the CDC says. “Keep the covering on your face the entire time you’re in public,” the CDC adds in a recommendation that seems to require wearing a mask while taking a walk or sitting in a park. On this issue, there is wide disagreement among health professions, including WHO and the CDC. WHO’s Dr. Ryan still rejects public mask-wearing. “There is no specific evidence to suggest that the wearing of masks by the mass population has any potential benefit,” he said March 30. “In fact, there’s some evidence to suggest the opposite in the misuse of wearing a mask property and fitting it properly.” He reiterated last week that mask-wearing is for the infected and people treating them. “If someone is ill, as you know, we recommend the use of medical masks in that context or/and for people who are caring for somebody who is ill,” Dr. Ryan said. And WHO’s website says, “If you are healthy, you only need to wear a mask if you are taking care of a person with COVID-19.” A number of esteemed American medical experts took this exact view at one point. In early March, as the pandemic spread in America, Dr. Anthony Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on CBS’s “60 Minutes”: “The masks are important for someone who is infected to prevent them from infecting someone else. Now when you see people and look at the films in China and South Korea, where everyone is wearing a mask, right now in the United States people should not be walking around with masks. Right now there is no reason to be walking around with a mask. When you’re in the middle of an outbreak wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better and it might even block a droplet but it’s not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is. And often there are unintended consequences. People keep fiddling with the mask, and they keep touching their face. When you think ‘mask,’ you should think of health care providers needing them and people who are ill.” Today, Dr. Fauci wears a mask in public. “I want to protect myself and protect others, and also because I want to make it be a symbol for people to see that that’s the kind of thing you should be doing,” he told CNN last week. “When I walk around the street in the neighborhood I live in Washington, D.C., which still has a considerable number of infections, it’s very clear that many people are doing that.” U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams was also not a mask proponent in March. “It’s important to understand that we are looking at the data every single day and we make the best recommendations to the American people we can based on what we know,” Dr. Adams said. “What the World Health Organization and the CDC have reaffirmed in the last few days is that they do not recommend the general public wear masks.” “If you have a mask and it makes you feel better, then by all means wear it, but know that the more you touch your face the more you put yourself at risk and know that right now the data isn’t quite there to say that there is a net benefit to the individual of wearing a mask,” he said. Earlier on Twitter, he said: “They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus, but if healthcare providers can’t get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk!” A referee in this disagreement is The New England Journal of Medicine. An article in early April by five physicians cast masks as generally useless when worn outside. “We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection,” the article said. “Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes). The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal. In many cases, the desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic.” The CDC and WHO also seem apart on quarantines and isolation. In late March, Dr. Ryan backed the idea of removing family members from their homes if they test positive. South Korea, for example, imposed this protocol. “What we have seen from a number of countries now is that this virus can be controlled,” Dr. Ryan said. “What we have seen is that through the aggressive measures of case finding, testing those cases, isolating those cases, caring for them depending on the severity they have, making sure they have adequate care, they don’t progress to severe disease if that’s possible, to find all of their contacts, to follow them for 14 days. If you quarantine your contacts, so remove them from the family home or remove them from the community so that they don’t have the possibility to transmit to other people.” The U.S. does not impose family separations. The CDC recommends: “In the home, anyone sick or infected should separate themselves from others by staying in a specific ‘sick room’ or area and using a separate bathroom (if available).” On lock-downs, Dr. Fauci endorsed a one-size-fits-all for the entire country. Asked on CNN in April if America needs a national lock-down, Dr. Fauci said, “I think so. I don’t understand why that’s not happening.” “The tension between ‘federal mandated’ versus ‘states’ rights’ to do what they want is something that I don’t want to get into,” Dr. Fauci said. “But if you look at what’s going on in this country, I just don’t understand why we’re not doing that. We really should be.” Dr. Ryan expresses opposition. “We have to find a balanced strategy that manages the risks of the disease against the risks to life and livelihood and that’s something we’ve said since the beginning,” he said. “We’ve been very, very clear. A comprehensive strategy is not a comprehensive lock-down. A comprehensive strategy is a strategy of surveillance, finding cases, testing, isolating, using quarantine.”

WASHINGTON — The U.S. has sent to Brazil more than 2 million doses of a malaria drug touted by President Donald Trump as potentially protecting against and treating the coronavirus, even though scientific evidence has not backed up those uses. No large, rigorous scientific studies have found the drug, hydroxychloroquine, safe or effective for preventing or treating COVID-19, and some smaller studies have indicated worse outcomes from those taking the drug. Brazil, now Latin America’s hardest-hit country, continues to see a surge in virus cases, and last week Trump announced that the U.S. was restricting travel from the country to prevent travelers from spreading the virus in the U.S. TOP STORIES

                               In a joint statement with the Brazilian government on Sunday, the White House said the doses of hydroxychloroquine had been sent to Brazil as a prophylactic for front-line health workers and as a therapeutic for those who may come down with the virus. The White House said it was also delivering 1,000 ventilators to Brazil. Trump revealed in May that he took a two-week course of the drug to protect against the coronavirus, despite warnings from his own government that it should only be administered for COVID-19 in a hospital or research setting due to potentially fatal side effects. Trump’s announcement that he was taking the drug was criticized by medical experts who warned that his actions could encourage others to take the drug outside of a medical setting. Trump said he decided to take hydroxychloroquine after two White House staffers tested positive for the disease.

Bucharest is more than 5,500 miles from Tuscaloosa, Alabama, but even in a locked-down world a team of Romanian medical specialists was able to make an unlikely journey to lend a hand in the battle against COVID-19. The State Partnership Program, run by the Department of Defense and several states, was designed to help former communist countries such as Romania build stable and democratic militaries when it began more than 30 years ago. Now Romania and other Eastern European countries once under the thumb of the Soviet Union are returning the favor. TOP STORIES

                               “The bond between my home nation of Romania and the U.S. state of Alabama has grown into one of enduring strength and readiness,” said Romanian Army Col. Jan-Florin Ganea. The Romanian military has been partnering with the Alabama National Guard since 1993. They have trained together in the U.S. and in Europe over the years. The Alabama Guard and Romanian military units have both served in Iraq. Today, more than a dozen Romanian army physicians, nurses and nuclear-biological-chemical specialists are crisscrossing the state from Huntsville to Birmingham to provide much-needed medical reinforcements for hospitals, nursing homes and long-term care facilities. Working alongside local medical counterparts, the Romanians are sharing what they have learned battling COVID-19 in other countries in Europe. They expect to be working in Alabama until mid-June. Army Maj. Gen. Sheryl E. Gordon, commander of the Alabama National Guard, said she is always happy when Romanian partners come to the state. But this visit is even more special because of the help they can offer in a time of stress. “We oftentimes focus on the military aspect of our partnership,” Gen. Gordon said. “This visit gives us an opportunity to focus on the many other benefits of our vital partnership with Romania.” It’s important for family, friends and allies to join together to fight a common enemy like the coronavirus, Col. Ganea said, “and that’s exactly what this mission represents.” Air Force Brig. Gen. Jessica Meyeraan, deputy director of security cooperation at U.S. European Command headquarters, said other nations also have stepped up to provide a hand to the U.S. in this “unprecedented moment in history.” The U.S. has the world’s largest reported caseload of COVID-19. Lessons learned Alabama officials over the weekend reported that the state had recorded more than 17,000 COVID-19 cases and more than 600 deaths. Infection numbers are still rising in major population centers such as Birmingham, Mobile and Tuscaloosa. Despite early fears by global health experts, many of the nations of Eastern Europe have reported low infection rates compared with other regions. “Romania’s desire to connect with Alabama and share critical insights gained during their own COVID-19 experiences exemplifies the underpinning mentality of the partnership program. We are stronger together, and together we can beat COVID-19,” said Gen. Meyeraan. The same partnership that brought the Romanian medical team to Alabama sent a group of Polish army doctors, nurses and health care professionals to Illinois on a COVID-19 relief mission last month. Air Force Brig. Gen. Richard Neely, the adjutant general of the Illinois National Guard, said he was deeply moved by the Polish military medics who shared their hard-won knowledge of tactics against COVID-19. Illinois National Guard soldiers and army troops from Poland have fought together in Afghanistan and Iraq under the partnership, Gen. Neely noted. “We have fought side by side for many years, and now we fight this pandemic together,” he said. The Polish doctors and other medical specialists were from the Military Institute of Medicine in Warsaw. Before the Chicago mission, they provided medical help to the Lombardy region in Italy, which had one of the deadliest outbreaks of COVID-19 anywhere in the world. The head of the Polish military medical staff said the situation in Chicago has turned out better than in Italy, where health care workers were overwhelmed. “Here we didn’t have a collapse of the administration of the medical services,” Dr. Jacek Siewiera said. The Polish contingent worked at several clinics in Chicago, including the Army Corps of Engineers-built field hospital at the McCormick Place Convention Center. The Polish medical staff also took part in web-based conferences with health care workers in other parts of Illinois. “We are amazed at how it was done by the National Guard [in the McCormick Center] and how it was done at Cook County emergency medical center,” Dr. Siewiera said. “We are amazed how they are using data to support the decision-making process. It should look like this all the time.”

White House National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien defended President Trump’s decision to pull some $450 million of U.S. annual funding from the World Health Organization, but also vowed the “same amount of money” will instead be channeled to other health-based humanitarian operations around the world. In an interview on CNN, Mr. O’Brien said the decision to reroute the money is warranted because the WHO has badly fumbled in the COVID-19 era by willingly helping China cover up responsibility for the global pandemic. “We’re going to take that same money and make sure it gets to the Doctors Without Borders and the Red Cross and the hospitals all over the world that need it, and doesn’t go through a corrupt international organization that’s controlled by the Chinese Communist Party,” the national security advisor said. “That’s for sure.” TOP STORIES

                               It was not immediately clear whether Mr. O’Brien was referring to a specific administration plan for rerouting the funding or speaking only in broad terms. By mentioning the Red Cross, he may have been referring to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), although the administration has so far not said whether it will increase the roughly $400 million in annual funding the United States government presently gives the organization — the leading international outfit for humanitarian assistance for people in nearly every one of the world’s various conflict zone. A bigger question surrounds Mr. O’Brien’s mention of Doctors Without Borders, also known by its name in French, Médecins sans Frontières (MSF). While U.S. corporations and private individuals are known to donate to Doctors Without Borders, the entity operates as a nonprofit organization and is notorious for refusing money from governments — including the U.S. government — in order to avoid even the appearance of political conflicts. After Mr. O’Brien made similar comments earlier in May, Doctors Without Borders sought to clarify that it would not be a good target for any rerouted U.S. government funds. “More than 90 percent of our funding comes from private donors. Our operations are carried out based solely on medical need and are devoid of any political, military or other agenda,” it said in a statement, according to Roll Call. “The World Health Organization serves a unique role through its mandate to act as a coordinating authority for global health issues. No other entity, including MSF, is mandated to serve this purpose.” CNN did not ask Mr. O’Brien about the issue in Sunday’s interview, during which the national security advisor also said the Trump administration intends to take the nearly $450 million that the U.S. would have given to the WHO — a figure he stressed is far greater than the some $40 million China gives the WHO annually — and instead “make sure it gets to front-line health care workers, just like we’re doing with PEPFAR in Africa.” He was referring to the President’s Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief, an organization that was created by the George W. Bush administration in 2003 to battle AIDS and HIV in Africa, and that the U.S. government has already channeled nearly $100 billion toward over the past 17 years. “We’re not doing it through the WHO,” Mr. O’Brien said. “We’re doing it as the United States of America.” He suggest the very creation of PEPFAR by the Bush administration was driven at least in part by past WHO failures to respond to the AIDS crisis. “They have bungled things going all the way back to AIDS/HIV in Africa,” Mr. O’Brien said. “That’s why the United States has spent over the past 20 years $142 billion on public health, especially the PEPFAR program that’s literally saving the lives, with antiretroviral drugs, of millions of people in Africa.” “The WHO isn’t saving lives for — for AIDS and HIV victims in Africa,” he added. “It’s the United States and our generous taxpayers who are saving those lives in Africa.”

The D.C. Department of Health paused the District’s count of decreased days of community spread to review a potential new peak in cases. “The District’s count in days of community spread decline has paused at 17 days while the data is under review to determine if a new peak in cases has occurred,” said a statement from the health department in a press release on Sunday. Health officials are measuring community transmission by looking at the date of symptom onset instead of the number of new cases that are confirmed daily.

                               There were just under 100 cases of community transmission reported on what would have been the District’s 17th day of decrease in community transmission. Since the 14th day of decrease in community transmission, which was required for the District to enter phase one, the number of cases via community transmission were between 40 and 60 new cases, according to a graph released by DOH.

Russia has extended the residence permit of former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden due to the ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic, state media reported Saturday. TASS, a news agency owned by the Russian government, reported that Mr. Snowden’s residence permit was automatically extended until June 15 because of “anti-coronavirus measures.” Mr. Snowden, 36, has lived in Russia since June 2013 while on the lam from authorities in the U.S., where he remains wanted on criminal charges stemming from his admitted role in leaking material to the media about the government’s domestic and foreign surveillance operations.

                               He had been living in Russia under a residence permit that was set to expire on April 30 but continues to remain valid as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, TASS reported. “Later, a decision will be made about whether it should be extended by three more years upon Snowden’s request and in line with the current legislation,” TASS cited an unnamed law enforcement source as saying. Mr. Snowden faces up to 30 years in prison if put on trial in the U.S. and convicted on all three criminal counts he currently faces, including violations of the Espionage Act and theft of government property. President Trump, on his part, previously called Mr. Snowden a “traitor” and has suggested he be executed. Millions of cases of COVID-19, the potentially deadly disease caused by the coronavirus, has been documented worldwide since it was discovered late last year in Wuhan, China. More than 396,000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in Russia, according to Johns Hopkins University, putting it behind only the U.S. and Brazil in terms of the countries with the most known coronavirus cases.

Monkeys stole blood samples from a laboratory in India that had been taken from people undergoing treatment for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, international media reported Friday. The incident happened earlier this week on the campus of the state-run medical college in Meerut, near Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh state, Reuters reported. A troop of monkeys attacked a lab technician, stole the samples and fled , Reuters reported, citing Dr. S. K. Garg, a top official at the college.

                               “Monkeys grabbed and fled with the blood samples of four COVID-19 patients who are undergoing treatment … we had to take their blood samples again,”  he said, Reuters reported. “These were not COVID test samples, but blood samples from COVID patients meant for routine tests,” the doctor specified, according to India’s NDTV. More than 173,000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in India, one of the world’s most populous country, since health officials first learned of the disease late last year. The World Health Organization has previously said that COVID-19 likely circulated among bats prior to spreading to an intermediary host animal and then humans. Dr. Garg noted that it is not clear yet of monkeys can become infected with COVID-19, however, Reuters noted. “No evidence has been found that monkeys can contract the infection,” he said, according to the news agency.

A group of thirty countries from around the world kicked off a joint initiative Friday aimed at sharing medicines, vaccines, and data to help combat the coronavirus pandemic. Led by Costa Rica, the group’s goal is to provide a “one-stop-shop” for the developing nations to access scientific information and intellectual property related to COVID-19, Reuters reported. “Vaccines, tests, diagnostics, treatments and other key tools in the coronavirus response must be made universally available as global public goods,” said Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado.

                               The World Health Organization praised the group’s establishment, and called on the international community to voluntarily pool knowledge related to COVID-19. “Shared knowledge, intellectual property and data will leverage our collective efforts to advance scientific discovery, technology development and broad sharing of the benefits of scientific advancement and its applications based on the right to health,” the WHO said. Since the beginning of the outbreak, countries around the world have called for a joint response and information sharing as nations have struggled to combat the spread of the virus, but many western nations have remained independent in the race to develop a widely accessible vaccine. The group, dubbed the “COVID-19 Technology Access Pool,” has received praise from organizations including Doctors Without Borders, it has been questioned by the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations, which claims the premise of the group could compromise intellectual property protections. “By urging licenses or non-enforcement declarations for COVID-19 treatments and vaccines to be granted on a non-exclusive global basis, the Solidarity Call to Action promotes a one-size-fits-all model that disregards the specific circumstances of each situation, each product and each country,” the IFPMA said in a statement Friday. “Different regions and countries will face different challenges regarding the manufacture and distribution of COVID-19 treatments and vaccines. Any access tools, including patent licensing mechanisms, should therefore allow for customized solutions to real-world problems that may arise,” they continued. The countries involved in the pact include Argentina, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belgium, Belize, Bhutan, Brazil, Chile, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Honduras, Indonesia, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Maldives, Mexico, Mongolia, Mozambique, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Palau, Panama, Peru, Portugal, Saint Vincent and Grenadines, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Sudan, The Netherlands, Timor-Leste, Uruguay, Zimbabwe.

Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania said Friday he tested positive for antibodies to the coronavirus and will donate his blood plasma in a bid to help those who develop a severe case. Mr. Casey, a Democrat, said he decided to get tested for antibodies after consulting with the Capitol’s attending physician, Brian Monahan. “The results of this test revealed substantial levels of COVID-19 antibody in my blood, significantly more than the amount required to qualify me as a plasma donor,” he said.

                               Mr. Casey said he will make his first donation Friday in Taylor, Pennsylvania.The senator said he can point to when he might have had the virus. He experienced a low-grade fever and mild flu-like symptoms earlier this spring and quarantined for two weeks at home in Scranton. His wife wasn’t home during his quarantine, he said, because she was with their eldest daughter and son-in-law, who were expecting their first child. “In consultation with my doctor, I chose not to seek medical care because my symptoms were relatively mild and manageable,” Mr. Casey said. “My fever went away on its own by mid-April, and it was never recommended that I be tested for the virus. I was able to work during my illness, remotely engaging with constituents and staff and keeping a full schedule.” Mr. Casey is the second U.S. senator to report antibodies to the virus. Sen. Tim Kaine, Virginia Democrat, on Thursday said he and his wife tested positive for them after experiencing symptoms in March. Both senators took what’s often known as a “serological” test, which checks for evidence of an immune response after a previous infection. The antibodies should provide some protection against future infection, though the coronavirus is newly discovered in humans and experts are still studying the issue. President Trump frequently lauds the number of COVID-19 survivors who’ve opted to donate their plasma to help others, saying it’s often the first thing they bring up after recovering.

PARIS (AP) — Europe’s extensive social welfare net is showing signs  of fraying under economic strain from the coronavirus, as protests  erupted for a second day in Spain Friday against layoffs by French  carmaker Renault, while Italy’s chief central banker warned that  “uncertainty is rife.” Further afield, while New Zealand had all but eradicated the  coronavirus with just one person in the nation of 5 million known to be  still infected, developments elsewhere were generally grim. India  reported another record increase in cases and Pakistan a record number  of deaths. As cases steadily rise across Africa, too, officials who are losing  the global race for equipment and drugs are scrambling for homegrown  solutions.

                               In the first major increase since it started gradually reopening May  11, France reported more than 3,000 new daily virus infections. It was  not immediately clear if the spike was due to a greater availability of  testing. In the U.S., the virus threw more than 2 million people out of work  last week despite the gradual reopening of businesses, stoking fears it  is doing deep and potentially long-lasting damage to the world’s largest  economy. The latest job-loss figures from the U.S. Labor Department bring to  41 million the running total of Americans who have filed for  unemployment benefits since the coronavirus shutdowns took hold in  mid-March. Strong safety-net programs in many European countries are  underwriting the wages of millions of workers and keeping them on the  payroll instead of adding them to the ranks of the unemployed. But the  limits are starting to show. In Britain, Treasury chief Rishi Sunak is expected to tell employers  that starting in August, they’ll have to share the costs of a program  that has effectively placed furloughed workers on the government  payroll. Sunak says the government can’t pay indefinitely for a program that  has cost 15 billion pounds ($18.4 billion) to cover 80% of wages of some  8.5 million people. It is in place until October, although the final  months will require employer input. Even as it seeks a government loan from France, struggling carmaker  Renault announced 15,000 job cuts worldwide as part of a 2 billion-euro  cost-cutting plan over three years, as demand for cars has plunged  around the globe. Renault said nearly 4,600 jobs will be cut in France and more than 10,000 in the rest of the world. That had a knock-on effect in Spain, where Nissan is rolling back  production in a move Madrid said would mean 3,000 direct job cuts and  risks as many as 20,000 additional jobs in the supply chain. Spanish workers took to the streets for a second day to protest the  closure of three Barcelona plants. Hundreds of workers have surrounded  at least four of Nissan’s car dealerships in or around the northeastern  city, covering their windows with leaflets reading “Nissan betrays  25,000 families” and “We will keep fighting” among others. The governor of the Bank of Italy, Ignazio Visco, in his annual  address, said Europe’s fourth-largest economy could contract by as much  as 13% this year under a pessimistic scenario that foresees a  “magnitude” drop in world trade and an intense deterioration of  financial conditions. “Today uncertainty is rife, not only about the course of the pandemic  but also about the repercussions on behavioural patterns, on  consumption and on investment decisions,” Visco said, adding that “after  the pandemic wanes, the world will be a different place.” How different will depend on how leaders manage falling employment,  lower consumption and the prospect of social unrest, he said. In New Zealand, health authorities have not found any new virus cases  for a week. Of the 1,504 people who were infected, 22 have died but all  but one of the rest have now recovered. The nation’s borders remain  closed, and staying virus-free when they eventually reopen poses a big  challenge. India registered another record daily increase of 7,466 cases just  before its two-month lockdown ends Sunday. The government’s new  guidelines expected this weekend may extend the lockdown in the  worst-hit areas while easing the rules to promote economic activity  elsewhere. Most cases in India are concentrated around its largest cities,  including Mumbai and New Delhi, but cases have been increasing in some  of the poorest eastern states as migrant workers who lost jobs in the  cities return to their native villages. Pakistan on Friday reported 57 deaths, its highest single-day  increase since the outbreak began. That increased the overall death toll  to more than 1,300 while the number of confirmed cases rose to over  64,000. In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte decided to ease a  lockdown in the capital to a more relaxed quarantine on Monday after  more than two months of strictures enforced by the police and military.  Infections spiked in Manila recently, and Duterte warned that the  pandemic is not over. South Africa says it has a backlog of nearly 100,000 unprocessed  tests for the coronavirus, a striking example of the painful shortage of  testing kits and reagents across Africa as cases steadily rise. The widespread shortages, especially in testing materials, have  jolted African authorities into facing uncomfortable truths: Richer  countries are elbowing them out and they need homegrown solutions to the  shortages. “We have to have Made in Africa products,” the director of the Africa  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, John Nkengasong, told  reporters Thursday. “We cannot keep importing basic things.” In the U.S., where the death toll is the highest in the world and has  surpassed 101,000, there were some encouraging signs in the economic  data. The overall number of Americans currently drawing jobless benefits  dropped for the first time since the crisis began, from 25 million to 21  million. And first-time applications for unemployment benefits have  fallen for eight straight weeks as states gradually let stores,  restaurants and other businesses reopen and the auto industry starts up  factories again. But the number of U.S. workers filing for unemployment benefits is  still extraordinarily high by historical standards, and that suggests  businesses are failing or permanently downsizing, not just laying off  people until the crisis can pass, economists warn. “That is the kind of economic destruction you cannot quickly put back  in the bottle,” said Adam Ozimek, chief economist at Upwork. The U.S. unemployment rate was 14.7% in April, a level not seen since  the Depression, and many economists expect it will be near 20% in May. Worldwide, the virus has infected more than 5.8 million people and  killed about 360,000, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.  The true dimensions of the disaster are widely believed to be  significantly greater, with experts saying many victims died without  ever being tested. ___ Barry contributed from Soave, Italy, and Perry from Wellington, New  Zealand.

PARRIS ISLAND, S.C. (AP) — The booming shouts of the rain-soaked  Marine recruits echo across Leatherneck Square training field, barely  muffled by their masks. And as they jog by, belting out responses to  drill instructors in a rhythmic cadence, the white fabric across their  faces is the only telltale sign of the coronavirus’ effects on their  quest to become Marines. But in ways big and small, the virus is impacting training at the  Marine Corps‘ Parris Island Recruit Depot and across the military. And  defense leaders say some of the adjustments are proving beneficial and  could become permanent. Maj. Gen. James Glynn, commander of Parris Island, said requiring  recruits to spend two weeks in quarantine before their training has had  unexpected benefits.

                               “They are singularly focused on two weeks of mental and emotional  prep for what you guys are seeing today,” he said during a visit  Wednesday by Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper. “I think it’s pretty evident  it’s making a difference. They’re mentally focused and have reconciled  why they’re here.” Until this week, recruits spent the two-week quarantine in a complex  of large white tents and bathroom and shower trailers that was quickly  built on the base to allow health monitoring and keep them isolated. But  now recruits are spending the two weeks in dorms at the Citadel, the  Marine college in Charleston, about a two-hour drive north. Esper, who toured the tent area with Glynn, said the new precautions —  including masks, social distancing and the quarantine — have greatly  lowered the amount of other respiratory illnesses recruits traditionally  get. “They’ve seen a much lower sick call right across the board when it  comes to infection, so they’re going to keep that. And we’re going to  keep some other practices,” said Esper, adding that by breaking the  recruits into smaller groups, “they’ve seen a higher level of unity and  esprit. And they bonded much more quickly.” As Esper walked around the soggy field, recruits were going through  what Marines call the “confidence course.” They were clambering over  large log obstacles, climbing towers, shimmying across rope lines strung  over a net, and swinging over streams of water. In other sections,  recruits were paired off to battle with pugil sticks, which replicates  rifle and bayonet combat. Staff Sgt. Katheryn Hunter, a drill instructor for three years at  Parris Island, said the main difference she sees due to the virus is  that the number of female recruits she has in 4th Battalion, Oscar  Company, has dropped to 70. And she has 35 recruits in squad bays that  usually hold up to 64. During the initial portion of training, women, who have their own  battalion, are largely separated from men. Marine Corps leaders  staunchly defend the segregation, saying it helps build confidence, but  some members of Congress have demanded change. On the confidence course, female recruits were together on the  various obstacles, while the male recruits were doing other tests. The course, Hunter said, is critical. “We have a lot of recruits that are scared of heights, recruits that  are scared of water or are scared of different obstacles,” she said,  adding that the course “actually tests recruits’ fears, also builds  their confidence that they can accomplish stuff as long as they set  their minds to it.” In the larger formations, the recruits wore masks, but during some  physical tests - even those where teamwork was required and social  distancing impossible - the masks came off. Most of the drill  instructors wore theirs at all times, as did Esper and his entourage. Commanders noted that the recruits had finished their two-week  quarantine and were on day 14 of their actual training - so they had  been largely isolated for about a month. Marine recruits go to either  Parris Island or to Camp Pendleton in southern California, for 13 weeks  of training. Another change, Esper said, is that military recruits often get to go  home for two weeks after graduation. That leave has been suspended  because of the virus. Instead, the Marines are getting three or four  days of little or no duty before reporting to their next schooling or  station. “They’re showing up at the next phase of training in much better  shape,” said Esper, noting that they haven’t been able to go out  drinking and partying. He said Marine leaders are “seeing a better  product entering the next phase of training, so they’re starting to  think maybe we won’t go back to the 10 days off.” Glynn said the plan to use the Citadel for quarantine was inspired by  his mother-in-law, who sent him an article about how colleges and the  military worked together during the Spanish flu pandemic. But while the  college, with its two-person rooms, is working out well, Glynn said  he’ll need another solution when classes resume. He said they are  reviewing several options, including some nearer Parris Island, but have  not made a decision. The Army has made similar changes in its recruit training, which is a  longer, 22-week course for infantry and armor soldiers. But instead of  separating the incoming recruits at a distant location for the two-week  quarantine, Army leaders changed the course schedule. The new plan shifted classroom learning to the first two weeks, with  many classes done virtually or outside, with little physical  interaction, spaced chairs and social distancing. The recruits then move  into what Army officials described as a training bubble, where they  begin their more traditional physical and combat instruction. Both the Marine Corps and the Army screen recruits for the virus when  they arrive at processing stations, and again when they get to the  training base. Army recruits go to one of the four training centers at  Fort Benning, Georgia; Fort Jackson, South Carolina; Fort Leonard Wood,  Missouri; and Fort Sill, Oklahoma. Defense leaders said they have been intrigued to see some good come from the virus precautions. “I mean, it’s funny,” said Esper, as he flew home from Parris Island,  “Even once coronavirus fades or we have a vaccine, you may come out  with a boot camp that produces a better product because of things  learned.”

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration may soon expel thousands of Chinese graduate students enrolled at U.S. universities and impose other sanctions against Chinese officials in the latest signs of tensions between Washington and Beijing that are raging over trade, the coronavirus pandemic, human rights and the status of Hong Kong. President Donald Trump said he would make an announcement about China on Friday, and administration officials said he is considering a months-old proposal to revoke the visas of students affiliated with educational institutions in China linked to the People’s Liberation Army or Chinese intelligence. Trump is also weighing targeted travel and financial sanctions against Chinese officials for actions in Hong Kong, according to the officials, who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

                               “We’ll be announcing what we’re doing tomorrow with respect to China and we are not happy with China,” Trump told reporters at an unrelated event Thursday, referring mainly to COVID-19. “We are not happy with what’s happened. All over the world people are suffering, 186 countries. All over the world they’re suffering. We’re not happy.” Although the student expulsions aren’t directly related to Hong Kong and China’s move to assert full control over the former British territory, potential sanctions against officials involved in that effort would be a result of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s determination that Hong Kong can no longer be considered autonomous from mainland China. Pompeo notified Congress on Wednesday that Hong Kong is no longer deserving of the preferential trade and commercial status it has enjoyed from the U.S. since it reverted to Chinese rule in 1997. Under a joint Sino-British agreement on the handover, Hong Kong was to be governed differently than the mainland for 50 years under a “one country, two systems” policy. Pompeo’s determination opened the door to possible sanctions and the loss of special perks Hong Kong has received from the United States. But neither Pompeo nor other officials were able Wednesday to describe what action the administration might take, an uncertainty related to the impact that such sanctions would have on U.S. companies that operate in Hong Kong and the city’s position as Asia’s major financial hub. Trump’s comments sparked a drop in U.S. financial markets. Serious consideration of the visa revocation proposal, first reported by The New York Times, has faced opposition from U.S. universities and scientific organizations who depend on tuition fees paid by Chinese students to offset other costs. In addition, those institutions fear possible reciprocal action from Beijing that could limit their students’ and educators’ access to China. In a nod to those concerns, the officials said any restrictions would be narrowly tailored to affect only students who present a significant risk of engaging in espionage or intellectual property theft. The officials could not say how many people could ultimately be expelled, although they said it would be only a fraction of the Chinese students in the country. Still, the possibility that the proposal may be implemented has drawn concerns from educators. “We’re very worried about how broadly this will be applied, and we’re concerned it could send a message that we no longer welcome talented students and scholars from around the globe,” said Sarah Spreitzer, director of government relations at the American Council on Education. “We don’t have a lot of details about how they are going to define ties to Chinese universities, what type of universities are they going to target, what would constitute a university having ties to the Chinese military,” she said. If the situation were reversed and another nation imposed limits on students from U.S. universities that receive Defense Department funding, she noted it would affect a wide range of schools. The U.S. hosted 133,396 graduate students from China in the 2018-19 academic year, and they made up 36.1% of all international graduate students, according to the Institute of International Education. Overall, there were 369,548 students from China, accounting for 33.7% of international students who contributed nearly $15 billion to the U.S. economy in 2018. The proposal to revoke the visas is not directly related to the dispute over Hong Kong, nor is it tied to U.S. criticism of China for its handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Rather, it is connected to various elements of trade and human rights issues that have seen U.S. officials complain about Chinese industrial espionage and spying and harassment of dissidents and religious and ethnic minorities. But the timing of a potential announcement could come at a time of increasingly heated rhetoric about the imposition of national security laws on Hong Hong in violation of the Sino-British accord. The proposal first began to be discussed last year when the administration moved to require Chinese diplomats based in the United States to report their domestic U.S. travel and meetings with American scientists and academics. At the time, U.S. officials said it was a reciprocal measure to match restrictions that American diplomats face in China. Those limits were followed by a requirement that Chinese state-run media in the U.S. register as “foreign diplomatic missions” and report their property holdings and employee rosters to the government. That was, in turn, followed by the limiting of the number of visas for Chinese journalists allowed to work in the United States. China retaliated for the visa limitations by expelling several reporters from U.S. media outlets, including The Washington Post and The New York Times.

Coronavirus closures of barbershops and hair salons have inspired some residents to test their tonsorial skills — a test Evan Winston failed in April with electric clippers, as evidenced by his 12-year-old son’s “haircut.” “I goofed and didn’t have the guard on right,” said Mr. Winston, president of Hercules Fence. “He had this ridiculous skinhead haircut. My wife was so mad at me.” As payback, he allowed his son, Tyler, to shave his head. Just before the boy started trimming, Mr. Winston realized that many other families must be having hair problems similar to his own. And in that light-bulb moment, the Hercules COVID-19 Charity Haircut Challenge was born. TOP STORIES

                               Mr. Winston committed his regional fencing company to donating $100 to a local food bank for every Hercules employee who cut their hair at home. For every friend or family member who chopped off some hair, he would donate $50. In just over a month, more than $13,000 has been raised, and the goal is to raise a total of $25,000. The proceeds will be divided among the Capital Area Food Bank, Feed More, the Maryland Food Bank and a food bank at Virginia Beach. “Regardless of exactly how many participants we get, we are going to give [at least $18,000] because it’s important to us,” Mr. Winston said. Mr. Winston said the challenge has boosted morale among staffers, given their families something to do together and raised awareness about hunger in the region. He chose this cause because he had received emails from the local school district about how it was delivering meals to families and had seen news reports about the work food banks were doing to support their communities, as many have been laid off during the pandemic. “It was a heightened sense of awareness about people living paycheck to paycheck,” Mr. Winston said, adding that he also wanted to provide a role model for his three kids on the importance of being charitable. Kris Antonis, a facility security officer with Hercules Fence, said that although her 9-year-old daughter needed an extra incentive to cut her hair for the challenge, the cause was meaningful. Ms. Antonis said she used to help deliver food with her grandmother to people experiencing homelessness, so when her daughter Presley found out the proceeds were going to food banks, she was extra excited to participate. Also her mom said she could dye her hair purple if she did it. “She’s ready to do it again if it means we can do a different color,” Ms. Antonis said. Adam McFadden, a production manager at Hercules Custom Iron in Walkersville, Maryland, said there were a couple of people in his office who “claimed they knew how to cut hair” so they set up a “pseudo-barbershop” and cut the hair of about 20 employees. “From my standpoint, you see people go hungry every day,” Mr. McFadden said. “We were fortunate enough to keep working through this pandemic.” Adam Isaacson, a friend of Mr. Winston‘s, said his dad had been growing out his beard since the stay-at-home order started and thought the Hercules challenge was a funny opportunity for his children to take a buzzer to it. Mr. Isaacson’s three kids and his sister’s two children “each took a turn with the beard trimmer and cut it off and made it look a little ridiculous,” he said. “They were hysterically laughing.” “This time when things are so messed up and everyone is looking to help,” Mr. Isaacson said. “All of my family was pretty excited to get involved.” Because the fencing business was deemed essential and his staff was able to keep working through the pandemic, Mr. Winston said he felt compelled to give now. However, as hair salons start to open up under phase one of reopening, Mr. Winston said they are giving it about one more week to meet their goal.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: Hmm. A peek at the “new normal.” Mickey Mouse has more clout than parents. Poor folks and the newly unemployed, who had been used to living high on the hog, now depend on Spam and baloney sandwiches to fill their tummies.

                               Professional sports leagues and gamblers prove they have tighter control of your personal savings than you do. Weak-kneed governors, mayors and Joe Biden, the man who wants to lead us to the promised land, says we “ain’t black.” You knew that was coming, right? You knew cliques of people have been saying since mid-winter that the “new normal” is coming. Are you ready? Are you, your family and your neighbors willing to pay higher taxes and fees for everything from gas and public transportation to park and recreational programs, from trash, garbage and recycling services to health care and landscaping licensing. The press for the “new normal” means local and state governments locked us down so they could lock up the keys pegged to fiscal responsibility. If you prefer another perspective, consider historian Victor Davis Hanson, whose column in Thursday’s online and print editions of The Washington Times, gives a clear picture: “The current U.S. budget deficit could soon exceed a record $4 trillion. The massive borrowing is being driven both by prior budget profligacy and a hurried effort by the Trump administration to pump liquidity into a quarantined America. “Americans may soon have to service a staggering national debt of about $30 trillion — nearly $100,000 of debt for every American,” Mr. Hanson wrote. This after witnessing an endless stream of videos and social media comments illustrating how governors, mayors and other elected officials shortchanged the Class of 2020 of proms, graduations and other salutatory events. And now that the Reopen America Movement is taking off and people want to know who’s the leader of the club, we learn it’s M-I-C-K-E-Y. Both Orlando’s Disney World and SeaWorld theme parks are slated to open soon, July 11 and June 10, respectively. How in the world can theme parks that shuttle millions of people on a daily basis manage to prepare for reopening during a pandemic when D.C. and other cities can’t even manage to reopen small ballparks, recreation centers and swimming pools? Major sports leagues are planning their reopenings, too. The Boys of Summer are going to play. The NBA weighed the idea of games without fans, which would be like Vegas without gamblers — it doesn’t work. And if you’re African-American, be on the lookout. This election season, Joe Biden has declared himself the new normal’s expert on who is and ain’t black. So, if you’re ready for the new normal, raise your hand — but not too high. Mr. Biden and his clique will be coming for your money. • Deborah Simmons can be contacted at [email protected] Manage Newsletters Copyright © 2020 The Washington Times, LLC.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: Amid all the protests-slash-thuggery in the streets of recent days over the police killing of a black man, George Floyd, came this 5-4 determination from the U.S. Supreme Court: California’s far-left governor, Gavin Newsom, was quite right in limiting the number of people who could attend church based on concerns over the coronavirus. Thanks be the liberals on the court for that egregious ruling. Thanks be the liberals and the mental gymnastics of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. who conveniently forgot churches aren’t just another Walmart. Churches are protected by the First Amendment. TOP STORIES

                               Religious freedom, not retail freedom, was the core reason for the founding of this nation. Regardless, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, joined by Roberts, said that Newsom’s executive order limiting a San Diego-area Pentecostal church’s planned Pentecost services for 100 people or 25% of occupancy was fine and dandy, along the lines of what the government ordered for other businesses and places of gathering. That’s to be expected from the leftists on the court. But Roberts had a chance to make a stand for America’s founding, for America’s notions of limited government, for the concept of rights in this country coming from God, not government — and he blew it. Big time. “Although California’s guidelines place restrictions on places of worship, those restrictions appear consistent with the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment,” Roberts wrote. “Similar or more severe restrictions apply to comparable secular gatherings, including lectures, concerts, movie showings, spectator sports and theatrical performances where large groups of people gather in close proximity for extended periods of time.” That’s nice. But to make that statement means to believe that concerts, movie theaters, lectures are one and the same as churches and places of religious worship. And they’re not. In America, saying so is tantamount to tortured logic. History makes clear this country came first and foremost as a result of godly men and women seeking a permanent solution to religious persecution — to religious persecution from the hands of government. That means the order of priorities is church first; government second. Or, put another way: God first — God-given rights to individuals, first; government-granted, second. If at all. One need only look to the First Amendment and the Ninth Amendment to underscore. Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh in his dissent argued plainly that the COVID-19 restrictions on the church were clear violations of the Constitution. “In his view,” SCOTUSblog.com wrote, “the businesses that are not subject to the restrictions — which, he noted, include malls, pet groomers, hair salons and marijuana dispensaries — are comparable to gatherings at houses of worship, and California [did not] show a good reason for treating houses of worship differently.” Good points, all. Good points that blow holes in the Roberts‘ line of reasoning of churches being allowed the same-same as other same-same businesses. Kavanaugh also noted the church “would suffer irreparable harm from not being able to hold services on Pentecost Sunday in a way that comparable secular businesses and persons can conduct their activities.” He was joined in the dissent by Justice Neil M. Gorsuch and Justice Clarence Thomas. Justice Samuel Alito voted to dissent, but did not join Kavanaugh’s opinion. Roberts, post-opinion, was credited by many in the media for issuing what was billed as a common-sense ruling that took into consideration the government’s job to protect citizens; the unknown nature of the coronavirus and the full extent of its dangers; and the belief that Newsom put a great deal of thought into his executive order, going above and beyond to treat churches in a way that was fair — that was like the treatment given all the other businesses in the state. Kavanaugh was accused of judicial activism. But how can it be judicial activism to uphold the very tenet of America’s founding and of the driving force behind America’s very system of governance? Roberts was wrong; Kavanaugh was right. We’re either a nation where religious freedom rules — or a nation where government rules. Roberts, with his bizarre, twisted jumps over historical truths and acrobatic hops over the Constitution, specifically the First and Ninth amendments, made clear: In his America, government rules. And this is all the more reason to keep Democrats far away from the White House and Senate. The next Supreme Court seat must be filled with another Kavanaugh, not a Roberts. • Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: Social protests on behalf of George Floyd have escalated way past the point of peaceful, and now, instead of solemn reflection on the need to weed out policemen-gone-rogue and hold them accountable — quickly — we have mask-wearing thugs with bricks taking to the streets, setting fires and smashing storefront windows, looting luxury goods and flouting the law. This is what happens when an 8-minute video surfaces showing cavalier police with hands in pockets choking out the life of a pleading suspect whose head is trapped between an officer’s knee and pavement. But this is also what happens when you shut down schools, shut down sports, shut down restaurants, shut down malls and stores and places of entertainment and gathering, and lock an entire nation of youth in their homes for weeks and months on end. Video games only entertain for so long. TOP STORIES

                               Floyd is proving a powder keg for COVID-19 angst. If Democrats drunk with executive power hadn’t gone so far over the top with their lockdown, stay-at-home, stay-off-the-streets COVID-19 securing of neighborhoods — handing out fines for church-goers, sending police to chase runners at the beach, standing by as officers dragged away subway riders who didn’t wear their face masks and more — well then, maybe some of the thuggery of recent days wouldn’t have occurred. Maybe some of the thuggery could have been contained faster. Maybe some of the Floyd protesters-slash-rioters wouldn’t have used Floyd’s death as cause for protesting-slash-rioting. Maybe some of them would’ve been otherwise occupied — at a movie theater, perhaps, or a shopping mall. Or on a basketball court or baseball field. At the beach, even. Maybe some of them wouldn’t have been able to hide their identities behind the recommended-slash-mandated face masks — and so maybe wouldn’t have been so emboldened to even commit acts of violence in the first place. Yes? That’s not to downplay the horrific killing of Floyd and the worthiness of protesting, peaceably, on his behalf, in honor of his life, as a community stand against police brutality, in common recognition of the need to do a better law enforcement job. But it is to say: You can’t keep an entire nation shut down, inside, away from normal life and on edge, mindful of daily and ever-changing virus-related panicky news, and then expect behavior to be at its best. You can’t keep youthful angst caged and expect the release to be smooth and steady. And with Floyd, Antifa never had it so good. So many minutes of horrible police acts, caught on video for all to see; so many pent-up youth, bored and on edge from the coronavirus. It was easy pickings for the thug-life types. Still, there’s a tiny sliver of sunlight at the end of this dark tunnel. Democrats, seeing streets burn and Molotov cocktails fly, are learning — should be learning — an important COVID-19 lesson, and it’s one that goes like this: Citizens have a breaking point.  And FYI, powder kegs can come in many forms. • Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: In reaction to the 2008 recession, Congress and the Obama administration passed what was the largest stimulus package in U.S. history. But budgetary illiteracy has hit new levels. Expenditures intended to soften the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic has already tripled that record. We’re not in Kansas anymore.  Speaker Pelosi and her Democratic colleagues in the House now want to double down. In May, the House passed the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act, or HEROES Act—an 1,800-page, $3 trillion grab bag spending bill. The centerpiece of the bill is a $1 trillion bailout of local and state governments that have mismanaged taxpayer dollars for decades. Illinois is “Exhibit A.” At the close of fiscal year 2019, the state had $137 billion in unfunded pension liabilities — a $6 billion increase compared to the previous year despite record breaking contributions to the fund. More than one-quarter of the state budget is expected to be engulfed by pension costs in 2020. According to a recent analysis from the Illinois Policy Institute, depending on the job, between 43 percent and 94 percent of public employees will collect retirement payouts in excess of $1 million.  TOP STORIES

                               A federal bailout means taxpayers in more fiscally responsible states will be funding those pensions — costly benefits demanded by out-of-state unions who were paid off after helping elect Democrat politicians. If political operatives in the states that have mortgaged the future of their taxpayers can’t just “say no” to the unions, they shouldn’t expect a “yes” from the rest of America. Admittedly we are a family of states, but every family has a moment that calls for tough love.      The severity of the current health and economic crisis warrants some action from Congress. But the pandemic does not erase basic arithmetic. Government can only spend money it collects. The rest is borrowed.  At the close of 2019, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reported the federal debt to be $16.8 trillion. This level of out-of-control spending will have very real consequences.  We have to pay interest to those who loaned us the money (including China). Payments owed on the debt are squeezing the federal budget and other spending priorities like infrastructure repairs are crowded out.  Interest payments on the debt last year amounted to over $400 billion. Imagine what the shakedown will be once the additional $2.8 trillion (so far) in pandemic spending is tacked on.   Teaching people just how big a debt we have is the first step in getting the country’s fiscal house in order. “One trillion” is too big to comprehend and 16 of something you can’t grasp isn’t too threatening. Consider the concept of “time” to put it into perspective. One million seconds passes over 12 days. One trillion seconds elapses over more than 30,000 years. Think of that the next time you hear about another trillion-dollar spending bill.  The coronavirus pandemic has already taken more than 100,000 American lives and triggered an economic crisis unseen since the Great Depression. Some action is necessary, but Congress should be careful to balance the benefits of stimulus spending with the consequences of extreme run-away debt. We can’t afford the unintended side-effects of the cure to be worse than the disease. • Richard Berman is the president of Berman and Co., a public relations firm in Washington, D.C.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: This year’s observance of Memorial Day had a wider focus than usual. Along with honoring the sacrifices of those who gave their lives in service to the nation, it underscored questions about the liberty for which those sacrifices were made. Religious liberty, in particular, has become an issue, in light of the physical restrictions we’ve endured during the great COVID-19 lockdown. All these weeks we’ve been called upon to balance our freedom to worship with our responsibilities as members of society to reduce the risk of spreading disease. The understanding of how to strike that balance has required closing churches and other houses of worship. Believers have accepted this as a reasonable protection of the public health — at least they accepted it in the early days of the pandemic when little was known about the scope and virulence of this contagion.

                               With the passage of time and greater clarity about the numbers of actual COVID-19 infections, they’ve begun to resist the limitations imposed by states. Demands for restoration of public worship have grown, putting religious leaders in a tough spot. They want to give Caesar his due, even as parishioners are beating on the church doors. The conflict has had a positive aspect, however. It’s drawn attention to the real meaning of religious liberty, which of course, is one of the guarantees made by the First Amendment. In our highly secularized society, a lot of people assume that the U.S. Constitution protects religious liberty so that people are free to seek spiritual fulfillment in whatever way satisfies their consciences. This accords conveniently with the view of non-believers that they’re best fulfilled by not having anything to do with religion at all. But while spiritual fulfillment is important, the actual reason religion enjoys constitutional protection is because people of faith feel themselves under an obligation to worship God, and government must not impede their ability to do so. The right exists because of the commitment. Whatever benefits individual spirits may derive are secondary. This is the understanding of faith on which the nation’s Founders — men steeped in scriptural familiarity and the undisputed Christian culture of their time — based the Constitution. It’s the liberty for which so many of our fellow Americans have fought and died. And it’s the reason we must reopen the churches. People realize that we’re not out of the woods, in terms of health risk. They’ll accept reduced attendance, face masks and social distancing. Pastors will accept the need for more services to compensate for fewer bodies in the pews (they may not be happy about the extra demands on their time and effort, but they’ll accept them). What has never been acceptable is the notion that religious practice is a non-essential activity. Reaction against that assumption is what has prompted some believers not only to defy state restrictions, but to unwisely disregard reasonable anti-infection measures. It’s clear that we can’t jump back into our familiar ways of worshipping. But we must be free to worship. Governments must understand this, and work with religious leaders to establish safe ways for believers to meet their obligations to God. Not to do so demeans the liberty for which so many have sacrificed so much. • Rev. Michael P.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: One of the many ironies of the COVID-19 global pandemic is the world’s rediscovery that most everything that comes out of China is — somehow or someway — based on lies, a sad reality based on the long cultural tradition of Chinese deception. Without exception, this fundamental risk is the most critical element in every aspect of any dealing with China, whether it’s a complex national security matter or a simple commercial transaction. China lies about, cheats and steals absolutely everything — there are no exceptions. This is China at its most basic and historical level. It’s what China does — for example, what part of four huge plants reproducing stolen CD’s and DVD’s don’t we understand? Back in the days of books and vinyl records, Chinese pirated copies were for sale the day after they were released. Today, it’s all forms of technology and at the highest levels.

                               Perhaps the most ironic part of this historical reality is that it’s completely known and understood throughout Asia. And China fully understands it about itself — China deals with it every day and at every level of its society and expects it from all parts of its society.  It’s also the realty that transcends all Chinese politics. For a comparable example, one must look at organized crime, the Mafia and drug cartels. And perhaps doubly ironic, the pervasive corruption of communism remains the “perfect fit” for modern China. It’s the only political model that could “work” in China. Accordingly, three basic aspects of China’s corrupt behavior need better understanding in the West: Where does “the lie” come from in China, how does it “get to us” and how do we best deal with it? Where does the lie come from? Sun Tzu, the 6th century Chinese general and author of “The Art of War” probably said it best: “All war is based on deception” and China has effectively been at war with us since the end of World War II. China has also been at war with everyone else in the world to the extent it competes for business or the political control China wants. Just look at Chinese expansion in South America and Africa — their goal is to own and control these regions to the exclusion of all other influences. Origins of the China approach go back to its philosophically based history — the Confucian approach to life was/is based on the end result rather than the way it was obtained, and the general rejection of legal structures. Many say that President Xi Jinping is an energetic advocate of Confucian approaches to his governance and obsession with control. The latest example is Hong Kong — soon to be under total PRC control. Taiwan is next. How does the lie “get to us?” China has weaponized its people in more ways than we seem to realize, especially by stealing information and bribing insiders. China has hundreds of thousand students overseas who are obliged to report. China carelessly — maybe even intentionally — sent infected COVID-19 travelers to the rest of the world. And what China fears most now are internationally-coordinated efforts for trillions in enforced/leveraged compensation. Accordingly, we should be aggressively coordinating these efforts worldwide. They have weaponized their high-tech exports by building back doors into their systems to collect information — the concern about 5G and Huawei is only the most recent. They steal everyone’s technology and observe no copyright or patent legal regimes anywhere in the world. They pervert food and medicine in any way they can to make money — this is a technique used by street vendors in China and applied at the highest level to deceptively adulterate the product. The entire “political system” in China is corrupt, from the very lowest level to the very highest. There has never been any accountability for public corruption except as punishment — Mafia style — for not paying off the vertical chain of corrupt officials. Bribery is a way of life in China, always has been and always will be — and the fact China occasionally executes a token corrupt public official is meant for show and a lesson to pay bribes up the chain of political command. How do we deal with it? The guiding principle for anything that comes out of China — anything — is to not believe it. Nevertheless, dealing with China is impossible if we simply decide not to deal with the lie — they are the lie and we must learn to better deal with it. Here are some basic rules for dealing with China: • In any negotiation, China must know/understand/realize that we don’t believe them — and unlike in other parts of the world, this will not offend because it’s not offensive in China. In fact, it’s routine and expected as a part of everyday life. • We can never believe anything from China that we cannot actually see and verify the reality thereof. For example, how many nuclear weapons does it have? We will never know this and the actual number will always be many times our best estimates: China will always hide its nukes. • We should assume that all foods, medicines, chemicals, metals, etc., from China will be adulterated and require continuous inspection. Will China continue to lie and cheat even if we catch them at it? For sure. A very clever system of cheating — when and if it’s exposed — is a matter of humor in China. If this brief review seems harsh and politically incorrect, keep in mind that it will not be taken that way in China, rather as a reason to be even more clever and deceptive in dealings with us. The battle between East and West has been going on for centuries and is not about to abate, especially as China sees its current prosperity and power directly related to its deception — and it does. Kipling was right: “Oh, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet.”  • Daniel Gallington served in senior national security positions.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: There is a justified and renewed push by some Republicans to suspend guest workers coming into the country that in my opinion would not only help to protect our economy, but will help the 34 million displaced American workers. Four senators have called for a suspension of all new guest worker visas for 60 days and of certain categories of guest worker visas for a year “or until unemployment has returned to normal levels.” Of course, the immigrant advocacy organizations and groups that represent guest workers immediately pushed back and said the proposal would hurt the economy, claiming the move is politically motivated to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic and advance permanent restrictions on accepting new guest workers for most types of visas. It is amazing that these same groups that have used the pandemic as a way to release all immigrants from detention and implement their radical anti-borders agenda are now claiming exploitation by the Trump administration.      TOP STORIES

                               It is my opinion that the push from the senators is good but does not go far enough. The president must use his emergency authority to immediately suspend the entry of the hundreds of thousands of high-tech as well as low-skilled temporary workers planning to come to the United States, issue regulations that put in place permanent protections for American workers and revoke the work authorization of those already in the country at this time. At the same time, the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program also needs to be scrutinized.  Even before the coronavirus pandemic, American workers were being replaced or undercut by foreign workers in tech and other industries (e.g., “high-skilled” H-1Bs at AT&T and recent college grads by foreign students in OPT. With record unemployment crushing more than 30 million Americans, especially young people just graduating from college, importing more cheap foreign labor or allowing foreign nationals who are already here to continue to work while Americans continue to lose their jobs is simply unacceptable. Can any reasonable person imagine why we would need to bring in more than 100,000 foreign college students this summer on “Summer Work-Travel” visas? I can’t. While I’m on the record as supporting President Trump’s efforts to protect American workers, suspending the entry of immigrants who want to come here permanently, as the president did with his April 22 executive order; it needs to be expanded. Mr. Trump must take the next logical step and use that same emergency authority to issue a new executive order to cover temporary workers — who are often able to stay in the United States for years — and put lasting regulations in place that would protect American workers who are currently being replaced or undercut by them.  If not, vulnerable Americans will remain in the same peril into the foreseeable future, long after the pandemic has lifted and the president’s executive orders have ended. These regulatory actions must be undertaken as soon as possible, while any visa suspension for these programs is still in effect. Some simply require that the administration finish and publish regulations it is already working on, like a regulation that would reform the H-1B program; a regulation that would reform the OPT program; and a regulation that would rescind an Obama administration regulation allowing thousands of spouses of H-1B workers each year to get work permits. This isn’t hard. It will just take the president sticking to his instincts to put America first. Around 4 million students will be graduating from college this spring, many with large loans, all looking for jobs. An immigration policy that puts America first would ensure that our students are first in line for employment. Simply put, OPT has always been a controversial foreign-worker program created by the Obama and Bush administrations to allow foreign students to work in the United States for up to three years after graduation — tax-free. Employers who hire these foreign workers don’t have to pay taxes on them, making them cheaper hires than our American students. OPT has grown expansively in recent years with more than 400,000 foreigners, primarily from China and India, receiving work permits as of 2018. They work in many different areas, including national security sensitive fields, with virtually no oversight. These jobs would otherwise go to American graduates looking to start a life for themselves in these difficult times. The program is also plagued by significant fraud. Thousands of foreign nationals who have obtained work permits through OPT have done so by claiming to work for employers that don’t exist. Thousands of these individuals have attended phony “schools” that exist only to help foreigners break our immigration laws. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is actively investigating the significant threats OPT creates, but the effort is taking up resources the agency simply doesn’t have. Fortunately, the program is entirely within ICE’s control and can be ended, or at least significantly limited to fit within resource constraints, through a quick regulatory fix. It’s time to act and make smart changes. President Trump has shown great courage to do the right thing for American citizens on immigration issues. I am confident he will act similarly regarding guest work visas.   • Tom Homan is the former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: In 561 BC, Peisistratos dissolved the Athenian “Ecclesia”  (“Assembly”) and seized power in Athens and Attica. The Ecclesia, made  up of all adult male landowners in the Athenian city-state, would not  rule the city again for more than 50 years. In 1258, Simon de Montfort, in a bid to maintain his shaky control  over England, convened the precursor to the modern Parliament (from the  French for “a place or occasion to talk”). In the subsequent years,  kings and parliaments would joust for supremacy, with the parliament  ultimately winning  — primarily by executing Charles I in 1649. Across  those four centuries, one of the most used and useful weapons wielded by  monarchs against parliaments was to dissolve them and send them back to  their shires. On May 20, in a similar way, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi essentially  dissolved the House of Representatives in a bid to reduce the power and  authority of most of its members and increase the power and authority of  its leadership. The given reason for doing this is to restrain the  progress of the coronavirus, but the actual purpose is to accelerate the  steady migration of decision-making power from rank and file lawmakers  to leadership, its lieutenants and staff.

                               That migration has been ongoing for decades and can be seen in the  obvious (the pervasive use of closed rules) and the grotesque (bills so  large that no one but staff knows what might lurk in them). But the  notion of proxy voting is a step change because it, more acutely than  anything else, removes from House members the thing that distinguishes  them from the rest of us — their ability to draft, deliberate, amend and  vote on legislation. The irreducible fact is that decisions get made by those who are in  the room where it happens, not by those who have given their proxies to  those who are in that room. For those concerned about the partisan divide, is it likely to get  better if we reduce the human interaction and the give and take that is  (sometimes) a necessary ingredient in in the legislative process? That  element of interaction is rare enough already. How rare will it be once  lawmakers can and are in fact encouraged to evade the simple obligation  to show up for work? Apart from being extraordinarily disturbing from a historical and  policy perspective, giving your vote to someone else is probably  unconstitutional and, accordingly, contrary to the oath of office each  member takes at the commencement of each session of Congress. The Constitution gives leeway to the House and Senate with respect to  their own rules of procedure. But in both chambers, a quorum is  required to do business, and a quorum is defined as a majority of its  members. Article 1 of the Constitution is pretty straightforward: “a  Majority of each shall constitute a Quorum to do Business; but a smaller  Number may adjourn from day to day, and may be authorized to compel the  Attendance of absent Members, in such Manner, and under such Penalties  as each House may provide.” If physical presence isn’t necessary, compelling “Attendance of  absent Members” would be equally unnecessary. Although proxy voting was  possible at the time of the Constitutional Convention, delegates waited  for their peers to conduct business in person. They knew the value of  being physically present. Is such presence inefficient? Absolutely. The Framers understood  this. They did not intend to make it easy to reach consensus and govern.  The People’s House is not intended or designed to have two lawmakers  negotiate with the executive branch and then have the remainder of the  membership ratify the result. Congressional leaders cannot simply ignore historical, policy and  pragmatic concerns, as well as constitutional requirements, simply  because they find them inconvenient, troublesome,or inconsistent with  their preferences to minimize the role of members and maximize the role  of leadership and its staff. Congress (from the Latin for “coming together”) is a gathering of  people together to solve issues. That cannot and will not be  accomplished in the absence of the people of Congress. • Michael McKenna, a columnist for The Washington Times, is the  president of MWR Strategies.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: The stories have become so commonplace that they’ve almost lost their shock value. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio singles out churches and synagogues, threatening to seize their property and shut them down “permanently” if they dare defy his orders. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, (working through her city’s director of public health), declares a Romanian church a “public nuisance.” “We will shut you down, we will cite you, and if we need to, we will arrest you, and we will take you to jail,” she tells this small group of former Soviet bloc Christians who refuse to bow to her power.

                               Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas issues a stay-at-home “order” that includes a “request” that all churches which choose to exercise their First Amendment rights must provide a “record of attendees” to the city and to the state. Andy Beshear, Kentucky’s governor, warns that any state residents attending any church services will be “forced” to self-quarantine for 14 days. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer declares that even “drive-through” church services are prohibited. He then instructs his police to record the license plate numbers of anyone caught sitting in their car in their local church parking lot. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declares an executive order prohibiting churches from holding any indoor worship services. Vanita, Oklahoma, Mayor Chuck Hoskin issues a municipal order saying that anyone engaging in any church activity inside or outside, will be subject to a $500 fine and 30 days in jail. Police in Lakewood, New Jersey, arrest 15 congregants of a local synagogue for attending an Orthodox Jewish funeral. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy responds by saying that any knowledge of the religious freedom guaranteed to these Jews by the Bill of Rights is “above his pay grade.” Mayor after mayor and governor after governor across America have declared churches to be “non-essential” and ordered them closed under penalty of law. And yet, those who’ve haranged us for decades about the “separation of church and state” now sit in sleepy silence. Why? George Santayana once said, “Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” With this as context, perhaps a bit of a history lesson is in order. In 1791, James Madison wrote the First Amendment: “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” Madison, thus, argued that it is an “essential” right of every church and not that of a “king.” Madison’s premise was very easy to understand. No government official should ever presume to define the matters of the church. No politician or unelected bureaucrat ever has the power to “establish”, dictate, contradict or contravene religious belief or practice. This is not the government’s business. It is the church’s and the church’s alone. It is not the prerogative of our Congress or the courts to tell the church what to do or not to do.  Eleven years later, Thomas Jefferson found it necessary to reassure a small group of nervous Baptists in Danbury, Connecticut, that they did not have to fear any government intrusion into the affairs of their denomination’s polity or practice. “I contemplate with sovereign reverence that … [the] legislature should ‘make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,’ thus building a wall of separation between Church and State.” It is from Jefferson’s assurance of non-intrusion that we get our present language of separation of church and state. Read in context, the words of Jefferson and Madison are crystal clear. In America, unlike any other nation, the church is protected from the government. There is a “wall” that provides that protection, and it serves as a fortress, not a prison. It is built to guard the church, not to confine it. This wall is no more intended to restrain religion than the walls around your personal home are intended to restrain you. As a house has a door whereby you come and go, likewise, our Constitution has a door whereby the church is always free to enter society as it chooses, but also to lock that door and keep the government out when it sees fit. The key here is that the church holds the key, not your power-hungry governor, or your strutting little local mayor. The door is locked from the inside, not the outside. The wall is built for your benefit, not theirs.  John F. Kennedy once said that “in times of turbulence … it is more true than ever that knowledge is power.” The COVID-19 turbulence has exposed the radical ignorance of the left. They know nothing of our history and care little for your freedom.  Remember this in November.  You have knowledge. You have power. You hold the key. It’s time to use it. • Everett Piper, former president of Oklahoma Wesleyan University, is a columnist for The Washington Times and author of “Not A Day Care: The Devastating Consequences of Abandoning Truth” (Regnery 2017).

ANALYSIS/OPINION: Is it me or do the media seem almost giddy, in a macabre way, that America has passed the 100,000 mark in deaths attributed to the coronavirus? Since February, The Washington Post has kept track with a front-page graph of daily and total deaths, suggestive of a corporate sales chart.   On Wednesday, the front page featured 100,000 in giant figures in white against a black background. With the paper full of the usual anti-Trump articles, it practically screamed, “See? He did this!” TOP STORIES

                                Alec Baldwin bashes millions of Americans, says only 'mentally ill' will vote for Trump
                              
                               Over at CNN, legal and national security analyst Asha Rangappa tweeted: “I have a suggestion. How about, no matter you tweet about, you end the tweet with the following phrase: ‘Also, Trump is responsible for the death of 100,000 Americans.’ That way there’s always a reminder.” According to Newsbusters.org, Ms. Rangappa’s tweet was quickly seconded by MSNBC’s counter-terrorism analyst Malcolm Nance. This is the guy who suggested in April 2017 that Mr. Trump deserved an ISIS suicide bombing of Trump Tower Istanbul because he phoned Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to congratulate him for winning a referendum.  On May 24, a few days before the death count hit 100,000, The New York Times Sunday front page headline was “U.S. DEATHS NEAR 100,000, AN INCALCULABLE LOSS,” accompanied by a list of 1,000 names of victims.  For the families who have lost loved ones, these are, indeed, incalculable losses. We should be praying for each and every family that has suffered such a loss, and for those who are battling for life.   But we also need to be aware of how much the media and leftist politicians are using the pandemic as their main chance to beat President Trump in November, keep their House majority and recapture the U.S. Senate. They seem intent on keeping the nation locked down and in a near-Depression as long as possible.  It may be their only hope. The numbers may be off, too. While some claim an undercount, New York and other jurisdictions have designated thousands of “probable” but undiagnosed cases as COVID-19 deaths. All deaths linked to the coronavirus are now classified as “COVID-19 deaths regardless of cause or underlying health issues that could have contributed to loss of life,” said Dr. Deborah Birx, Coronavirus Response Coordinator for the White House Coronavirus Task Force. More than 35,100 nursing home deaths have been reported in 37 states, out of 174,381 cases in 42 states, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. More than 80 percent of the deaths are of people 65 and older.   So, it boggles the mind to recall orders by three states for nursing homes to take in people who tested positive for the coronavirus, thus putting at risk the most vulnerable population. Although most of the media have studiously ignored this huge scandal, The New York Times published an article on April 24, “‘Playing Russian Roulette’: Nursing Homes Told to Take the Infected.”  Here’s the key paragraph: “At the epicenter of the outbreak, New York issued a strict new rule last month: Nursing homes must readmit residents sent to hospitals with the coronavirus and accept new patients as long as they are deemed ‘medically stable.’ California and New Jersey have also said that nursing homes should take in such patients.” More than 29,000 people have died in New York state, about 75 percent of them aged 65 and older, many in nursing homes, even while New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo was being praised by the media for his brilliant leadership during the crisis. Curiously, when you click on the link to Mr. Cuomo’s executive order, the state page says the “document may have moved,” and directs the reader to a later order about specimen collections. With Joe Biden looking frailer by the day, and Mr. Cuomo being suggested as either a VP candidate or a fallback presidential contender, the disappearance of his nursing home order is convenient at the very least.   New York and New Jersey have had a combined 40,279 fatalities, according to Johns Hopkins University’s count, or more than 40 percent of the 100,000 U.S. reported deaths. The vast majority are people 65 and older, with those infected over 80 having the highest fatality rate.  In early April, New Jersey Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli issued a directive to nursing homes to accept clients diagnosed with COVID-19. As of this past Friday, 537 long-term-care homes in the state reported coronavirus outbreaks, with 5,750 deaths, or more than half of the state’s 11,401 COVID-19 fatalities.   In late April, Ms. Persichilli warned of a second outbreak and said she was worried about nursing homes, which have shown “very little resiliency” to the coronavirus. No kidding. Meanwhile, California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration issued a similar order: Skilled nursing facilities “shall not refuse to admit or readmit a resident based on their status as a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 case.” What were they thinking?   As of Friday, 1,632 nursing home residents in California had died of the virus, out of nearly 4,000 total deaths in the state.   These three states are among the hardest hit by the virus, and all are governed by Democrats.  But you can bet the farm that the media will blame President Trump for every single COVID-19-related death right up to Election Day. • Robert Knight is a contributor to The Washington Times.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: Valerie Jarrett, former White House whisperer for the Barack Obama administration, said in an MSNBC television interview that “vote-by-mail” should be the way to go in each and every state for elections this November. And forever after, for that matter. And with that, the left tipped its hat to its “never let a crisis go to waste” COVID-19 endgame. “This week,” said Jarrett, as Breitbart reported, “we launched Civic Cities, where we are working with mayors across the country.” TOP STORIES

                               Working for what? To kill the integrity of America’s election system. To ultimately, destroy the Electoral College and tip the scales of voting the Democrats’ way for years, even decades, to come. And to do so on the wings of teaching civility in politics. Civic Cities is the left’s latest way of pretending like it’s working on behalf of the citizens of the United States while actually working to undercut the Constitution, free market and concept of individual rights, and brainwashing the next generation in good old-fashioned socialist collectivism. “We’re building Civic Cities across the nation — cities which provide the following: Solutions Civics, [that] teaches No-Blame problem solving of government issues to high school students,” reads one bullet point from the Citizens Campaign website. Yada yada, so on and so forth. “No blame” is code for “no accountability.” No accountability for Democrats, that is. Anyhow, apparently, as part of Civic Cities, youth are being trained to think of voting as an at-home endeavor. “We’re working in high schools,” Jarrett said, “because people who are first-time voters tend to be lifelong voters. We have colleges and universities. We have the business community engaged.” The endgame? “We should have vote-by-mail in every state,” she said. “We should have early vote in every state. Everybody should be able to go online to register. Why is it leaders are not making it as easy as possible for us to vote as opposed to trying to suppress the vote? We’re trying to close the age and the race gap. We’re confident that this is a long term plan.” And COVID-19 has provided the perfect platform to spring this long-term vote-from-home plan into effect. “This COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare the weaknesses in government and leadership,” Jarrett said. Oh, what a lucky day for Democrats that COVID-19 came along. Not only do Dems now have a tool to justify hiding away their subpar candidate Joe Biden in the basement — out of the comparatively hot gaffe zone known as The Field of Donald Trump’s Fire — but also, they can put in place the groundswell for a long-held dream of the left: to destroy America’s fair system of elections. “Vote-by-mail has not been in any way an indicator of vote fraud,” Jarrett said. And by that, she meant, in typical Democrat-slash-Orwellian-speak: Vote-by-mail is highly susceptible to fraud. And thanks to COVID-19, Democrats have a chance to usher in an electoral system rife with fraud they can exploit for decades to come. • Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter @ckchumley.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, tech companies have repeatedly been called upon to help solve a host of problems. They’ve certainly answered that call, filling in various needs ranging from education to logistics networks to use of drones for delivering medical supplies.  But not everything has been roses. Some governments around the world have been using tech to gain more power in the name of fighting COVID-19. More people should contest these abuses of power, lest the world devolve into a surveillance state. In Singapore, police used a remote-controlled robot to patrol a park. The robot monitored foot traffic and relayed messages to urge people to practice social distancing. In theory, this is an innocent-enough way of informing people of the dangers of COVID-19 and reducing exposure and transmission. In practice, it’s an instance of Orwellian overreach — “Big Brother is watching you.”  TOP STORIES

                               The Singapore government is sullying safety protocol, too, by keeping a centralized database of cases that anyone can view online. The database doesn’t divulge names, but it does keep location data. While that sounds less threatening, it’s still problematic. As The New York Times showed, identifying people based on location data alone is relatively easy. Sure, contact tracing can be an effective way of monitoring the disease’s spread and getting much-needed information to those who are at risk, but safeguards like opt-in programs and deletion standards must be put in place to protect citizens’ privacy. Meanwhile, in Poland, the government is requiring people to download a selfie application, wherein people who need to isolate for 14 days have to upload selfies of themselves at home to a government-run app. If they don’t, they’re subject to police visits.  In Israel, the government used phone location data to impose quarantine requirements “without compromise.” Thankfully, this particular program has since come to an end after an oversight group within Israeli parliament raised a stink. But the fact that this was ever implemented is seriously troubling. From policing robots to government selfie quota — none of this is good news for civilians, but perhaps the most alarming development so far is how some governments are now using drone technology to monitor citizens and enforce lockdowns and restrictions.  For example, take China, a notoriously authoritarian state. It has already used drones to enforce prevention measures, and many European countries are following suit. One police department in the U.K. is uploading drone footage to their social media profile to socially shame people for not complying with social distancing measures. In France, drones are being used to enforce lockdown orders by the government. If these measures aren’t challenged, then authoritarian regimes will run amok.  Even the United States has imported these kinds of draconian and authoritarian tactics. In New York, for example, law enforcement are using drones to spot and fine residents in an effort to enforce lockdown orders. California and New Jersey, too, have used drones as a method of monitoring and enforcing social distancing during lockdowns. New Jersey is using the tech to spot non-compliant citizens so they can issue them fines of up to $1,000. This is all “to help combat people not following social distancing,” according to one police department. While that may seem like a harsh invasion of privacy, a New Jersey police chief assures us it’s worth it “if it saves one life.” City authorities are making similar efforts to encourage social distancing among residents in Savannah, Georgia. Limiting human contact and curbing the infection rate are valid concerns, but shrugging off constitutional protections of privacy will have far-reaching implications for the future.  Thankfully, these actions and orders have not gone uncontested. People are becoming increasingly vocal in their criticisms of such programs. Groups such as the ACLU have expressed concern over the privacy questions raised by various track and trace programs, as well as access to cellphone location data. More people need to step up and express their concern in order to make sure that the government is not acting without any checks whatsoever. We have to think long-term during this coronavirus crisis; we can’t let the government use it as a reason to chip away at our rights as citizens. Here in America, the current outcry against what’s already happening simply isn’t enough. More of us need to speak up in defense of what’s rightfully ours. After all, if we allow the government’s tech overreach to be normalized, we may well find that the freedoms we surrender for a time are freedoms that we never get back. • James Czerniawski is a contributor for Young Voices.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: Donald Trump’s prospects for 2020 are better than one might think, despite being deluged with troubles that Job himself might not have endured. Yet, miraculously, he’s still very much in the game. Consider: A recent poll conducted for CNN found Joe Biden losing in each of 15 battleground states, with Mr. Trump again winning Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. A major reason: Voters prefer Mr. Trump over Mr. Biden when it comes to running the economy. In that special election in California’s 25th Congressional District, the GOP’s Mike Garcia, a son of a Mexican immigrant and a former Navy fighter pilot, handed the Republican Party its first pickup of a Democratic seat in the state since 1998, with the president making a highly publicized appearance on Mr. Garcia’s behalf. Barack Obama’s and Hillary Clinton’s much ballyhooed endorsement of Mr. Garcia’s challenger fell flat. TOP STORIES

                               Here’s another interesting tidbit: Las Vegas odds-makers had the president a slight favorite over the former vice president even before the major rise in the stock market and signs that a vaccine may come sooner rather than later. And while the president is being hammered by the media for pressing states to return to a semblance of normality, the majority of governors feel compelled to say they have plans for normality too, perhaps with an eye on Mr. Garcia’s win in California. A consideration in that contest, notes the Cook political report, was a “thin patience for lockdowns.”  The president is viewed by that CNN survey as slightly underwater on the coronavirus issue, with the media flogging him for his supposed failure to respond quickly and take the advice of his health care experts.  It’s hard to believe that any president would have acted sooner, with China telling us that the disease did not transfer easily from one human to another, with the WHO insisting it was unlikely to spread beyond China’s borders and with our our own top infectious disease experts taking Dr. Anthony Fauci’s view that the risk to America was “minuscule.” The first known case in the United States of COVID-19 was discovered in a young man who had returned to Washington State on Jan. 15 from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the disease. U.S. health officials were not overly concerned, believing the virus was confined largely to the Wuhan area and that there was “no evidence” that it would leap China’s national boundaries. Yet just seven days after the virus had been confirmed on Jan. 21, the president and his advisers quickly assembled a team of distinguished infectious disease experts to serve on the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Though the WHO wouldn’t label the virus a global threat until the 30th, the president declared a public health emergency a day later, blocking entry into the United States of most non-U.S. citizens arriving from China.  The China travel ban was the first of dozens of crucial actions taken by the White House, including airport screenings, quarantining, mitigating, distancing, etc., all approved by the task force’s world-class epidemiologists and virologists whom the president had selected. Furthermore, these steps have kept the American death rate per confirmed coronavirus cases lower than numerous Western European democracies, including Sweden, Switzerland and the Netherlands. The mammoth falsehood that the president had been whimsically rejecting the advice of his health care experts was put to rest by Dr. Fauci himself at the April 13 White House briefing. When Drs. Deborah Birx and Fauci urged the travel ban on China, Dr. Fauci stressed that the president said “yes” to their request. He said “yes” when both endorsed a European travel ban. And he gave a “yes” to a travel ban on the United Kingdom and Ireland. The first and only time that Drs. Birx and Fauci formally made a recommendation for “strong mitigation,” Dr. Fauci added, the president went for strong mitigation. When the president called for a partial reopening of the country in 15 days, he agreed to the 30-day delay that they said was crucial to its success. Indeed, the author cannot find notable divisions between the task force and the president on policy until after the official reopening of the states in May. And even those have been exaggerated. Early on the president was endlessly mocked for his view that COVID-19 would not be a major problem for the United States. But he was hardly going rogue, as the media pretends. His optimism was derived from the task force’s scholars on infectious disease, including Drs. Robert Redfield and Fauci, who, in turn, had been misinformed by China and the WHO. Dr. Redfield told reporters the disease was a China problem, but that “the risk to the American public is low,” repeating that comforting thought several times. Dr. Fauci ended his remarks this way: “I underscore what Bob said: We still have a low risk to the American public. … ” On multiple other occasions Dr. Fauci minimized the risk, telling USA Today on Feb. 17 that “the real and present danger” was the seasonal flu, while the coronavirus danger is “just minuscule.”  The media’s determination to convince voters that the president’s decisions were irrational is hardly surprising. But what is remarkable is that a president gut-punched by a pandemic, major job losses and an unforgiving media still finds he has a good shot at winning a second term. • Allan H.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: In every generation, long-settled issues hibernate like cicadas, patiently waiting until new controversies propel them to the surface. Thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, the latest of these hardy perennials is absentee voting. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California is the boldest Democrat, proposing that absentee ballots be widely distributed throughout his state — apparently like toilet paper (supplies of which remain limited). But this newest paper chase is motivated by the noblest of intentions: guaranteeing risk-free voting in the 2020 presidential election. After all, what does it matter if the franchise is effectively extended to the undocumented, the felonious, the homeless, the unlettered and the unentitled? Isn’t absentee voting just another form of social distancing to fight COVID-19? TOP STORIES

                               Benjamin Franklin’s timeless warning about the fragility of the American democratic experiment — “a Republic, if you can keep it” — is being studiously ignored and not just in California. Wherever two or more Democrats are gathered together, their familiar tropes are always close at hand. Try to discuss voter fraud and you are immediately charged either with racism or a thinly-disguised bias against immigrants.  Any suggestion that community voting records need to be periodically reviewed for citizenship (Are you here legally?); accuracy (Do you still live in this district?); or even mortality (Are you still alive?) will result in either impassioned arguments or nasty allegations that your real agenda is voter suppression. Can you imagine the catastrophic effects on our already strained banking system if our credit bureaus relied on this same kind of outdated, uncorroborated information? One of the most insightful sources on voting problems in California and elsewhere is the public interest group Judicial Watch. Its president, Tom Fitton, believes that “dirty (voter) rolls can mean dirty elections,” so the group aggressively files lawsuits whenever problems are uncovered. For example, one Kentucky investigation “found that 48 Kentucky counties … had more registered voters than citizens over the age of 18.” How widespread is the problem? In January, Judicial Watch announced that, with the assistance of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, it had found “2.5 million extra voter names” spread across 378 American counties.  Far from voter suppression, those alarming totals suggest that political machines of various stripes are aggressively engaging in vote harvesting. With the American political system in hyper-drive, correcting even the smallest of these anomalies is quickly condemned by one armed camp or the other. A new wrinkle on these old arguments began to emerge around the Memorial Day holiday. Since our military has a well-organized system of absentee balloting, why couldn’t similar arrangements reduce the threat of COVID-19? A federal judge in San Antonio, Texas, last week even opined that the problem of voter fraud was theoretical while the coronavirus is a clear and present danger.  I smiled because one of my most treasured personal souvenirs is a red-line version of the “Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act” signed into law in August 1986 by President Ronald Reagan. Working for Sen. John Warner as an Army Congressional Fellow, I managed that legislation while learning that bipartisan leadership is essential in protecting our citizen-soldiers. I had been one of those soldiers, several of my applications for military absentee ballots lost or ignored during successive Cold War assignments. After Congressman Al Swift, a Democrat from Washington, wrote a bill to strengthen absentee voting, Mr. Warner assigned me to shepherd its counterpart through the Senate. From organizing hearings to signing up co-sponsors — including both Jesse Helms and Edward Kennedy — bipartisan cooperation became the order of the day.  Keeping it that way meant consistently demonstrating two things: ballot security and the absence of any advantage to either party. The entire military chain of command would certify the bona fides of each soldier, sailor, airman and marine. Democratic and Republican witnesses assured the Senate that this legislation would provide both parties with a level playing field. The only real opposition came when a Virginia election official angrily shouted that, “Votin’ may be a raht, but absentee votin’ is a privilege!” — a statement I later included verbatim in the Senate record. But everyone else agreed that the proposed legislation was right, proper and badly needed. Those facts notwithstanding, this obscure law later helped to decide the presidential election of 2000. Remember Florida, the hanging chads and those troublesome military absentee ballots? Well, you’re welcome, America, but try to remember that this was a legacy of the ’80s, when partisanship ended on Capitol Hill every day at 5 p.m. as glasses were raised. Try expanding absentee ballot rights today only if you are encouraged by such helpful precedents as the Titanic, Lusitania and Hindenburg. • Ken Allard is a retired U.S. Army colonel and former NBC News military analyst now living in San Antonio, Texas.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: Look at recent headlines and it’s as if COVID-19 were sweeping across the nation as some sort of grisly ghost of death, leaving piles of bodies in the morgues, piles of bodies in the nursing homes, piles of bodies in the hospitals — even piles of bodies in the streets. But do the math and the truth is far less earth-shattering. As a percentage of the U.S. population, which WorldOMeters estimates for 2020 at just shy of 331 million, the coronavirus death count is 0.03%.

                               That’s miniscule. That’s teeny-weeny. That’s itty-bitty. But for that, America has lost its economy, its free market, its freedom, its Constitution. “U.S. coronavirus death toll tops 100,000 as Trump pushes to reopen,” Politico’s headline blared, above a story with a critical look at President Donald Trump’s insistence to get America back in business. The story went on to report how America “leads the world in reported confirmed coronavirus cases,” a number Johns Hopkins University now puts around 1.6 million. And even if those numbers were completely accurate — even if the data from hospitals could be trusted — then 1.6 million cases of coronavirus in a population of 331 million still seems pretty minuscule when put in context of percentages: that’s 0.48%. Again: miniscule. The more important number is the one that tells how many recoveries, right? But death is much more interesting to report. “US coronavirus deaths top 100,000,” wrote Reuters. “U.S. coronavirus death toll rises above 100,000 in world’s deadliest outbreak,” wrote CNBC. “U.S. coronavirus death toll surpasses 100,000,” reported CNN. “US coronavirus death toll crosses 100,000 in harrowing milestone,” wrote Fox News. Some context would be good here. Of course, a headline like “Coronavirus proves deadly for 0.03% of U.S. population” — while truthful —doesn’t exactly scream, stop the presses! It does, however, provide some cooler head insights into just how widespread this virus is, just how devastating its death count is — and ultimately, just how smart a move it is for this administration to adopt a policy line of opening the economy, and opening the economy but quick. The 0.48% of the U.S. population infected by the coronavirus may think it premature; the family and loved ones of the 0.03% who’ve died from COVID-19 may think it careless and even cruel — but fact is, destroying an entire country for such a minuscule number of victims is nothing short of crazy. America cannot stand still another moment and suffer the destruction of freedoms, free enterprise and the future for the sake of a few COVID-19 victims — for the fear there might be a few more. The national suicide must stop now. • Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley. Listen to her podcast “Bold and Blunt” by clicking HERE.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: There’s a too-little talked about outcome of all this rush to develop anti-COVID-19 measures in the health world, and in both government and private sectors, and it’s one that goes like this: If a self-described coronavirus mitigation product or action fails to do as promised, or worse, actually causes harm to a citizen or group of citizens, there’s no mechanism for accountability. There’s no means of suing. The government has exempted itself and all its willing COVID-19 product-developing partners from any sort of liability for mistakes, misconceptions, misunderstandings about proper usage — from anything that could come back to bite. How so? TOP STORIES

                               The Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act, or PREP Act, that’s how. That’s the measure that gives the Health and Human Services secretary the authority to declare certain entities off-limits to legal liabilities during times of national crises — like COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. “The Secretary’s March 17, 2020 Declaration (‘COVID-19 Declaration’) provides certain individuals and entities (‘Covered Persons’) with immunity from suit and liability under federal and state law against ‘all claims for loss caused by, arising out of, relating to, or resulting form the administration to or the use by an individual of a covered countermeasure’ … except for willful misconduct,” according to a post from JD Supra. What a free-for-all for the COVID-19 opportunist, yes? And they serve for both private businesses and government. Test positive for COVID-19 despite wearing a face mask advertised as a protection against the coronavirus? Too bad; the manufacturer cannot be touched. Too bad; the governor issuing face mask mandates cannot be touched. Too bad; the grocery store enforcing the unconstitutional face mask orders from the governor cannot be touched. Swallow a pill the pharmaceutical industry comes up with and sells as a means of strengthening immunity to fight off the coronavirus — and suffer devastating medical side effects? Too bad; so sad. Watch a family member who was abiding a government order die from COVID-19? Again, too bad; so sad. Move on; there’s nothing to see here — certainly nothing to sue. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo may have sent thousands of elderly coronavirus patients to their COVID-19 deaths at nursing homes around the state. But he won’t pay for it. Neither will the nursing homes. From The Guardian: “As Governor Andrew Cuomo faced a spirited challenge in his bid to win New York’s 2018 Democratic primary, his political apparatus got a last-minute boost: a powerful healthcare industry group suddenly poured more than $1m into a Democratic committing backing his campaign. Less than two years after that flood of cash from the Greater New York Hospital Association (GNYHA), Cuomo signed legislation last month quietly shielding hospital and nursing home executives from the threat of lawsuits stemming from the coronavirus outbreak.” The power of granting immunity is a wonderful thing. And now we have a rush to develop a vaccine before the end of the year that will stop the spread of the coronavirus? That, as industry best-practice and government guidelines dictate it takes between 10 and 15 years to develop a single safe and effective vaccine. Beware, Americans. “Currently,” JD Supra reports, “Covered Persons [under this PREP Act] are afforded immunity through October 1, 2024.” That’s four years of free-for-all COVID-19 countermeasure product design, production, marketing and sale without all that pesky shadow of accountability, liability and lawsuit. That’s four years of government actions and orders to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. If Cuomo is an example of what’s to come, Americans need to be on high alert. With PREP, it’s clear: The priorities are Big Business, Big Pharma and Big Government — the private citizens last. • Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: The coronavirus pandemic has exposed deep divisions in the United States, but in one crucial area, it has unified our nation. With more than 90,000 dead and nearly 1.5 million sick, the American people have decisively judged the country that created this crisis: Communist China. That’s the finding of a new poll commissioned by the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation and conducted by YouGov. In a representative survey of American adults, we discovered that 71% of the country believes that Beijing should be penalized for the coronavirus. There is deep public support for international sanctions, additional tariffs, refusing to pay interest on Chinese-held U.S. debt, and banning communist officials from traveling to America. A majority want Beijing to pay America and other countries for the lives and livelihoods it has destroyed. Only 17 percent don’t want reparations. More broadly, we found that a stunning 67 percent of Americans now view Beijing as an enemy or opponent. This tracks with a Gallup poll in March that showed U.S. favorability of China at an all-time low. TOP STORIES

                               We don’t have to wonder why the American people feel this way. By now it is well-known that Beijing’s oppression and secrecy hid the true nature of the coronavirus, allowing it to spread virtually unchecked around the world — but not within other provinces of China. Scientists in the United Kingdom have shown that if China had been honest and taken earlier action, there would have been 95 percent fewer cases globally. Instead, the Communist Party covered up the truth, with disastrous consequences for America and the whole world. But Americans aren’t just turning on China because of the current pandemic. The last few months are merely the latest proof that Beijing endangers U.S. security and prosperity, and it dovetails with the growing realization that China’s authoritarian vision threatens human rights everywhere, including our own. Our fellow citizens have watched with horror as the Chinese Communist Party has stepped up its campaign to conquer Hong Kong, thrown millions of Muslim Uighurs into modern-day concentration camps, and convinced U.S. companies like the NBA and others to censor free speech and toe Beijing’s propaganda line. No wonder Americans want to decouple our country from China and hold that regime accountable. Yet the greatest barrier to fulfilling the people’s wish isn’t geopolitics, commercial ties or anything of the kind. It’s something much simpler: The self-interest of our political and business leaders. From the moment President Nixon set foot in China in 1972 to the present day, U.S. elites have long been captivated by the promise of good relations with the Middle Kingdom. Politicians, from both parties, have sought to cement their own legacies by drawing our countries closer together. CEOs have salivated at the possibility of tapping such a huge consumer market and labor pool, envisioning lower costs and higher profits. Yet while these leaders have spent decades touting the benefits of ever-closer ties, over that same time, the American people have almost uniformly seen Communist China in a negative light. This unfortunate mismatch is still true today. Even now, the sense among high society is that Americans should accept the Chinese Communist Party’s growing power. Some, like many business leaders and the families of former U.S. presidents, continue to say that closer U.S.-China cooperation is the key to our future. Meanwhile, the current race for the White House features one man who voted for legislation that allowed China to decimate American manufacturing, and another man who, despite strong rhetoric and much-needed containment policies, has staked much of his legacy on striking an elusive trade deal with Beijing and has even praised Chinese President Xi Jinping’s “transparency.” But the American people don’t want deals or flattery. In their boundless common sense, our fellow citizens rightly see that Communist China and free, democratic America cannot co-exist cozily. This was becoming clear before the coronavirus. It is unmistakable now that Beijing’s actions have led to the death of nearly 100,000 of our family, friends and neighbors, and the suffering of millions more. There is an overwhelming post-partisan consensus that the United States must take a much stronger stance when it comes to Chinese oppression and aggression, whether morally, diplomatic, military or economic. The expectation is growing for our elected officials — Republican and Democrat — to reflect the unity of the nation and hold Communist China accountable. Americans are being told that we may have to “live with” the coronavirus for the time being and accept a new reality. But the American people are telling our leaders that we do not have to accept the Chinese Communist Party’s influence and propaganda within our country. We do not have to accept our manufacturing and medical dependence on China. These are things we can change. And most Americans think we should. • Marion Smith (@smithmarion) is executive director of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation in Washington, D.C.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: The current U.S. budget deficit could soon exceed a record $4 trillion. The massive borrowing is being driven both by prior budget profligacy and a hurried effort by the Donald Trump administration to pump liquidity into a quarantined America. The COVID-19 shutdown has left the country on the cusp of a self-inflicted economic collapse not seen since the Great Depression. Americans may soon have to service a staggering national debt of about $30 trillion — nearly $100,000 of debt for every American.

                               Democrats and Republicans can blame each other, either for spending too much or for too little taxation, or both. But both sides will agree that managing such an astronomical debt requires several frightening choices. One, Americans would be forced to live with permanent near-zero interest rates, or perhaps even negative interest rates. We are already seeing how the current low interest rates punish those who were thrifty and put away money in savings accounts. Negligible interest rewards those who borrow but forces savers to look for returns in volatile real estate or the risky stock market. In other words, there would be little interest paid out on the federal debt. The selling point for investors would be that the U.S. at least honors it bonds and debts and is safer than alternative global investments. America would become a permanent debtor that avoids paying much interest to anyone who lends it ever more money — on the cynical rationale that investors have no other safe place to put their money. Two, Americans, who are already taxed heavily at the local, state and federal levels, would simply have to pay even more. Top earners might pay a real tax rate of 60 percent to 70 percent of their incomes to government, with deleterious effects on incentives to create or earn further wealth. Gasoline prices are at astonishing lows, so some have advocated yet another federal fuel-tax increase, a national sales tax or a wealth tax on the rich. The problem with constant increases in taxation is the ensuing culture of even greater spending that inevitably follows and the destruction of individual incentive. Three, the government could make draconian cuts in spending, focusing mostly on entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare, along with defense, where the bulk of federal expenditures are found. Cutting Social Security and Medicare is usually political suicide. In times of growing tensions with China, Russia, Iran and North Korea, it would equally be foolish to slash defense spending. Instead, expect some sort of reductions in Social Security benefits for high-income Americans, along with higher Medicare deductibles for everyone. Four, the government could fall into the bad habits of the 1970s and simply expand the money supply, fuel inflation and pay down the debt with funny money. We would then likely experience the baleful consequences that a prior generation faced with stagflation and curative but staggeringly high interest rates during the Nixon, Ford, Carter and early Reagan administrations. Rather than fooling with interest rates and the money supply, a mixture of increased revenue and spending cuts seems wiser. Yet both are far harder to enact politically than just letting the Federal Reserve Board adjust national liquidity and interest. Five, the government could hope that new deregulation and more tax incentives might spur GDP growth of 3 percent or more per annum and thus “grow” our way out of deficits by radically expanding the economy. Such optimism is frequently voiced but rarely has prevented large budget deficits. A decade ago, the bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, headed by former Republican Sen. Alan Simpson and former Democratic official Erskine Bowles, charted a pathway out of debt. The commission outlined a holistic plan of gradual cuts and revenue increases. Its wise recommendations found little to no political support. In the first two decades of the 21st century, the United States has faced three existential crises. The first was the 9/11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, which prompted a global effort to fight radical Islamic terrorism. The second occurred in 2008, when the U.S. financial system and stock market nearly collapsed. The third began earlier this year with the COVID-19 epidemic and a quarantine that reduced the economy to its most shaky state since the 1930s. During the first two crises, we snapped back the economy with low interest rates, increased government spending and larger annual deficits — and passed the greater long-term debt to another administration, another Congress and another generation of Americans. We are postponing another rendezvous with reality. But as we near $30 trillion in debt, what cannot go on much longer soon probably won’t. • Victor Davis Hanson, a classicist and historian at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, is the author of “The Second World Wars: How the First Global Conflict Was Fought and Won” (Basic Books, 2017).

ANALYSIS/OPINION: The governors of all 50 states and the mayors of many large cities have assumed unto themselves the powers to restrict private personal choices and lawful public behavior in an effort to curb the spread of COVID-19. They have done so not by enforcing previously existing legislation but by crafting their own executive orders, styling those orders as if they were laws, using state and local police to enforce those so-called laws and — presumably when life returns to normal and the courts reopen — prosecuting the alleged offenders in court. It is hard to believe that any judge in America would permit a criminal trial of any person for violating a standard of behavior that has not been enacted into law by a legislature. We know this because under our system of representative government, separated powers and guaranteed liberties, only the legislative branch can craft laws and assign punishments for noncompliance. This is Constitutional Law 101. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch has written that the executive branch cannot enforce a law that it has written. If it does, we will have approached tyranny.

                               Have we approached tyranny already? During the past eight weeks, governors and mayors have closed most businesses, public venues and houses of worship, prohibited public assembly and restricted travel — all of which they have unilaterally decreed to be nonessential.   In his terrifying novel “1984” — which posits a future of total control of all persons by the government and total control of the government by one political party — George Orwell argued that he who controls the meaning of words controls the laws as well. That Orwellian truism has been manifested like never before here in America, where executive branch officeholders have used state and local police to restrain people from engaging in private and public behavior which they concede was lawful two months ago because today it is not deemed “essential.” Frankly, I am surprised at the ferocity of police enforcement and the lameness of police compliance. The police have taken the same oaths to uphold the same Bill of Rights — it’s not the Bill of Safety; it’s the Bill of Rights — as have all other officeholders. The police also know that it is unlawful for them to obey an unlawful order, particularly when they use force. The lockdown orders are all unlawful because none of them — none — has been enacted by a legislature, and all of them — all — interfere with fundamental liberties, each of which is guaranteed — guaranteed — by the U.S. Constitution. Please don’t misunderstand me. I recognize the scientific value of personal efforts to control contagion. But under the Constitution, these social-distancing, wear-your-mask, shut-your-business, stay-at-home edicts constitute mere recommendations that should induce rational voluntary compliance, because the government in America is without lawful power to compel compliance. The governors complain about resistance. They need to know that Americans will resist efforts to interfere in behavior that remains as moral, natural, lawful and constitutional as it was 60 days ago. Last week, President Trump, sounding fed up with gubernatorial lockdown orders, declared that religious worship is essential — meaning, in his opinion, all houses of worship should be opened — and he offered that he was prepared to “override” any governors who disagreed with him. When the president realized that he lacked any authority to override even unlawful gubernatorial decrees, he dispatched the Department of Justice to begin filing challenges to governors in federal courts and to argue that constitutional freedoms are being impaired by the states. I applaud this, but it is too little, too late. Where was the DOJ when Catholic priests were threatened with arrest for saying Mass or distributing palms and when Jewish rabbis were put in COVID-19-infested jails for holding funerals? At all these religious events, folks freely chose to exercise their freedom to worship; and to take their chances. These DOJ interventions provoked the question: Who should decide what goods, services or venues are essential — the states or the federal government? The question is Orwellian, as the answer is: neither of them. The government in America — state or federal — has no power and no right to determine what goods, services and venues are essential. Those determinations have been for individuals to make since 1776, and those individual choices have been constitutionally protected from the feds since the Bill of Rights was ratified in 1791 and from the states since the 14th Amendment was ratified in 1868. What is essential to the laborer or student or housewife may not be essential to the former Goldman Sachs partner who was elected governor of New Jersey, and who decreed last week, “It shall be the duty of every person or entity in this State … to cooperate fully” with his orders, or essential to the ideologue who is mayor of the Big Apple and who, for all his professed liberality, threatened to close permanently — permanently — businesses and houses of worship that flaut his guidelines. A duty is undertaken voluntarily or by nature, not by executive command, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy. And the government cannot take property away from its owners except for a legitimate public use and only for just compensation, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.  Governors and mayors can make all the dictatorial pronouncements and threats that they wish. But they cannot use public assets to enforce them. And when they seek to use force, those from whom they seek it should decline the offer.   In America, we decide for ourselves what produces happiness. We have never delegated to the government — ever — the power to make personal choices for us. And some of us are willing to take chances and even do “nonessential” things. The essence of the freedoms for which we have fought since 1776 is the liberty to be ourselves. • Andrew P.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: You needn’t be a hi-tech hipster to be familiar with Siri of Appleland or Alexa of Googleville, the artificially intelligent ladies at your beck and call now hanging out with a new kid on the AI block. Its name is contact tracing, and it’s being deployed in the battle to rein in COVID-19. Technically, contact tracing isn’t new. The D.C. Department of Health and other public health agencies are well-acquainted with the probing policies of contact tracing, which were deployed to connect the dots against such scourges as STDs, HIV/AIDS, Ebola, food poisoning and E.coli.

                               Artificial eyes can become productive tools — if privacy laws, regulations and rules are followed and apolitical. Still, think of contact tracing by way of a question: Would you entrust your personal and health data in the hands of a high school grad who barely earned a diploma and doesn’t know Georgia, the U.S. Peach State, from Georgia, the Eurasian nation-state? Here’s a brief description of how contact works. Apple and Google have joined the coronavirus fight by helping track people who have COVID-19. The “trackers” — government and nonprofit workers — ask the “tracked” persons who they might have been in contact with. Next, the tracked are asked to divulge where, when and with whom they had contact — including names and addresses. Now, when it comes to STDs, infected persons are asked to name and provide contact information for their sexual contacts, regardless of the relationship. Some lie, some provide a little information and some simply clam up. That’s human behavior for you. The same would apply to COVID-19, so be forewarned. Siri and Alexa are always listening, awaiting your request for safety recalls for food or toys. In fact, the only time they aren’t awaiting your command is when they are locked down, and I don’t mean locked down as we are in our homes. I mean off, unplugged. No AC, no DC. And don’t forget that smartphones, smart TVs and refrigerators, security systems, GPS systems and bluetooth connections can spread what comes out of your mouth, too — and AI speaks more than one language, and closed-circuit TV and cameras have ears. Now let’s turn to privacy and politics. The popular website WebMD recently reported this projection from Crystal Watson, a senior scholar with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security: “There are currently around 30,000 contact tracers  That might sound like not much, but it’s better than what it was at the start of this national emergency, when there were only 2,200 trained contact tracers in state health departments around the United States.” Understand, where governors, legislatures, mayors and town councils were once berating the Trump administration for shortages of masks, ventilators, hand sanitizer and toilet paper, they are now pressing to hire contact tracing and train their bureaucracies. Ms. Watson, again by way of example, estimated that states will need at least 100,000 workers trained in contact tracing. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said Tuesday morning that the city will have an estimated 200 contact tracers by June 1 and the response has been “tremendous.” The political and economic price tags for contact tracing are immeasurable at this junction, even though we won’t hit the polls until November. However, it’s safe to say our privacy won’t be the No. 1 concern with regard to technology, training, hiring and oversight. Politicians have yet to disclose how they will keep personal information of test results, contact tracing and treatment out of the hands of hackers, jerks, fly-by-night researchers and blackmailers. The issue begs the privacy question.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: Tennessee is reopening and it cannot come soon enough. In fact, I wish it would have come a whole lot sooner. More than a month ago I said as much in a letter I sent to our governor. I requested he lift these restrictions immediately for the good of all Tennesseans. Small businesses are faced with the prospect of closing for good. Workers are growing uncertain if they can support their families. We are losing millions in economic output. It’s all being inflicted unconstitutionally, with no regard to balanced distribution of power outlined in the Tennessee Constitution. And it has to stop. In my letter, I pleaded with the governor to end his stay-at-home orders because of the “destruction” on Tennessee’s economy, businesses and the men and women in the workforce. Not only does it impact us financially, but the mental health of our citizens is suffering as well with an increased rate of suicide — one week resulting in more deaths to suicide in Tennessee than to COVID-19. The data and medical research we’re now seeing no longer supports a shutdown, so it’s time to act. TOP STORIES

                               I am not just saying this for myself. It is what my constituents want. I know, I asked them. Among nearly 9,000 people I polled on Facebook on April 13, 55 percent told me they were in favor of lifting the restrictions imposed by the governor’s executive order. People are justifiably worried both about getting sick and being out of work. But there are reasonable precautions we all can take to prevent ourselves and others from getting sick. There is no way to prevent yourself from losing your job when you are stuck at home and your company is idle. I also do not think the governor had the legal authority to invoke an order that closed businesses, dictated Tennesseans’ health care decisions and prohibited people from exercising their right to gather. And, as an attorney who knows firsthand the importance of constitutional governance, it worries me just as much as the other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.  I am a Tennessee licensed attorney. I have been in practice for 30 years and have served as an assistant attorney general and an assistant district attorney general. I am also a former federal judicial law clerk. I have studied this. The governor claims he acted under the 2010 “Emergency Management Powers” afforded to him in Tennessee law. That law did grant him powers, but the state legislature did so unconstitutionally in giving the governor legislative powers in times of emergency. When it comes to the distribution of powers between the legislative, executive and judicial departments of state, the Tennessee Constitution is quite clear: “No person or persons belonging to one of these departments shall exercise any of the powers properly belonging to either of the others, except in the cases herein directed or permitted.” Nowhere in the state constitution do I see it directed or permitted for the state legislature to hand its power to the governor in a time of emergency. But beyond that, much like the U.S. Constitution, the Tennessee Constitution is premised upon the protection of unalienable individual rights that exist with or without government. This is clearly unconstitutional.  Along with my letter to the governor, I have also sent a letter to the state attorney general outlining my concerns. We need to be cautious and responsible during this time when it comes to the COVID-19 but also when it comes to our liberties. We cannot sit idly by. • Bruce Griffey is a member of the Tennessee House of Representatives and represents District 75.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: Just in case we needed a reminder, the debate over the desirability and duration of stay-at home orders during the current coronavirus pandemic has exposed the uncomfortable relationship that exists between science and democracy. Science points in the direction of the rule of the expert while democracy is rooted in the principle of popular sovereignty. While the American people and scientists have competing claims to rule (popular consent vs. scientific knowledge), each actually needs the other to survive peaceably and comfortably, so neither can afford to completely discredit or abandon the other. Modern, rights-oriented democracies like the United States desire much of what science has to offer, including a real shot at comfortable preservation for the many and not just for the few. There are good reasons, then, for democracies to be perplexed when it comes to the relationship they should seek with persons who have mastered the physical and natural sciences.   TOP STORIES

                               The tension between competing claims to rule based on popular consent on the one side, and scientific knowledge on the other side, only came to a head once the democratic model of government was shown to be defensible, principally by the Founding generation in the United States. Living with the tension between democracy and science in a responsible way requires that we distinguish the respective spheres within which “political” reasoning and “scientific” reasoning should prevail. This is easier asserted than accomplished, but doing this intelligently is critical to having a decent and competent democratic nation. One major distinction between the realm of politics and the scientific realm is that the political arena is dominated by matters that are fundamentally variable, something that is not true in the realm of science. Additionally, political decision-makers by definition are persons of practical action who are expected to deliberate and issue commands whereas scientists are not obligated to take action or issue commands. Political officials who are reputed to be “prudent” are persons who excel at adjusting policies to changing circumstances, including changing public opinions, and who recognize that “contingency” is a characteristic of political life. The prudent decision-maker understands that promoting the common good requires the continuous adjustment of a complex array of matters (e.g., political, economic, cultural, etc.) that are highly variable in nature.   The most esteemed political decision-makers are persons who are adept at adjusting policies in such a way as to promote what is good for human beings, which requires a recognition that some ways of behaving and conducting human affairs are better than other ways. Knowledge of this kind benefits more from good intuition and extensive experience than from the mastery of some body of scientific knowledge.  Admittedly, national and state officials who seek to act prudently need the knowledge that scientists possess in order to give people a good shot at enjoying the full benefits of living in a modern, right-oriented democracy. Political decision-making, however, ultimately should prevail in a democracy over the knowledge of scientists when it comes to matters bearing on the quality of life of the people, for example, deciding whether churches provide “essential” services. A political community that abdicates decision-making to experts on fundamental issues related to the way of life of the people is no longer a democratic community. Additionally, the kind of knowledge required to make intelligent decisions about what constitutes a healthy life for human beings (e.g., risk taking as community service and as a source of personal distinction) transcends the realm of purely scientific knowledge in the direction of morality. While good scientific knowledge may help when it comes to knowing how to survive, the consummate political knowledge of a George Washington or Winston Churchill makes survival with dignity possible. Consider how Founding-era Americans distinguished themselves for all time by following the prudent counsel of Washington and James Madison.  All of this accentuates the enormous responsibilities that fall to the people in a democracy. Nurturing a citizenry that is up to the task of selecting persons for public office who are capable of deliberating and acting prudently when it comes to the common good is enormously difficult. It was among the greatest challenges facing the Founders.   Carrying out this task well requires that citizens appreciate the extremely complex decision-making that is required to protect, restrain and/or balance diverse religious, racial, ethnic, economic and political interests, while also recognizing that political decision-making at its best should satisfy human longings that transcend creature comforts and mere survival. Despite the protestations of many journalists and political pundits, nothing about all of this is easy. Preserving the integrity and vitality of the nation during the COVID-19 pandemic will require that the American people possess the knowledge and the courage to insist on a prudential relationship between science and politics that preserves the democratic bona fides of our constitutional republic and also points us in the direction of rational, dignified existence — an existence that requires the discipline to control our fears and face adversity with the dignity appropriate to a free people — at this point, we have left the realm of scientific knowledge.      • David Marion is Elliott Emeritus Professor of Government and a faculty fellow at the Wilson Center for Leadership in the Public Interest at Hampden-Sydney College.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: The Trump administration issued new guidance this past week for religious institutions, calling churches and other places of worship “essential” institutions. Some critics have characterized the move as “siding with” churches, arguing that the decision was simply a political move to energize his base. But these critics have to answer two questions if they expect to be taken seriously. First, where is their outrage for other institutions that have been deemed “essential,” ranging from marijuana dispensaries to abortion clinics? Second, given that some exposure to risk is inevitable, why does reopening religious institutions under the appropriate guidelines pose a systematically larger risk? We take risks all the time — whether it’s driving in a car or getting take-out from a restaurant. So the mere presence of risk cannot be a deal breaker unless we want to get stuck in a constant paralysis of physical nihilism. Before unpacking these two important questions, it’s useful to take stock of the contribution that religious institutions play in the economy and, more broadly, society at large.

                               There is a large established scientific literature documenting that religious affiliation has played a major role in society, including the United States. Substantial empirical evidence exists linking religion with not only prosocial behavior (e.g., generosity and volunteerism), but also much lower risk with a wide array of deleterious outcomes, ranging from suicide to drug and alcohol abuse. These results that religion serves as a protective factor against many traumatic events throughout life hold across many different statistical samples and studies: Roughly 80 percent of studies on religion and spirituality finding a positive relationship between religion and measures of psychological well-being. In fact, not that the Great Recession of 2008-09 is a perfect analogue, but my recent research also shows that active Christians — those participating in a faith community and view faith as important for their daily life — were not only more likely to report that they were thriving and satisfied with their life overall, but also insensitive to local fluctuations in economy activity that depressed others’ self-reported well-being. Importantly, these results did not hold for those who simply answer the survey question saying that they ascribed to a particular faith — the protective effect of religion during the 2008 to 2017 period held only for those engaged with their church community. Admittedly, those ascribing to a secular worldview might interpret religion as a crutch that gives people false hope during crises. While that’s an important discussion to have, it’s beyond my pay grade. Rather, what is clear from the empirical literature is that religion is unambiguously linked with a wide array of measures of well-being and mental health, which is especially important during times of crisis.  Given the declines in mental health and rise in suicides over the course of the pandemic, and the large empirical literature that causally links these outcomes with economic declines, this isn’t just a debate for religious scholars to theorize over — it’s a public policy question and priority. Now, critics have argued that allowing for the reopening of houses of worship will pose unnecessary risk for the public health recovery. But the fact that there are such heterogeneous views here shouldn’t come as a surprise given that perceptions of policy actions during the COVID-19 pandemic have been best explained by political affiliation, rather than standard economic metrics. If these critics want to be taken seriously, why is it that they have said nothing about the many other institutions that have remained open in most states during the pandemic, such as marijuana dispensaries and abortion clinics? Given the obvious concerns with both of these, it is peculiar to say the least that ardent critics of the president have not raised their voice over these other “essential services.” Moreover, whether religious institutions pose a systematically greater risk to the spread of the virus is an open question. My recent research here shows that counties with greater social capital — which generally refers to levels of trust, shared norms, and relationships — had not only lower infection rates of COVID-19, but also lower growth rates in the spread of the virus.  Given that religious affiliation is one of the most important determinants of social capital, it seems likely that most religious institutions would be less likely to spread the virus, especially if the CDC guidelines are followed. Even Dr. Anthony Fauci has pointed out that the risk is not binary: “how you approach what you do in houses of worship really varies.” This means that each state and house of worship can apply the guidelines based on their own unique risk profile. While some might view President Trump’s decision as a political move, what matters to all of us is getting our country back to full health and economic dynamism. The empirical evidence here suggests that religious institutions are of central importance of human flourishing and unlikely to accelerate the spread or return of the virus. Haters are going to hate, but hopefully they can be more consistent. • Christos A.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: I see a war has broken out even as we talk of opening up our states’ economies. Perhaps I am overly-sensitive, but I get the feeling that there is serious disagreement between those who insist on covering their bodies to prevent the spread of the Wuhan virus and those who are taking their chances. The chance-takers wear no masks, no shields, no gloves, and absolutely never don one of those all-covering, full-body protective outfits that leave one looking like an astronaut in the Bulgarian space program. The full-coverage crowd I call the prophylactic wearers. The non-coverage crowd I call, well, I call them the non-coverage crowd.   Now in this battle over what protective attire is to be worn in public I intend to remain absolutely neutral. So far as I have been able to ascertain no one, neither among the prophylactic wearers nor among the non-coverage crowd, has taken me seriously on the one constructive recommendation that I have made during this crisis.  TOP STORIES

                               I suggested early on when Dr. Anthony Fauci and the pulchritudinous Dr. Deborah Birx were earnestly urging us to wash our hands after every possible exposure to the virus we go all the way. I suggested that we wash our hands and our feet. Possibly even blow your nose. Thus far I have heard nothing not even from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, not even from the Dial soap manufacturers. Nada from the handkerchief manufacturers.  Thus, I am staying out of the to-cover or not-to-cover controversy. In fact, I am staying home. I have undertaken a book assignment, and I am perhaps the only person who has not been in the least discommoded by the public health authorities of late with the possible exception of the president’s former lawyer Michael Cohen and his former campaign manager Paul Manafort. Both men have been released from prison because of the crisis and are finishing their sentences in the comfort of their own homes. I hope they at least will wash their hands and feet. What else do they have to do? Yet friends tell me it is getting pretty acrimonious out there in the grocery stores and the pharmacies, where both sides in the protective-attire battles are purchasing supplies. A lady told me the other day that she could not tell which side was more warlike. Both sides yelled at her when she stepped into the wrong lane.  These battles remind me of a coinage by the great Tom Wolfe. He coined the term “Championism” in his 2004 novel, “I Am Charlotte Simmons.” According to Tom, people suffer the “real emotions” of “exultation” or “depression” over the fate of those they deem their champions. They usually do not even know much about their champions, but by gum they are completely committed to him. They may have simply walked into a room and seen one team competing with another. Almost inadvertently they just find themselves pulling for that one team. They lose all sense of perspective because of “championism.” Now, as the battle lines are drawn between the prophylactic wearers and the non-coverage crowd, the political commentators will tell you it is all politics. The members of the non-coverage crowd are following the cues from our frolicsome, good-natured president, Donald Trump. The prophylactic wearers are serious, sober, followers of Dr. Fauci and the pulchritudinous Dr. Birx. Well, maybe they are. But allow me to add another thought. How about allowing a literary mind to have his say in the cacophony created by the voices of science and the political voices. There are among the millions of people dressed like they are ready for Halloween and the millions more dressed like normal human beings in an admittedly abnormal era those other citizens. The ones Tom Wolfe talked about. The ones who suffer from “championism.”  They are the people who walked through a room, saw a commentator shouting about COVID-19, and immediately went out and purchased a mask and gloves, and shield. There are others who were more relaxed. Possibly they left the room and purchased suntan lotion. Both sides are suffering the “exultation” or the “depression” of “championism.” The fact is, it seems to me, that not many people understand the Wuhan virus. So, go easy on each other, and as for me I am staying home, not because of a virus from China but because of a deadline. • R.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: Beware the contact tracing. The government wants it believed contact tracing is nothing but a simple friendly means of making sure Americans are protected from COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, both now and in the future, via testing, monitoring and providing necessary medical equipment and, in some cases, with supporting with quarantining. But there’s nothing friendly about it. Contact tracing is a frightening tracking and surveillance program that gives government near-total control of citizens. It’s billed as voluntary. But those who decline to participate are subject to legal enforcement at the hands of government. TOP STORIES

                               And on that last: That’s not opinion. That’s fact. That’s the government’s own language. Here’s the run-down of what’s coming on the heels of the coronavirus crisis — the “new normal,” as the health bureaucrats and left-leaning control freaks like to call it. First, the definition: Contact tracing is, at the root, a means of tracing where you’ve been and whom you’ve come into contact with, so as to give health professionals the knowledge they need to contain a disease’s spread. Sounds sensible, yes? Even by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s own definition, contact tracing sounds sensible. The CDC calls it a “core disease control measure employed by state and local health officials,” one that’s been employed, in fact, “for decades,” and one that’s decidedly a “key strategy to prevent the spread of COVID-19.” OK to that. But there’s a decided difference between self-reporting and with going where the government wants to go on this. This is where it veers off America’s course straight into communist country. On the CDC’s “Coronavirus Disease” webpage, “Principles of Contact Tracing,” is a section titled, “Social services and housing will be needed for contacts unable to separate themselves from others in their current living situation.” The section opens with this: “Separating contacts from people who are not exposed is critical to the success of any contact tracing effort and requires social supports for individual compliance and medical monitoring.” It goes on with this: “If possible, contacts should be asked to voluntarily stay home, monitor themselves and maintain social distancing from others.” And it finishes with this: “However, health departments have the authority to issue legal orders of quarantine, should the situation warrant that measure.” Disobey the government’s recommendation to quarantine — and the government has the authority to force a quarantine. How? By “legal orders.” How will those legal orders be enforced? Good question. The CDC, in that same section, gives clues: “Support services for consideration include but may not be limited to housing. …” Here comes the government, with some handy-dandy housing for quarantined individuals — just the kind of housing the could come in handy for those who either don’t have the means to self-quarantine, or who’ve been handed a “legal order” to quarantine. Oh, pishaw. This is America, land of the free — land of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA Act, with all its patient privacies and protections, right? That’s what H.R. 6666, the COVID-19 Testing, Reaching And Contacting Everyone Act, or TRACE Act, from Rep. Bobby Rush, Illinois Democrat, would have believed, anyway. H.R. 6666 calls for $100 billion to be spent in fiscal 2020 to “award grants to eligible entities to conduct diagnostic testing for COVID-19, to trace and monitor the contacts of infected individuals, and to support the quarantine of such contacts through mobile health units” and “as necessary, testing individuals and providing individuals with services related to testing and quarantine at their residences,” according to the text of the bill. And it makes clear that nothing in the bill would violate Americans’ health privacies and rights to choose — or, rights to refuse. That’s bunk. Government at your door? Government at your door to monitor COVID-19 patients? Government at your door to quarantine citizens? The “eligible entities” who get the $100 billion to do all this testing include medical professionals, nonprofit officials, and health people tied to public schools, high schools, colleges and other places of higher learning. Oh, and “any other” source deemed acceptable by the secretary of Health and Human Services, working with the director of the CDC. Count on this: Your children, tested, at school, for COVID-19 — or, for any other transmissible disease to come in the future that’s deemed a danger by federal, state and local health wonks. Back to the CDC COVID-19 contact tracing page. “Communities need a large number of trained contact tracers,” CDC reports. “The time to start building the trained workforce is now.” Johns Hopkins just released a training course for would-be contact tracers — and given all the folk put out of work by government stay-at-home orders, no doubt, there are a lot these would-be’s out there. And as Eagle Forum reported, some of the language put forth in this training is concerning at best, outright frightening at worst. In a section about dealing with the issue of autonomy and the right of the patient-slash-citizen to choose his or her own health care, the Johns Hopkins training video goes like this: “[E]ach person can make their own decisions. This is true unless the decisions they make or the things they do can harm someone else. And we all know that this is true. And in the case of contact tracing, it means that people can make their own decisions. But if they’re not isolating themselves or not quarantining themselves, that could harm someone else. It does put other people at risk so they do have some limits on their autonomy, or their ability to make their own decisions within the context of contact tracing.” In other words: Participate — or be deemed a hazard to health. And those who are deemed hazards to health are obviously incapable of making their own decisions. So the government must make those decisions for them. See the threats to individual freedoms here? What a tangled web that’s woven. The CDC puts out advisements and guidance. The Democrats in Congress put out the funding mechanism to carry out these same advisements and guidance. Johns Hopkins puts out the training guidelines for those hired to carry out those federal advisements and guidance. The states and localities carry the water from there. By the time the advisements and guidance come knocking on citizens’ doors — they’re in the form of orders and mandates. Don’t we already have that example in modern-day COVID-19 times, where the federal government, meaning the White House, recommends one thing, but states, meaning the governors, then take it to executive order extremes and make those recommendations into mandates? Yes, yes we do. But the CDC, Rush and his bill cosponsors, Johns Hopkins, and all the contact tracing partners at the state and local levels of government get to maintain plausible deniability on force. They all get to pretend that participation in contact tracing is voluntary — and that the only citizens who would refuse to volunteer are the citizens who are unable to make their own decisions due to some sort of psychological issue that could cause harm to self or others. It’s an utterly frightening government takeover of Americans’ freedoms, of citizens’ individual rights. Now add technology to contact tracing — and feel the real chill. Again, from the CDC’s own site: “Case investigation, contact tracing and contact follow-up and monitoring will need to be linked with timely testing, clinical services and agile data management systems to facilitate real-time electronic transmission of laboratory and case data for public health action.” Real-time data collection. Real-time public health action. How’s the government going to do that? The CDC is pushing for “proximity tracking” — “tools that use Bluetooth or GPS to track an individual’s exposure to cases.” That’s bureau-speak for government surveillance and tracking of individuals, in real-time. In smartphone time. In smartphone app times. What a surveillance society that’ll be. It’ll give government the power to see where the paths of COVID-19 patients cross with the paths of those who don’t have COVID-19; to alert those who don’t have COVID-19 of the paths they just crossed with those who have COVID-19; to go to the homes of those who were exposed to COVID-19 and test them, and monitor them, and quarantine them. And if need be, to get a legal order to quarantine them. Welcome to the “new normal” the left wants for America — a country of communist collectivism and total government control. Resist now, or forever our freedoms will vanish. • Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley. Listen to her podcast “Bold and Blunt” by clicking HERE.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: Writing and making public one’s opinions guarantees people will respond. Writers, performers and every human likely desire his or her thoughts, and even their life, to matter to others. The alternative is to become hermits. Like other opinion writers, I get my share of positive and negative letters, but during the Trump administration the level of invective for those questioning anything the president says seems to have become more intense. President Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are in a verbal battle that resembles schoolyard behavior I recall as a child: “Your mother wears combat boots,” said one kid. “Oh yeah, well your mother is (something I can’t print).” Fisticuffs or shoving soon followed before a teacher broke it up.

                               Mrs. Pelosi recently said the president has “doggy-doo on his shoes.” The president responded that the speaker has “mental problems.” He’s said worse about her, but it’s hard to imagine she could top (or bottom) the “doggy-doo” remark. Many people have written in response to my column last week on the danger of promoting hydroxychloroquine when the FDA, NIH and experienced physicians have said it is not recommended for prevention or treatment of COVID-19. Mr. Trump said he has taken the drug for two weeks to protect himself. I wrote that I recalled the number of snake oil salesmen who have been part of a history of medical quackery. While saying the president is not one of those, some readers took more than offense at what they considered the link and they let me know it. Some sent “proof” that the drug is effective for treating the coronavirus, but many of their sources lacked credibility. They ignored the sources I mentioned. I was called “stupid” and an “idiot” (is there a difference?) for daring to question the president’s repeated endorsement of the drug. One emailer said by writing that one column I had lost “all credibility.” I wonder if, after a very long career in journalism, there was ever a time when the writer believed I had credibility? Name-calling has become common in the Internet age and 24/7 news cycle. Increasingly, people read, or tune into, only those things that reinforce their beliefs. This is as dangerous as eating an unbalanced diet. Calling someone names does nothing to advance an argument. Debate is better, but that, too, seems to be on the endangered species list. A clever insult is far better than name-calling. A long-ago comment by a long-forgotten congressman about a colleague remains one of my favorite insults: “I have a minimum high regard for the gentleman.” The best response to an insult, though, is an ancient one: “A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger” (Proverbs 15:1). I tried that one on a recent correspondent and she apologized for the words she used. That created a dialogue, rather than a hostile confrontation and we were able to exchange views in a civil manner. No one I know has ever had his or her mind changed in response to incivility. My grandmother once threatened to “wash my mouth out with soap” if I even dared to say anything that violated her sense of decorum. That had a deterrent effect on me. Perhaps, if I were to give into my lower nature, I would respond to insults by saying that if they are writing me they aren’t writing ransom notes, but that would be uncivil and the ghost of my grandmother might return with a bar of soap in hand. • Cal Thomas, a nationally syndicated columnist, is the author of “America’s Expiration Date: The Fall of Empires, Superpowers and the United States” (HarperCollins/Zondervan, January 2020).

ANALYSIS/OPINION: The economy is in more dire straits than Washington politicians behave, and they need to put aside their partisan agendas and fencing on Twitter to save it. The Labor Department reported 20 million jobs lost in April, raising unemployment to 14.7 percent, and government statisticians believe the chaos caused serious undercounting. Adding idled workers still receiving payments from employers but incorrectly classified as employed, and those shut in, unable to look for work and hence not counted in the labor force, the jobless rate jumps to 23.5 percent. The survey was conducted in mid-April, but millions more filed for unemployment benefits during the weeks that followed, putting the real unemployment rate well above the 24.9 percent Great Depression peak.

                               Most visible are lost jobs in restaurants, airlines, non-emergency health care and entertainment, but a second wave is unfolding along the supply chain. For example, Boeing and GE’s aircraft engine division are girding for depressed air travel for several years, and cleaners, caterers, other business and child care services are losing customers. Half of small businesses may be closed permanently, and two in five displaced workers will never return to former jobs. Many newspapers are suffocating from lost ad revenue. Both political parties have been eager to exploit the crisis to stuff their long-term ideological agendas into stimulus packages — such as lopsided rules favoring unions for Democrats and tax breaks often favored by Republicans. Aid is arriving too late and with too many strings for quick distribution. Means testing slowed stimulus checks, and onerous bureaucratic conditions forced many small businesses to pass on grants and loans. All the bickering and bargaining delays the fire brigade while the economy is burning. The latest is the $500 billion in fiscal assistance requested by state governors. House Democrats painstakingly wasted time drafting a $3 trillion bill that includes sweet spots rich in Democratic votes and will result in weeks of wrangling with Senate Republicans. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell warns no bill gets past the Senate without tort reform. President Trump wants aid tied to sanctuary city policies. A package will emerge because neither party wants to bear blame for draconian school spending cuts but not before a lot more carnage in the economy. Earlier relief packages sent $150 billion to the states, but most of that was for extraordinary COVID-19 expenses. The recession has cost the states and municipal governments at least $270 billion in lost sales and income tax revenues, as well as from excise taxes on theater tickets, hotels and other services. Municipalities are cutting back on garbage collection and other basic health and safety services. State and local governments have shed 1 million workers — and that’s before they finally come to terms with slashing budgets for the second half of this year and next. State and local governments still employ 19 million — more than manufacturing and construction combined. To avoid Armageddon, Congress should quickly pass a plain vanilla $500 billion aid package and let the governors sort it.     Instead, as with the $3 trillion in packages that sent payments to households, small businesses, the airlines and others, Congress and the administration will burden the bill with lots of conditions and politically targeted complexity, the money will arrive too late to save millions of jobs. The public schools — trying terribly hard to protect students, faculty and staff by relying more on digital learning solutions — simply won’t have the cash needed to function effectively. The governors have given conservative lawmakers and Mr. Trump good cause to stiff them. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo faced down President Trump regarding authority to reopen New York’s economy and formed a coalition of Northeastern states but is now calling for an active federal partner in Washington to address his state’s financial problems. Gov. Gavin Newsom has repeatedly asserted California is a nation state. Fine, let Sacramento borrow in the bond market and raise taxes further, and see what that does to its credit rating and how many folks with professional skills — other than tech magnates residing in gated estates — still want to live in his paradise for the homeless and illegal immigrants. As for Mr. McConnell, it’s the pique of indifference to suggest that states and municipalities look to bankruptcy and higher taxes. States are as critical to the national economy, and nothing would slow solutions more than a trip through creditor reorganization, litigation and more taxes. Responsibility for the national economy still resides along Pennsylvania Avenue between the Oval Office and Capitol Dome. • Peter Morici is an economist and business professor at the University of Maryland, and a national columnist.  Manage Newsletters Copyright © 2020 The Washington Times, LLC.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: Great plagues have changed the course of history. Best known is the Black Death (1347-51), introduced to Europe from Asia through trade routes, carried by rats and transmitted by fleas.  This bubonic plague killed up to one-third to one-half of the population of Europe, almost literally burying the old social order that was medieval feudalism, wiping the slate clean for the rise of mercantilism, the Age of Exploration and the Renaissance.

                               Lesser known is the Antonine Plague (165-180 A.D.), introduced to the Roman Empire through trade with Asia, probably the measles or smallpox. The Antonine Plague, according to contemporary accounts, caused 2,000 deaths daily in Rome, an estimated 5 million deaths throughout the Empire, and devastated the Roman legions, hampering defense of the eastern and northern frontiers.  According to Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, for whom the plague is named, writing from his camp on the Rhine: “With their ranks thinned by the epidemic, Roman armies were now unable to push the tribes back.” (Macromannic Wars) The Plague of Justinian (541-542 A.D.), introduced to the Mediterranean and Europe from Asia, is one of the deadliest plagues in history, possibly the bubonic plague and rehearsal for the later Black Death. An estimated 25 million to 100 million died, perhaps as much as half the population of Europe. Byzantine historian Procopius, who eyewitnessed the Plague of Justinian, reports that in the capital, Constantinople, 10,000 died daily. He bitterly criticized Emperor Justinian for making matters worse with oppressive taxation, indifferent to the plague’s economic devastation: “When pestilence swept through the whole known world and notably the Roman Empire, wiping out most of the farming community and of necessity leaving a trail of devastation in its wake, Justinian showed no mercy towards the ruined freeholders. Even then, he did not refrain from demanding the annual tax, not only the amount at which he assessed every individual, but also the amount for which his deceased neighbors were liable.” (Procopius, Anekdota 558 A.D.)  The Plague of Justinian is one of the most consequential in history — preventing resurrection of a reunited Roman Empire: “The plague’s long-term effects on European and Christian history were enormous … The plague weakened the Byzantine Empire at a critical point, when Justinian’s armies had nearly retaken all of Italy and the western Mediterranean … the evolving conquest would have reunited the core of the Western Roman Empire with the Eastern Roman Empire.” (Cyril Mango, “Byzantium: The Empire of New Rome,” 1980) The plague buried the last chance for continuity of classical civilization in Western Europe, bringing on the Dark Ages. Perhaps the deadliest, most consequential, and most tragic plague in history has no name.  In the three centuries (1500-1800) after Columbus discovered America, European diseases, including smallpox and measles, to which Native American populations had no immunity, spread like wildfire through the New World, from Tierra del Fuego in the South to the Arctic Circle, killing 90 percent or more, emptying the continents of their original peoples. Happily, the coronavirus is proving far less deadly than the great plagues of history, with a mortality rate continually being revised downward, now much less than 1 percent. Coronavirus hardly deserves to be described as a plague at all. Nonetheless, the unprecedented reaction, many would say overreaction, of U.S. and allied governments — to contain the coronavirus by mass social isolation and suspending all but the most essential economic activity — may well have catastrophic consequences for Western Civilization. In three months, the U.S. economy has gone from being the most prosperous in history into a deepening New Great Depression from which there may be no quick recovery. More than 39 million Americans are unemployed, some 15 percent of the workforce, eclipsing the worst of the 1930s Great Depression. $6 trillion in new debt has been added, virtually overnight, by U.S. government spending on so-called “coronavirus recovery” to mitigate the disastrous effects of government-imposed unemployment and small-business closures. White House hopes for quick recovery sound like socialist fantasies about the miraculous power of government economic planning, not free market realism.  Government can strangle the “golden goose” but not force its corpse to lay eggs, as the Emperor Justinian discovered. Defense Secretary Mark Esper no longer talks about defense increases, but instead hopes for “flat” future defense budgets. But a New Great Depression means deep defense cuts, sharp decline of U.S. military power and a more dangerous world. The Pentagon needs to re-focus priorities on defense investments that buy the most security at the least cost. For example, space-based missile defense can shield America from growing nuclear and hypersonic missile threats in just five years for $20 billion. EMP and cyber-protection of electric grids and life-sustaining critical infrastructures can be achieved without spending defense dollars. The coronavirus New Great Depression may be our Plague of Justinian. It happens just when President Trump was rebuilding economic and military strength possibly capable of sustaining the post-1945 world order led by the United States — call it “Pax Americana.” Now, saving Pax Americana may be as unrealistic as Justinian’s hopes to resurrect the Roman Empire. As Justinian learned, when there is no money to pay the legions, the barbarians win. • Peter Vincent Pry, director of the Task Force on National and Homeland Security, served as chief of staff on the Congressional EMP Commission, and on the staffs of the House Armed Service Committee and the CIA.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: Good news (please see the accompanying table)! If you are under 65, in reasonably good health and do not have a vitamin D deficiency, you have only a tiny chance of dying from COVID-19. And if you are younger than 34, your chances of dying from the virus are so small as to be almost statistically undetectable. On the other hand, if you are 85 or older, are in a nursing home, have serious health problems and a vitamin D deficiency, you may be in real danger if you are exposed to the virus — but only a tiny portion of the population is in such a condition. The U.S. population is about 330 million, and the number of people who die each year from all causes is about 2.85 million or a bit less than 1 percent. To date, less than 100,000 people in the United States have died from COVID-19 or three-hundreds of 1 percent. (The peak in deaths appears to have already occurred but even if the number of deaths doubles from the current level, which is most unlikely, the total will be well under one-tenth of 1 percent).

                               Political leaders have shut down much of the world economy on the basis of bad information and the failure to ask the right questions. Any action to try to stop the spread of the virus should have been accompanied with a competent estimate of how many net lives would be saved by the action.  Net lives means how many people would die from COVID-19 compared to all of the additional lives lost through delayed diagnoses and treatments of cancer, heart disease and all other ailments due to the COVID-19 shutdown. The number of additional suicides and the misery of losing tens of thousands of small businesses, and the loss of liberty also needed to be factored in. Very little of any of that was done. Early in the year, the leaders of the World Health Organization (WHO) said the virus was unlikely to be transmitted from human to human (given its animal origin) and probably would not be a big threat. It soon became apparent that WHO had been wrong, and the threat was real. The folks at WHO were soon exposed as Chinese puppets — Communists lying? Who would have thought? A group out of Imperial College in the U.K., promoted a model that forecast 2 million or so deaths in the U.S. and millions elsewhere from the virus. This caused panic among the medical, political and media elites, which resulted in the worldwide shutdown. The model turned out to be deeply flawed, overstating the likely death toll by over 20-fold (aka gross incompetence, or worse). The fraudulent model was neither closely examined initially, nor rejected because it served certain political and media interests. Political opponents of President Trump were quick to blame him for not acting quickly enough, while ignoring the fact that when he shut down China travel on Jan. 31, they had criticized him for overreacting.  The media loved the story because fear sells newspapers and increases TV ratings, and they could blame it on the hated Mr. Trump. But as is typical with the many in the media, they did not think beyond stage I, and as the economy was needlessly sent into the tank, advertisers withdrew. Circulation and ratings may be up, but fewer advertisers are paying the freight, so many of those who promoted the panic are and will be losing their jobs. Ah, divine justice. Serious scholars, like Professor Anne Marie Knott of Washington University in St. Louis, a mathematician who also understands economics, has prepared a very clear short presentation, “Why you haven’t caught COVID-19,” explaining how the data demonstrates that most people, especially the young, will never contract the virus and for those who do, most will have a totally benign or mild reaction. Her presentation may be found on YouTube at: Anne Marie Knott: Why you haven’t caught COVID-19. Again, the only real danger is for a very small percentage of people over 65, except for those 85 and older, who have other serious problems. Ms. Knott’s analysis clearly shows that the costs of the shutdown are greatly exceeding the benefits. Mr. Trump, the political leaders in both parties, and particularly the mainstream media were too easily seduced by well-meaning “experts” like Dr. Anthony Fauci. Most of the medical experts, understandably, have a very narrow focus and do not fully consider total costs and benefits of their recommendations and actions. Now that we have sufficient global data and “petri dish” experiments (from U.S. Navy and commercial cruise ships that were quarantined for more than 14 days) to understand the real risks to various groups) there is no longer justification for most restrictions on those under 65. Resources should be concentrated on the elderly with underlying conditions — and the rest of humanity should be allowed to go free and resume normal lives. • Richard W.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: Did you hear the good news? Liberty University, which the media predicted would be Ground Zero  for a deadly outbreak of coronavirus, has not reported a single  on-campus case. Not one. This is welcome news to any person of goodwill. But not to the press. TOP STORIES

                               In March, the media went bat crazy, essentially accusing Liberty  President Jerry Falwell Jr. of risking mass murder by welcoming some  students back from spring break. The New York Times headline on March 29 was “Liberty University Brings Back Its Students, and Coronavirus, Too.” No, it did not. Most students stayed home. Mr. Falwell welcomed back  to the dorms those students who would have put themselves more at risk  by traveling, especially those from overseas. The college followed  strict health guidelines such as social distancing, and recommended that  students use online programs. On March 30, The Washington Post ran an editorial, “Irresponsible  decisions like Jerry Falwell Jr.’s put untold numbers of people at  risk.” The Post cited The New York Times’ contention that about a dozen  Liberty students “were sick with symptoms that suggested COVID-19.” It turns out that the students had common colds or the flu or  something other than COVID-19. Only one student tested positive, and he  was living off-campus. Several other universities, such as Rutgers, Pepperdine, Valencia and  Texas A&M, introduced similar policies, but only Liberty was  singled out for a press whipping. Well, why not? The media have hated the college since 1971, when  Moral Majority founder Jerry Falwell Sr. established it to give  Christians an alternative to “mainstream” academia. The sad truth is  that most colleges have morphed into Marxist hothouses where U.S.  history courses have given way to transgender studies, multiculturalism  and identity politics, and where students learn to despise their  country. Liberty offers a traditional curriculum, attracting students from all  over the United States and abroad, making it one of the largest private  universities in America. With 15,000 students on campus and 100,000  students online, Jerry Falwell’s dream has become a nightmare for the  progressive left. Added to the mix is Jerry Falwell Jr.’s outspoken support of  President Trump, before and after his election. Mr. Trump was Liberty’s  commencement speaker in 2017. On the other hand, Mr. Falwell’s sometimes  Trump-like retorts to critics may indicate that the New York wise guy  could be influencing Mr. Falwell more than the other way around. But we can’t get into either man’s head and see their actual mindset. Unlike the press, that is. On May 17, Washington Post editors looked into their handy replica of  Mr. Trump’s right-hand palm, read the lines, and came up with this in  the Sunday Outlook section: “Coronavirus testing is about saving lives.  Trump thinks it’s just about numbers, says journalist Fintan O’Toole.” In the same edition, fellow soothsayer Ruth Marcus’ column was  headlined: “To Trump, winning is all that matters.” Really? He has no  other motives? And he only thinks about numbers? Well, what do you expect from a very bad man with orange hair, as  he’s depicted each week in The Post comics section by Doonesbury  cartoonist Garry Trudeau, who is hopelessly locked in a “Hate Nixon”  mode updated to the Trump era? To underscore Mr. Trump’s assumed moral turpitude, The Post (and  we’re still working on the May 17 edition here) sent reporters all the  way to West Java, Indonesia, so they could produce a two-page spread  with a big color picture of a construction site. The headline: “Trump’s  business partner digs up graves to build resort.” Perhaps this is actually newsworthy. It’s usually the Democrats who commune with the dead, especially around Election Day. Well, if the Russian collusion smear didn’t work, and the Ukraine  phone call impeachment attempt is collapsing into a Biden disaster, why  not go for guilt by association? Talk about digging for a scandal. Back on Page One, The Post accused Mr. Trump of a “retaliatory purge”  because he fired the State Department inspector general who had  apparently been more at home when Mr. Obama was in the White House. Finally, the lead editorial on May 17, “The absurd cynicism of  ‘Obamagate,’” claims that “Mr. Trump would like to rewrite history,  making it seem as though the Russian investigation lacked firm grounding  and that a sinister Obama administration plot explains the misdeeds  that his own people committed.” Why, yes, that’s where the evidence has led, with the FBI being  exposed for its persecution of Gen. Michael Flynn and its “Crossfire  Hurricane” plan to prevent or cripple the Trump presidency. If you thumbed all the way through the May 17 edition of The Post,  you would be convinced that we are in the grip of a power-mad  authoritarian president. But what a difference a day makes. On May 18, The Post’s front page had this: “Trump seems poised to let  others lead on reopening: Governors, businesses make key calls as  critics see shrinking presidency.” Shrinking presidency? Well, which is it? Is he an overreaching authoritarian or a shrinking president? Likewise, will we ever learn whether Jerry Falwell Jr. has psychic  powers like a Post writer, or was he just lucky that he was right about  the coronavirus policy? Inquiring readers may never know. • Robert Knight is a contributor to The Washington Times. His website is roberthknight.com.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: Donald Trump won the presidency by riding a wave of common sense politicking that wasn’t so much politicking as it was speaking truth to patriot power — by condemning the senseless killings of American citizens at the hands of previously deported illegals, for instance, or by calling out the Democrats in the Republican Party who were working with elitist globalists to undercut U.S. sovereignty. And since then, on Make America Great Again ideals, on America First principles, Trump hasn’t disappointed. He’s been great for the economy, great for the little business guy, great for the voices of those mocked and derided and dismissed by the previous administration. He’s been nothing short of stupendous on fighting the D.C. cabal. He’s been bold, brash and oft-braggadocio — and bluntly put, a breath of fresh air in a field of snobbish elitism. But then came the coronavirus. And the mighty Trump has stumbled, taking with him, an entire nation of suffering Americans — minus the hand-rubbing gleeful Democrats using COVID-19 to best political advantage, of course.

                               Call this is a tough love moment. But Trump is leader of the free world, and is ultimately to blame for the ravaging of the Constitution and the dire economic condition of this nation due to COVID-19. As Harry S. Truman might say — as Harry S. Truman did say — “The buck stops here.” The buck stops at the desk of the one in charge. Trump never should have practically ceded the White House stage to medical bureaucrats and scientists like Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a practical proxy for billionaire Bill “Vaccine the World” Gates, a fawning supporter of World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, or to even global health expert Deborah Birx —amicably inclined to this administration as she seems. Trump, unknowingly, diluted his own authority. The fact is doctors are fallible. Doctors are also, well, doctors. They’re not economists. They’re not small business owners. They’re not farmers. They’re not teachers. They’re not politicians. They’re not even supposed to be political, right? (Yet they are.) They’re doctors, trained in the art of giving the best doctorly advice about whatever medical issue is presented and, in this sue-happy world we call modern America, to do so in a way that relieves them of any sort of legal liability. Give a doctor a headache patient and there’s a patient headed for a battery of expensive medical tests and prescription pills, yes? Enter the coronavirus. Give a doctor a COVID-19 patient and there’s a patient headed for worst-case scenario preventive treatments. Facts and science and truths be danged. So went the advisements of Fauci and Birx and all the other medical experts who emerged from offices and dark corners to speak, with whatever authorities they could muster from their higher-university lineages of learning. Their advisements were all based on best-guessed, worst-case cautions. They ratcheted up fears to the point their advisements and cautions trickled into the states and localities as mandates and orders. They admitted what they didn’t know; they acknowledged what they couldn’t predict with accuracy. But that didn’t stop the train of executive orders and unconstitutional crackdowns on civil, individual rights from steamrolling across America. This is where Trump stumbled. Trump could’ve balanced out the White House medical fear-mongering messaging with truths about the unreliable computer modeling; with truths about the conflicted interests of cash-strapped hospitals to inflate COVID-19 cases; with truths about the comparison of this virus with others — with comparison of the political response to this virus with others. Trump could’ve brought forward entrepreneurs to the White House podium to speak of their sad stories of forced government shutdowns of their businesses; or farmers, to show the devastations of dumped dairy and destroyed crops; or fitness club owners, to tell of dashed dreams and shuttered businesses. He could’ve cited statistics on suicides and rising alcoholism. He could’ve pointed to the outrage of keeping open marijuana shops, while shutting churches — the absurdities of sending police to chase down beach-goers and arrest mask-less subway riders. He could’ve invited social services’ experts to the Rose Garden to speak on the horrible increases in child sex abuse, or domestic violence, due to forced shut-downs, due to stay-at-home mandates. He could’ve balanced out the dire doctor predictions with somber statements from economists, entrepreneurs, from civil rights attorneys and constitutional experts, from church leaders, from psychologists and mental health professionals — all who could’ve given the sort of contextual analysis that went missing from this whole fear-fueled COVID-19 political response. Trump, in short, could’ve changed the messaging. Trump could have given a national tutorial on the uses and abuses of power. He could’ve better controlled the message. He could’ve condemned the knee-jerk messaging. He could’ve been the cooler head in the room, the one giving balance and context and calm-amid-the-storm leadership. He could’ve kept the doctors on a tighter leash, behind closed doors, so the media — the Trump-hating media — couldn’t take their statements and politicize them, use them to pack the biggest political punch. He could’ve kept the medical wonks as simply voices on a team of many — on a team that provided a more balanced, nuanced look at COVID-19 and its outcomes. And he could’ve been the guy who considered all those voices, all those recommendations, all those concerns and advisements and warnings, and who took the White House stage to make clear: This is the way it will be. This is the way it will not be. He could’ve reminded, daily, the out-of-control pols that in America, rights come from God, and cannot be trampled by government at whim. And then he could’ve harped daily on the emerging failures of science to bring forth the predicted gloom and doom of COVID-19 — as proof of the logic, say, of keeping America open for business. As underscore of the need, say, of keeping intact the Constitution. “Lockdowns failed to alter course of pandemic and are now destroying millions of livelihoods worldwide, JP Morgan study claims,” The Daily Mail wrote, in a head-shakingly regretful headline, just published this week. Trump had a chance to take a headline like that and say — see? America will not cower in fear. See? America has no need to cower in fear. But he stumbled. He misstepped. He now stands as mistaken as the fear mongers on this. And yet, still, Trump deserves another chance. Trump, for the good of the country, for the fate of our nation, needs to win a second White House term — he needs to stay around a while longer and beat back the elitists and globalists and socialists and worse who are hungering for our nation’s soul. He needs to fight off the leftists who have used COVID-19 to political advantage, and who are at this very point in time plotting to use another COVID-19-like crisis for even more political advantage. But he can’t make another mistake like this. America can’t afford another COVID-19. This country won’t survive another round. He needs to use his bully pit — his Twitter feed — his White House platform and the rest to take control of the COVID-19 dialogue and force a return to more MAGA times. America needs Trump to be Trump. • Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley. Listen to her podcast “Bold and Blunt” by clicking HERE.
