Three days after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer urged Michiganders to “Google” how to cut their own hair during the ongoing coronavirus-related restrictions, the Democratic governor was spotted marching with her hands raised among throngs of George Floyd protesters in Detroit Thursday. A video tweeted by WXYZ Detroit showed Ms. Whitmer purportedly violating her own social distancing orders by marching shoulder-to-shoulder with protesters. In the video, the governor wore a face mask with her arms raised as protesters chanted, “Hands up, don’t shoot.” .@GovWhitmer @LtGovGilchrist and Bishop Charles Ellis lead a group of marchers in Detroit honoring the life of #GeorgeFloyd.

                               “Elections matter,” Ms. Whitmer said during the march, The Detroit News reported. “We cannot be  defeated. We must move forward together. When we do that, we cannot be  defeated.” According to the state administration’s website, “Persons  may engage in expressive activities protected by the First Amendment  within the State of Michigan, but must adhere to social distancing  measures recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,  including remaining at least six feet from people from outside the  person’s household.” But Whitmer  spokeswoman Tiffany Brown denied the governor broke any rules. “The governor took precautions for engaging in an  outdoor activity, including wearing a mask even though it is not  required outdoors under the order,” Ms. Brown told The Detroit News. “Nothing in this order shall be taken to abridge protections  guaranteed by the state or federal constitution.” “That includes the right to peaceful protest,” she added. Just Monday, Ms. Whitmer said she had a “high level” of  concern about the Floyd protests potentially spreading the new coronavirus. Last month, she repeatedly criticized the anti-lockdown protesters who advocated for the reopening of the state’s economy. “The  fact of the matter is these protests, in a perverse way, make it  likelier that we are going to have to stay in a stay-home posture,”  Ms. Whitmer said of the anti-lockdown protesters on May 13, The Detroit News reported. “The whole point of them, supposedly, is that they  don’t want to be doing that.” On Monday, after violent protests swept the country for the sixth straight night over Floyd’s death, Ms. Whitmer urged residents to Google how to cut their own hair while hair salons and barbershops remain closed. “If you’re one of those people that’s going to  Ohio [for a haircut], I hope and pray that  you are doing your part not  to bring COVID-19 home,” the governor said Monday, referring to the disease caused by the coronavirus. “If you haven’t  resorted to that,  Google how to do a haircut, or throw your hair in a  ponytail or curl it  and get through the next couple of weeks so we can  resume some of  these things.” While the entire state has moved onto phase 4 of  reopening, which  includes dine-in bars and restaurants and retail stores, salons and  barbershops remain closed. Ms. Whitmer will update the state on its COVID-19 response at 11 a.m. Friday.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the federal government’s top infectious diseases expert, on Friday urged caution for those attending the massive George Floyd protests across the country as the coronavirus continues to present a threat to public health. Dr. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that being in such large crowds, chanting, and the chaos that has come out from some of the demonstrations are setting up dangerous conditions to spread COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. “It’s a perfect set-up for further spread of the virus in terms of creating some blips that could turn into some surges,” he told WTOP. “There certainly is a risk.” TOP STORIES

                               National unrest sparked after the deaths of Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor have renewed the painful debate of racial tensions and police brutality in the U.S. Earlier this week, a group of 1,288 “public-health officials, infectious disease professions, and community stakeholders” published an open letter endorsing the widespread protests as “vital to the national public health.” “Staying at home, social distancing, and public masking are effective at minimizing the spread of COVID-19,” they wrote. “To the extent possible, we support the application of these public health best practices during demonstrations that call attention to the pervasive lethal force of white supremacy.” In his interview, Dr. Fauci endorsed peaceful protests, but he urged demonstrators to keep their masks on at all times. “It’s important to exercise your constitutional right to be able to demonstrate. But it’s a delicate balance because the reasons for demonstrating are valid, but the demonstration puts one at additional risk,” he said. As of Friday morning, there were 1,874,411 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 108,238  deaths  in the U.S., according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The U.S. population is more than 300 million.

The unemployment rate fell to a better-than-expected 13.3% in May, the Labor Department said Friday, in the strongest signal yet that the economy has turned the corner from the coronavirus shutdowns. “This recovery begins today,” Vice President Mike Pence declared in an interview on CNBC. The jobless rate was more than 1 point lower than April’s rate of 14.7%, as employers added about 2.5 million jobs. There were job gains in hospitality and retail, as almost every sector increased hiring. An exception was local governments, which shed about 500,000 jobs.

                               President Trump quickly scheduled a news conference at the White House on the jobs report. The turnaround has implications for his reelection prospects, suggesting that the economy could be in stronger-than-expected shape through the summer and fall. Mr. Trump tweeted Friday, “Really Big Jobs Report. Great going President Trump (kidding but true)!” The unexpectedly positive report prompted major stock indexes to soar. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose more than 900 points, or about 3.5%, by mid-day; the S&P 500 rose 2.8% and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 2.2%. Many economists, including some at the White House, had forecast the unemployment rate in May to climb to nearly 20% and for job losses to reach 7 million for the month. In March and April, employers shed 21.4 million jobs as nearly all states ordered nonessential businesses to close. Despite the encouraging report, top congressional Democrats renewed their call for the Senate to approve a $3 trillion coronavirus relief package passed by the House three weeks ago. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard E. Neal, Massachusetts Democrat, noted that expanded unemployment benefits are scheduled to expire next month and tens of millions of Americans are still out of work. “Our country is in crisis,” Mr. Neal said. “Nearly 110,000 Americans have died due to COVID-19, and more than 42 million are out of work. Longstanding systemic injustices in our nation are front and center; they’re the reason communities of color disproportionately feel the health and economic effects of this pandemic, and they’re what have prompted thousands of people in all 50 states to take to the streets in peaceful protest. Yet as millions remain out of work and American deaths continue to multiply, Senate Republicans look the other way and refuse to take action.” Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said of the report, “The great American comeback is underway after the economy was artificially interrupted by the global pandemic.” “Incredibly, Joe Biden is counting on more economic pain for Americans so he can capitalize on it politically,” he said of the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. “It is disgusting and sad that Biden and the Democrats are openly worrying that America will get back to work because it would be bad news for them.”

COLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France (AP) — At least the dead will always be there. All too many have been, for 76 years since that fateful June 6 on  France’s Normandy beaches, when allied troops in 1944 turned the course  of World War II and went on to defeat fascism in Europe in one of the  most remarkable feats in military history. Forgotten they will never be. Revered, yes. But Saturday’s  anniversary will be one of the loneliest remembrances ever, as the  coronavirus pandemic is keeping almost everyone away — from government  leaders to frail veterans who might not get another chance for a final  farewell to their unlucky comrades. TOP STORIES

                               Rain and wind are also forecast, after weeks of warm, sunny weather. “The sadness is almost too much, because there is no one,” said local  guide Adeline James. “Plus you have their stories. The history is sad  and it’s even more overwhelming now between the weather, the (virus)  situation and, and, and.” The locals in this northwestern part of France have come out year  after year to show their gratitude for the soldiers from the United  States, Britain, Canada and other countries who liberated them from  Adolf Hitler’s Nazi forces. Despite the lack of international crowds, David Pottier still went  out to raise American flags in the Calvados village of Mosles,  population 356, which was liberated by allied troops the day after the  landing on five Normandy beachheads. In a forlorn scene, a gardener tended to the parched grass around the  small monument for the war dead, while Pottier, the local mayor, was  getting the French tricolor to flutter next to the Stars and Stripes. “We have to recognize that they came to die in a foreign land,” Pottier said. “We miss the GIs,” he said of the U.S. soldiers. The pandemic has wreaked havoc across the world, infecting 6.6  million people, killing over 391,000 and devastating economies. It poses  a particular threat to the elderly  - like the surviving D-Day veterans  who are in their late nineties or older. It has also affected the younger generations who turn out every year  to mark the occasion. Most have been barred from traveling to the  windswept coasts of Normandy. Some 160,000 soldiers made the perilous crossing from England that  day in atrocious conditions, storming dunes which they knew were heavily  defended by German troops determined to hold their positions. Somehow, they succeeded. Yet they left a trail of thousands of casualties who have been mourned for generations since. Last year stood out, with U.S. President Donald Trump joining his  French counterpart Emmanuel Macron at the American cemetery in  Colleville-sur-Mer, on a bluff overlooking Omaha Beach. A smattering of  veterans were honored with the highest accolades. All across the beaches  of Normandy tens of thousands came from across the globe to pay their  respects to the dead and laud the surviving soldiers. The acrid smell of wartime-era jeep exhaust fumes and the rumble of  old tanks filled the air as parades of vintages vehicles went from  village to village. The tiny roads between the dunes, hedges and apple  orchards were clogged for hours, if not days. Heading into the D-Day remembrance weekend this year, only the salty  brine coming off the ocean on Omaha Beach hits the nostrils, the shrieks  of seagulls pierce the ears and a sense of desolation hangs across the  region’s country roads. “Last year this place was full with jeeps, trucks, people dressed up  as soldiers,” said Eric Angely, who sat on a seawall, dressed in a World  War II uniform after taking his restored U.S. Army jeep out for a ride. “This year, there is nothing. It’s just me now, my dog and my jeep,” the local Frenchman said. Three quarters of a century and the horrific wartime slaughter of  D-Day help put things in perspective. Someday the COVID-19 pandemic,  too, will pass, and people will turn out to remember both events that  shook the world. “We don’t have a short memory around here,” Pottier said with a wistful smile. ___ Virginia Mayo contributed.

SYDNEY (AP) — An Australian court sided with police in ruling Friday  that a Black Lives Matter protest planned for Sydney poses too much risk  for spreading the coronavirus and cannot be held. Thousands of people were expected to rally in Australia’s largest  city on Saturday afternoon to honor George Floyd and to protest against  the deaths of indigenous Australians in custody. But New South Wales state Supreme Court Justice Des Fagan ruled the  rally was not an authorized public assembly. Fagan said he understood  the rally was designed to coincide with similar events in other  countries. TOP STORIES

                               “I don’t diminish the importance of the issues and no one would deny  them in normal circumstances,” he said. “No one denies them that but  we’re talking about a situation of a health crisis.” In Sydney, outdoor gatherings are restricted to 10 people, while up  to 50 people can go to funerals, places of worship, restaurants, pubs  and cafes. State Premier Gladys Berejiklian said organizers initially proposed a  protest far smaller rally. She said protesters could not guarantee  social distancing protocols would be followed. “All of us have given up so much and worked so hard to make sure we get on top of the virus,” Berejiklian told reporters. Earlier Friday, demonstrators in the capital reminded the country that racial inequality is not a U.S. issue alone. Organizers of the Canberra rally that attracted about 2,000  demonstrators handed out masks and hand sanitizer. Most protesters kept a  recommended social distance but drew closer to hear speeches. Public  gatherings are limited to 20 in Canberra, but police did not intervene. School teacher Wendy Brookman, a member of the Butchulla indigenous  people, said Australia should not accept that more than 430 indigenous  Australians have died in police custody or prison in the past three  decades. “We’re not here to jump on the bandwagon of what’s happened in the  United States,” Brookman said. “We’re here to voice what’s happening to  our indigenous people.” One of the protesters’ signs read “I can’t breathe” and drew a  parallel between Floyd’s death in the U.S. on May 25 and the Australian  indigenous experience. Those words were among the last spoken by Floyd  and an indigenous Australian, David Dungay, who died in a prison  hospital in 2015 while being restrained by five guards. In South Korea, dozens gathered in front of the U.S. Embassy to  condemn what they described as police brutality toward protesters in the  U.S. They called for South Korea’s government to speak against the  “racial discrimination and state violence” of its ally and pushed for an  anti-discrimination law to improve the lives of migrant workers,  undocumented foreigners and other minorities. “As the U.S. civil society empowered and stood in solidarity with  Korean pro-democracy activists in the past, we will now stand in  solidarity with citizens in the United States,” said activist Lee  Sang-hyun, referring to South Koreans’ bloody struggles against military  dictatorships that ruled the country until the late 1980s. Holding a banner that read “Justice for Floyd,” most of the  protesters wore black and some brought flowers in honor of Floyd, who  died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his neck with a  knee for several minutes while he pleaded for air. Larger marches are planned in Seoul on Saturday to protest Floyd’s death.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Ten long weeks after a massive coronavirus outbreak  sidelined one of the Navy’s signature warships, the USS Theodore  Roosevelt has returned to sea and is conducting military operations in  the Pacific region. Lining the flight deck in their dress white uniforms, sailors wearing  white face masks stood a virus-safe 10 feet (3 meters) apart in a  final, formal thank you as the ship sailed out of port in Guam on  Thursday and headed into the Philippine Sea. “We manned the rail, which we don’t normally do. There was a lot of  symbolism in that,” Navy Capt. Carlos Sardiello told The Associated  Press in an interview from the ship Thursday. “They’re excited. They’re  fired up to be back at sea doing the mission.” TOP STORIES

                               The Roosevelt pulled into Guam on March 27, with a rapidly escalating  number of sailors testing positive for the virus. Over time, more than  1,000 were infected with COVID-19, setting off a lengthy and systematic  process to move about 4,000 sailors ashore for quarantine and treatment,  while about 800 remained aboard to protect and run the high-tech  systems, including the nuclear reactors that run the vessel. Slowly, sailors were methodically brought back on board, while the  others who had remained went ashore for their mandated two-week  quarantine. And in late March, the ship with only about 3,000 crew  aboard went out to sea for roughly two weeks of training, including the  recertification of the flight deck and fighter squadron, such as  takeoffs and landings on the carrier. Earlier this week, the Roosevelt wrapped up training and returned to  Guam to pick up nearly 1,000 sailors who had been left there to either  complete their quarantine or to manage and work with those still on the  island. As the ship sailed into the port, it was flying a flag with the  words “Don’t Give Up the Ship,” a famous Navy battle cry from the War of  1812. “Our sailors didn’t give up the ship. They fought and got it back. So  I thought it was appropriate,” said Sardiello, who asked one of the  other Navy ships to borrow their flag. “The ship was clean and the ship  was healthy with no COVID cases. So I said, OK, we’re going to fly that  one time on the way into Guam as a symbol to bolster their morale.” RS1 Katie VanDrimmelen was one of the sailors left ashore during the  two-week training. She had tested positive for the virus and was in  quarantine for about five weeks. Walking back onto the ship, she said,  was like being welcomed home from a deployment. “It was amazing,” said VanDrimmelen, of Ogden, Utah. “It was very  comforting to be back in our normal atmosphere. Everybody was happy.” Sardiello said that watching the sailors board the ship was a great  feeling, But he knows he’s not done yet. There are still about 350  sailors on Guam who are either in isolation or are there as support  staff. “More and more of those sailors are meeting the return-to-work  criteria, and we’re flying them on board every single day. So we’re  whittling down that number day by day,” said Sardiello. “But I really  want those 350 remaining back. And we’re working hard on that.” He said that any sailors who don’t recover in time will be  transported back to the U.S. The ship is expected to continue operations  in the Pacific, and then would likely head home to San Diego later this  summer. The Roosevelt has been at the center of a still unresolved  controversy that led to the firing of the ship’s previous captain, the  resignation of the Navy secretary and an expanded investigation into  what triggered the outbreak and how well top naval commanders handled  it. Sardiello, had previously captained the Roosevelt but was abruptly  sent back to the ship in early April to take command after Capt. Brett  Crozier was fired for urging his commanders to take faster action to  stem the virus outbreak onboard. After a preliminary review last month, Adm. Mike Gilday, the Navy’s  top officer, recommended that Crozier be reinstated as ship captain. But  the Navy decided to conduct the broader investigation. That review, which effectively delays a decision on Crozier’s  reinstatement, was finished and submitted to Gilday at the end of March  and he is still reviewing the extensive report, which includes several  hundred pages of interviews, documents and recommendations. Cmdr. Nate Christensen, spokesman for Gilday, said is will take time  for the admiral to finish his review and make any decisions.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: These days, the term “public education” seems to mean a little bit of this and a little bit of that, as if teaching and learning are the ingredients of a secret recipe. Education is no secret. What happens outside and inside schools, however, is multilayered systematic chaos. So-called education is dispensed by “educators” who are not necessarily teachers. Once one of the noblest of professions, teaching has become a complex grid of red tape controlled by federal bureaucrats safely embedded in Washington; governors, mayors and county executives who tether their policies to get-out-the-vote agendas; and unionists who knew our schools were closing before we did and didn’t prepare themselves, us or students. TOP STORIES

                               Yet they all pull, push, tug and demand at the same time. As a result, when COVID-19 struck, elected officials simultaneously channeled defiant Alabama Democrats George Wallace and Bull Connor and blocked schoolhouse doors. Students’ GPAs tanked, and grades, and ceremonies traditionally held at the end of the school year were canceled. Teachers didn’t even receive their shiny, red apples. Tsk, tsk, tsk. As we emerge from the darkness of the coronavirus, let’s look forward to the ringing of school bells in a different way. Politicians and unions are mostly focusing on what school facilities should look like when faculty and students return, mostly proposing the same health and safety mandates that have been followed since the COVID-19 lockdown. Fine. Let’s call it back to basics. Just as we need to disinfect classrooms, restrooms and eating areas, we need to disinfect teaching. Consider the academic mindset that all children must attend college. After that was embedded into the curriculum of public education, we should have asked what happens to home economics, industrial arts and physical education? Children are still taught the three Rs, but sewing was kicked to the curb. Perhaps too domesticated post-women’s movement? Ironically, one of the first stores recently looted in D.C. was pricey Moncler, which sells kids’ winter wear costing several hundred dollars and adults several thousands. Children and adults would know how to design and sew their own, if learning were an educational priority or even an option. Ditto the basics of industrial arts. The lack of basic, hands-on training in the industrial arts means school janitors and custodians can easily grasp the art of sweeping and mopping floors, and collecting and dumping trash. But what about welding and wood carving to build a jungle gym in the backyard? Do teachers teach the mechanics of plumbing and pipefitting? Basic instruction on the difference between a cubic and linear foot would allow phys ed and math teachers to piggyback lesson plans. Basic teaching piques the curiosity of children who want to move into STEM programs. Children learn and love to get their hands dirty when they’re young, and because of COVID-19 we’re reinforcing how important the basic lesson of hand washing: Do it and do it often. Our schools should teach and show how sometimes somebody’s got their hands dirty, and our schools can teach U.S. history along the way — the men, women and children who built America got dirty along the way, building infrastructure and tending to agriculture. But, hey, even our Founders’ hands were soiled by ink. • Deborah Simmons can be contacted at [email protected] Manage Newsletters Copyright © 2020 The Washington Times, LLC.

Roughly 80% of recipients of expanded federal unemployment insurance would get more money from the benefits than they could expect to earn from a job if the emergency program is extended another six months, Congress’ official budget scorekeeper said Thursday. In the second half of 2020, the U.S. economy would probably do better but employment would be lower if the benefits were to be extended through January, the Congressional Budget Office also found. In 2021, though, both economic output and employment would be lower if the benefits are extended, CBO projected. TOP STORIES

                               Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley, whose staff requested the analysis, said Democrats’ approach to the issue would “encourage unemployment, government dependence and reduced productivity.” “As we begin to safely reopen our economy, it should be the goal of Congress to get America back to work, while helping those who can’t in a more targeted and efficient way,” said Mr. Grassley, Iowa Republican. In March, Congress approved an additional $600-per-week in federal unemployment benefits on top of regular state benefits as part of an emergency $2.2 trillion package in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Republicans had raised concerns that the benefits, which are due to expire at the end of July, were structured in such a way that disincentivized work. The Democrat-led House included an extension of the benefits through January in a separate $3 trillion-plus bill the chamber passed last month. Rep. James Comer, Kentucky Republican, led a letter Thursday urging congressional leaders to allow the benefits to expire at the end of July. “The supplemental UI was intended to be a lifeline for those whose employer was unable to retain them, not set individuals on a path to continued reliance on government assistance,” Mr. Comer and more than 60 of his Republican colleagues said. With millions of Americans still out of work, some lawmakers have talked up the idea of a “return to work” bonus or a less lucrative extension as possible elements of the next comprehensive rescue package. If the program is extended through January, roughly five in six people receiving the benefits starting in August would get more money from unemployment than they could expect to earn from work during those six months, CBO said. Analysts also found that if the benefits were extended, U.S. economic output would probably be greater in the second half of 2020 as demand for goods and services picked up, even though employment would be lower than it would have been without the extension. But in 2021, both economic output and employment would be lower if the benefits continued because a reduced labor supply would last longer than the bolstered demand, CBO said. The Labor Department reported Thursday that another 1.9 million Americans filed for unemployment last week, with the total number of claims since the pandemic took hold in March now above 40 million.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director said Thursday he’s “very concerned” that his agency’s public health message isn’t resonating, citing uneven use of face coverings and lax compliance with social distancing at parties or other major events. Robert Redfield said people near his home in Baltimore tend to wear masks but he hardly sees anyone in Washington wearing them. He also said he shared Democratic lawmakers’ concerns about photos of people gathered at the Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri or the SpaceX launch in Florida without maintaining physical distancing.

                               “We’re very concerned that our public health message isn’t resonating. We continue to try to figure out how to penetrate the message with different groups,” he told House lawmakers tracking the pandemic response. “We will continue to try to message as well we can.” “These social distancing strategies that we’ve learned are something we’re going to need to perfect,” Dr. Redfield said. “Because we’re going to need them to be our major defense again in October, November, December.” As it stands, there is no vaccine for the coronavirus or widespread public immunity to the newly discovered disease. Experts say the dual threat of a second coronavirus wave and a bad flu season could be difficult to manage. Dr. Redfield said only 47% of the Americans avail themselves of the flu shot under ordinary circumstances, so everyone needs to do their part before a COVID-19 antidote is available. “This single act will save lives,” he told the subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee. “We’re really hoping the American public will see that the flu vaccine is one major way they can help this nation get through this fall.” The coronavirus discovered in Wuhan, China, last December has spread across the globe and infected 1.8 million people in the U.S., and killed over 107,000. Transmission is plateauing after months of drastic measures, including stay-at-home orders, business closures and physical distancing. The summer weather may slow transmission, though a fall resurgence is a major fear. States also fear flare-ups as businesses reopen and people gather in mass protests against police brutality. Rep. Mark Pocan, Wisconsin Democrat, said he is worried that chemical riot-control agents will cause coughing and potential disease transmission at the protests. Dr. Redfield said he would raise his concern at the next White House coronavirus task force meeting. “I think you raised an important point,” Dr. Redfield said. “We have advocated strongly the ability to have face coverings and masks available to protesters.” He also said marchers ought to get tested to ensure they don’t spread the virus in the community if they become infected. “I do think there is a potential, unfortunately, for this to be a seeding event,” he said. Dr. Redfield urged appropriators on the coronavirus subcommittee to fund improvements to the nation’s public health infrastructure, especially its data-reporting systems. And he acknowledged well-documented hiccups in developing a COVID-19 test that local health departments could use, which included a delay in engaging the private sector. Public health departments had to send test samples to the CDC in the early weeks of the pandemic, and contamination problems delayed the CDC’s effort to develop a diagnostic that state departments could use on their own. “Within five weeks, it was corrected,” Dr. Redfield said, saying the development of a test within five to six weeks from acquiring the genetic sequence of the pathogen was “still an accomplishment.” “That six weeks was the six weeks we had to get ahead of this virus,” Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, Washington Republican, interjected. Democratic lawmakers also said they’re concerned the CDC has dropped out of view amid the pandemic despite its expertise. Subcommittee Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro noted the CDC stopped doing media calls in March and that states tried to reopen before the CDC released detailed guidance on how to do it safely. “I am alarmed that this administration has sidelined the CDC in our response to the pandemic and chosen political expediency over public health,” said Ms. DeLauro, Connecticut Democrat. “As a result, the U.S. has had the worst response to the coronavirus of any country in the world.” Rep. Tom Cole, Oklahoma Republican, objected to the chairwoman’s suggestion the U.S. fared worse than other countries, citing European countries with sophisticated health systems that saw higher per-capita death rates. “In this case, we may not be the best but we’re not the worst,” Mr. Cole said. Ms. DeLauro said other countries, including Germany and South Korea, found ways to keep their populations relatively safe. “There is no national coordinated strategy,” she added. “It appears as if the United States is just admitting defeat.”

A serious multisystem inflammatory syndrome that might be linked to the new coronavirus appeared to affect an “unusually high proportion” of children of African ancestry, according to a small study from a Paris hospital. Out of 21 children and adolescents who were admitted to the hospital with the inflammatory syndrome, 12 patients (57%) were of African ancestry, says the study, published Wednesday in the BMJ. The patients ranged from 3 to 16 years of age, with an average age of 7 years. The disease has similar symptoms of toxic shock syndrome and Kawasaki disease, a rare illness of unknown origin that causes blood vessels to become inflamed. It can cause persistent fever, abdominal symptoms, rash and cardiovascular symptoms, as well as heart-related or blood vessel-related shock requiring intensive care.

                               Health experts have said that the inflammatory syndrome could be an “antibody mediated or delayed response” to COVID-19 that shows up several weeks after infection, the Science Daily reported. Cases of the pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome have also been seen in Italy, the United Kingdom and the U.S. All 21 patients in the study had noticeable gastrointestinal symptoms in the early stages of illness and “high levels of inflammatory markers,” the researchers noted. Twelve patients (57%) exhibited symptoms of Kawasaki disease shock syndrome, and 16 (76%) of them experienced heart inflammation. Seventeen (81%) of the patients required intensive care support. Nineteen children and adolescents (90%) in the study had evidence of a recent SARS-CoV-2 infection, the coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 disease. All of the patients were discharged home after an average of eight days spent at the hospital.

Nancy Messonnier, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official who caught the White House off guard by warning of major disruptions from COVID-19 in February, is an “outstanding leader” and remains a key figure in the government’s response to the virus, the nation’s top disease-fighter said Thursday. “She has not been sidelined,” CDC Director Robert Redfield told a House Appropriations Committee panel monitoring the response to the pandemic. Dr. Messonnier rose to prominence by warning Americans on Feb. 25 that COVID-19 could become a major problem in the U.S. and that families should gird for changes to their work life, child care arrangements and other parts of everyday life.

                               “We are asking the American public to work with us to prepare in the expectation that this could be bad,” she told reporters at the time. Her warning exacerbated a selloff on Wall Street and reportedly irked President Trump, who was returning to the U.S. from a brief trip to India. Upon returning, the president held a White House briefing in which he suggested the 15 known cases in the U.S. could be knocked back down to zero. The CDC stopped doing media calls in early March, as the White House held its own briefings, meaning the public no longer heard from Dr. Messonnier. Yet her warning seemed prescient by mid-March, as states issued stay-at-home orders and the administration called on Americans to work and learn at home and avoid large gatherings. State economies are beginning to reopen, though over 100,000 Americans have died from the virus. Asked if Dr. Messonnier’s initial warning was correct, Dr. Redfield on Thursday said, “Yes.” “Dr. Messonnier remains one of our outstanding leaders,” he said. “She is a great scientific ally of mine and other leaders.” He said Dr. Messonnier is the agency’s project-leader on Operation Warp Speed, the administration’s effort to land a vaccine to COVID-19 in record time.

The D.C. Department of Health said Thursday there was a new peak in the community spread of the coronavirus during phase one of the District’s reopening. The new peak in cases occurred May 30, and the District now is at a total of three days of sustained decrease in community spread. “Due to a backlog of lab results being reported after Memorial Day, and as new cases are identified through contact tracing, the number of cases attributed to a specific symptom onset date will be impacted,” the Health Department said. “This may result in a new peak, and a resetting of Day 0 in the upcoming days.” TOP STORIES

                               The department is relying on a community spread metric, which is determined by date of symptom onset, instead of when people were tested for coronavirus. The District entered phase one on May 29. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has yet to detail what criteria will determine entering phase two, including the significance of returning to Day 0 in the count of community spread.

Emergency department visits dropped by 42% from late March through April, the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, while the number of infectious disease-related visits increased fourfold during the same time frame, said a new federal report published Wednesday. There was an average of 1.2 million ER visits from March 29 to April 25 compared to 2.1 million visits per week from March 31 to April 27 of last year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The largest decreases in visits were among children 14 years and younger, women and people in the Northeast region. Visits for abdominal pain and other digestive issues, musculoskeletal pain, hypertension, chest pain, nausea, vomiting and other specified upper respiratory infections saw the biggest declines. There were also fewer visits for heart attacks (also called acute myocardial infarction). TOP STORIES

                               “Health messages that reinforce the importance of immediately seeking care for symptoms of serious conditions, such as myocardial infarction, are needed,” the study said. “The striking decline in ED (emergency department) visits nationwide, with the highest declines in regions where the pandemic was most severe in April 2020, suggests that the pandemic has altered the use of the ED by the public,” the report said. “Persons who use the ED as a safety net because they lack access to primary care and telemedicine might be disproportionately affected if they avoid seeking care because of concerns about the infection risk in the ED,” the researchers wrote. “To minimize SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, transmission risk and address public concerns about visiting the ED during the pandemic, CDC recommends continued use of virtual visits and triage help lines and adherence to CDC infection control guidance.” The CDC used data from the National Syndromic Surveillance Program, a network that collects electronic health data in real-time, from hospitals in 47 states or about 73% of emergency department visits in the U.S. to study trends. There were increases in ER visits for infectious disease exposure and screening, COVID-19, pneumonia not caused by tuberculosis, respiratory failure or insufficiency, other specified and unspecified lower respiratory disease, cardiac arrest and heart rhythm problems.

The editors of The Lancet, a London-based journal renowned for accurate medical research, are disclosing   “serious scientific questions” about a paper they published May 22 knocking the use of the Trump-endorsed hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19. The now-disputed research paper relied on the examination of hospital files for nearly 100,000  patients to conclude that the drug, in combination an antibiotic, is ineffective and can cause heart problems. More than 14,000 patients were given the drug, with or without, an antibiotic in 671 hospitals on six continents from December to April. Over 100 scientists quickly challenged the study’s methods, writing to The Lancet that in some cases medical records did not match the actual patient.

                               President Trump has championed hydroxychloroquine, bringing with it intense criticism from the liberal media — and a Fox News anchor — who painted the anti-malaria drug as dangerous. Mr. Trump disclosed he took a regimen of the drug as a preventative for the new coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 disease. A number of U.S. physicians have come forward to say they have seen success in the prescribing hydroxychloroquine to COVID patients. Backers say hydroxychloroquine has been used safely for 60 years to prevent and treat malaria by blocking parasites from invading red blood cells. Its anti-inflammatory properties have been proven effective in treating Lupus and some skin diseases. The Food and Drug Administration is one of many agencies and institutes conducting clinical trials. The May 22 Lancet article contained  this conclusion: “We were unable to confirm a benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, when used alone or with a macrolide, on in-hospital outcomes for COVID-19. Each of these drug regimens was associated with decreased in-hospital survival and an increased frequency of ventricular arrhythmias when used for treatment of COVID-19.” The report gained widespread news media coverage. Often missed was the study’s warning: “A cause-and-effect relationship between drug therapy and survival should not be inferred. These data do not apply to the use of any treatment regimen used in the ambulatory, out-of-hospital setting. Randomized clinical trials will be required before any conclusion can be reached regarding benefit or harm of these agents in COVID-19 patients.” The Lancet editor’s backtrack posted on Wednesday said that “important scientific questions have been raised about data in the paper. … We are issuing an Expression of Concern to alert readers to the fact that serious scientific questions have been brought to our attention. We will update this notice as soon as we have further information.” The article carried the bylines of four scientists at medical centers in the U.S. Data was analyzed by the firm  Surgisphere in Chicago. A French clinic in southern France has conducted trials that show hydroxychloroquine is effective in treating COVID-19.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Nearly 1.9 million people applied for U.S. unemployment benefits last week, evidence that many employers are still cutting jobs even as the gradual reopening of businesses has slowed the pace of layoffs. The total number of people who are receiving jobless aid rose slightly to 21.5 million, down from a peak of nearly 25 million two weeks ago but still at a historically high level. It shows that scattered rehiring is offsetting only some of the ongoing layoffs with the economy mired in a recession. Thursday’s latest weekly number from the Labor Department is still more than double the record high that prevailed before the viral outbreak. Still, the number of people who applied for benefits last week marked the ninth straight decline since applications spiked in mid-March. The job market meltdown that was triggered by the coronavirus may have bottomed out as more companies call at least some of their former employees back to work.

The total number of people receiving aid fell in 37 states and in D.C. and increased in 13 states. Applications for jobless benefits are falling in states that had reopened their businesses early, such as Georgia and Texas, and are also declining in those that are still early in the reopening process, such as New York and Massachusetts. With all states in the process of gradually reopening for business, more consumers are starting to return to restaurants, stores and hair salons. That trend has boosted consumer spending from exceedingly low levels and has likely encouraged some companies to hire again. In addition to the laid-off employees who applied for benefits last week, 623,000 others sought jobless aid under a new program for self-employed and gig workers, who now qualify for unemployment benefits for the first time. These figures aren’t adjusted for seasonal variations, so the government doesn’t include them in the overall data. The figures come one day before the government’s jobs report for May is expected to show that employers slashed 8 million jobs last month and that the unemployment rate jumped from 14.7% to 19.8%. If those forecasts prove accurate, it would mean that nearly 30 million people have lost jobs since the viral outbreak intensified in March and that joblessness has reached its highest point since the Great Depression. Since mid-March, 42.7 million people have applied for unemployment benefits. Not all of them are still unemployed, though. Some have since been rehired. And some laid-off people, it turns out, filed duplicate applications for benefits as they struggled with unresponsive state unemployment systems. Thursday’s report wasn’t affected by the protests over the killing of George Floyd, which in recent days forced some major retailers and small businesses to close, because it covers claims filed only through May 30. But some economists warn that applications for unemployment aid could rise in next week’s report, reflecting business closures amid the protests and scattered vandalism. “That’s going to kick up the claims again,” said Jane Oates, a former Labor Department official. The depth of the job cuts since the virus forced the widespread shutdown of businesses reflects an economy gripped by the worst downturn since the Great Depression. The economy is thought to be shrinking in the April-June quarter at an annual rate approaching 40%. That would be, by far, the worst quarterly contraction on record. Still, real-time private data on consumer behavior is showing signs that the economy is gradually reviving. Credit and debit card spending tracked by Chase Bank shows that consumer spending, though roughly flat last week, rebounded from its low point in mid-April, when it was 40% below year-ago levels. Now, it is down 20% from a year ago. Economists caution that most Americans will need to feel more confident about returning to their former habits of shopping, traveling and eating out before the economy can sustain any meaningful recovery. That will likely require the availability of a vaccine or a significant increase in testing. “What’s really going to move the needle economically is when consumers and businesses feel comfortable re-engaging with the economy the way they did before COVID-19,” said Adam Kamins, a senior regional economist at Moody’s Analytics. Some businesses that have reopened have seen only a limited number of customers so far. In Chattanooga, Tennessee, Nneka Ijeoma lost her job as a bartender at a whiskey bar when it closed in March. Though the bar has reopened, it has rehired only two of its 17 employees. In the meantime, Ijeoma is receiving $275 in state unemployment benefits each week, plus $600 a week in federal benefits “We were honestly so blessed by that,” she said of the federal aid, which will expire at the end of July. “I wouldn’t have been able to get by on $275.” Still, she is eager to return to work and to go back to school in the fall to finish her college degree. Yet she always regarded bartending as a long-term opportunity. “I always thought I could work in hospitality forever,” she said. “I thought it was recession-proof.”

A now-famous Michigan barber is taking his case to cut hair during the coronavirus pandemic to the state Supreme Court, as the Justice Department weighs in on the side of other businesses suing against the strict COVID-19 lockdowns there. Small businesses and Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer have been at odds for weeks over some of the most severe economic restrictions any state has imposed since the coronavirus pandemic swept across the U.S. this winter. She began relaxing those restrictions this week. TOP STORIES

                               The clashes led to peaceful protests in Lansing, one of which, Operation Haircut last week, featured 77-year-old barber Karl Manke clipping hair at the top of the state capitol’s steps. Mr. Manke wielded his scissors at his Owosso barber shop Tuesday despite rulings against his operation by a state appeals court and an administrative law judge, according to his attorney. But both orders should be stayed as Mr. Manke appeals both legal matters, one civil and one administrative, his attorney, David Kallman, said. “As an attorney, I have advised Karl that he needs to abide by the court’s decision, but if he elects to go ahead and cut hair while following proper sanitary and social distancing rules, then I’m going to defend him,” Mr. Kallman said. On May 29, the Justice Department said it would support seven companies that filed a federal lawsuit against Ms. Whitmer. The companies argue the restrictions had “significantly impaired in some instances their ability to maintain their economic livelihoods.” The department’s statement of concern in the case comes after Attorney General William Barr on April 27 asked federal prosecutors “to review state and local policies to ensure that civil liberties are protected during the COVID-19 pandemic.” The businesses are a real estate brokerage, a landscaping company, an automotive glass exporter, an engine oil and auto parts distributor, a jewelry store, a dentist, and a chain of car washes. The owners say that while some similar enterprises have been allowed to stay open, they have not. On May 22, Ms. Whitmer extended Michigan’s closures until June 12, although she has begun allowing some economic activity to return in parts of the state. She took that step one day after a state judge tossed a lawsuit from the Republican legislative majority that accused her of assuming excessive powers under the state’s Emergency Management Act. Ms. Whitmer has “issued over 100 executive orders that impose sweeping limitations on nearly all aspects of life for citizens of Michigan, significantly impairing in some instances their ability to maintain their economic livelihoods,” the Justice Department said in announcing its support. Several federal prosecutors called Ms. Whitmer’s slew of executive orders arbitrary and thus infringing on clear constitutional protections. “I have no doubt about the governor’s good intentions, but the executive orders arbitrarily discriminate by allowing some businesses to operate while similar businesses must close or limit their operations,” said Matthew Schneider, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan who oversees Mr. Barr’s April initiative. “Under the governor’s orders it’s OK to go to a hardware store and buy a jacket, but it’s a crime to go inside a clothing store and buy the identical jacket without making an appointment,” Mr. Schneider said. “That’s arbitrary.” Mr. Manke is cutting hair by appointment and consequently his barber shop is avoiding long lines and any violations of social distancing requirements, Mr. Kallman said. Nevertheless, shortly before the close of business Tuesday, a contempt motion was filed against Mr. Manke by the Michigan attorney general, Mr. Kallman said. A county judge has scheduled a hearing on that motion for June 11.

An autopsy released Wednesday showed that George Floyd, the black man killed by a white Minneapolis police officer, had the coronavirus. NBC News reported that the Hennepin County Medical Examiner said Mr. Floyd, whose death has sparked worldwide protests, tested positive for the virus on April 3. The medical report by Chief Medical Examiner Andrew Baker said Mr. Floyd seemed to have been asymptomatic — as many people who catch the virus are — and that his lungs appeared healthy.

                               An earlier, preliminary autopsy report from the county said Mr. Floyd died from “cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.” Mr. Floyd died saying “I can’t breathe” as a policeman kneeled on his neck for almost nine minutes. The full report Wednesday said Mr. Floyd had other “significant” conditions, including hypertension-related heart disease, fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use. However, these were not listed under the cause of death.

A June rally roared on Wall Street on Wednesday as private employers reported that job losses stabilized in May, raising hopes among investors and in Washington that the recovery from the coronavirus shutdown could be faster and stronger than predicted. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 527 points, or 2%, to close at 26,269. That was more than 8,000 points above the index’s low point in March, when the COVID-19 pandemic was forcing businesses to close and throwing more than 40 million Americans out of work. The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.7%, closing less than 1% below its record high on Feb. 19. The index has climbed more than 42% since its low point on March 23.

                               Investors were buoyed by optimism about states reopening from the shutdown and by a report from the payroll firm ADP estimating that U.S. private-sector jobs fell by about 2.8 million from April to May. That was significantly better than projections of about 9 million and well below the previous month’s record number of nearly 20 million. President Trump pointed to the “booming” stock market rally as more proof that the economy will bounce back significantly before Election Day in November. “I built this great economy, and I’m building it again,” Mr. Trump told Fox News radio host Brian Kilmeade. “By the time of the election, I believe the economy will be doing phenomenal numbers. Big job increases, big GDP increases, and that’ll be before the election.” The transportation sector, which stands to benefit more than most others from the economy’s reopening, led the rally. Shares of American, Delta and United airlines all gained at least 5.9%. White House senior adviser Kevin Hassett said the jobs report could mean the economy is recovering faster than expected after the coronavirus-related lockdowns. “This ADP report is a real positive sign, and it’s such a positive sign that I really have to grab my pencil and go back to my desk and see what’s going on. … It’s way lower than I expected, in a good way,” Mr. Hassett said on Fox Business. “We’re getting close to the bottom, for sure. The number is so good — it’s such good news — that I really have to dig deep into it and see if there’s not something funny going on.” More than 40 million unemployment claims have been filed since the pandemic took hold in March. Mr. Hassett said some projections have the gross domestic product contracting by 50% in the second quarter. “If you look at the states that have been opening up, then you can see that they are really getting back to normal quickly,” he said. “I do think that we’re going to see bottom. I was expecting June, but this ADP number does suggest that you’re very, very close to a turning point.” The Labor Department is due to release its unemployment figures for May on Friday morning. Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisers in Holland, Pennsylvania, cautioned that the May unemployment rate is likely to be about 20% and that some indicators point to more job losses this month. “I am not sure that will be the peak [of unemployment],” Mr. Naroff said in his report Wednesday. “We can open up the economy all we want, but if there is double-digit unemployment for an extended period, consumer spending levels will not be able to come close to where they had been. Will investors recognize that? Got me.” Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of economic activity. A report Wednesday from the Institute for Supply Management showed service providers began to emerge from the shutdown in May. Its non-manufacturing index rose 3.6 points, the most in more than two years, to 45.4, but the reading below 50 showed that most service-related industries were still contracting. ADP said the job losses in May hit small, medium and large businesses alike. “The impact of the COVID-19 crisis continues to weigh on businesses of all sizes,” Ahu Yildirmaz, co-head of the ADP Research Institute, said in a statement. “While the labor market is still reeling from the effects of the pandemic, job loss likely peaked in April, as many states have begun a phased reopening of businesses.” Conservative economist Stephen Moore, who advised the Trump campaign in 2016, said the stock market is engaging in “premature exuberance.” He said he is still predicting a “really bad summer” of business failures and a difficult job market. “I’m just not as bullish about the economy as the investment markets are,” he said, adding that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, isn’t likely to agree with Senate Republicans to “anything that helps the economy.” The House has approved a $3 trillion economic relief package, including expanded unemployment benefits and hundreds of billions of dollars in aid for states and cities. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, said last week that the Senate will consider another bill in about a month and it would be “narrowly crafted” compared with the House proposal. Mr. Moore said any compromise on the House bill “is bad for the economy.” He said the employment benefit program approved in March, with a $600 weekly federal payment on top of state benefits, is giving people too much incentive to stay home. “We’d be much better off just doing nothing,” Mr. Moore said. “The thing that needs to happen now is just go back to the old employment benefit program … and then the payroll tax cut. You do those two things, and you get some real juice in the economy. People really underestimate how much damage we’ve done to the economic infrastructure of the country, and I think it could take a long time to recover. I can’t see this [stock] market staying at this level.” White House advisers note that unemployment rates were at historic lows for all groups before the pandemic hit the U.S., with a national jobless rate of 3.5% in February. White House Domestic Policy Adviser Brooke Rollins said the U.S. was experiencing “unprecedented prosperity,” including the lowest jobless rates in a half century for blacks and Hispanics. “To get all of that back is really a priority,” she said this week in a forum hosted by Politico. She said the payroll tax cut is needed but the president isn’t necessarily opposed to another round of significant relief spending. “He is not in the typical Republican ‘box,’” she said. “He will do what he believes is right for the country. The long-term health of the country is at the top of the president’s mind.” Mr. Moore expects the unemployment rate to be around 10% by Election Day, but he said the president could benefit “if the direction is good.” He also sees two “silver linings” to the rioting that has roiled the nation for the past week that could help the president and hurt presumptive Democratic nominee Joseph R. Biden. “The lockdown lockdown is over now,” Mr. Moore said. “And No. 2 is, it’s increased Trump’s odds of getting reelected because the left has exposed how radical they are. That’s good for markets because the markets obviously want Trump over Biden.”

The COVID-19 pandemic is entering a complicated, hold-your-breath stage as states work to stamp out flare-ups and hope their hospitals can handle an anticipated rise in cases as their economies reopen and Americans socialize again. The New York City region that endured the worst of the pandemic is doing far better, though parts of California and Texas are reporting increases in cases. Hospitals in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area are filling with COVID-19 patients and are concerned about a spike in cases after protests over the death of George Floyd. Many of the protesters are young and less vulnerable to COVID-19, though marchers could catch the coronavirus while gathering and further spread it in minority communities that are already reeling from the pandemic, scientists say.

                               Newly confirmed cases are rising in more than a dozen states, sometimes because of increases in testing, and clusters of hot spots are erupting in rural areas with prison and meat-processing plants that are vulnerable to outbreaks. The U.S. is approaching 2 million confirmed infections and faces a complex struggle to hold down transmissions that increased with frightening speed earlier this year. “If I were to describe the pandemic in the United States overall now, it would be that there are low embers burning within the metropolitan areas and there are little sparking fires heading off all over the heartland,” said William Hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard University. “Numbers are hovering around steady, but we have to remember that is reflecting a decrease in the Northeast and a slow increase which is replacing that elsewhere.” Experts said they should be able to tell by the latter half of June whether efforts to reopen and mingle once again have resulted in a spate of new infections. “The metric that is most firm, even though it is delayed, is hospitalizations of people with lab-confirmed COVID-19,” said William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University. “If that starts to tick up, then we start to frown because it means there is, indeed, more transmission out there.” About 40,000 COVID-19 patients were in U.S. hospitals at the start of June, up from 34,000 in mid-May. Many states, especially in the Northeast, are reporting fewer hospitalizations, and more than a dozen have relatively steady numbers. A handful are showing upticks, however. Hospitalizations in Arizona surpassed 1,000 for the first time Monday, sparking debate about actions after lifting the state’s stay-at-home order in mid-May. “A state like Arizona is concerning. The scope of the rise and the velocity is concerning,” former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb told CNBC. “It’s going to be very hard, though, for a lot of these governors to go backward and start implementing mitigation again. “They’re probably going to tolerate a higher level of infection than we were willing to on the first go-round, and that just sets up more risk,” he said. Flare-ups in some states, he said, could “reseed” parts of the country with the coronavirus. Hospitals in Montgomery, Alabama, and in Minnesota also have been taxed recently with COVID-19 patients. “We are getting closer and closer to being overly full,” Caitlin Eccles-Radtke, an infectious disease physician at Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis, told MedPage Today. The national conversation has pivoted to protests after the death of Mr. Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Still, the coronavirus that dominated global headlines since the start of the year remains a challenge, infecting 1.8 million people and counting in the U.S. and killing more than 107,000. States are trying to make sure high-risk populations are tested. That includes prison inmates, meat processing workers and nursing home residents. The Trump administration recently announced data linking 26,000 deaths to nursing homes across the country. The pandemic also continues to have an outsized effect on minority populations. Federal data shows black Americans, who make up 13% of the population, account for 23% of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. and account for more than half of infections in multiple Southern states. Experts say the racial disparities are results of underlying health issues in minority populations, and frustrations with the U.S. response to COVID-19 are further fueling protests over racial injustice. Some parts of the country are reporting good news. New York, the hardest-hit state, reported fewer than 1,000 new cases on June 1, compared with about 4,000 on May 1 and 8,000 on April 1. Although the numbers in New York are still much higher than other parts of the country, the trend line is positive. “The tri-state region actually looks very good right now,” Dr. Gottlieb told CNBC. New York officials said buses and subway lines will have social-distancing decals and hand sanitizers in stations when the city begins to lift restrictions next week. In Pennsylvania, a large number of counties will move Friday to the “green phase,” which eases many restrictions and lets businesses move from 50% capacity under the yellow stage to 75%. Areas of southeastern Pennsylvania and Philadelphia will enter the yellow phase, in which some business may open but teleworking is mandated “where feasible.” “We continue to see around 500-700 cases a day, and these are among different populations, but long-term care facilities remain a concern that we are continuing to assist,” Pennsylvania Health Department spokesman Nate Wardle said. Scientists are worried that the coronavirus will strike in a “second wave” this fall after a potential lull in transmission because of hot and humid weather, yet it is starting to wreak havoc in Latin America as countries in the Southern Hemisphere enter winter. Disease trackers are looking backward to try to get a better sense of overall exposure to the coronavirus since the start of the outbreak. They are producing statistical averages based on serological testing that checks for antibodies. Exposure ranges widely, from an estimated 2% of the population in Boise, Idaho, to roughly 20% in New York City, based on figures compiled by the American Enterprise Institute. Elsewhere, antibody testing suggests roughly 17% of London’s population has been exposed, compared with 10% in Paris and Wuhan, China, about 6% in Miami and nearly 5% in Los Angeles. The virus was discovered in Wuhan in December and spread around the globe in the early months of this year, upending American life as President Trump urged people to work and learn at home and avoid large gatherings. Governors issued a patchwork of state-at-home orders that closed most businesses while allowing food and other essential services to continue. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said emergency department visits plummeted by 42% in the early pandemic period from late March to late April compared with similar dates in 2019 as people hunkered at home. The biggest declines were among children younger than 14, females and residents of the Northeast region, the CDC report said, suggesting the illness scared people away from seeking care. “The striking decline in ED visits nationwide, with the highest declines in regions where the pandemic was most severe in April 2020, suggests that the pandemic has altered the use of the ED by the public,” the agency said. The CDC said hospitals should maintain clear triage procedures to keep COVID-19 patients separate from other emergency room patients. Health care providers also should set up telephone lines to help people swiftly understand whether they need to report to the emergency room for injuries or other conditions, the agency said.

Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said Wednesday that the state will enter phase two of the reopening plan on Friday. “In the face of the most daunting challenge of our lifetime, the people of Maryland have been resilient, have never lost hope and they are showing what it truly means to be Maryland strong,” Mr. Hogan said Wednesday at a coronavirus briefing. The governor on Friday will lift his executive order requiring non-essential businesses to close. TOP STORIES

                               Under phase two, personal care businesses, like tattoo parlors and nail salons, can open at 50% capacity and strict safety protocols. Retail stores, technology firms, car dealerships, insurance agencies, travel agencies, real estate agencies, design studios and more will be able to reopen Friday. Starting Monday, state government offices will reopen with staff wearing face coverings and Plexiglass dividers at each station. Mr. Hogan said the next step of reopening will likely coincide with the end of the school year, when he will allow for the opening of outdoor amusement, fitness and sporting businesses. “Just because Marylanders can return to the office, doesn’t mean that they should,” he said, urging people to continue to telework.

A malaria drug President Donald Trump took to try to prevent COVID-19 proved ineffective for that in the first large, high-quality study to test it in health workers and others closely exposed to people with the disease. Results published Wednesday by the New England Journal of Medicine show that hydroxychloroquine was no better than placebo pills at preventing illness from the coronavirus. The drug did not seem to cause serious harm, though — about 40% on it had side effects, mostly mild stomach problems. “We were disappointed. We would have liked for this to work,” said the study leader, Dr. David Boulware, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Minnesota. “But our objective was to answer the question and to conduct a high-quality study,” because the evidence on the drug so far has been inconclusive, he said.

                               Hydroxychloroquine and a similar drug, chloroquine, have been the subject of much debate since Trump started promoting them in March. Hydroxychloroquine has long been used for malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, but no large studies have shown it or chloroquine to be safe or effective for much sicker patients with coronavirus, and some studies have suggested the drugs may do harm. Trump took a two-week course of hydroxychloroquine, along with zinc and Vitamin D, after two staffers tested positive for COVID-19, and had no ill effects, according to results of his latest physical released by his doctor Wednesday. Federal regulators have warned against their use except in hospitals and formal studies because of the risk of side effects, especially heart rhythm problems. Boulware’s study involved 821 people in the United States and Canada living with someone diagnosed with COVID-19 or at high risk of getting it because of their job — doctors, nurses, ambulance workers who had significant exposure to a sick patient while not wearing full protective gear. They were randomly assigned to get either placebo pills or hydroxychloroquine for five days, starting within four days of their exposure. Neither they nor their doctors knew who who was getting what. After 14 days in the study, 12% on the drug developed COVID-19 symptoms versus 14% in the placebo group, but the difference is so small it could have occurred by chance, Boulware said. “There’s basically no effect. It does not prevent infection,” he said of the drug. Even if it were to give some slim advantage, “we’d want a much larger effect” to justify its use and risk of side effects for preventing illness, he said. Results were no different among a subgroup of participants who were taking zinc or vitamin C, which some people believe might help make hydroxychloroquine more effective. “This fits with everything else we’ve seen so far which suggests that it’s not beneficial,” said Dr. Peter Bach, director of a health policy center at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. This study was in younger relatively healthy people, but the results “would make me very discouraged about trying to use this in older people” who are most vulnerable to serious illness from the coronavirus, Bach said. “If it does work, it doesn’t work very well.” Dr. Dan Culver, a lung specialist at the Cleveland Clinic, said there’s still a chance that giving the drug sooner than four days after someone’s exposure to the virus may help prevent illness. But the study “takes ‘home run’ off the table” as far as hopes for the drug, he said. The study was mostly funded by David Baszucki, founder of Roblox, a California-based game software company, and other private donors and the Minnesota university. Boulware also is leading a study testing hydroxychloroquine for treating COVID-19. The study is finished and results are being analyzed now. On Tuesday, the journal Lancet posted an “expression of concern” about a study it published earlier this month of nearly 15,000 COVID-19 patients on the malaria drugs that tied their use to a higher risk of dying in the hospital or developing a heartbeat problem. Scientists have raised serious questions about the database used for that study, and its authors have launched an independent audit. That work had a big impact: the World Health Organization suspended use of hydroxychloroquine in a study it is leading, and French officials stopped the drug’s use in hospitals. On Wednesday, the WHO said experts who reviewed safety information decided that its study could resume.

The metal detectors every sports fan has become accustomed to at the gate might soon be accompanied by thermal body scanners as part of the gargantuan task of preventing the spread of the new coronavirus and other airborne diseases. And that might be just one thing the public will need to be comfortable with in order to bring games back for in-person viewing. Tickets have widely transitioned from paper souvenirs to smartphone screens, but how about using your face as your proof of purchase Nascent forms of crowd monitoring - like laser-driven density detection and camera-based calculations of line length - will likely grow faster in a post-pandemic era of live sports that must highlight hygiene.

                               “The pandemic really ups the need for greater assurance of stadium safety,” said Bob Boland, an athletics official who teaches at Penn State and has more than two decades of experience in sports and law as an instructor, consultant and agent. “Vaccine treatments, containment, they all could be game-changers, but people will need to be comfortable with mass body temperature screening and other technology that could be in play.” Not unlike the aftermath from the 2001 terrorist attacks, when long waits to pass through magnetometers and have a security guard wave a wand over pants pockets became the norm. “After 9/11 we overdid it, meaning we were so intent on making every building be safe and everyone safe that we made it extremely inconvenient to go to games and events. But we said that it would get better over time, and it did,” said Marc Ganis, cofounder of the Chicago-based consulting firm SportsCorp. “Now how do you do that?” Technology will be a vital piece of the puzzle. It will also further test a fan’s willingness to potentially sacrifice a little more privacy in exchange for the opportunity to sit courtside or behind the plate again. “Can I say both?” said Jim Mueller, a Milwaukee Bucks season ticket holder who also buys partial packages to Milwaukee Brewers and Green Bay Packers games. “I understand it from the Bucks’ perspective and the NBA perspective, but as an American I don’t want to be traced.” Dave Karls has Bucks season tickets too, eager enough for his next visit to Fiserv Forum that having his location trackable in the arena would not interfere with the enjoyment. “I’d much rather have that than not be able to attend the game at all,” Karls said. Any concerns depend on an individual’s definition of surveillance, a word that carries a nefarious connotation in some corners. In some countries, the effort this year to stem the outbreak of COVID-19 with contact tracing has included citizen consent to location registration. Activity at a sporting event in the U.S. would likely only be collected in aggregate, like an elevated skin temperature flagged during a walk through a thermal scanner. That’s not a piece of data tied to someone’s actual identity that could run afoul of federal privacy laws. Perhaps QR codes will be used for patrons to self-report current health conditions. Carrying a smartphone and using it to shop already opens a user to some form of location tracking and direct marketing. Team-sponsored apps allowing fans to order burgers and beers directly to their seats and receive push notifications for merchandise already provide a framework for what could be next. “I think the stadiums could probably say, ‘Hey, we’ve got 50 people in the bathroom right now,’ in the aggregate because you already downloaded that app,” said Nerissa Coyle McGinn, a Chicago attorney with a practice in advertising, technology and privacy who has worked with sports teams including the Chicago Bulls, Detroit Red Wings and New York Giants. “You’ve agreed to their privacy policy, and sharing aggregate information isn’t considered sharing personal information.” The algorithms caused a bit of controversy at Alabama, where football coach Nick Saban’s frustration with students leaving blowout games early and a nationwide attendance decline prompted establishment of the “Tide Loyalty Points” program  that rewarded fans for their fourth quarter presence with prizes and priority purchasing for in-demand events. Bluetooth technology is used in that case for tracking; it’s only functional inside Bryant-Denny Stadium. “The more information you can give to somebody, the more likely they’re willing to consent to the question of this type of data,” said Nan Sato, a Philadelphia attorney with a focus on the intersection of technology and sports. “Who’s getting the data? How is it being stored and used, how long is the data going to be retained, and how the privacy of the fans is going to be protected?” Screening technology that scans a user’s eyes, face or fingerprint has multiplied in recent years, particularly in airports to speed up security lines. Two years ago, Major League Baseball struck a deal with a biometric identification system, Clear, to accelerate ballpark entry by body part - fingerprints, for now, but perhaps one day a fan’s face will serve as his or her ticket. “When you kind of pull back the layers, people aren’t fearful of the facial recognition technology itself. They’re fearful of what happens to that data after. It’s more a matter of transparency on our clients’ front: ’Hey, we’re not going to sell this data to a third party. It’s maintained in an encrypted way,” said Shaun Moore, a former SMU football player and the co-founder of Trueface, a software startup with customers in a variety of sectors including sports. “We never see any of the data. We don’t know who’s in the database. So that’s one way we keep privacy in mind when developing these tools. There needs to be transparency in how the data flows and who has access to it, how long it stays in the system. Is it 30 days? Is it two days? Where is it being used?”

D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser on Wednesday imposed the District’s fourth curfew amid nationwide protests and rioting over the death of George Floyd while in police custody in Minneapolis last week. Curfew will start at 11 p.m. Wednesday and end at 6 a.m. Thursday, Miss Bowser said at a press conference. The three previous curfews started at 7 p.m. “We have allowed peaceful protest every night, who we are concerned about is people who are not peaceful and destroying our city,” Miss Bowser said. “Our curfew is a tool for MPD [Metropolitan Police Department] to make sure that they can put their resources to finding those people and detaining those people.” TOP STORIES

                               Metropolitan Police Chief Peter Newsham said Tuesday evening’s peaceful protest persuaded officials to start the new curfew four hours later than previous ones. “The largest group of protesters we have seen to this point have been doing a little bit of self-policing,” Chief Newsham said, noting peaceful protesters chastising someone for trying to tear down a street sign. Chief Newsham said more than 5,000 people were protesting Tuesday evening in the District, which resulted in 19 arrests for curfew violations. Over the course of the protests, 19 people were arrested Saturday night, 92 on Sunday night, and 288 on Monday night. Of those arrested, 41% were from the District, 39% were from Maryland and Virginia, 1% were from other states and 9% had no fixed address. Chief Newsham said 63% arrests were for curfew violations, 11% for felony rioting and 11% for burglary.

It’s not OK to violate stay-at-home and social distancing orders if you’re protesting the economic shutdown from the coronavirus pandemic, but it’s fine to do so if you’re decrying “white supremacy,” according to some public health experts. An open letter signed by 1,288 “public health officials, infectious disease professionals, and community stakeholders” came out in support of the mass protests spurred by the death of George Floyd in police custody, refusing to denounce them as “risky” and calling them “vital to the national public health.” “Staying at home, social distancing, and public masking are effective at minimizing the spread of COVID-19,” said the June 1 letter. “To the extent possible, we support the application of these public health best practices during demonstrations that call attention to the pervasive lethal force of white supremacy.” TOP STORIES

                               The letter, spurred by infectious-disease specialists at the University of Washington, was signed by doctors and medical professionals from top universities such as Columbia, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, the University of Chicago and the University of Michigan, as well as community activists. “However, as public health advocates, we do not condemn these gatherings as risky for COVID-19 transmission,” the letter continued. “We support them as vital to the national public health and to the threatened health specifically of Black people in the United States.” They applied a different standard to those such as the “heavily armed and predominantly white protesters” who descended last month on the state capitol in Lansing, Michigan, to demonstrate against the stay-at-home orders. “This should not be confused with a permissive stance on all gatherings, particularly protests against stay-home orders,” the letter said. “Those actions not only oppose public health interventions, but are also rooted in white nationalism and run contrary to respect for Black lives.” In addition, “Protests against systemic racism, which fosters the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 on Black communities and also perpetuates police violence, must be supported.” Dozens of public health and disease experts have signed an open letter in support of the nationwide anti-racism protests.“White supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to COVID-19,” they wrote.https://t.co/EewPNgDSu3 The letter, with its apparent double-standard on a disease that does not discriminate between left- and right-wing protesters, drew a lengthy, outraged response on Twitter from Blaze managing editor Leon Wolf, who asked whether the entire pandemic shutdown had been a farce. Public health experts “didn’t really believe what they were saying all along. Because an infectious disease does not care about the reason you are gathering or how important it is. It has no social conscience, or conscience of any kind,” Mr. Wolf said. “Which leads me to believe they were doing it because of politics, or desire to control, or whatever.” That conclusion is that they didn’t really believe what they were saying all along. Because an infectious disease does not care about the reason you are gathering or how important it is. It has no social conscience, or conscience of any kind. 14/ Footage from the massive protests that have roiled U.S. cities shows that some of the tens of thousands of protesters are wearing masks, but many are ignoring social distancing rules, leading to fears that the demonstrations could trigger another COVID-19 outbreak. While most of the protesters appear to be peaceful, the demonstrations have been marred by violence, looting, fire-setting and mayhem by perpetrators who often wear masks, although that may be to avoid being identified by police. Even so, the letter urged local and state governments: “Do not disband protests under the guise of maintaining public health for COVID-19 restrictions.” At the same time, the signers said that authorities should anticipate “an increased number of infections in the days following a protest,” and increase access to testing and health care. The letter did not mention the assaults, property damage or destruction to communities, but focused on the public health danger from “white supremacy,” calling it “a lethal public health issue that contributes to and predates COVID-19.” “A public health response to these demonstrations is also warranted, but this message must be wholly different from the response to white protesters resisting stay-home orders,” the letter said. “Infectious disease and public health narratives adjacent to demonstrations against racism must be consciously anti-racist, and infectious disease experts must be clear and consistent in prioritizing an anti-racist message.”

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is facing backlash from the salon industry in the state after she suggested people start researching how to cut their own hair during the coronavirus pandemic. After violent protests swept the country for the sixth straight night over the police custody death of George Floyd, Ms. Whitmer stressed Monday that Michiganders needed to maintain proper social distancing to protect themselves and others from getting sick. “If you’re one of those people that’s going to Ohio [for a haircut], I hope and pray that  you are doing your part not to bring COVID-19 home,” she said. “If you haven’t  resorted to that, Google how to do a haircut, or throw your hair in a  ponytail or curl it and get through the next couple of weeks so we can  resume some of these things.” TOP STORIES

Members  of the Safe Salons for Michigan Coalition testified Tuesday before the Joint  Select Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic in Lansing, where they demanded that the governor apologize and lift the salon lockdown. Hair salons will still not be open, even though the stay-at-home order has been lifted. Governor Whitmer suggests people Google how to cut hair.

More than a third of people with lupus have struggled to fill their prescriptions of hydroxychloroquine, a drug largely touted by President Trump, during the coronavirus pandemic, a new survey found. Shortages of the drug in March and April occurred as media outlets and Mr. Trump reported possible benefits of hydroxychloroquine in treating or preventing COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. The survey, conducted by the Lupus Research Alliance, found that participants had been taking hydroxychloroquine for an average of 11.4 years and that 31% of respondents had issues getting refills. Respondents also reported not being able to take the full dose of the drug or splitting doses. Some said they were unable to get their prescriptions filled because the drugs were not in supply.

                               One patient said she was able to fill her prescription after three weeks of calling different pharmacies. Another said her physician advised her to halve her regular dose until the supply shortage passed. The survey included 334 people in the U.S. with lupus, a chronic autoimmune disease that affects millions worldwide. The survey collected responses from participants from 42 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, between March 1 and May 18. Last month, Mr. Trump claimed to be taking hydroxychloroquine briefly as a preventative measure. There are some clinical trials of the drug underway. On Wednesday, World Health Organization announced it would resume research of the anti-malarial drug in a global study of potential coronavirus treatments after temporarily halting it last week out of safety concerns. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has warned that hydroxychloroquine can cause serious heart rhythm problems for coronavirus patients. The agency advised the drug only be taken within a hospital setting or for a clinical trial. There is currently no approved treatment for COVID-19 although numerous trials of different drugs are in the works.

Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine on Wednesday said his state is unlikely to volunteer to host the Republican National Convention after President Trump said officials are looking for another state to hold the event. “I don’t know where we’ll be several months from now, but this would not be something that we think that we would volunteer to do,” Mr. DeWine said on “Fox & Friends.” “These mass gatherings are just a real problem, particularly those that are inside.” He said that while Ohio has flattened the curve on key metrics in the fight against the coronavirus, the virus “is still very much here.” TOP STORIES

                               “These mass gatherings are kind of the last things to come together and a mass gathering inside is frankly the thing that would scare us the most simply about the spread of the virus,” Mr. DeWine said. Other Republican state leaders such as Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said they’d be happy to host the late August event amid rising tensions between convention planners and North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat. Mr. Trump said late Tuesday that officials have been forced to seek another location because Mr. Cooper can’t guarantee the full use of an arena in Charlotte. Mr. Cooper has said a primary concern during the ongoing negotiations is looking out for public safety. Democrats have already postponed their convention in Milwaukee and are pondering ways to hold parts of it virtually. Mr. Trump had said in early April that there was no contingency plan in place for the Republican convention and that it would proceed as planned in late August.

Google tracked the locations of 300 million people and gave the data to a handful of scientists whom the company deemed worthy. But exactly who has the data, what data the scientists have and what they will do with it is a bit of a mystery. Google began handing over users’ data to the scientists before the coronavirus outbreak and has continued giving them special access during the pandemic. In May, the scientists published a paper revealing that the data was “aggregated from over 300 million smartphone users” and “cover nearly all countries and 65% of Earth’s populated surface.” The smartphone users were not aware they were being studied, according to the paper, which was published in Nature Human Behavior. In other scientific studies, participants are actively observed.

                               “We first apply machine learning to location data points to segment them into semantic ‘trips,’” the 11 scientists wrote. “The system automatically finds trips by taking into account a variety of signals, such as timing of location points, dwell times, and other factors. This, for example, includes stops at airports and other locations on a multi-stop international itinerary.” The scientists who have published on some of the data found that the U.S. and Mexico have “one of the busiest borders,” and the most restrictive borders are between Turkey and Armenia, Morocco and Algeria, and Israel and Gaza, according to the paper, which is accessible via ResearchGate. Weather and daylight patterns also affect physical movement, and the scientists said people are most active in July and August. “Peaks outside this period mostly coincide with national and/or religious holidays such as Easter, the Hajj, and Thanksgiving in the United States,” the scientists wrote. “Unsurprisingly the lowest frequency of movement is observed in January.” Otherwise, nobody besides the scientists and Google knows what else can be gleaned from the information. The scientists say the aggregated data is available to those who want access upon “reasonable request” by contacting the authors and filling out a request form that Google will approve or deny. Google said it provides data to research institutions, not governments, and enters into agreements with those using the data to block them from sharing it with others. “The mobility data set is based on aggregate, anonymized location data, and has been made available to a small set of academic researchers to help understand the spread of COVID-19,” a Google representative said in a statement. Google has allowed the public to see certain data in its “COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports,” which are compiled to help public health officials, doctors and others examine how to tailor social distancing policies during the COVID-19 pandemic. The mobility reports are searchable online by country and region. Rachel Bovard, senior adviser to the right-leaning Internet Accountability Project, said she has concerns about how Google handles users’ data. “Google has a troubling pattern of accumulating massive troves of personal data on individuals without any transparency regarding what they’re doing with it or with whom it is being shared,” Ms. Bovard said. “The company is a serial violator of user privacy and has largely been unaccountable for it. Congressional oversight isn’t just warranted; it is needed.” Arizona sued Google last week for allegedly using deceit and unfair business practices to get its users’ location data. Arizona’s complaint said people who disabled the location tracker still had their movements tracked and that Google confused users attempting to opt out of the location tracking. “While Google users are led to believe they can opt out of location tracking, the company exploits other avenues to invade personal privacy,” Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich said. “It’s nearly impossible to stop Google from tracking your movements without your knowledge or consent.” Some privacy experts are not fretting about Google’s data collection. Ryan Calo, a University of Washington law professor, said concerns could involve the fairness of access to the data and the terms involved in accessing it, but he thinks there is not much cause for concern. “I don’t see a lot of reason to worry. It is not as though Google is telling researchers where specific people are or have been,” Mr. Calo said in an email. “It looks like the data is aggregated and, as a researcher, I am in favor of access to industry data if the privacy harms can be mitigated.” Zach Graves, policy head at the Lincoln Network technology policy advocacy group, said he has not seen the data at issue but he favors making such information accessible to researchers. “I generally think it’s a good idea to allow broad public interest/research exemptions for use of this sort of data,” Mr. Graves said in an email. “Of course, it’s important they also adhere to industry best practices to remove personally identifiable information and limit the possibility of such information getting leaked.” Google also has collaborated with Apple on a contact-tracing project that uses a Bluetooth-based system on phones to monitor users’ potential exposure to coronavirus-infected people. The companies have said the technology does not collect location information and requires users to opt in to participate.

NEW YORK — New York City contact tracers hired to contain the spread of the coronavirus reached out to all of the roughly 600 people who tested positive for the virus citywide on Monday, the first day of the program, and succeeded in reaching more than half of them, officials said Tuesday. “On Day 1 of the program, seeking to reach several hundred people and have what could be an hour conversation with each of them was a tall order,” Dr. Ted Long, the head of the city’s contact tracing program, said at a briefing. Long said the fact that the contact tracers actually got through to more than half of the new cases “shows that the system we’re setting up is working.” The city has hired 1,700 people for its contact tracing effort and needs to reach 2,500 in order to meet Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s target for entering the first phase of the state’s four-step reopening process. The contact tracers are placing people infected with the virus in hotel rooms if they need to isolate themselves away from their families as well as reaching out to the close contacts of those who test positive for COVID-19.

                               Asked if the past week’s protests over the death of George Floyd might spark a new wave of infections, Long encouraged anyone who was at a protest to get tested for the coronavirus at one of the more than 150 free testing sites around the city. Floyd, who was black, died after a white police officer pressed a knee into his neck for several minutes. “It starts with the testing piece, which is why we’re extending the invitation we are to anybody that’s been out there at the protests, come in for a free test, it’s close to where you live,” Long said. “We’d love to have you.”

Oregon Republicans have launched a recall campaign against Gov. Kate Brown, the second in less than two years, accusing her of abusing her office and wrecking the state’s economy with her sweeping coronavirus shutdown orders. The campaign, Stop the Abuse — Recall Kate Brown, needs to gather 280,050 signatures from registered voters within 90 days to qualify for the November ballot. Oregon Republican Party Chairman Bill Currier said the recall was needed to “end her disastrous, unaccountable, and abusive tenure as the chief executive of our state.” TOP STORIES

                               “A year ago, citizens were angry, but now Oregonians are fighting for their livelihoods and their freedoms,” Mr. Currier said in a Monday statement. “Governor Brown’s unlawful executive orders stand in the way of restoring both.” The Washington Times has reached out to the governor, who has defended her executive orders on the shutdown and gradual reopening, calling them necessary to protect public health from the novel coronavirus threat. “There are no shortcuts for us to return to life as it was before this pandemic. Moving too quickly could return Oregon to the early days of this crisis, when we braced for overfilled hospitals and ventilators in short supply,” she said in a May 18 statement. In a state of 4.2 million, Oregon has recorded 4,302 cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, since March 13 and 154 deaths, according to the Oregon Health Authority. “Kate Brown still keeps us in her lockdown while our economy is tanking and Oregonians are losing their jobs and worrying about how to put food on the table and pay their mortgages,” said Solomon Yue, Republican National Committeeman for Oregon. Oregon Republicans sought last summer to recall the Democrat Brown, who was reelected in November 2018 with 50.1% of the vote, but the signatures fell 8% short of the 280,050 required to qualify for the ballot. Even so, Mr. Currier said that signature total was a record for any statewide recall petition in Oregon history and that 33% of those who signed petitions were not Republicans. The “round one” campaign also gave the party a database of names, phone numbers and email addresses that can be used for “round two,” he said. “In 2019, there was clearly buyer’s remorse about Kate Brown’s leadership that led hundreds of thousands of voters to seek to hold her accountable,” Mr. Currier said. “The conduct of the Governor during the events of 2020 has only served to reveal just how devastating Brown’s abuse of power could truly be upon Oregon.” Kate Brown has destroyed Oregon’s small businesses, the backbone of the state’s economy. #orpol #StopTheAbuse #RecallKateBrown https://t.co/vz3GOsCMm1 Oregonians did a great job staying close to home last weekend.

She agreed Monday to deploy 50 unarmed National Guard troops after repeated requests from Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler, but she stressed that they “will not be on the front lines, making arrests or doing crowd control.” “That’s basically a pathetic response,” said Mr. Currier, the mayor of Adair Village, Oregon. Ms. Brown is facing multiple lawsuits over her extensions of executive orders shutting down businesses and churches in response to the pandemic. A county judge declared last month her orders “null and void,” but the Oregon Supreme Court temporarily reinstated them pending a review by the full court.

Adm. Brett Giroir, the coronavirus “testing czar,” expects to transition back to his regular post at the Department of Health and Human Services in the coming weeks. Adm.

                               An HHS spokesperson said Adm. Giroir would remain engaged with COVID-19 testing and related efforts, but that much of the day-to-day management and operations of testing are being transitioned back to health and human services. The comments come as states across the country are increasingly relaxing their coronavirus-related restrictions and as the global pandemic has been knocked from the headlines by the national unrest in the wake of the killing of George Floyd in Minnesota on Memorial Day. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the federal government’s top infectious diseases expert, said in an interview published this week that the White House coronavirus task force meetings are not occurring as frequently as they used to. “And certainly my meetings with the president have been dramatically decreased,” Dr. Fauci told the health news website Stat.

More than a quarter of U.S. adults said they would be unlikely to get a coronavirus vaccine that was free of charge and protected them from infection, according to polling released on Tuesday. Overall, 27% of adults said they “definitely” or “probably” would not get the vaccine, according to the ABC News/Washington Post poll. Forty-three percent said they would definitely get a vaccine and 28% said they would probably get one. TOP STORIES

Eighty-one percent of Democrats, 71% of independents and 58% of Republicans said they would definitely or probably get a vaccine that protected them from the virus and that was available for free. The results are similar to other recent surveys gauging public interest in the U.S. on a vaccine. There are more than 1.8 million positive cases in the U.S. and more than 105,000 coronavirus-related deaths, according to a tracker from Johns Hopkins University. The survey of 1,001 U.S. adults was conducted from May 25-28 and has a margin of error of 3.5 points.

MONTCLAIR, N.J. (AP) — Joe Biden could seize the number of delegates  needed to formally clinch the Democrats’ presidential nomination on  Tuesday as seven states and the District of Columbia push through a  pandemic and exploding racial tensions to host the largest slate of  primary elections in almost three months. Voters will be asked to navigate curfews, health concerns and a sharp  increase in mail balloting as elections take place from Maryland to  Montana. Four states were originally scheduled to vote in April but  delayed their contests because of the coronavirus outbreak. Pennsylvania  offers the day’s biggest trove of delegates and represents a  high-profile test case for Republicans and Democrats working to  strengthen their operations in one of the most important general  election battlegrounds. “We think we’re prepared,” said state Democratic Party Chairwoman  Nancy Patton Mills. “Thank goodness we have the opportunity of working  this out in the primary because we don’t know where we’ll be with the  pandemic in November.” TOP STORIES

                               Biden needs to win 89% of all delegates at stake on Tuesday to clinch  the nomination, but his role as his party’s clear presidential nominee  is not in danger should he fall short. With a dominant showing on Super  Tuesday in early March, the former vice president pushed out all his  major opponents. He will almost certainly secure the needed delegates  later in the month if necessary. Still, Tuesday offers a historic opportunity for the 77-year-old  Democrat, who is waging his third presidential campaign and who hopes to  amass as many delegates as possible to show strength before going up  against President Donald Trump. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is not actively campaigning, having  suspended his operation and endorsed Biden, but his name will appear on  the ballots. On the eve of Tuesday’s primaries, senior adviser Jeff  Weaver encouraged progressives to vote for Sanders anyway. “People who support Bernie Sanders and his agenda, who want to  maximize the influence of progressives at the convention, should cast  their vote for Bernie Sanders,” Weaver said, reminding voters that the  Vermont senator is seeking leverage to shape the party’s platform and  rules. The comments serve as a reminder that Biden may have no legitimate  Democratic rivals remaining, but he must still win over skeptical  activists from his party’s far-left flank who worry he’s too close to  the political establishment. Party unity will likely be an afterthought this week, however, as  more immediate health and safety concerns dominate the national  conversation. The coronavirus death toll has surged past 100,000 nationwide, and  thousands of new cases are reported each day. At the same time, several  major cities, including some voting Tuesday, are grappling with protests  following the killing of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died  after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s  neck for several minutes. Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser ordered a 7 p.m. curfew, though  voting places will be open until 8 p.m. Voting has been deemed  essential, and city officials say voters will not be subject to arrest  if they cast ballots during the curfew. It’s much the same in  Philadelphia, where officials have promised that voters would not be  arrested should their city’s 6 p.m. curfew be extended for a fourth  consecutive night. “We are in unique times and voting is a unique challenge for people,”  said Josh Schwerin, chief strategist for the pro-Democrat super PAC  Priorities USA. He said that his organization and others will be  watching closely on Tuesday “to see how well it works, where issues are,  and where obstacles have been put in place.” Political groups have had to adjust as some states move to a system  that relies largely on voting by mail. They include Montana, where all  56 counties decided to vote entirely by mail. Voting rights watchdogs in  multiple states have expressed concerns about access to mail ballots,  confusion about deadlines and a shortage of poll workers that could lead  to long lines. Those voting Tuesday include the District of Columbia, Indiana,  Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South  Dakota. An eighth state holding primary elections, Iowa, chose its  presidential nominee early in the year and focused on other offices.

Throughout January, the World Health Organization publicly praised  China for what it called a speedy response to the new coronavirus. It  repeatedly thanked the Chinese government for sharing the genetic map of  the virus “immediately,” and said its work and commitment to  transparency were “very impressive, and beyond words.” But behind the scenes, it was a much different story, one of  significant delays by China and considerable frustration among WHO  officials over not getting the information they needed to fight the  spread of the deadly virus, The Associated Press has found. Despite the plaudits, China in fact sat on releasing the genetic map,  or genome, of the virus for more than a week after three different  government labs had fully decoded the information. Tight controls on  information and competition within the Chinese public health system were  to blame, according to dozens of interviews and internal documents.

                               Chinese government labs only released the genome after another lab  published it ahead of authorities on a virologist website on Jan. 11.  Even then, China stalled for at least two weeks more on providing WHO  with detailed data on patients and cases, according to recordings of  internal meetings held by the U.N. health agency through January — all  at a time when the outbreak arguably might have been dramatically  slowed. WHO officials were lauding China in public because they wanted to  coax more information out of the government, the recordings obtained by  the AP suggest. Privately, they complained in meetings the week of Jan. 6  that China was not sharing enough data to assess how effectively the  virus spread between people or what risk it posed to the rest of the  world, costing valuable time. “We’re going on very minimal information,” said American  epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove, now WHO’s technical lead for  COVID-19, in one internal meeting. “It’s clearly not enough for you to  do proper planning.” “We’re currently at the stage where yes, they’re giving it to us 15  minutes before it appears on CCTV,” said WHO’s top official in China,  Dr. Gauden Galea, referring to the state-owned China Central Television,  in another meeting. The story behind the early response to the virus comes at a time when  the U.N. health agency is under siege, and has agreed to an independent  probe  of how the pandemic was handled globally. After repeatedly  praising the Chinese response early on, U.S. President Donald Trump has  blasted WHO in recent weeks for allegedly colluding with China to hide  the extent of the coronavirus crisis. He cut ties with the organization  on Friday, jeopardizing the approximately $450 million the U.S. gives  every year as WHO’s biggest single donor. In the meantime, Chinese President Xi Jinping has vowed to pitch in  $2 billion over the next two years to fight the coronavirus, saying  China has always provided information to WHO and the world “in a most  timely fashion.” The new information does not support the narrative of either the U.S.  or China, but instead portrays an agency now stuck in the middle that  was urgently trying to solicit more data despite limits to its own  authority. Although international law obliges countries to report  information to WHO that could have an impact on public health, the U.N.  agency has no enforcement powers and cannot independently investigate  epidemics within countries. Instead, it must rely on the cooperation of  member states. The recordings suggest that rather than colluding with China, as  Trump declared, WHO was kept in the dark as China gave it the minimal  information required by law. However, the agency did try to portray  China in the best light, likely as a means to secure more information.  And WHO experts genuinely thought Chinese scientists had done “a very  good job” in detecting and decoding the virus, despite the lack of  transparency from Chinese officials. WHO staffers debated how to press China for gene sequences and  detailed patient data without angering authorities, worried about losing  access and getting Chinese scientists into trouble. Under international  law, WHO is required to quickly share information and alerts with  member countries about an evolving crisis. Galea noted WHO could not  indulge China’s wish to sign off on information before telling other  countries because “that is not respectful of our responsibilities.” In the second week of January, WHO’s chief of emergencies, Dr.  Michael Ryan, told colleagues it was time to “shift gears” and apply  more pressure on China, fearing a repeat of the outbreak of Severe Acute  Respiratory Syndrome that started in China in 2002 and killed nearly  800 people worldwide. “This is exactly the same scenario, endlessly trying to get updates  from China about what was going on,” he said. “WHO barely got out of  that one with its neck intact given the issues that arose around  transparency in southern China.” Ryan said the best way to “protect China” was for WHO to do its own  independent analysis with data from the Chinese government, because  otherwise the spread of the virus between people would be in question  and “other countries will take action accordingly.” Ryan also noted that  China was not cooperating in the same way some other countries had in  the past. “This would not happen in Congo and did not happen in Congo and other  places,” he said, probably referring to the Ebola outbreak that began  there in 2018. “We need to see the data. … It’s absolutely important at  this point.” The delay in the release of the genome stalled the recognition of its  spread to other countries, along with the global development of tests,  drugs and vaccines. The lack of detailed patient data also made it  harder to determine how quickly the virus was spreading — a critical  question in stopping it. Between the day the full genome was first decoded by a government lab  on Jan. 2 and the day WHO declared a global emergency on Jan. 30, the  outbreak spread by a factor of 100 to 200 times, according to  retrospective infection data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control  and Prevention. The virus has now infected over 6 million people  worldwide and killed more than 375,000. “It’s obvious that we could have saved more lives and avoided many,  many deaths if China and the WHO had acted faster,” said Ali Mokdad, a  professor at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the  University of Washington. However, Mokdad and other experts also noted that if WHO had been  more confrontational with China, it could have triggered a far worse  situation of not getting any information at all. If WHO had pushed too hard, it could even have been kicked out of  China, said Adam Kamradt-Scott, a global health professor at the  University of Sydney. But he added that a delay of just a few days in  releasing genetic sequences can be critical in an outbreak. And he noted  that as Beijing’s lack of transparency becomes even clearer, WHO  director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus’s continued defense of China  is problematic. “It’s definitely damaged WHO’s credibility,” said Kamradt-Scott. “Did  he go too far? I think the evidence on that is clear….it has led to so  many questions about the relationship between China and WHO. It is  perhaps a cautionary tale.” WHO and its officials named in this story declined to answer  questions asked by The Associated Press without audio or written  transcripts of the recorded meetings, which the AP was unable to supply  to protect its sources. “Our leadership and staff have worked night and day in compliance  with the organization’s rules and regulations to support and share  information with all Member States equally, and engage in frank and  forthright conversations with governments at all levels,” a WHO  statement said. China’s National Health Commission and the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs had no comment. But in the past few months, China has repeatedly  defended its actions, and many other countries - including the U.S. -  have responded to the virus with even longer delays of weeks and even  months. “Since the beginning of the outbreak, we have been continuously  sharing information on the epidemic with the WHO and the international  community in an open, transparent and responsible manner,” said Liu  Mingzhu, an official with the National Health Commission’s International  Department, at a press conference  on May 15. ___________ The race to find the genetic map of the virus started in late  December, according to the story that unfolds in interviews, documents  and the WHO recordings. That’s when doctors in Wuhan noticed mysterious  clusters of patients with fevers and breathing problems who weren’t  improving with standard flu treatment. Seeking answers, they sent test  samples from patients to commercial labs. By Dec. 27, one lab, Vision Medicals, had pieced together most of the  genome of a new coronavirus with striking similarities to SARS. Vision  Medicals shared its data with Wuhan officials and the Chinese Academy of  Medical Sciences, as reported first by Chinese finance publication  Caixin and independently confirmed by the AP. On Dec. 30, Wuhan health officials issued internal notices warning of  the unusual pneumonia, which leaked on social media. That evening, Shi  Zhengli, a coronavirus expert at the Wuhan Institute of Virology who is  famous for having traced the SARS virus to a bat cave, was alerted to  the new disease, according to an interview with Scientific American. Shi  took the first train from a conference in Shanghai back to Wuhan. The next day, Chinese CDC director Gao Fu dispatched a team of  experts to Wuhan. Also on Dec. 31, WHO first learned about the cases  from an open-source platform that scouts for intelligence on outbreaks,  emergencies chief Ryan has said. WHO officially requested more information on Jan. 1. Under  international law, members have 24 to 48 hours to respond, and China  reported two days later that there were 44 cases and no deaths. By Jan. 2, Shi had decoded the entire genome of the virus, according to a notice later posted on her institute’s website. Scientists agree that Chinese scientists detected and sequenced the  then-unknown pathogen with astonishing speed, in a testimony to China’s  vastly improved technical capabilities since SARS, during which a  WHO-led group of scientists took months to identify the virus. This  time, Chinese virologists proved within days that it was a  never-before-seen coronavirus. Tedros would later say Beijing set “a new  standard for outbreak response.” But when it came to sharing the information with the world, things began to go awry. On Jan. 3, the National Health Commission issued a confidential  notice ordering labs with the virus to either destroy their samples or  send them to designated institutes for safekeeping. The notice, first  reported by Caixin and seen by the AP, forbade labs from publishing  about the virus without government authorization. The order barred Shi’s  lab from publishing the genetic sequence or warning of the potential  danger. Chinese law states that research institutes cannot conduct  experiments on potentially dangerous new viruses without approval from  top health authorities. Although the law is intended to keep experiments  safe, it gives top health officials wide-ranging powers over what  lower-level labs can or cannot do. “If the virologist community had operated with more autonomy….the  public would have been informed of the lethal risk of the new virus much  earlier,” said Edward Gu, a professor at Zhejiang University, and Li  Lantian, a PhD student at Northwestern University, in a paper published  in March analyzing the outbreak. Commission officials later repeated that they were trying to ensure  lab safety, and had tasked four separate government labs with  identifying the genome at the same time to get accurate, consistent  results. By Jan. 3, the Chinese CDC had independently sequenced the virus,  according to internal data seen by the Associated Press. And by just  after midnight on Jan. 5, a third designated government lab, the Chinese  Academy of Medical Sciences, had decoded the sequence and submitted a  report - pulling all-nighters to get results in record time, according  to a state media interview. Yet even with full sequences decoded by  three state labs independently, Chinese health officials remained  silent. The WHO reported on Twitter that investigations were under way  into an unusual cluster of pneumonia cases with no deaths in Wuhan, and  said it would share “more details as we have them.” Meanwhile, at the Chinese CDC, gaps in coronavirus expertise proved a problem. For nearly two weeks, Wuhan reported no new infections, as officials  censored doctors who warned of suspicious cases. Meanwhile, researchers  found the new coronavirus used a distinct spike protein to bind itself  to human cells. The unusual protein and the lack of new cases lulled  some Chinese CDC researchers into thinking the virus didn’t easily  spread between humans - like the coronavirus that casues Middle East  respiratory syndrome, or MERS, according to an employee who declined to  be identified out of fear of retribution. Li, the coronavirus expert, said he immediately suspected the  pathogen was infectious when he spotted a leaked copy of a sequencing  report in a group chat on a SARS-like coronavirus. But the Chinese CDC  team that sequenced the virus lacked specialists in the molecular  structure of coronaviruses and failed to consult with outside  scientists, Li said. Chinese health authorities rebuffed offers of  assistance from foreign experts, including Hong Kong scientists barred  from a fact-finding mission to Wuhan and an American professor at a  university in China. On Jan. 5, the Shanghai Public Clinical Health Center, led by famed  virologist Zhang Yongzhen, was the latest to sequence the virus. He  submitted it to the GenBank database, where it sat awaiting review, and  notified the National Health Commission. He warned them that the new  virus was similar to SARS and likely infectious. “It should be contagious through respiratory passages,” the center  said in an internal notice seen by the AP. “We recommend taking  preventative measures in public areas.” On the same day, WHO said that based on preliminary information from  China, there was no evidence of significant transmission between humans,  and did not recommend any specific measures for travelers. The next day, the Chinese CDC raised its emergency level to the  second highest. Staffers proceeded to isolate the virus, draft lab  testing guidelines, and design test kits. But the agency did not have  the authority to issue public warnings, and the heightened emergency  level was kept secret even from many of its own staff. By Jan. 7, another team at Wuhan University had sequenced the  pathogen and found it matched Shi’s, making Shi certain they had  identified a novel coronavirus. But Chinese CDC experts said they didn’t  trust Shi’s findings and needed to verify her data before she could  publish, according to three people familiar with the matter. Both the  National Health Commission and the Ministry of Science and Technology,  which oversees Shi’s lab, declined to make Shi available for an  interview. A major factor behind the gag order, some say, was that Chinese CDC  researchers wanted to publish their papers first. “They wanted to take  all the credit,” said Li Yize, a coronavirus researcher at the  University of Pennsylvania. Internally, the leadership of the Chinese CDC is plagued with fierce  competition, six people familiar with the system explained. They said  the agency has long promoted staff based on how many papers they can  publish in prestigious journals, making scientists reluctant to share  data. As the days went by, even some of the Chinese CDC’s own staff began  to wonder why it was taking so long for authorities to identify the  pathogen. “We were getting suspicious, since within one or two days you would  get a sequencing result,” a lab technician said, declining to be  identified for fear of retribution. ___________ On Jan. 8, the Wall Street Journal  reported that scientists had  identified a new coronavirus in samples from pneumonia patients in  Wuhan, pre-empting and embarrassing Chinese officials. The lab  technician told the AP they first learned about the discovery of the  virus from the Journal. The article also embarrassed WHO officials. Dr. Tom Grein, chief of  WHO’s acute events management team, said the agency looked “doubly,  incredibly stupid.” Van Kerkhove, the American expert, acknowledged WHO  was “already late” in announcing the new virus and told colleagues that  it was critical to push China. Ryan, WHO’s chief of emergencies, was also upset at the dearth of information. “The fact is, we’re two to three weeks into an event, we don’t have a  laboratory diagnosis, we don’t have an age, sex or geographic  distribution, we don’t have an epi curve,” he complained, referring to  the standard graphic of outbreaks scientists use to show how an epidemic  is progressing. After the article, state media officially announced the discovery of  the new coronavirus. But even then, Chinese health authorities did not  release the genome, diagnostic tests, or detailed patient data that  could hint at how infectious the disease was. By that time, suspicious cases were already appearing across the region. On Jan. 8, Thai airport officers pulled aside a woman from Wuhan with  a runny nose, sore throat, and high temperature. Chulalongkorn  University professor Supaporn Wacharapluesadee’s team found the woman  was infected with a new coronavirus, much like what Chinese officials  had described. Supaporn partially figured out the genetic sequence by  Jan. 9, reported it to the Thai government and spent the next day  searching for matching sequences. But because Chinese authorities hadn’t published any sequences, she  found nothing. She could not prove the Thai virus was the same pathogen  sickening people in Wuhan. “It was kind of wait and see, when China will release the data, then we can compare,” said Supaporn. On Jan. 9, a 61-year-old man with the virus passed away in Wuhan -  the first known death. The death wasn’t made public until Jan. 11. WHO officials complained in internal meetings that they were making  repeated requests for more data, especially to find out if the virus  could spread efficiently between humans, but to no avail. “We have informally and formally been requesting more epidemiological  information,” WHO’s China representative Galea said. “But when asked  for specifics, we could get nothing.” Emergencies chief Ryan grumbled that since China was providing the  minimal information required by international law, there was little WHO  could do. But he also noted that last September, WHO had issued an  unusual public rebuke of Tanzania for not providing enough details about  a worrisome Ebola outbreak. “We have to be consistent,” Ryan said. “The danger now is that  despite our good intent…especially if something does happen, there  will be a lot of finger-pointing at WHO.” Ryan noted that China could make a “huge contribution” to the world  by sharing the genetic material immediately, because otherwise “other  countries will have to reinvent the wheel over the coming days.” On Jan. 11, a team led by Zhang, from the Shanghai Public Health  Clinical Center, finally published a sequence on virological.org, used  by researchers to swap tips on pathogens. The move angered Chinese CDC  officials, three people familiar with the matter said, and the next day,  his laboratory was temporarily shuttered by health authorities. Zhang referred a request for comment to the Chinese CDC. The National  Health Commission, which oversees the Chinese CDC, declined multiple  times to make its officials available for interviews and did not answer  questions about Zhang. Supaporn compared her sequence with Zhang’s and found it was a 100%  match, confirming that the Thai patient was ill with the same virus  detected in Wuhan. Another Thai lab got the same results. That day,  Thailand informed the WHO, said Tanarak Plipat, deputy director-general  of the Department of Disease Control at Thailand’s Ministry of Public  Health. After Zhang released the genome, the Chinese CDC, the Wuhan Institute  of Virology and the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences raced to  publish their sequences, working overnight to review them, gather  patient data, and send them to the National Health Commission for  approval, according to documentation obtained by the AP. On Jan. 12, the  three labs together finally published the sequences on GISAID, a  platform for scientists to share genomic data. By then, more than two weeks had passed since Vision Medicals decoded  a partial sequence, and more than a week since the three government  labs had all obtained full sequences. Around 600 people were infected in  that week, a roughly three-fold increase. Some scientists say the wait was not unreasonable considering the  difficulties in sequencing unknown pathogens, given accuracy is as  important as speed. They point to the SARS outbreak in 2003 when some  Chinese scientists initially - and wrongly - believed the source of the  epidemic was chlamydia. “The pressure is intense in an outbreak to make sure you’re right,”  said Peter Daszak, president of the EcoHealthAlliance in New York. “It’s  actually worse to go out to go to the public with a story that’s wrong  because the public completely lose confidence in the public health  response.” Still, others quietly question what happened behind the scenes. Infectious diseases expert John Mackenzie, who served on a WHO  emergency committee during the outbreak, praised the speed of Chinese  researchers in sequencing the virus. But he said once central  authorities got involved, detailed data trickled to a crawl. “There certainly was a kind of blank period,” Mackenzie said. “There  had to be human to human transmission. You know, it’s staring at you in  the face… I would have thought they would have been much more open at  that stage.” _________________ On Jan. 13, WHO announced that Thailand had a confirmed case of the virus, jolting Chinese officials. The next day, in a confidential teleconference, China’s top health  official ordered the country to prepare for a pandemic, calling the  outbreak the “most severe challenge since SARS in 2003”, as the AP  previously reported. Chinese CDC staff across the country began  screening, isolating, and testing for cases, turning up hundreds across  the country. Yet even as the Chinese CDC internally declared a level one  emergency, the highest level possible, Chinese officials still said the  chance of sustained transmission between humans was low. WHO went back and forth. Van Kerkhove said in a press briefing that  “it is certainly possible there is limited human-to-human transmission.”  But hours later, WHO seemed to backtrack, and tweeted that “preliminary  investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear  evidence of human-to-human transmission” — a statement that later  became fodder for critics. A high-ranking official in WHO’s Asia office, Dr. Liu Yunguo, who  attended medical school in Wuhan, flew to Beijing to make direct,  informal contacts with Chinese officials, recordings show. Liu’s former  classmate, a Wuhan doctor, had alerted him that pneumonia patients were  flooding the city’s hospitals, and Liu pushed for more experts to visit  Wuhan, according to a public health expert familiar with the matter. On Jan. 20, the leader of an expert team returning from Wuhan,  renowned government infectious diseases doctor Zhong Nanshan, declared  publicly for the first time that the new virus was spreading between  people. Chinese President Xi Jinping called for the “timely publication  of epidemic information and deepening of international cooperation.” Despite that directive, WHO staff still struggled to obtain enough  detailed patient data from China about the rapidly evolving outbreak.  That same day, the U.N. health agency dispatched a small team to Wuhan  for two days, including Galea, the WHO representative in China. They were told about a worrying cluster of cases among more than a  dozen doctors and nurses. But they did not have “transmission trees”  detailing how the cases were connected, nor a full understanding of how  widely the virus was spreading and who was at risk. In an internal meeting, Galea said their Chinese counterparts were  “talking openly and consistently” about human-to-human transmission, and  that there was a debate about whether or not this was sustained. Galea  reported to colleagues in Geneva and Manila that China’s key request to  WHO was for help “in communicating this to the public, without causing  panic.” On Jan. 22, WHO convened an independent committee to determine  whether to declare a global health emergency. After two inconclusive  meetings where experts were split, they decided against it - even as  Chinese officials ordered Wuhan sealed in the biggest quarantine in  history. The next day, WHO chief Tedros publicly described the spread of  the new coronavirus in China as “limited.” For days, China didn’t release much detailed data, even as its case  count exploded. Beijing city officials were alarmed enough to consider  locking down the capital, according to a medical expert with direct  knowledge of the matter. On Jan. 28, Tedros and top experts, including Ryan, made an  extraordinary trip to Beijing to meet President Xi and other senior  Chinese officials. It is highly unusual for WHO’s director-general to  directly intervene in the practicalities of outbreak investigations.  Tedros‘ staffers had prepared a list of requests for information. “It could all happen and the floodgates open, or there’s no  communication,” Grein said in an internal meeting while his boss was in  Beijing. “We’ll see.” At the end of Tedros’ trip, WHO announced China had agreed to accept  an international team of experts. In a press briefing on Jan. 29, Tedros  heaped praise on China, calling its level of commitment “incredible.” The next day, WHO finally declared an international health emergency.  Once again, Tedros thanked China, saying nothing about the earlier lack  of cooperation. “We should have actually expressed our respect and gratitude to China  for what it’s doing,” Tedros said. “It has already done incredible  things to limit the transmission of the virus to other countries.”

The coronavirus pandemic that upended everyday life and killed more than 104,000 Americans no longer leads the newscasts as protests against police brutality roil major cities, sparking concern that the public may let up its guard against the insidious disease. Disease trackers already feared a second wave of transmission as businesses slowly reopened and people eager to socialize crowded into beach towns and summertime party hubs. Now, people marching or rioting in the wake of George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis aren’t practicing social distancing, either, creating fears that protests will become “superspreader” events.

                               “Don’t snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. We’re talking about reopening in one week in New York City, and now we’re seeing these mass gatherings over the past several nights that could, in fact, exacerbate the COVID-19 spread,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. “We spent all this time closed down, locked down, masks, socially distanced — and then you turn on the TV and you see these mass gatherings that could potentially be infecting hundreds and hundreds of people, after everything that we have done. We have to take a minute and ask ourselves, ‘What are we doing here?’ “ The Democratic governor said he shares the protesters’ outrage and noted that America’s struggle with racism extends far beyond the Minneapolis incident. Still, he is concerned about the gatherings. “How many superspreaders were in that crowd?” he said before addressing the fact that many protesters weren’t in the most vulnerable age group. “How many young people went home and kissed their mother ‘hello’ or shook hands with their father or hugged their father or their grandfather or their grandmother or their brother or their sister and spread a virus?” Protesters in cities across America are shouting, potentially releasing virus-laded droplets. Although they are outside, allowing viral particles to drift off, demonstrators are so close together that there is plenty of risk. “The single thing that I am most worried about is a lot of these folks aren’t wearing masks or have them down around their neck, and a lot of police aren’t wearing masks,” said Jordan Strauss, managing director for business intelligence and investigations at Kroll, a global risk consultancy. Personal protective equipment “is already in short supply, and we are dealing with an extremely transmissible virus hitting minority communities particularly hard,” he said. “I’m concerned about legitimate protesters and their families getting sick.” Some violent provocateurs don’t live in the places where protests are happening, so “they could carry the virus into places it hasn’t been before. It is a huge risk right now,” said Mr. Strauss, who once served as a director at the White House National Security Council specializing in incident management. The coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China, in December and has spread around the globe. It has infected 1.8 million people in the U.S. and killed more than 104,000. Nursing homes have been hit incredibly hard. Federal officials have obtained reports of nearly 26,000 nursing home residents dying from COVID-19, according to materials prepared for the nation’s governors and provided to The Associated Press. As transmission slows across the country, however, states have begun to reopen restaurants, shops and offices to get the economy revving again. The protests are “another one of these things that we have to balance as a society. We’re balancing economics against prevention of transmission. In this case, we’re balancing freedom of speech and freedom to protest against epidemic parameters around the infectious disease,” said Michael Mina, assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Although some of the protesters are wearing face coverings that can slow transmission, many aren’t. Asymptomatic people can spread the coronavirus, so they might not know it when they hit the streets. “There’s no doubt in my mind that these can become breeding grounds for this virus,” Mr. Mina said. “The one benefit is that they tend to be outside.” Hopefully, he said, breezes and other outdoor conditions will distribute many viral particles away from the crowds. The New York City Department of Health tweeted tips to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19. It urged those who “plan to protest” to wear face coverings, use hand sanitizer and use noise-makers instead of yelling. It also advised protesters to stick to small groups and stay at least 6 feet away from other groups. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser told local residents to get tested for the virus after mingling with other protesters. “A mass gathering is a mass gathering,” said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “When people are socially interacting and unable to social distance, shouting and being sprayed with agents that caused them to cough, it is a simple biological fact the transmission events are going to occur.”

Health officials say their fledgling efforts to trace and stem the spread of the coronavirus could be hampered by protests across the country. The situation could mean more bad news for businesses seeking to recover from coronavirus shutdowns and recent rioting: Contact tracing is a key element of many states’ plans to further reopen their economies. A lack of contact tracing could result in uptick in COVID-19 cases and delay reopening plans. Large groups of protesters in numerous cities are causes for concern for infectious disease experts.

                               “Whenever you have people in crowded places and close proximity, you have an increased possibility of spread from person-to-person,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute on Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “I think if you have the element of public disruption where people are gathering in a disruptive way without any control over crowds and people are intermingling, clearly there is a chance there will be an uptick in infections …” State and local officials have been attempting to gradually reopen after weeks of stay-at-home orders, but health experts say widespread testing, contact tracing and isolation must be in place to prevent new outbreaks of infections. “A mass gathering is a mass gathering. When people are socially interacting and unable to social distance, shouting, and being sprayed with agents that caused them to cough, it is a simple biological fact the transmission events are going to occur,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar for Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. ” … The sheer numbers of exposures in some cities may be above the threshold that a health department can handle in terms of contact tracing. “If these protests lead to surges in cases and transmission chains that spill into hospitals and cause stress on the system, it will be a setback to reopening safely,” Dr. Adalja said. Thousands of people across the country have protested the death of George Floyd, a black man who died on Memorial Day after a white Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck for nearly 9 minutes. The protests’ impact on the spread of COVID-19 is unknown. Most demonstrations were outside, where the chance for spread is lower, and some protesters have been properly wearing masks, noted Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University. He said the demonstrations could accelerate or lead to spikes in infections in parts of the country, particularly among people of color. “That’s exactly the population that has been disproportionately affected by COVID-19, and I have concerns that some new infections may be acquired during these demonstrations and then taken home to family and friends to spread even further,” said Dr. Schaffner. He added that mistrust in government officials and authority figures could disrupt contact tracing. People could be “leary” about providing the contact information of individuals they have been demonstrating with, Dr. Schaffner said. The protests also are disrupting coronavirus testing efforts in parts of the country. Some of the testing clinics in Minneapolis have been damaged during riots, according to a city government spokesperson. Two sites in Jacksonville, Florida, cancelled coronavirus testing on Sunday due to concerns about riots in the downtown area, and they remained closed Monday. All community-based coronavirus testing sites in Illinois were closed Monday following an announcement that public transportation and businesses across the state shut down over the weekend due to protests and looting in Chicago and other cities, Patch reported. On Saturday, Los Angeles’ mayor announced the closure of COVID-19 testing centers out of safety concerns from violent protests. “When you try to do public health measures, when you have disruptions like this, this could get in the way of the effectiveness of public health measures,” Dr. Fauci said. χ This article is based in part on wire service reports.

Two Democratic lawmakers on Monday called for federal prison officials to explain why two of President Trump’s former associates have been released into home confinement amid the coronavirus crisis, while “low-risk, vulnerable individuals” remain in prison. Sens. Kamala D. Harris of California and Hakeem Jeffries of New York sent a letter to Attorney General William P. Barr and Federal Bureau of Prisons Director Michael Carvajal saying they are concerned Trump associates are receiving favorable treatment. They pointed to the cases of Paul Manafort, who briefly served as Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman, who had been serving a sentence for financial fraud, and Michael Cohen, Mr. Trump’s former fixer, who pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations.

                               Both men were released to thin the prison population and stop the spread of the coronavirus. The lawmakers cite the case of Andrea Circle Bear, who was the first federal prisoner to die from COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. She was sentenced to two years on a drug charge and died weeks after delivering a baby via cesarean section. In another case, a 67-year-old man with coronary artery disease was denied home confinement because he had not served half of his sentence. “These examples make clear that there are two systems of justice in our country — one for President Trump and his associates, and another for everyone else. These examples also heighten our concern about the politicization of the Department of Justice,” the lawmakers wrote. Ms. Harris and Mr. Jefferies want to know if the White House asked to have Manafort or Cohen transferred to home confinement and a list of individuals involved in those decisions. The lawmakers asked Mr. Barr to provide details on how the Justice Department and Bureau of Prisons determine who is picked for home confinement.

Gun sales surged in May as shops reported an uptick in interest and demand amid national protests after the Memorial Day killing of George Floyd and as the COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc and stoke fear across the country. “Almost, you couldn’t even keep up with it. That’s how crazy it was,” said Joe Hawk, owner of Guns & Roses in New Jersey. “After Memorial Day, it spiked again. It just went crazy again.” Small Arms Analytics & Forecasting, a private research firm, estimated that more than 1.7 million guns were sold in May, an 80% jump from May 2019.

                               “Yet again, firearms sales have surged in unprecedented ways,” said Jurgen Brauer, the group’s chief economist. The stock prices for several gunmaking companies, including Sturm, Ruger & Co., jumped Monday. Larry Hyatt, owner of Hyatt Guns in Charlotte, North Carolina, said the gun demand prompted by COVID-19 was already straining suppliers. “Then you have this looting and rioting causing another demand, and it’s really putting pressure on inventory,” Mr. Hyatt said. Gun sales typically increase during presidential election years and during periods of national unrest, including after mass shootings, but Mr. Hyatt said the confluence of factors is unique. “There’s economic worry, there’s crime worry, and then you got the worry of the coronavirus — it’s [a] triple whammy,” he said. More than 3 million checks were run through the FBI’s national instant check system last month, which was a record for May and about a 32% increase from May 2019. The FBI numbers don’t match gun sales perfectly but are used as a general approximation to gauge the health of the market. Small Arms Analytics & Forecasting and other market analysts subtract from their reports permit checks and other data unlikely to be related to gun sales. “Now what you’re seeing happening across the country is only going to fuel concerns about personal safety,” said Mark Oliva, a spokesman for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the leading trade group for the gun industry. Sales were booming this year before the Floyd killing sparked national protests and tense standoffs between law enforcement and protesters this past week. Five of the 10 top days for FBI checks were in March, and five of the top 10 weeks were in periods covering February, March and April. Mr. Oliva said recent surveys of their retailers found that as many as 40% were first-time buyers. Small Arms Analytics & Forecasting reported that handgun sales likely clocked in at about 1 million in May, a 94% increase from last year, and the 535,000 long gun sales marked an increase of about 66%. “They’re buying predominantly handguns — small, defensive-use handguns — and they’re telling the retailers that they’re coming in to buy guns to be able to provide for their own safety, which was our suspicion as these sales started,” Mr. Oliva said. “I expect that those will continue as we go forward.” He said election-year politics can figure into the numbers. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, has pledged to push for strict gun controls if elected. Mr. Biden was among a number of officials across the country urging a de-escalation Monday as tensions over Mr. Floyd’s killing flared. He suggested that police could be trained to engage potential threats with non-lethal uses of firearms. “The idea that instead of standing there and teaching a cop when there’s an unarmed person coming at them with a knife or something to shoot them in the leg instead of the heart is a very different thing,” he told a gathering of black leaders at a church in Wilmington, Delaware. “There’s a lot of different things that could change.” During the post-Newtown gun control push, Mr. Biden suggested that people could scare off attempted intruders by firing a shotgun into the air. More than 4,000 arrests have been made across the country in recent days on charges including stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a tally from The Associated Press. More than 60 Secret Service officers and special agents were injured over the weekend as protests rocked the nation’s capital near the White House. D.C. Metropolitan Police Chief Peter Newsham said Monday that the department made 88 arrests Sunday and overnight and that seven officers sustained minor injuries.

The Democratic Republic of Congo has detected a new Ebola outbreak in its northwest Équateur province, adding to global health woes. Lab tests confirmed six cases. Four patients have died and two are receiving care, according to the World Health Organization. The outbreak in the health zone around the city of Mbandaka comes as the globe battles the COVID-19 pandemic. TOP STORIES

                               Also, the DRC is trying to stamp out the last embers of an Ebola outbreak in a war-torn, eastern province that’s been going on since 2018. “This is a reminder that COVID-19 is not the only health threat people face,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus said. “Although much of our attention is on the pandemic, WHO is continuing to monitor and respond to many other health emergencies.” The new Ebola outbreak is the 11th one recorded in the DRC since the disease was discovered in 1976. The ninth one occurred in the same area from May to July in 2018. WHO said it has personnel on the ground in Mbandaka to test samples and trace the contacts of infected persons.

The District has opened two more COVID-19 testing sites, one of which will accept walk-ups without an appointment required. The walk-up site opened in Northwest on F Street between 4th and 5th streets. “We’re going to be shutting down this part of the street so that we can have this walk-up testing site,” Mayor Muriel Bowser said at a press conference at Judiciary Square. “You can walk up here without an appointment if you need a COVID test.” TOP STORIES

                               Additionally, the District is replacing the former virus testing site at United Medical Center with one at 2241 Martin Luther King Jr. Ave. in Southeast. The District reported 56 new cases of the coronavirus Monday, bringing its total to 8,801 positive cases. It has tested 46,483 people in all out of a population of just more than 700,000. Two more District residents have died from the virus, for a total of 466. Miss Bowser noted that many of the protesters who have demonstrated in the District in recent days have worn masks, but D.C. health director Dr. LaQuandra Nesbitt said that masked gatherings, even peaceful protests, were “not something we would support at this time” due to the pandemic. “If you think were exposed at the protests or elsewhere, please get tested,” the office of D.C. Council member Elissa Silverman tweeted.

The public approval rating of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe fell over the weekend to its lowest point in roughly two years. The latest polling by Kyodo News shows Mr. Abe’s approval rating stands at 39.8% after widespread criticism of his government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. With a population of 126.5 million, Japan has reported 16,787 confirmed cases of COVID-19, 899 deaths and 14,422 recoveries, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker.

Mr. Abe moved to lift coronavirus restrictions last week after seeing a downtrend in new cases. 47.2% of respondents said the timing was too early, while 38.7% supported the timing. It also marks the first time the president’s approval rating has dipped below 40% since May 2018 after allegations of favoritism regarding school building projects, according to Japanese news reports.

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Tuesday’s primaries in eight states are the  biggest test to date of campaigning during the coronavirus era, a way  for parties to test-drive new ways of getting out the vote during a time  when it can be dangerous to leave your home. Voters from Pennsylvania to Iowa to New Mexico will cast ballots in  both the Democratic presidential contest, where former Vice President  Joe Biden is the only contender with an active campaign, and a host of  down-ballot primaries for everything from governors to state  representatives. Many states postponed elections scheduled between  mid-March and May to the date because of the coronavirus outbreak. Unable to send candidates out to barnstorm the states or volunteers  to knock on voters’ doors, campaigns have had to improvise. One  Pennsylvania Republican congressional campaign recruited 100 people,  including its candidate’s large extended family, to hand-write thousands  of letters to voters urging support. Another organized “pop-up food  banks” for the needy. Others moved up television advertising to  capitalize on a captive audience locked down at home. Democrats have  created a phone banking model almost along the lines of a technology  support hub, where knowledgeable volunteers and staffers can guide  confused voters, step by step, through the process of voting by mail.

                               “Any plan you had three months ago is out the window,” said Brock  Lowrance, a Republican strategist working on two Montana races - Sen.  Steve Daines’ reelection bid and Rep. Greg Gianforte’s bid for the GOP  gubernatorial nomination. “Campaigns are having to adapt in the ways  they’re talking to voters but also in the ways voters are going to  vote.” Some voting experts predict half or more of all ballots cast in the  November election will be sent through the mail, as the Centers for  Disease Control recommends as a way to lessen risk of exposure to the  virus at polling stations. States have scrambled to adjust to the new  reality with some sending every voter an absentee ballot request. In Iowa, the traditional frenzy of pre-primary  barbecues and rallies has shifted to twice-a-week Zoom training of  volunteers for Democratic Senate candidate Theresa Greenfield, who then  start dialing voters to ensure they’ve requested and returned their mail  ballots. “Just because we’re staying home doesn’t mean we’re standing still,” said Sam Newton, communication director for Greenfield. In Montana, where the populace is more accustomed to voting by mail,  the outbreak has still altered the rhythm of the political season.  Lowrance says he’s noticed far more down-ballot races advertising on  television, a reflection of how campaigns have fewer ways to reach  voters and more eyeballs glued to the screen during quarantine. Lowrance said campaigns, including his own, have had to watch their  budgets as the pandemic and economic crash have crimped fundraising and  refrained from hiring the legion of door-knockers who usually hit the  streets before elections. And now they are having to plan for two  possibilities - that November will resemble the intense lockdowns of the  past two months, or the more mixed reality of reopened states. “It’s really trying to build two different plans and execute them,” Lowrance said. The greatest attention is on Pennsylvania, however. It’s  simultaneously the biggest state voting on Tuesday, the only one that is  likely to be a presidential battleground in November and the state  that’s seen the biggest shift in voting in the COVID-19 era. That’s because this is the first statewide election under a new, more  permissive mail voting law passed last year. In 2016, only 4.6% of the  state’s voters cast a ballot by mail. Now 21% of all the state’s 8.5  million voters have already requested absentee ballots. Democrats are overwhelmingly the ones asking to vote by mail - 1.3  million have filed requests, compared with 525,000 Republicans, state  records show. That’s partly a reflection of GOP distrust of mail voting  that’s been stoked by President Donald Trump, who’s claimed without  evidence it will lead to widespread fraud. Even the Trump campaign,  recognizing that getting supporters to mail ballots in is key to winning  elections, has been pushing Republicans to use the technique. Some Pennsylvania Republicans have worried Trump is hobbling the  party by making its voters distrust the easiest method of voting during  the pandemic. Others argue the gap will close in the fall, when  Democrats aren’t the only ones to have a presidential candidate on the  ballot. “They had that Bernie and Biden thing going, and it drove some  enthusiasm, as it naturally would,” said Dave Feidt, the party chairman  in Dauphin County, home to the state capital of Harrisburg. “But to come  full circle, you’ll see a very different dynamic in the fall when  things are R against D.” Democrats are elated with their mail ballot lead, saying it reflects  their voters’ excitement. “They’re willing to crawl through broken glass  to make sure they participate,” said Democratic National Committee  spokesman David Bergstein. The party has also shifted its campaign tactics, building upon its  success in Wisconsin, where the state party pushed mail voting heavily  and Democrats won a contested state supreme court election in April. The  party has distributed new call scripts to volunteers with detailed  instructions on mail voting and ensured there are experts who can walk  confused voters through requesting ballots. People marooned at home are  answering phones and texts at a notably higher rate, Bergstein said. Pennsylvania has revealed one potential weak spot for Democrats in  the mail voting era - African Americans voters, who operatives say have  been requesting ballots at lower rates. Claudette Williams, a black  Democrat running for a state legislative seat in eastern Pennsylvania,  has had to replace her regular circuit of black churches with regular  Zoom calls with black ministers and their parishioners. Her campaign has  also organized “pop-up food banks” to distribute food to the needy, at a  distance, during the outbreak. Normally Williams would be frantically meeting voters in the days  before a primary. “Today I have to pick up 60 pounds of meat for a  pop-up pantry,” she said Friday. Republicans have also been testing new ways of reaching voters. Once  the lockdowns began, it switched its Trump Victory organizing push to  online meetings, says it recruited 300,000 new members who have made  millions of calls, often with the aid of the campaign’s app that helps  target voters in key states. “Within just 24 hours, our teams transitioned to an entirely virtual  campaign,” said Republican National Committee spokeswoman Mandi Merritt. Also conducting primaries Tuesday are Indiana, Maryland, Rhode Island and South Dakota.

CAIRO (AP) — Aid organizations are making an urgent plea for funding  to shore up their operations in war-torn Yemen, saying they have already  been forced to stop some of their work even as the coronavirus rips  through the country. Some 75% of U.N. programs in Yemen have had to shut their doors or  reduce operations. The global body’s World Food Program had to cut  rations in half and U.N.-funded health services were reduced in 189 out  of 369 hospitals nationwide. “It’s almost impossible to look a family in the face, to look them in  the eyes and say, ‘I’m sorry but the food that you need in order to  survive we have to cut in half,’” Lise Grande, resident U.N. coordinator  for Yemen, told The Associated Press.

                               The dwindling funds are the result of several factors, but among the  top reasons is obstruction by Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who control the  capital, Sanaa, and other territories. The United States, one of the  largest donors, decreased its aid to Yemen earlier this year, citing  interference by the Houthis. It’s yet to be seen whether the Houthis will allow monitoring and  oversight or give U.N. agencies the space to operate. A U.N. pledging  conference for Yemen on Tuesday seeks $2.41 billion to cover essential  activities from June to December. Grande said the Houthis are working to become more transparent, and  that she hopes this will encourage donor countries to give aid. Her optimism, however, comes as the Houthis face heavy criticism for  suppressing information about the number of COVID-19 cases and  fatalities in areas they control, while putting no mitigation measures  in place. Tuesday’s conference will be co-hosted for the first time by Saudi  Arabia - a major player in Yemen’s civil war since it first unleashed a  bombing campaign in 2015 to try to push back the Iranian-backed Houthis  who had seized the northern half of the country. Critics question the Saudis’ high-profile role in rallying  humanitarian support even as they continue to wage a war - as do the  Houthis - that has created the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Maysaa Shuja al-Deen, a Yemeni researcher and a non-resident fellow  at the Sana’a Center for Strategic Studies, said the kingdom is trying  to repair its international image by changing the conversation. Saudi Arabia “has always tried to change the narrative of the war and  present itself as a backer of the legitimate government, not part of  the conflict,” she said. In past years, the kingdom has been one of the top donors for U.N.  humanitarian aid operations in Yemen. The Saudi ambassador to Yemen,  Mohammed al-Jaber, said the kingdom will allocate half a billion dollars  this year to support U.N. programs, including $25 million for a  COVID-19 response plan. The U.N. itself has also investigated allegations of corruption and diversion of aid in Yemen in its own ranks. Reports indicate that the coronavirus is spreading at an alarming rate throughout the country. Among the slashed programs is financial support to thousands of  health workers who haven’t received salaries from the government for  nearly three years. Grande said that just a week before the first  coronavirus case was announced in Yemen, aid agencies had to stop paying  health workers. Without salaries, medical staff won’t be able to provide health services to patients amid the pandemic. The U.N. received around $3.6 billion in 2019 in international  donations for its campaign, short of its $4.2 billion goal. For its 2020  plan, it has so far received only 15% out of the needed $3.5 billion. Yemen has been caught in a grinding war since 2014 when Houthi rebels  descended from their northern enclave and took over Sanaa, forcing the  internationally recognized president to flee. In the spring of 2015, a  U.S.-backed, Saudi-led coalition began a destructive air campaign to  dislodge the Houthis while imposing a land, sea and air embargo on  Yemen. The air war and fighting on the ground has killed more than 100,000  people, shut down or destroyed half of Yemen’s health facilities, and  driven 4 million Yemenis from their homes. Cholera epidemics and severe  malnutrition among children have led to thousands of additional deaths. As the war enters its sixth year, with no sign of a viable  cease-fire, the suffering looks set to continue. Fighting has continued  unabated along several front lines in Yemen, including in Marib, an  oil-rich eastern province, threatening new waves of displacement. The U.N.’s massive aid program, totaling $8.35 billion since 2015, is  vital to keeping many Yemenis alive. Ten million people are on the  brink of famine and 80% of the 30 million population are in need of aid,  according to the U.N. With the coronavirus spreading, more money is needed. Since April, authorities in areas controlled by Yemen’s  internationally recognized government reported 283 cases, including 85  deaths. The Houthis declared only four cases, including one death. The World Health Organization believes that there is a significant  underestimation of the outbreak, which could further hinder efforts to  get supplies into Yemen that are needed to contain the virus. Richard Brennan, the WHO’s regional emergency director, told the AP  that he believes the deaths are in the hundreds and cases in the  thousands, based on what he’s heard from numerous health care providers.  But he said the lack of funding means the organization’s health  programs are hanging by a thread. The International Rescue Committee, an aid group, said Yemen is  conducting just 31 tests per one million people, among the world’s  lowest scores. With increasing needs and fewer funds, the U.N. refugee agency will  have to stop cash assistance and shelter programs for more than 50,000  displaced families by August, said spokeswoman Heba Kanso. She said the  agency will be forced to end its partnership with dozens of Yemeni NGOs  that will have let go more than 1,500 national staff. Relief agencies worry that donors will give less as many countries  struggle their own virus outbreaks. But they warn that the world’s worst  humanitarian crisis can indeed get much worse. “The world’s attention is diverted elsewhere and these are the  vulnerable among the most vulnerable on the planet, and we need a  commitment,” said Brennan.

ROME (AP) — The first day of June saw coronavirus restrictions ease  from Asia to Europe on Monday, even as U.S. protests against police  brutality sparked fears of new outbreaks. The Colosseum opened its  ancient doors in Rome, ferries restarted in Bangladesh, golfers played  in Greece, students returned in Britain and Dutch bars and restaurants  were free to welcome hungry, thirsty patrons. Countries around the Mediterranean Sea began tentatively to kickoff a  summer season in which tourists could bask in their famously sunny  beaches while still being protected by social distancing measures from a  virus that is marching relentlessly around the world. “We are reopening a symbol. A symbol of Rome, a symbol for Italy,”  said Alfonsina Russo, director of the Colosseum’s archaeological park.  “(We are) restarting in a positive way, with a different pace, with a  more sustainable tourism, compatible with our cities.” TOP STORIES

                               Greece lifted lockdown measures Monday for hotels, campsites,  open-air cinemas, golf courses and public swimming pools, while beaches  and museums reopened in Turkey and bars, restaurants, cinemas and  museums came back to life in the Netherlands. A long line of masked visitors snaked outside the Vatican Museums,  which include the Sistine Chapel, as they reopened for the first time in  three months. Italy is eager to reboot its tourism industry, which  accounts for 13% of its economy. The Vatican Museums’ famous keyholder - the “clavigero” who holds the  keys to all the galleries on a big ring on his wrist - opened the gate  in a sign both symbolic and literal that the Museums were back in  business. Still, strict crowd control measures were in place at both the  Vatican and the Colosseum: visitors needed reservations to visit the  landmarks, their temperatures were taken before entering and wearing a  mask was mandatory. The Dutch relaxation of coronavirus rules took place on a major  public holiday with the sun blazing, raising immediate fears of  overcrowding in popular beach resorts like Scheveningen, near The Hague.  The new rules let bars and restaurants serve up to 30 people inside if  they keep social distancing, but there’s no standing at bars and  reservations are necessary. Britain, which with over 38,500 dead has the world’s second-worst  death toll behind the United States, eased restrictions despite warnings  from health officials that the risk of spreading COVID-19 was still too  great. Some elementary classes reopened in England and people could now have  limited contact with family and friends, but only outdoors and with  social distancing. In Asia, Bangladesh restarted bus, train, ferry and flight services  Monday, hoping that a gradual reopening revives an economy in which  millions have become jobless. Traffic jams and crowds of commuters  clogged Manila, as the Philippine capital embraced a high-stakes gamble  to kickstart the economy. Around 6.18 million infections have been reported worldwide, with  over 372,000 people dying, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins  University. The true death toll is believed to be significantly higher,  since many victims died without ever being tested. In the U.S., the often-violent protests over the death of George  Floyd, a black man pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police  officer, are raising fears of new virus outbreaks in a country that has  more confirmed infections and deaths than any other. Protests over Floyd’s death have shaken the U.S. from New York to Los  Angeles. Demonstrators are packed cheek by jowl, many without masks,  many chanting, shouting or singing. The virus is dispersed by  microscopic droplets in the air when people cough, sneeze, talk or sing. “There’s no question that when you put hundreds or thousands of  people together in close proximity, when we have got this virus all over  the streets … it’s not healthy,” Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said. The U.S. has seen more than 1.7 million infections and over 104,000  deaths in the pandemic, which has disproportionately affected racial  minorities in a nation that does not have universal health care. South Korea and India offered cautionary tales Monday about just how hard it is to halt the virus. South Korea reported a steady rise in cases around the capital after  getting praise earlier from around the world for appearing to bring its  outbreak under control. Hundreds of infections have been linked to  nightspots, restaurants and a massive e-commerce warehouse near Seoul,  the capital. The 35 new cases reported Monday include 30 around Seoul,  and the resurgence is straining the country’s ability to test patients  and trace their contacts. “We have been seeing an increased number of high-risk patients who  have been infected through family members or religious gatherings,” said  Jeong Eun-kyeong, director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention. “There’s a particular need for people over 65, pregnant  women and those with chronic medical conditions to be alert.” Incheon, a port city west of Seoul, on Monday said it’s considering  banning gatherings at 4,200 churches and other religious facilities. In India, cases increased rapidly even as it eased restrictions  Monday on shops and public transport in more states. Subways and schools  remain closed and experts said India is still far from reaching the  peak of its outbreak. The government was easing the lockdown to help  millions of day laborers who have lost their jobs and are unable to feed  their families. China, where the global pandemic is believed to have originated late  last year, reported 16 new cases on Monday, all travelers from abroad.  With local transmissions having fallen to virtually zero, much of China  has reopened for business and Monday saw the further restart of classes  in middle and high schools. Kindergartners and fourth- and fifth-graders  will be allowed back next week. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa says China has pledged to  make available 30 million COVID-19 testing kits per month to African  countries, which are facing a shortage. The U.S. has sent Brazil more than 2 million doses of a malaria drug  touted by President Donald Trump as potential treatment for coronavirus,  despite a scientific study that shows it can actually harm patients.  Brazil is Latin America’s hardest-hit nation in the pandemic, with  nearly 515,000 confirmed cases, second only to the U.S. Japan, meanwhile, started blood tests Monday in three areas including  Tokyo to check to what percentage of its people have developed  antibodies, a sign of past coronavirus infections. The tests will be  conducted on 10,000 randomly selected people over 20 years old and  results are expected at the end of the month. ___ Gorondi reported from Budapest and Kennedy reported from Miami.

NEW YORK (AP) — Protests erupting across the nation over the past  week - and law enforcement’s response to them - are threatening to upend  efforts by health officials to track and contain the spread of  coronavirus  just as those efforts were finally getting underway. Health experts need newly infected people to remember and recount  everyone they’ve interacted with over several days in order to alert  others who may have been exposed, and prevent them from spreading the  disease further. But that process, known as contact tracing, relies on  people knowing who they’ve been in contact with — a daunting task if  they’ve been to a mass gathering. And the process relies on something that may suddenly be in especially short supply: Trust in government. TOP STORIES

                               “These events that are happening now are further threats to the trust  we need,” said Dr. Sandro Galea, dean of the Boston University School  of Public Health. “If we do not have that, I worry our capacity to  control new outbreaks becomes more limited,” he said. Government officials have been hoping to continue reopening  businesses, churches and other organizations after months of  stay-at-home orders and other infection-prevention measures. But health  experts also hoped that any reopening would be accompanied by widespread  testing, contact tracing and isolation to prevent new waves of illness  from beginning. Over the past week, protests sparked by the death of George Floyd, a  black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pinned a  knee to his neck, have involved thousands of people gathered tightly  together in large crowds in more than 20 cities nationwide. It’s unclear if the protests themselves will trigger large new  outbreaks. The protests were outside, where infections don’t spread as  readily as indoors. Also, many of the protesters were wearing masks, and  much of the contact was likely less-hazardous “transient” moments of  people moving around, passing each other, said Dr. William Schaffner, an  infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University. But, still, experts worry that public efforts to contain the disease in the future could be undermined. In Los Angeles, the city’s mayor announced Saturday that COVID-19  testing centers were being closed because of safety concerns related to  violent protests. Testing in Minneapolis will be affected because some  of the clinics that provide the service have been damaged in the  protests, according to a city government spokesperson. Reduced testing could “be giving the virus another head start,” Schaffner said. And contract tracing, which is only just getting going in several  states, is an even bigger concern. It involves people who work for or  with health departments asking intimate questions about where a person  has been and who they’ve been talking to - and getting full, truthful  answers in return. “In this current environment which has enhanced or brought forth a  mistrust of governmental authority, it might make them disinclined to  speak with anyone in government,” Schaffner said. That is especially true in black communities trying to cope with  episodes of police violence and longstanding frustrations with how they  have been marginalized and mistreated by people who work for government  agencies. And those are the communities that have been hardest hit by  the coronavirus in the U.S. and most in need of public health measures  to help control it. In a press conference Saturday, Minnesota Public Safety Commissioner  John Harrington used the term “contact tracing” when describing an  investigation into arrested protesters there. He said the goal is to  “see if there are crime or white supremacy organizations that have  played a role” and “to understand how do we go after them, legally,”  Harrington said. But Harrington’s use of “contact tracing” by law enforcement may  complicate the job of health workers as they try to track the virus’s  spread, some experts said. “That was an abuse of the word ‘contact tracing.’ That is not what  contact tracing is,” said Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the  federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Contact tracing is a service to patients and their contacts to  provide services for patients and warning for contacts. It has nothing  to do with police activity. Nothing,” said Frieden, who is currently  president of Resolve to Save Lives, a nonprofit that works to prevent  epidemics. Galea said he hopes many people will separate in their minds the  contact tracing done by public health workers from crime investigations  by the police. But, he added, “I do think sometimes it’s difficult to  make a distinction when you feel marginalized by, and targeted by, the  entire government.” ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support  from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science  Education.

The Justice Department has added its support to a federal lawsuit challenging Maine Gov. Janet Mills‘ banning out-of-state residents from using state campgrounds during phase one of its reopening plan. The owners of two campgrounds and two restaurants in Maine filed a federal lawsuit against Ms. Mills, saying her reopening plan unconstitutionally violates people’s right to travel from state to state. Ms. Mills has ordered out-of-state residents coming to Maine to quarantine for 14 days before renting space at a campground or RV park.

                               She has also only allowed Maine residents to use the campgrounds until June 1. The plaintiffs say the order has hurt their businesses and is discriminatory because it treats Maine residents more favorably than nonresidents. Siding with the plaintiffs, the Justice Department said the order infringes upon Americans’ right to travel throughout the country. “Here, Maine likely has transgressed the Constitution’s limits by discriminating between Maine residents and out-of-state residents with respect to the ability to patronize campgrounds and RV parks within the state,” attorneys with the Department’s Civil Rights Division wrote Friday. Ms. Mills defended the restrictions, saying they are necessary to protect residents’ health. She also slammed the Justice Department for bringing the lawsuit. “I am deeply disappointed — and frankly disgusted — that the U.S. Department of Justice is making a concerted effort to undermine the health of the people of Maine — objections they never raised when the president and his own task force took steps to limit travel. It seems to me that their only actual ‘interest’ here is, at best, political or, at worst, to harm Mainers, not defend them,” she said in a statement. The businesses — Bayley’s Camping Resort, the Little River Bar & Grille and the Seaside Square Cafe, all in Scarborough, and the Little Ossipee Campground in Waterboro — say the order has hurt their business. Canceled reservations have cost the Little Ossipee Campground over $90,000 and Bayley’s Campground has received over 700 canceled reservations, refunded over $150,000 in reservation fees and lost over $26,000 in revenue, according to the lawsuit. The Justice Department said the losses could have been avoided and Ms. Mills hasn’t offered a good reason for why she’s banned non-Maine residents from campgrounds. “It is not obvious why a 14-day self-quarantine in a New Hampshire home, for instance, is any less effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19 than undergoing the same isolation in a house in Maine,” the department said. “Put simply, the mere fact that a traveler has recently been outside Maine is not a good proxy for the risk that he will spread COVID-19.” Maine Attorney General Aaron M. Frey also rebutted the Justice Department, saying the reopening plan is lawful and necessary. “The Executive Orders and the Restarting Plan at issue in this lawsuit were carefully crafted and have been reviewed and updated in order to protect Mainers’ health during the COVID-19 pandemic,” he said in a statement. “Specifically, the requirement for individuals traveling into Maine from out of state to self-quarantine for 14 days (with exemptions for essential workers) was examined by my office, which determined it was a lawful requirement consistent with Maine’s public health challenges.”

The U.S. and the World Health Organization do not agree on two major virus blockers — masks and social distance — resulting in inconsistent public advice on how to prevent COVID-19 infections. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a set policy on its website: “Stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arms’ length) from other people.” But WHO’s Dr. Michael Ryan, who directs its health emergency program, recommends about half that space — at least 1 meter, or a little over 3 feet, allowing people to mingle closer together.

                               “Our recommendations are 1 meter or more distance between individuals,” Dr. Ryan said at a press conference last week at WHO’s Geneva headquarters. “We recently had a systemic review that’s been conducted to look at influence, influence-like illness, coronavirus and COVID-19 which has found a strong protective effect of a distance of 1 meter or more so that’s important.” The CDC also splits with WHO on masks worn to block viruses expelled in sneezes, coughs and speech. In March, the CDC recommended coverings only for sick people and those caring for them. But in early April, it reversed course after studies showed that infected people without symptoms could spread the germ. “Everyone should wear a cloth face cover when they have to go out in public, for example to the grocery store or to pick up other necessities … The cloth face cover is meant to protect other people in case you are infected,” the CDC says. “Keep the covering on your face the entire time you’re in public,” the CDC adds in a recommendation that seems to require wearing a mask while taking a walk or sitting in a park. On this issue, there is wide disagreement among health professions, including WHO and the CDC. WHO’s Dr. Ryan still rejects public mask-wearing. “There is no specific evidence to suggest that the wearing of masks by the mass population has any potential benefit,” he said March 30. “In fact, there’s some evidence to suggest the opposite in the misuse of wearing a mask property and fitting it properly.” He reiterated last week that mask-wearing is for the infected and people treating them. “If someone is ill, as you know, we recommend the use of medical masks in that context or/and for people who are caring for somebody who is ill,” Dr. Ryan said. And WHO’s website says, “If you are healthy, you only need to wear a mask if you are taking care of a person with COVID-19.” A number of esteemed American medical experts took this exact view at one point. In early March, as the pandemic spread in America, Dr. Anthony Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on CBS’s “60 Minutes”: “The masks are important for someone who is infected to prevent them from infecting someone else. Now when you see people and look at the films in China and South Korea, where everyone is wearing a mask, right now in the United States people should not be walking around with masks. Right now there is no reason to be walking around with a mask. When you’re in the middle of an outbreak wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better and it might even block a droplet but it’s not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is. And often there are unintended consequences. People keep fiddling with the mask, and they keep touching their face. When you think ‘mask,’ you should think of health care providers needing them and people who are ill.” Today, Dr. Fauci wears a mask in public. “I want to protect myself and protect others, and also because I want to make it be a symbol for people to see that that’s the kind of thing you should be doing,” he told CNN last week. “When I walk around the street in the neighborhood I live in Washington, D.C., which still has a considerable number of infections, it’s very clear that many people are doing that.” U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams was also not a mask proponent in March. “It’s important to understand that we are looking at the data every single day and we make the best recommendations to the American people we can based on what we know,” Dr. Adams said. “What the World Health Organization and the CDC have reaffirmed in the last few days is that they do not recommend the general public wear masks.” “If you have a mask and it makes you feel better, then by all means wear it, but know that the more you touch your face the more you put yourself at risk and know that right now the data isn’t quite there to say that there is a net benefit to the individual of wearing a mask,” he said. Earlier on Twitter, he said: “They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus, but if healthcare providers can’t get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk!” A referee in this disagreement is The New England Journal of Medicine. An article in early April by five physicians cast masks as generally useless when worn outside. “We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection,” the article said. “Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes). The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal. In many cases, the desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic.” The CDC and WHO also seem apart on quarantines and isolation. In late March, Dr. Ryan backed the idea of removing family members from their homes if they test positive. South Korea, for example, imposed this protocol. “What we have seen from a number of countries now is that this virus can be controlled,” Dr. Ryan said. “What we have seen is that through the aggressive measures of case finding, testing those cases, isolating those cases, caring for them depending on the severity they have, making sure they have adequate care, they don’t progress to severe disease if that’s possible, to find all of their contacts, to follow them for 14 days. If you quarantine your contacts, so remove them from the family home or remove them from the community so that they don’t have the possibility to transmit to other people.” The U.S. does not impose family separations. The CDC recommends: “In the home, anyone sick or infected should separate themselves from others by staying in a specific ‘sick room’ or area and using a separate bathroom (if available).” On lock-downs, Dr. Fauci endorsed a one-size-fits-all for the entire country. Asked on CNN in April if America needs a national lock-down, Dr. Fauci said, “I think so. I don’t understand why that’s not happening.” “The tension between ‘federal mandated’ versus ‘states’ rights’ to do what they want is something that I don’t want to get into,” Dr. Fauci said. “But if you look at what’s going on in this country, I just don’t understand why we’re not doing that. We really should be.” Dr. Ryan expresses opposition. “We have to find a balanced strategy that manages the risks of the disease against the risks to life and livelihood and that’s something we’ve said since the beginning,” he said. “We’ve been very, very clear. A comprehensive strategy is not a comprehensive lock-down. A comprehensive strategy is a strategy of surveillance, finding cases, testing, isolating, using quarantine.”

WASHINGTON — The U.S. has sent to Brazil more than 2 million doses of a malaria drug touted by President Donald Trump as potentially protecting against and treating the coronavirus, even though scientific evidence has not backed up those uses. No large, rigorous scientific studies have found the drug, hydroxychloroquine, safe or effective for preventing or treating COVID-19, and some smaller studies have indicated worse outcomes from those taking the drug. Brazil, now Latin America’s hardest-hit country, continues to see a surge in virus cases, and last week Trump announced that the U.S. was restricting travel from the country to prevent travelers from spreading the virus in the U.S. TOP STORIES

                               In a joint statement with the Brazilian government on Sunday, the White House said the doses of hydroxychloroquine had been sent to Brazil as a prophylactic for front-line health workers and as a therapeutic for those who may come down with the virus. The White House said it was also delivering 1,000 ventilators to Brazil. Trump revealed in May that he took a two-week course of the drug to protect against the coronavirus, despite warnings from his own government that it should only be administered for COVID-19 in a hospital or research setting due to potentially fatal side effects. Trump’s announcement that he was taking the drug was criticized by medical experts who warned that his actions could encourage others to take the drug outside of a medical setting. Trump said he decided to take hydroxychloroquine after two White House staffers tested positive for the disease.

Bucharest is more than 5,500 miles from Tuscaloosa, Alabama, but even in a locked-down world a team of Romanian medical specialists was able to make an unlikely journey to lend a hand in the battle against COVID-19. The State Partnership Program, run by the Department of Defense and several states, was designed to help former communist countries such as Romania build stable and democratic militaries when it began more than 30 years ago. Now Romania and other Eastern European countries once under the thumb of the Soviet Union are returning the favor. TOP STORIES

                               “The bond between my home nation of Romania and the U.S. state of Alabama has grown into one of enduring strength and readiness,” said Romanian Army Col. Jan-Florin Ganea. The Romanian military has been partnering with the Alabama National Guard since 1993. They have trained together in the U.S. and in Europe over the years. The Alabama Guard and Romanian military units have both served in Iraq. Today, more than a dozen Romanian army physicians, nurses and nuclear-biological-chemical specialists are crisscrossing the state from Huntsville to Birmingham to provide much-needed medical reinforcements for hospitals, nursing homes and long-term care facilities. Working alongside local medical counterparts, the Romanians are sharing what they have learned battling COVID-19 in other countries in Europe. They expect to be working in Alabama until mid-June. Army Maj. Gen. Sheryl E. Gordon, commander of the Alabama National Guard, said she is always happy when Romanian partners come to the state. But this visit is even more special because of the help they can offer in a time of stress. “We oftentimes focus on the military aspect of our partnership,” Gen. Gordon said. “This visit gives us an opportunity to focus on the many other benefits of our vital partnership with Romania.” It’s important for family, friends and allies to join together to fight a common enemy like the coronavirus, Col. Ganea said, “and that’s exactly what this mission represents.” Air Force Brig. Gen. Jessica Meyeraan, deputy director of security cooperation at U.S. European Command headquarters, said other nations also have stepped up to provide a hand to the U.S. in this “unprecedented moment in history.” The U.S. has the world’s largest reported caseload of COVID-19. Lessons learned Alabama officials over the weekend reported that the state had recorded more than 17,000 COVID-19 cases and more than 600 deaths. Infection numbers are still rising in major population centers such as Birmingham, Mobile and Tuscaloosa. Despite early fears by global health experts, many of the nations of Eastern Europe have reported low infection rates compared with other regions. “Romania’s desire to connect with Alabama and share critical insights gained during their own COVID-19 experiences exemplifies the underpinning mentality of the partnership program. We are stronger together, and together we can beat COVID-19,” said Gen. Meyeraan. The same partnership that brought the Romanian medical team to Alabama sent a group of Polish army doctors, nurses and health care professionals to Illinois on a COVID-19 relief mission last month. Air Force Brig. Gen. Richard Neely, the adjutant general of the Illinois National Guard, said he was deeply moved by the Polish military medics who shared their hard-won knowledge of tactics against COVID-19. Illinois National Guard soldiers and army troops from Poland have fought together in Afghanistan and Iraq under the partnership, Gen. Neely noted. “We have fought side by side for many years, and now we fight this pandemic together,” he said. The Polish doctors and other medical specialists were from the Military Institute of Medicine in Warsaw. Before the Chicago mission, they provided medical help to the Lombardy region in Italy, which had one of the deadliest outbreaks of COVID-19 anywhere in the world. The head of the Polish military medical staff said the situation in Chicago has turned out better than in Italy, where health care workers were overwhelmed. “Here we didn’t have a collapse of the administration of the medical services,” Dr. Jacek Siewiera said. The Polish contingent worked at several clinics in Chicago, including the Army Corps of Engineers-built field hospital at the McCormick Place Convention Center. The Polish medical staff also took part in web-based conferences with health care workers in other parts of Illinois. “We are amazed at how it was done by the National Guard [in the McCormick Center] and how it was done at Cook County emergency medical center,” Dr. Siewiera said. “We are amazed how they are using data to support the decision-making process. It should look like this all the time.”

White House National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien defended President Trump’s decision to pull some $450 million of U.S. annual funding from the World Health Organization, but also vowed the “same amount of money” will instead be channeled to other health-based humanitarian operations around the world. In an interview on CNN, Mr. O’Brien said the decision to reroute the money is warranted because the WHO has badly fumbled in the COVID-19 era by willingly helping China cover up responsibility for the global pandemic. “We’re going to take that same money and make sure it gets to the Doctors Without Borders and the Red Cross and the hospitals all over the world that need it, and doesn’t go through a corrupt international organization that’s controlled by the Chinese Communist Party,” the national security advisor said. “That’s for sure.” TOP STORIES

                               It was not immediately clear whether Mr. O’Brien was referring to a specific administration plan for rerouting the funding or speaking only in broad terms. By mentioning the Red Cross, he may have been referring to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), although the administration has so far not said whether it will increase the roughly $400 million in annual funding the United States government presently gives the organization — the leading international outfit for humanitarian assistance for people in nearly every one of the world’s various conflict zone. A bigger question surrounds Mr. O’Brien’s mention of Doctors Without Borders, also known by its name in French, Médecins sans Frontières (MSF). While U.S. corporations and private individuals are known to donate to Doctors Without Borders, the entity operates as a nonprofit organization and is notorious for refusing money from governments — including the U.S. government — in order to avoid even the appearance of political conflicts. After Mr. O’Brien made similar comments earlier in May, Doctors Without Borders sought to clarify that it would not be a good target for any rerouted U.S. government funds. “More than 90 percent of our funding comes from private donors. Our operations are carried out based solely on medical need and are devoid of any political, military or other agenda,” it said in a statement, according to Roll Call. “The World Health Organization serves a unique role through its mandate to act as a coordinating authority for global health issues. No other entity, including MSF, is mandated to serve this purpose.” CNN did not ask Mr. O’Brien about the issue in Sunday’s interview, during which the national security advisor also said the Trump administration intends to take the nearly $450 million that the U.S. would have given to the WHO — a figure he stressed is far greater than the some $40 million China gives the WHO annually — and instead “make sure it gets to front-line health care workers, just like we’re doing with PEPFAR in Africa.” He was referring to the President’s Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief, an organization that was created by the George W. Bush administration in 2003 to battle AIDS and HIV in Africa, and that the U.S. government has already channeled nearly $100 billion toward over the past 17 years. “We’re not doing it through the WHO,” Mr. O’Brien said. “We’re doing it as the United States of America.” He suggest the very creation of PEPFAR by the Bush administration was driven at least in part by past WHO failures to respond to the AIDS crisis. “They have bungled things going all the way back to AIDS/HIV in Africa,” Mr. O’Brien said. “That’s why the United States has spent over the past 20 years $142 billion on public health, especially the PEPFAR program that’s literally saving the lives, with antiretroviral drugs, of millions of people in Africa.” “The WHO isn’t saving lives for — for AIDS and HIV victims in Africa,” he added. “It’s the United States and our generous taxpayers who are saving those lives in Africa.”

The D.C. Department of Health paused the District’s count of decreased days of community spread to review a potential new peak in cases. “The District’s count in days of community spread decline has paused at 17 days while the data is under review to determine if a new peak in cases has occurred,” said a statement from the health department in a press release on Sunday. Health officials are measuring community transmission by looking at the date of symptom onset instead of the number of new cases that are confirmed daily.

                               There were just under 100 cases of community transmission reported on what would have been the District’s 17th day of decrease in community transmission. Since the 14th day of decrease in community transmission, which was required for the District to enter phase one, the number of cases via community transmission were between 40 and 60 new cases, according to a graph released by DOH.

Russia has extended the residence permit of former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden due to the ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic, state media reported Saturday. TASS, a news agency owned by the Russian government, reported that Mr. Snowden’s residence permit was automatically extended until June 15 because of “anti-coronavirus measures.” Mr. Snowden, 36, has lived in Russia since June 2013 while on the lam from authorities in the U.S., where he remains wanted on criminal charges stemming from his admitted role in leaking material to the media about the government’s domestic and foreign surveillance operations.

                               He had been living in Russia under a residence permit that was set to expire on April 30 but continues to remain valid as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, TASS reported. “Later, a decision will be made about whether it should be extended by three more years upon Snowden’s request and in line with the current legislation,” TASS cited an unnamed law enforcement source as saying. Mr. Snowden faces up to 30 years in prison if put on trial in the U.S. and convicted on all three criminal counts he currently faces, including violations of the Espionage Act and theft of government property. President Trump, on his part, previously called Mr. Snowden a “traitor” and has suggested he be executed. Millions of cases of COVID-19, the potentially deadly disease caused by the coronavirus, has been documented worldwide since it was discovered late last year in Wuhan, China. More than 396,000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in Russia, according to Johns Hopkins University, putting it behind only the U.S. and Brazil in terms of the countries with the most known coronavirus cases.

Monkeys stole blood samples from a laboratory in India that had been taken from people undergoing treatment for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, international media reported Friday. The incident happened earlier this week on the campus of the state-run medical college in Meerut, near Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh state, Reuters reported. A troop of monkeys attacked a lab technician, stole the samples and fled , Reuters reported, citing Dr. S. K. Garg, a top official at the college.

                               “Monkeys grabbed and fled with the blood samples of four COVID-19 patients who are undergoing treatment … we had to take their blood samples again,”  he said, Reuters reported. “These were not COVID test samples, but blood samples from COVID patients meant for routine tests,” the doctor specified, according to India’s NDTV. More than 173,000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in India, one of the world’s most populous country, since health officials first learned of the disease late last year. The World Health Organization has previously said that COVID-19 likely circulated among bats prior to spreading to an intermediary host animal and then humans. Dr. Garg noted that it is not clear yet of monkeys can become infected with COVID-19, however, Reuters noted. “No evidence has been found that monkeys can contract the infection,” he said, according to the news agency.

A group of thirty countries from around the world kicked off a joint initiative Friday aimed at sharing medicines, vaccines, and data to help combat the coronavirus pandemic. Led by Costa Rica, the group’s goal is to provide a “one-stop-shop” for the developing nations to access scientific information and intellectual property related to COVID-19, Reuters reported. “Vaccines, tests, diagnostics, treatments and other key tools in the coronavirus response must be made universally available as global public goods,” said Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado.

                               The World Health Organization praised the group’s establishment, and called on the international community to voluntarily pool knowledge related to COVID-19. “Shared knowledge, intellectual property and data will leverage our collective efforts to advance scientific discovery, technology development and broad sharing of the benefits of scientific advancement and its applications based on the right to health,” the WHO said. Since the beginning of the outbreak, countries around the world have called for a joint response and information sharing as nations have struggled to combat the spread of the virus, but many western nations have remained independent in the race to develop a widely accessible vaccine. The group, dubbed the “COVID-19 Technology Access Pool,” has received praise from organizations including Doctors Without Borders, it has been questioned by the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations, which claims the premise of the group could compromise intellectual property protections. “By urging licenses or non-enforcement declarations for COVID-19 treatments and vaccines to be granted on a non-exclusive global basis, the Solidarity Call to Action promotes a one-size-fits-all model that disregards the specific circumstances of each situation, each product and each country,” the IFPMA said in a statement Friday. “Different regions and countries will face different challenges regarding the manufacture and distribution of COVID-19 treatments and vaccines. Any access tools, including patent licensing mechanisms, should therefore allow for customized solutions to real-world problems that may arise,” they continued. The countries involved in the pact include Argentina, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belgium, Belize, Bhutan, Brazil, Chile, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Honduras, Indonesia, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Maldives, Mexico, Mongolia, Mozambique, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Palau, Panama, Peru, Portugal, Saint Vincent and Grenadines, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Sudan, The Netherlands, Timor-Leste, Uruguay, Zimbabwe.

Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania said Friday he tested positive for antibodies to the coronavirus and will donate his blood plasma in a bid to help those who develop a severe case. Mr. Casey, a Democrat, said he decided to get tested for antibodies after consulting with the Capitol’s attending physician, Brian Monahan. “The results of this test revealed substantial levels of COVID-19 antibody in my blood, significantly more than the amount required to qualify me as a plasma donor,” he said.

                               Mr. Casey said he will make his first donation Friday in Taylor, Pennsylvania.The senator said he can point to when he might have had the virus. He experienced a low-grade fever and mild flu-like symptoms earlier this spring and quarantined for two weeks at home in Scranton. His wife wasn’t home during his quarantine, he said, because she was with their eldest daughter and son-in-law, who were expecting their first child. “In consultation with my doctor, I chose not to seek medical care because my symptoms were relatively mild and manageable,” Mr. Casey said. “My fever went away on its own by mid-April, and it was never recommended that I be tested for the virus. I was able to work during my illness, remotely engaging with constituents and staff and keeping a full schedule.” Mr. Casey is the second U.S. senator to report antibodies to the virus. Sen. Tim Kaine, Virginia Democrat, on Thursday said he and his wife tested positive for them after experiencing symptoms in March. Both senators took what’s often known as a “serological” test, which checks for evidence of an immune response after a previous infection. The antibodies should provide some protection against future infection, though the coronavirus is newly discovered in humans and experts are still studying the issue. President Trump frequently lauds the number of COVID-19 survivors who’ve opted to donate their plasma to help others, saying it’s often the first thing they bring up after recovering.

PARIS (AP) — Europe’s extensive social welfare net is showing signs  of fraying under economic strain from the coronavirus, as protests  erupted for a second day in Spain Friday against layoffs by French  carmaker Renault, while Italy’s chief central banker warned that  “uncertainty is rife.” Further afield, while New Zealand had all but eradicated the  coronavirus with just one person in the nation of 5 million known to be  still infected, developments elsewhere were generally grim. India  reported another record increase in cases and Pakistan a record number  of deaths. As cases steadily rise across Africa, too, officials who are losing  the global race for equipment and drugs are scrambling for homegrown  solutions.

                               In the first major increase since it started gradually reopening May  11, France reported more than 3,000 new daily virus infections. It was  not immediately clear if the spike was due to a greater availability of  testing. In the U.S., the virus threw more than 2 million people out of work  last week despite the gradual reopening of businesses, stoking fears it  is doing deep and potentially long-lasting damage to the world’s largest  economy. The latest job-loss figures from the U.S. Labor Department bring to  41 million the running total of Americans who have filed for  unemployment benefits since the coronavirus shutdowns took hold in  mid-March. Strong safety-net programs in many European countries are  underwriting the wages of millions of workers and keeping them on the  payroll instead of adding them to the ranks of the unemployed. But the  limits are starting to show. In Britain, Treasury chief Rishi Sunak is expected to tell employers  that starting in August, they’ll have to share the costs of a program  that has effectively placed furloughed workers on the government  payroll. Sunak says the government can’t pay indefinitely for a program that  has cost 15 billion pounds ($18.4 billion) to cover 80% of wages of some  8.5 million people. It is in place until October, although the final  months will require employer input. Even as it seeks a government loan from France, struggling carmaker  Renault announced 15,000 job cuts worldwide as part of a 2 billion-euro  cost-cutting plan over three years, as demand for cars has plunged  around the globe. Renault said nearly 4,600 jobs will be cut in France and more than 10,000 in the rest of the world. That had a knock-on effect in Spain, where Nissan is rolling back  production in a move Madrid said would mean 3,000 direct job cuts and  risks as many as 20,000 additional jobs in the supply chain. Spanish workers took to the streets for a second day to protest the  closure of three Barcelona plants. Hundreds of workers have surrounded  at least four of Nissan’s car dealerships in or around the northeastern  city, covering their windows with leaflets reading “Nissan betrays  25,000 families” and “We will keep fighting” among others. The governor of the Bank of Italy, Ignazio Visco, in his annual  address, said Europe’s fourth-largest economy could contract by as much  as 13% this year under a pessimistic scenario that foresees a  “magnitude” drop in world trade and an intense deterioration of  financial conditions. “Today uncertainty is rife, not only about the course of the pandemic  but also about the repercussions on behavioural patterns, on  consumption and on investment decisions,” Visco said, adding that “after  the pandemic wanes, the world will be a different place.” How different will depend on how leaders manage falling employment,  lower consumption and the prospect of social unrest, he said. In New Zealand, health authorities have not found any new virus cases  for a week. Of the 1,504 people who were infected, 22 have died but all  but one of the rest have now recovered. The nation’s borders remain  closed, and staying virus-free when they eventually reopen poses a big  challenge. India registered another record daily increase of 7,466 cases just  before its two-month lockdown ends Sunday. The government’s new  guidelines expected this weekend may extend the lockdown in the  worst-hit areas while easing the rules to promote economic activity  elsewhere. Most cases in India are concentrated around its largest cities,  including Mumbai and New Delhi, but cases have been increasing in some  of the poorest eastern states as migrant workers who lost jobs in the  cities return to their native villages. Pakistan on Friday reported 57 deaths, its highest single-day  increase since the outbreak began. That increased the overall death toll  to more than 1,300 while the number of confirmed cases rose to over  64,000. In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte decided to ease a  lockdown in the capital to a more relaxed quarantine on Monday after  more than two months of strictures enforced by the police and military.  Infections spiked in Manila recently, and Duterte warned that the  pandemic is not over. South Africa says it has a backlog of nearly 100,000 unprocessed  tests for the coronavirus, a striking example of the painful shortage of  testing kits and reagents across Africa as cases steadily rise. The widespread shortages, especially in testing materials, have  jolted African authorities into facing uncomfortable truths: Richer  countries are elbowing them out and they need homegrown solutions to the  shortages. “We have to have Made in Africa products,” the director of the Africa  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, John Nkengasong, told  reporters Thursday. “We cannot keep importing basic things.” In the U.S., where the death toll is the highest in the world and has  surpassed 101,000, there were some encouraging signs in the economic  data. The overall number of Americans currently drawing jobless benefits  dropped for the first time since the crisis began, from 25 million to 21  million. And first-time applications for unemployment benefits have  fallen for eight straight weeks as states gradually let stores,  restaurants and other businesses reopen and the auto industry starts up  factories again. But the number of U.S. workers filing for unemployment benefits is  still extraordinarily high by historical standards, and that suggests  businesses are failing or permanently downsizing, not just laying off  people until the crisis can pass, economists warn. “That is the kind of economic destruction you cannot quickly put back  in the bottle,” said Adam Ozimek, chief economist at Upwork. The U.S. unemployment rate was 14.7% in April, a level not seen since  the Depression, and many economists expect it will be near 20% in May. Worldwide, the virus has infected more than 5.8 million people and  killed about 360,000, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.  The true dimensions of the disaster are widely believed to be  significantly greater, with experts saying many victims died without  ever being tested. ___ Barry contributed from Soave, Italy, and Perry from Wellington, New  Zealand.

PARRIS ISLAND, S.C. (AP) — The booming shouts of the rain-soaked  Marine recruits echo across Leatherneck Square training field, barely  muffled by their masks. And as they jog by, belting out responses to  drill instructors in a rhythmic cadence, the white fabric across their  faces is the only telltale sign of the coronavirus’ effects on their  quest to become Marines. But in ways big and small, the virus is impacting training at the  Marine Corps‘ Parris Island Recruit Depot and across the military. And  defense leaders say some of the adjustments are proving beneficial and  could become permanent. Maj. Gen. James Glynn, commander of Parris Island, said requiring  recruits to spend two weeks in quarantine before their training has had  unexpected benefits.

                               “They are singularly focused on two weeks of mental and emotional  prep for what you guys are seeing today,” he said during a visit  Wednesday by Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper. “I think it’s pretty evident  it’s making a difference. They’re mentally focused and have reconciled  why they’re here.” Until this week, recruits spent the two-week quarantine in a complex  of large white tents and bathroom and shower trailers that was quickly  built on the base to allow health monitoring and keep them isolated. But  now recruits are spending the two weeks in dorms at the Citadel, the  Marine college in Charleston, about a two-hour drive north. Esper, who toured the tent area with Glynn, said the new precautions —  including masks, social distancing and the quarantine — have greatly  lowered the amount of other respiratory illnesses recruits traditionally  get. “They’ve seen a much lower sick call right across the board when it  comes to infection, so they’re going to keep that. And we’re going to  keep some other practices,” said Esper, adding that by breaking the  recruits into smaller groups, “they’ve seen a higher level of unity and  esprit. And they bonded much more quickly.” As Esper walked around the soggy field, recruits were going through  what Marines call the “confidence course.” They were clambering over  large log obstacles, climbing towers, shimmying across rope lines strung  over a net, and swinging over streams of water. In other sections,  recruits were paired off to battle with pugil sticks, which replicates  rifle and bayonet combat. Staff Sgt. Katheryn Hunter, a drill instructor for three years at  Parris Island, said the main difference she sees due to the virus is  that the number of female recruits she has in 4th Battalion, Oscar  Company, has dropped to 70. And she has 35 recruits in squad bays that  usually hold up to 64. During the initial portion of training, women, who have their own  battalion, are largely separated from men. Marine Corps leaders  staunchly defend the segregation, saying it helps build confidence, but  some members of Congress have demanded change. On the confidence course, female recruits were together on the  various obstacles, while the male recruits were doing other tests. The course, Hunter said, is critical. “We have a lot of recruits that are scared of heights, recruits that  are scared of water or are scared of different obstacles,” she said,  adding that the course “actually tests recruits’ fears, also builds  their confidence that they can accomplish stuff as long as they set  their minds to it.” In the larger formations, the recruits wore masks, but during some  physical tests - even those where teamwork was required and social  distancing impossible - the masks came off. Most of the drill  instructors wore theirs at all times, as did Esper and his entourage. Commanders noted that the recruits had finished their two-week  quarantine and were on day 14 of their actual training - so they had  been largely isolated for about a month. Marine recruits go to either  Parris Island or to Camp Pendleton in southern California, for 13 weeks  of training. Another change, Esper said, is that military recruits often get to go  home for two weeks after graduation. That leave has been suspended  because of the virus. Instead, the Marines are getting three or four  days of little or no duty before reporting to their next schooling or  station. “They’re showing up at the next phase of training in much better  shape,” said Esper, noting that they haven’t been able to go out  drinking and partying. He said Marine leaders are “seeing a better  product entering the next phase of training, so they’re starting to  think maybe we won’t go back to the 10 days off.” Glynn said the plan to use the Citadel for quarantine was inspired by  his mother-in-law, who sent him an article about how colleges and the  military worked together during the Spanish flu pandemic. But while the  college, with its two-person rooms, is working out well, Glynn said  he’ll need another solution when classes resume. He said they are  reviewing several options, including some nearer Parris Island, but have  not made a decision. The Army has made similar changes in its recruit training, which is a  longer, 22-week course for infantry and armor soldiers. But instead of  separating the incoming recruits at a distant location for the two-week  quarantine, Army leaders changed the course schedule. The new plan shifted classroom learning to the first two weeks, with  many classes done virtually or outside, with little physical  interaction, spaced chairs and social distancing. The recruits then move  into what Army officials described as a training bubble, where they  begin their more traditional physical and combat instruction. Both the Marine Corps and the Army screen recruits for the virus when  they arrive at processing stations, and again when they get to the  training base. Army recruits go to one of the four training centers at  Fort Benning, Georgia; Fort Jackson, South Carolina; Fort Leonard Wood,  Missouri; and Fort Sill, Oklahoma. Defense leaders said they have been intrigued to see some good come from the virus precautions. “I mean, it’s funny,” said Esper, as he flew home from Parris Island,  “Even once coronavirus fades or we have a vaccine, you may come out  with a boot camp that produces a better product because of things  learned.”

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration may soon expel thousands of Chinese graduate students enrolled at U.S. universities and impose other sanctions against Chinese officials in the latest signs of tensions between Washington and Beijing that are raging over trade, the coronavirus pandemic, human rights and the status of Hong Kong. President Donald Trump said he would make an announcement about China on Friday, and administration officials said he is considering a months-old proposal to revoke the visas of students affiliated with educational institutions in China linked to the People’s Liberation Army or Chinese intelligence. Trump is also weighing targeted travel and financial sanctions against Chinese officials for actions in Hong Kong, according to the officials, who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

                               “We’ll be announcing what we’re doing tomorrow with respect to China and we are not happy with China,” Trump told reporters at an unrelated event Thursday, referring mainly to COVID-19. “We are not happy with what’s happened. All over the world people are suffering, 186 countries. All over the world they’re suffering. We’re not happy.” Although the student expulsions aren’t directly related to Hong Kong and China’s move to assert full control over the former British territory, potential sanctions against officials involved in that effort would be a result of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s determination that Hong Kong can no longer be considered autonomous from mainland China. Pompeo notified Congress on Wednesday that Hong Kong is no longer deserving of the preferential trade and commercial status it has enjoyed from the U.S. since it reverted to Chinese rule in 1997. Under a joint Sino-British agreement on the handover, Hong Kong was to be governed differently than the mainland for 50 years under a “one country, two systems” policy. Pompeo’s determination opened the door to possible sanctions and the loss of special perks Hong Kong has received from the United States. But neither Pompeo nor other officials were able Wednesday to describe what action the administration might take, an uncertainty related to the impact that such sanctions would have on U.S. companies that operate in Hong Kong and the city’s position as Asia’s major financial hub. Trump’s comments sparked a drop in U.S. financial markets. Serious consideration of the visa revocation proposal, first reported by The New York Times, has faced opposition from U.S. universities and scientific organizations who depend on tuition fees paid by Chinese students to offset other costs. In addition, those institutions fear possible reciprocal action from Beijing that could limit their students’ and educators’ access to China. In a nod to those concerns, the officials said any restrictions would be narrowly tailored to affect only students who present a significant risk of engaging in espionage or intellectual property theft. The officials could not say how many people could ultimately be expelled, although they said it would be only a fraction of the Chinese students in the country. Still, the possibility that the proposal may be implemented has drawn concerns from educators. “We’re very worried about how broadly this will be applied, and we’re concerned it could send a message that we no longer welcome talented students and scholars from around the globe,” said Sarah Spreitzer, director of government relations at the American Council on Education. “We don’t have a lot of details about how they are going to define ties to Chinese universities, what type of universities are they going to target, what would constitute a university having ties to the Chinese military,” she said. If the situation were reversed and another nation imposed limits on students from U.S. universities that receive Defense Department funding, she noted it would affect a wide range of schools. The U.S. hosted 133,396 graduate students from China in the 2018-19 academic year, and they made up 36.1% of all international graduate students, according to the Institute of International Education. Overall, there were 369,548 students from China, accounting for 33.7% of international students who contributed nearly $15 billion to the U.S. economy in 2018. The proposal to revoke the visas is not directly related to the dispute over Hong Kong, nor is it tied to U.S. criticism of China for its handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Rather, it is connected to various elements of trade and human rights issues that have seen U.S. officials complain about Chinese industrial espionage and spying and harassment of dissidents and religious and ethnic minorities. But the timing of a potential announcement could come at a time of increasingly heated rhetoric about the imposition of national security laws on Hong Hong in violation of the Sino-British accord. The proposal first began to be discussed last year when the administration moved to require Chinese diplomats based in the United States to report their domestic U.S. travel and meetings with American scientists and academics. At the time, U.S. officials said it was a reciprocal measure to match restrictions that American diplomats face in China. Those limits were followed by a requirement that Chinese state-run media in the U.S. register as “foreign diplomatic missions” and report their property holdings and employee rosters to the government. That was, in turn, followed by the limiting of the number of visas for Chinese journalists allowed to work in the United States. China retaliated for the visa limitations by expelling several reporters from U.S. media outlets, including The Washington Post and The New York Times.

Coronavirus closures of barbershops and hair salons have inspired some residents to test their tonsorial skills — a test Evan Winston failed in April with electric clippers, as evidenced by his 12-year-old son’s “haircut.” “I goofed and didn’t have the guard on right,” said Mr. Winston, president of Hercules Fence. “He had this ridiculous skinhead haircut. My wife was so mad at me.” As payback, he allowed his son, Tyler, to shave his head. Just before the boy started trimming, Mr. Winston realized that many other families must be having hair problems similar to his own. And in that light-bulb moment, the Hercules COVID-19 Charity Haircut Challenge was born. TOP STORIES

                               Mr. Winston committed his regional fencing company to donating $100 to a local food bank for every Hercules employee who cut their hair at home. For every friend or family member who chopped off some hair, he would donate $50. In just over a month, more than $13,000 has been raised, and the goal is to raise a total of $25,000. The proceeds will be divided among the Capital Area Food Bank, Feed More, the Maryland Food Bank and a food bank at Virginia Beach. “Regardless of exactly how many participants we get, we are going to give [at least $18,000] because it’s important to us,” Mr. Winston said. Mr. Winston said the challenge has boosted morale among staffers, given their families something to do together and raised awareness about hunger in the region. He chose this cause because he had received emails from the local school district about how it was delivering meals to families and had seen news reports about the work food banks were doing to support their communities, as many have been laid off during the pandemic. “It was a heightened sense of awareness about people living paycheck to paycheck,” Mr. Winston said, adding that he also wanted to provide a role model for his three kids on the importance of being charitable. Kris Antonis, a facility security officer with Hercules Fence, said that although her 9-year-old daughter needed an extra incentive to cut her hair for the challenge, the cause was meaningful. Ms. Antonis said she used to help deliver food with her grandmother to people experiencing homelessness, so when her daughter Presley found out the proceeds were going to food banks, she was extra excited to participate. Also her mom said she could dye her hair purple if she did it. “She’s ready to do it again if it means we can do a different color,” Ms. Antonis said. Adam McFadden, a production manager at Hercules Custom Iron in Walkersville, Maryland, said there were a couple of people in his office who “claimed they knew how to cut hair” so they set up a “pseudo-barbershop” and cut the hair of about 20 employees. “From my standpoint, you see people go hungry every day,” Mr. McFadden said. “We were fortunate enough to keep working through this pandemic.” Adam Isaacson, a friend of Mr. Winston‘s, said his dad had been growing out his beard since the stay-at-home order started and thought the Hercules challenge was a funny opportunity for his children to take a buzzer to it. Mr. Isaacson’s three kids and his sister’s two children “each took a turn with the beard trimmer and cut it off and made it look a little ridiculous,” he said. “They were hysterically laughing.” “This time when things are so messed up and everyone is looking to help,” Mr. Isaacson said. “All of my family was pretty excited to get involved.” Because the fencing business was deemed essential and his staff was able to keep working through the pandemic, Mr. Winston said he felt compelled to give now. However, as hair salons start to open up under phase one of reopening, Mr. Winston said they are giving it about one more week to meet their goal.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: Hmm. A peek at the “new normal.” Mickey Mouse has more clout than parents. Poor folks and the newly unemployed, who had been used to living high on the hog, now depend on Spam and baloney sandwiches to fill their tummies.

                               Professional sports leagues and gamblers prove they have tighter control of your personal savings than you do. Weak-kneed governors, mayors and Joe Biden, the man who wants to lead us to the promised land, says we “ain’t black.” You knew that was coming, right? You knew cliques of people have been saying since mid-winter that the “new normal” is coming. Are you ready? Are you, your family and your neighbors willing to pay higher taxes and fees for everything from gas and public transportation to park and recreational programs, from trash, garbage and recycling services to health care and landscaping licensing. The press for the “new normal” means local and state governments locked us down so they could lock up the keys pegged to fiscal responsibility. If you prefer another perspective, consider historian Victor Davis Hanson, whose column in Thursday’s online and print editions of The Washington Times, gives a clear picture: “The current U.S. budget deficit could soon exceed a record $4 trillion. The massive borrowing is being driven both by prior budget profligacy and a hurried effort by the Trump administration to pump liquidity into a quarantined America. “Americans may soon have to service a staggering national debt of about $30 trillion — nearly $100,000 of debt for every American,” Mr. Hanson wrote. This after witnessing an endless stream of videos and social media comments illustrating how governors, mayors and other elected officials shortchanged the Class of 2020 of proms, graduations and other salutatory events. And now that the Reopen America Movement is taking off and people want to know who’s the leader of the club, we learn it’s M-I-C-K-E-Y. Both Orlando’s Disney World and SeaWorld theme parks are slated to open soon, July 11 and June 10, respectively. How in the world can theme parks that shuttle millions of people on a daily basis manage to prepare for reopening during a pandemic when D.C. and other cities can’t even manage to reopen small ballparks, recreation centers and swimming pools? Major sports leagues are planning their reopenings, too. The Boys of Summer are going to play. The NBA weighed the idea of games without fans, which would be like Vegas without gamblers — it doesn’t work. And if you’re African-American, be on the lookout. This election season, Joe Biden has declared himself the new normal’s expert on who is and ain’t black. So, if you’re ready for the new normal, raise your hand — but not too high. Mr. Biden and his clique will be coming for your money. • Deborah Simmons can be contacted at [email protected] Manage Newsletters Copyright © 2020 The Washington Times, LLC.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: Amid all the protests-slash-thuggery in the streets of recent days over the police killing of a black man, George Floyd, came this 5-4 determination from the U.S. Supreme Court: California’s far-left governor, Gavin Newsom, was quite right in limiting the number of people who could attend church based on concerns over the coronavirus. Thanks be the liberals on the court for that egregious ruling. Thanks be the liberals and the mental gymnastics of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. who conveniently forgot churches aren’t just another Walmart. Churches are protected by the First Amendment. TOP STORIES

                               Religious freedom, not retail freedom, was the core reason for the founding of this nation. Regardless, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, joined by Roberts, said that Newsom’s executive order limiting a San Diego-area Pentecostal church’s planned Pentecost services for 100 people or 25% of occupancy was fine and dandy, along the lines of what the government ordered for other businesses and places of gathering. That’s to be expected from the leftists on the court. But Roberts had a chance to make a stand for America’s founding, for America’s notions of limited government, for the concept of rights in this country coming from God, not government — and he blew it. Big time. “Although California’s guidelines place restrictions on places of worship, those restrictions appear consistent with the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment,” Roberts wrote. “Similar or more severe restrictions apply to comparable secular gatherings, including lectures, concerts, movie showings, spectator sports and theatrical performances where large groups of people gather in close proximity for extended periods of time.” That’s nice. But to make that statement means to believe that concerts, movie theaters, lectures are one and the same as churches and places of religious worship. And they’re not. In America, saying so is tantamount to tortured logic. History makes clear this country came first and foremost as a result of godly men and women seeking a permanent solution to religious persecution — to religious persecution from the hands of government. That means the order of priorities is church first; government second. Or, put another way: God first — God-given rights to individuals, first; government-granted, second. If at all. One need only look to the First Amendment and the Ninth Amendment to underscore. Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh in his dissent argued plainly that the COVID-19 restrictions on the church were clear violations of the Constitution. “In his view,” SCOTUSblog.com wrote, “the businesses that are not subject to the restrictions — which, he noted, include malls, pet groomers, hair salons and marijuana dispensaries — are comparable to gatherings at houses of worship, and California [did not] show a good reason for treating houses of worship differently.” Good points, all. Good points that blow holes in the Roberts‘ line of reasoning of churches being allowed the same-same as other same-same businesses. Kavanaugh also noted the church “would suffer irreparable harm from not being able to hold services on Pentecost Sunday in a way that comparable secular businesses and persons can conduct their activities.” He was joined in the dissent by Justice Neil M. Gorsuch and Justice Clarence Thomas. Justice Samuel Alito voted to dissent, but did not join Kavanaugh’s opinion. Roberts, post-opinion, was credited by many in the media for issuing what was billed as a common-sense ruling that took into consideration the government’s job to protect citizens; the unknown nature of the coronavirus and the full extent of its dangers; and the belief that Newsom put a great deal of thought into his executive order, going above and beyond to treat churches in a way that was fair — that was like the treatment given all the other businesses in the state. Kavanaugh was accused of judicial activism. But how can it be judicial activism to uphold the very tenet of America’s founding and of the driving force behind America’s very system of governance? Roberts was wrong; Kavanaugh was right. We’re either a nation where religious freedom rules — or a nation where government rules. Roberts, with his bizarre, twisted jumps over historical truths and acrobatic hops over the Constitution, specifically the First and Ninth amendments, made clear: In his America, government rules. And this is all the more reason to keep Democrats far away from the White House and Senate. The next Supreme Court seat must be filled with another Kavanaugh, not a Roberts. • Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: Social protests on behalf of George Floyd have escalated way past the point of peaceful, and now, instead of solemn reflection on the need to weed out policemen-gone-rogue and hold them accountable — quickly — we have mask-wearing thugs with bricks taking to the streets, setting fires and smashing storefront windows, looting luxury goods and flouting the law. This is what happens when an 8-minute video surfaces showing cavalier police with hands in pockets choking out the life of a pleading suspect whose head is trapped between an officer’s knee and pavement. But this is also what happens when you shut down schools, shut down sports, shut down restaurants, shut down malls and stores and places of entertainment and gathering, and lock an entire nation of youth in their homes for weeks and months on end. Video games only entertain for so long. TOP STORIES

                               Floyd is proving a powder keg for COVID-19 angst. If Democrats drunk with executive power hadn’t gone so far over the top with their lockdown, stay-at-home, stay-off-the-streets COVID-19 securing of neighborhoods — handing out fines for church-goers, sending police to chase runners at the beach, standing by as officers dragged away subway riders who didn’t wear their face masks and more — well then, maybe some of the thuggery of recent days wouldn’t have occurred. Maybe some of the thuggery could have been contained faster. Maybe some of the Floyd protesters-slash-rioters wouldn’t have used Floyd’s death as cause for protesting-slash-rioting. Maybe some of them would’ve been otherwise occupied — at a movie theater, perhaps, or a shopping mall. Or on a basketball court or baseball field. At the beach, even. Maybe some of them wouldn’t have been able to hide their identities behind the recommended-slash-mandated face masks — and so maybe wouldn’t have been so emboldened to even commit acts of violence in the first place. Yes? That’s not to downplay the horrific killing of Floyd and the worthiness of protesting, peaceably, on his behalf, in honor of his life, as a community stand against police brutality, in common recognition of the need to do a better law enforcement job. But it is to say: You can’t keep an entire nation shut down, inside, away from normal life and on edge, mindful of daily and ever-changing virus-related panicky news, and then expect behavior to be at its best. You can’t keep youthful angst caged and expect the release to be smooth and steady. And with Floyd, Antifa never had it so good. So many minutes of horrible police acts, caught on video for all to see; so many pent-up youth, bored and on edge from the coronavirus. It was easy pickings for the thug-life types. Still, there’s a tiny sliver of sunlight at the end of this dark tunnel. Democrats, seeing streets burn and Molotov cocktails fly, are learning — should be learning — an important COVID-19 lesson, and it’s one that goes like this: Citizens have a breaking point.  And FYI, powder kegs can come in many forms. • Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: In reaction to the 2008 recession, Congress and the Obama administration passed what was the largest stimulus package in U.S. history. But budgetary illiteracy has hit new levels. Expenditures intended to soften the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic has already tripled that record. We’re not in Kansas anymore.  Speaker Pelosi and her Democratic colleagues in the House now want to double down. In May, the House passed the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act, or HEROES Act—an 1,800-page, $3 trillion grab bag spending bill. The centerpiece of the bill is a $1 trillion bailout of local and state governments that have mismanaged taxpayer dollars for decades. Illinois is “Exhibit A.” At the close of fiscal year 2019, the state had $137 billion in unfunded pension liabilities — a $6 billion increase compared to the previous year despite record breaking contributions to the fund. More than one-quarter of the state budget is expected to be engulfed by pension costs in 2020. According to a recent analysis from the Illinois Policy Institute, depending on the job, between 43 percent and 94 percent of public employees will collect retirement payouts in excess of $1 million.  TOP STORIES

                               A federal bailout means taxpayers in more fiscally responsible states will be funding those pensions — costly benefits demanded by out-of-state unions who were paid off after helping elect Democrat politicians. If political operatives in the states that have mortgaged the future of their taxpayers can’t just “say no” to the unions, they shouldn’t expect a “yes” from the rest of America. Admittedly we are a family of states, but every family has a moment that calls for tough love.      The severity of the current health and economic crisis warrants some action from Congress. But the pandemic does not erase basic arithmetic. Government can only spend money it collects. The rest is borrowed.  At the close of 2019, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reported the federal debt to be $16.8 trillion. This level of out-of-control spending will have very real consequences.  We have to pay interest to those who loaned us the money (including China). Payments owed on the debt are squeezing the federal budget and other spending priorities like infrastructure repairs are crowded out.  Interest payments on the debt last year amounted to over $400 billion. Imagine what the shakedown will be once the additional $2.8 trillion (so far) in pandemic spending is tacked on.   Teaching people just how big a debt we have is the first step in getting the country’s fiscal house in order. “One trillion” is too big to comprehend and 16 of something you can’t grasp isn’t too threatening. Consider the concept of “time” to put it into perspective. One million seconds passes over 12 days. One trillion seconds elapses over more than 30,000 years. Think of that the next time you hear about another trillion-dollar spending bill.  The coronavirus pandemic has already taken more than 100,000 American lives and triggered an economic crisis unseen since the Great Depression. Some action is necessary, but Congress should be careful to balance the benefits of stimulus spending with the consequences of extreme run-away debt. We can’t afford the unintended side-effects of the cure to be worse than the disease. • Richard Berman is the president of Berman and Co., a public relations firm in Washington, D.C.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: This year’s observance of Memorial Day had a wider focus than usual. Along with honoring the sacrifices of those who gave their lives in service to the nation, it underscored questions about the liberty for which those sacrifices were made. Religious liberty, in particular, has become an issue, in light of the physical restrictions we’ve endured during the great COVID-19 lockdown. All these weeks we’ve been called upon to balance our freedom to worship with our responsibilities as members of society to reduce the risk of spreading disease. The understanding of how to strike that balance has required closing churches and other houses of worship. Believers have accepted this as a reasonable protection of the public health — at least they accepted it in the early days of the pandemic when little was known about the scope and virulence of this contagion.

                               With the passage of time and greater clarity about the numbers of actual COVID-19 infections, they’ve begun to resist the limitations imposed by states. Demands for restoration of public worship have grown, putting religious leaders in a tough spot. They want to give Caesar his due, even as parishioners are beating on the church doors. The conflict has had a positive aspect, however. It’s drawn attention to the real meaning of religious liberty, which of course, is one of the guarantees made by the First Amendment. In our highly secularized society, a lot of people assume that the U.S. Constitution protects religious liberty so that people are free to seek spiritual fulfillment in whatever way satisfies their consciences. This accords conveniently with the view of non-believers that they’re best fulfilled by not having anything to do with religion at all. But while spiritual fulfillment is important, the actual reason religion enjoys constitutional protection is because people of faith feel themselves under an obligation to worship God, and government must not impede their ability to do so. The right exists because of the commitment. Whatever benefits individual spirits may derive are secondary. This is the understanding of faith on which the nation’s Founders — men steeped in scriptural familiarity and the undisputed Christian culture of their time — based the Constitution. It’s the liberty for which so many of our fellow Americans have fought and died. And it’s the reason we must reopen the churches. People realize that we’re not out of the woods, in terms of health risk. They’ll accept reduced attendance, face masks and social distancing. Pastors will accept the need for more services to compensate for fewer bodies in the pews (they may not be happy about the extra demands on their time and effort, but they’ll accept them). What has never been acceptable is the notion that religious practice is a non-essential activity. Reaction against that assumption is what has prompted some believers not only to defy state restrictions, but to unwisely disregard reasonable anti-infection measures. It’s clear that we can’t jump back into our familiar ways of worshipping. But we must be free to worship. Governments must understand this, and work with religious leaders to establish safe ways for believers to meet their obligations to God. Not to do so demeans the liberty for which so many have sacrificed so much. • Rev. Michael P.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: One of the many ironies of the COVID-19 global pandemic is the world’s rediscovery that most everything that comes out of China is — somehow or someway — based on lies, a sad reality based on the long cultural tradition of Chinese deception. Without exception, this fundamental risk is the most critical element in every aspect of any dealing with China, whether it’s a complex national security matter or a simple commercial transaction. China lies about, cheats and steals absolutely everything — there are no exceptions. This is China at its most basic and historical level. It’s what China does — for example, what part of four huge plants reproducing stolen CD’s and DVD’s don’t we understand? Back in the days of books and vinyl records, Chinese pirated copies were for sale the day after they were released. Today, it’s all forms of technology and at the highest levels.

                               Perhaps the most ironic part of this historical reality is that it’s completely known and understood throughout Asia. And China fully understands it about itself — China deals with it every day and at every level of its society and expects it from all parts of its society.  It’s also the realty that transcends all Chinese politics. For a comparable example, one must look at organized crime, the Mafia and drug cartels. And perhaps doubly ironic, the pervasive corruption of communism remains the “perfect fit” for modern China. It’s the only political model that could “work” in China. Accordingly, three basic aspects of China’s corrupt behavior need better understanding in the West: Where does “the lie” come from in China, how does it “get to us” and how do we best deal with it? Where does the lie come from? Sun Tzu, the 6th century Chinese general and author of “The Art of War” probably said it best: “All war is based on deception” and China has effectively been at war with us since the end of World War II. China has also been at war with everyone else in the world to the extent it competes for business or the political control China wants. Just look at Chinese expansion in South America and Africa — their goal is to own and control these regions to the exclusion of all other influences. Origins of the China approach go back to its philosophically based history — the Confucian approach to life was/is based on the end result rather than the way it was obtained, and the general rejection of legal structures. Many say that President Xi Jinping is an energetic advocate of Confucian approaches to his governance and obsession with control. The latest example is Hong Kong — soon to be under total PRC control. Taiwan is next. How does the lie “get to us?” China has weaponized its people in more ways than we seem to realize, especially by stealing information and bribing insiders. China has hundreds of thousand students overseas who are obliged to report. China carelessly — maybe even intentionally — sent infected COVID-19 travelers to the rest of the world. And what China fears most now are internationally-coordinated efforts for trillions in enforced/leveraged compensation. Accordingly, we should be aggressively coordinating these efforts worldwide. They have weaponized their high-tech exports by building back doors into their systems to collect information — the concern about 5G and Huawei is only the most recent. They steal everyone’s technology and observe no copyright or patent legal regimes anywhere in the world. They pervert food and medicine in any way they can to make money — this is a technique used by street vendors in China and applied at the highest level to deceptively adulterate the product. The entire “political system” in China is corrupt, from the very lowest level to the very highest. There has never been any accountability for public corruption except as punishment — Mafia style — for not paying off the vertical chain of corrupt officials. Bribery is a way of life in China, always has been and always will be — and the fact China occasionally executes a token corrupt public official is meant for show and a lesson to pay bribes up the chain of political command. How do we deal with it? The guiding principle for anything that comes out of China — anything — is to not believe it. Nevertheless, dealing with China is impossible if we simply decide not to deal with the lie — they are the lie and we must learn to better deal with it. Here are some basic rules for dealing with China: • In any negotiation, China must know/understand/realize that we don’t believe them — and unlike in other parts of the world, this will not offend because it’s not offensive in China. In fact, it’s routine and expected as a part of everyday life. • We can never believe anything from China that we cannot actually see and verify the reality thereof. For example, how many nuclear weapons does it have? We will never know this and the actual number will always be many times our best estimates: China will always hide its nukes. • We should assume that all foods, medicines, chemicals, metals, etc., from China will be adulterated and require continuous inspection. Will China continue to lie and cheat even if we catch them at it? For sure. A very clever system of cheating — when and if it’s exposed — is a matter of humor in China. If this brief review seems harsh and politically incorrect, keep in mind that it will not be taken that way in China, rather as a reason to be even more clever and deceptive in dealings with us. The battle between East and West has been going on for centuries and is not about to abate, especially as China sees its current prosperity and power directly related to its deception — and it does. Kipling was right: “Oh, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet.”  • Daniel Gallington served in senior national security positions.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: There is a justified and renewed push by some Republicans to suspend guest workers coming into the country that in my opinion would not only help to protect our economy, but will help the 34 million displaced American workers. Four senators have called for a suspension of all new guest worker visas for 60 days and of certain categories of guest worker visas for a year “or until unemployment has returned to normal levels.” Of course, the immigrant advocacy organizations and groups that represent guest workers immediately pushed back and said the proposal would hurt the economy, claiming the move is politically motivated to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic and advance permanent restrictions on accepting new guest workers for most types of visas. It is amazing that these same groups that have used the pandemic as a way to release all immigrants from detention and implement their radical anti-borders agenda are now claiming exploitation by the Trump administration.      TOP STORIES

                               It is my opinion that the push from the senators is good but does not go far enough. The president must use his emergency authority to immediately suspend the entry of the hundreds of thousands of high-tech as well as low-skilled temporary workers planning to come to the United States, issue regulations that put in place permanent protections for American workers and revoke the work authorization of those already in the country at this time. At the same time, the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program also needs to be scrutinized.  Even before the coronavirus pandemic, American workers were being replaced or undercut by foreign workers in tech and other industries (e.g., “high-skilled” H-1Bs at AT&T and recent college grads by foreign students in OPT. With record unemployment crushing more than 30 million Americans, especially young people just graduating from college, importing more cheap foreign labor or allowing foreign nationals who are already here to continue to work while Americans continue to lose their jobs is simply unacceptable. Can any reasonable person imagine why we would need to bring in more than 100,000 foreign college students this summer on “Summer Work-Travel” visas? I can’t. While I’m on the record as supporting President Trump’s efforts to protect American workers, suspending the entry of immigrants who want to come here permanently, as the president did with his April 22 executive order; it needs to be expanded. Mr. Trump must take the next logical step and use that same emergency authority to issue a new executive order to cover temporary workers — who are often able to stay in the United States for years — and put lasting regulations in place that would protect American workers who are currently being replaced or undercut by them.  If not, vulnerable Americans will remain in the same peril into the foreseeable future, long after the pandemic has lifted and the president’s executive orders have ended. These regulatory actions must be undertaken as soon as possible, while any visa suspension for these programs is still in effect. Some simply require that the administration finish and publish regulations it is already working on, like a regulation that would reform the H-1B program; a regulation that would reform the OPT program; and a regulation that would rescind an Obama administration regulation allowing thousands of spouses of H-1B workers each year to get work permits. This isn’t hard. It will just take the president sticking to his instincts to put America first. Around 4 million students will be graduating from college this spring, many with large loans, all looking for jobs. An immigration policy that puts America first would ensure that our students are first in line for employment. Simply put, OPT has always been a controversial foreign-worker program created by the Obama and Bush administrations to allow foreign students to work in the United States for up to three years after graduation — tax-free. Employers who hire these foreign workers don’t have to pay taxes on them, making them cheaper hires than our American students. OPT has grown expansively in recent years with more than 400,000 foreigners, primarily from China and India, receiving work permits as of 2018. They work in many different areas, including national security sensitive fields, with virtually no oversight. These jobs would otherwise go to American graduates looking to start a life for themselves in these difficult times. The program is also plagued by significant fraud. Thousands of foreign nationals who have obtained work permits through OPT have done so by claiming to work for employers that don’t exist. Thousands of these individuals have attended phony “schools” that exist only to help foreigners break our immigration laws. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is actively investigating the significant threats OPT creates, but the effort is taking up resources the agency simply doesn’t have. Fortunately, the program is entirely within ICE’s control and can be ended, or at least significantly limited to fit within resource constraints, through a quick regulatory fix. It’s time to act and make smart changes. President Trump has shown great courage to do the right thing for American citizens on immigration issues. I am confident he will act similarly regarding guest work visas.   • Tom Homan is the former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: In 561 BC, Peisistratos dissolved the Athenian “Ecclesia”  (“Assembly”) and seized power in Athens and Attica. The Ecclesia, made  up of all adult male landowners in the Athenian city-state, would not  rule the city again for more than 50 years. In 1258, Simon de Montfort, in a bid to maintain his shaky control  over England, convened the precursor to the modern Parliament (from the  French for “a place or occasion to talk”). In the subsequent years,  kings and parliaments would joust for supremacy, with the parliament  ultimately winning  — primarily by executing Charles I in 1649. Across  those four centuries, one of the most used and useful weapons wielded by  monarchs against parliaments was to dissolve them and send them back to  their shires. On May 20, in a similar way, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi essentially  dissolved the House of Representatives in a bid to reduce the power and  authority of most of its members and increase the power and authority of  its leadership. The given reason for doing this is to restrain the  progress of the coronavirus, but the actual purpose is to accelerate the  steady migration of decision-making power from rank and file lawmakers  to leadership, its lieutenants and staff.

                               That migration has been ongoing for decades and can be seen in the  obvious (the pervasive use of closed rules) and the grotesque (bills so  large that no one but staff knows what might lurk in them). But the  notion of proxy voting is a step change because it, more acutely than  anything else, removes from House members the thing that distinguishes  them from the rest of us — their ability to draft, deliberate, amend and  vote on legislation. The irreducible fact is that decisions get made by those who are in  the room where it happens, not by those who have given their proxies to  those who are in that room. For those concerned about the partisan divide, is it likely to get  better if we reduce the human interaction and the give and take that is  (sometimes) a necessary ingredient in in the legislative process? That  element of interaction is rare enough already. How rare will it be once  lawmakers can and are in fact encouraged to evade the simple obligation  to show up for work? Apart from being extraordinarily disturbing from a historical and  policy perspective, giving your vote to someone else is probably  unconstitutional and, accordingly, contrary to the oath of office each  member takes at the commencement of each session of Congress. The Constitution gives leeway to the House and Senate with respect to  their own rules of procedure. But in both chambers, a quorum is  required to do business, and a quorum is defined as a majority of its  members. Article 1 of the Constitution is pretty straightforward: “a  Majority of each shall constitute a Quorum to do Business; but a smaller  Number may adjourn from day to day, and may be authorized to compel the  Attendance of absent Members, in such Manner, and under such Penalties  as each House may provide.” If physical presence isn’t necessary, compelling “Attendance of  absent Members” would be equally unnecessary. Although proxy voting was  possible at the time of the Constitutional Convention, delegates waited  for their peers to conduct business in person. They knew the value of  being physically present. Is such presence inefficient? Absolutely. The Framers understood  this. They did not intend to make it easy to reach consensus and govern.  The People’s House is not intended or designed to have two lawmakers  negotiate with the executive branch and then have the remainder of the  membership ratify the result. Congressional leaders cannot simply ignore historical, policy and  pragmatic concerns, as well as constitutional requirements, simply  because they find them inconvenient, troublesome,or inconsistent with  their preferences to minimize the role of members and maximize the role  of leadership and its staff. Congress (from the Latin for “coming together”) is a gathering of  people together to solve issues. That cannot and will not be  accomplished in the absence of the people of Congress. • Michael McKenna, a columnist for The Washington Times, is the  president of MWR Strategies.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: The stories have become so commonplace that they’ve almost lost their shock value. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio singles out churches and synagogues, threatening to seize their property and shut them down “permanently” if they dare defy his orders. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, (working through her city’s director of public health), declares a Romanian church a “public nuisance.” “We will shut you down, we will cite you, and if we need to, we will arrest you, and we will take you to jail,” she tells this small group of former Soviet bloc Christians who refuse to bow to her power.

                               Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas issues a stay-at-home “order” that includes a “request” that all churches which choose to exercise their First Amendment rights must provide a “record of attendees” to the city and to the state. Andy Beshear, Kentucky’s governor, warns that any state residents attending any church services will be “forced” to self-quarantine for 14 days. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer declares that even “drive-through” church services are prohibited. He then instructs his police to record the license plate numbers of anyone caught sitting in their car in their local church parking lot. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declares an executive order prohibiting churches from holding any indoor worship services. Vanita, Oklahoma, Mayor Chuck Hoskin issues a municipal order saying that anyone engaging in any church activity inside or outside, will be subject to a $500 fine and 30 days in jail. Police in Lakewood, New Jersey, arrest 15 congregants of a local synagogue for attending an Orthodox Jewish funeral. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy responds by saying that any knowledge of the religious freedom guaranteed to these Jews by the Bill of Rights is “above his pay grade.” Mayor after mayor and governor after governor across America have declared churches to be “non-essential” and ordered them closed under penalty of law. And yet, those who’ve haranged us for decades about the “separation of church and state” now sit in sleepy silence. Why? George Santayana once said, “Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” With this as context, perhaps a bit of a history lesson is in order. In 1791, James Madison wrote the First Amendment: “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” Madison, thus, argued that it is an “essential” right of every church and not that of a “king.” Madison’s premise was very easy to understand. No government official should ever presume to define the matters of the church. No politician or unelected bureaucrat ever has the power to “establish”, dictate, contradict or contravene religious belief or practice. This is not the government’s business. It is the church’s and the church’s alone. It is not the prerogative of our Congress or the courts to tell the church what to do or not to do.  Eleven years later, Thomas Jefferson found it necessary to reassure a small group of nervous Baptists in Danbury, Connecticut, that they did not have to fear any government intrusion into the affairs of their denomination’s polity or practice. “I contemplate with sovereign reverence that … [the] legislature should ‘make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,’ thus building a wall of separation between Church and State.” It is from Jefferson’s assurance of non-intrusion that we get our present language of separation of church and state. Read in context, the words of Jefferson and Madison are crystal clear. In America, unlike any other nation, the church is protected from the government. There is a “wall” that provides that protection, and it serves as a fortress, not a prison. It is built to guard the church, not to confine it. This wall is no more intended to restrain religion than the walls around your personal home are intended to restrain you. As a house has a door whereby you come and go, likewise, our Constitution has a door whereby the church is always free to enter society as it chooses, but also to lock that door and keep the government out when it sees fit. The key here is that the church holds the key, not your power-hungry governor, or your strutting little local mayor. The door is locked from the inside, not the outside. The wall is built for your benefit, not theirs.  John F. Kennedy once said that “in times of turbulence … it is more true than ever that knowledge is power.” The COVID-19 turbulence has exposed the radical ignorance of the left. They know nothing of our history and care little for your freedom.  Remember this in November.  You have knowledge. You have power. You hold the key. It’s time to use it. • Everett Piper, former president of Oklahoma Wesleyan University, is a columnist for The Washington Times and author of “Not A Day Care: The Devastating Consequences of Abandoning Truth” (Regnery 2017).

ANALYSIS/OPINION: Is it me or do the media seem almost giddy, in a macabre way, that America has passed the 100,000 mark in deaths attributed to the coronavirus? Since February, The Washington Post has kept track with a front-page graph of daily and total deaths, suggestive of a corporate sales chart.   On Wednesday, the front page featured 100,000 in giant figures in white against a black background. With the paper full of the usual anti-Trump articles, it practically screamed, “See? He did this!” TOP STORIES

                                Alec Baldwin bashes millions of Americans, says only 'mentally ill' will vote for Trump
                              
                               Over at CNN, legal and national security analyst Asha Rangappa tweeted: “I have a suggestion. How about, no matter you tweet about, you end the tweet with the following phrase: ‘Also, Trump is responsible for the death of 100,000 Americans.’ That way there’s always a reminder.” According to Newsbusters.org, Ms. Rangappa’s tweet was quickly seconded by MSNBC’s counter-terrorism analyst Malcolm Nance. This is the guy who suggested in April 2017 that Mr. Trump deserved an ISIS suicide bombing of Trump Tower Istanbul because he phoned Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to congratulate him for winning a referendum.  On May 24, a few days before the death count hit 100,000, The New York Times Sunday front page headline was “U.S. DEATHS NEAR 100,000, AN INCALCULABLE LOSS,” accompanied by a list of 1,000 names of victims.  For the families who have lost loved ones, these are, indeed, incalculable losses. We should be praying for each and every family that has suffered such a loss, and for those who are battling for life.   But we also need to be aware of how much the media and leftist politicians are using the pandemic as their main chance to beat President Trump in November, keep their House majority and recapture the U.S. Senate. They seem intent on keeping the nation locked down and in a near-Depression as long as possible.  It may be their only hope. The numbers may be off, too. While some claim an undercount, New York and other jurisdictions have designated thousands of “probable” but undiagnosed cases as COVID-19 deaths. All deaths linked to the coronavirus are now classified as “COVID-19 deaths regardless of cause or underlying health issues that could have contributed to loss of life,” said Dr. Deborah Birx, Coronavirus Response Coordinator for the White House Coronavirus Task Force. More than 35,100 nursing home deaths have been reported in 37 states, out of 174,381 cases in 42 states, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. More than 80 percent of the deaths are of people 65 and older.   So, it boggles the mind to recall orders by three states for nursing homes to take in people who tested positive for the coronavirus, thus putting at risk the most vulnerable population. Although most of the media have studiously ignored this huge scandal, The New York Times published an article on April 24, “‘Playing Russian Roulette’: Nursing Homes Told to Take the Infected.”  Here’s the key paragraph: “At the epicenter of the outbreak, New York issued a strict new rule last month: Nursing homes must readmit residents sent to hospitals with the coronavirus and accept new patients as long as they are deemed ‘medically stable.’ California and New Jersey have also said that nursing homes should take in such patients.” More than 29,000 people have died in New York state, about 75 percent of them aged 65 and older, many in nursing homes, even while New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo was being praised by the media for his brilliant leadership during the crisis. Curiously, when you click on the link to Mr. Cuomo’s executive order, the state page says the “document may have moved,” and directs the reader to a later order about specimen collections. With Joe Biden looking frailer by the day, and Mr. Cuomo being suggested as either a VP candidate or a fallback presidential contender, the disappearance of his nursing home order is convenient at the very least.   New York and New Jersey have had a combined 40,279 fatalities, according to Johns Hopkins University’s count, or more than 40 percent of the 100,000 U.S. reported deaths. The vast majority are people 65 and older, with those infected over 80 having the highest fatality rate.  In early April, New Jersey Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli issued a directive to nursing homes to accept clients diagnosed with COVID-19. As of this past Friday, 537 long-term-care homes in the state reported coronavirus outbreaks, with 5,750 deaths, or more than half of the state’s 11,401 COVID-19 fatalities.   In late April, Ms. Persichilli warned of a second outbreak and said she was worried about nursing homes, which have shown “very little resiliency” to the coronavirus. No kidding. Meanwhile, California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration issued a similar order: Skilled nursing facilities “shall not refuse to admit or readmit a resident based on their status as a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 case.” What were they thinking?   As of Friday, 1,632 nursing home residents in California had died of the virus, out of nearly 4,000 total deaths in the state.   These three states are among the hardest hit by the virus, and all are governed by Democrats.  But you can bet the farm that the media will blame President Trump for every single COVID-19-related death right up to Election Day. • Robert Knight is a contributor to The Washington Times.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: Valerie Jarrett, former White House whisperer for the Barack Obama administration, said in an MSNBC television interview that “vote-by-mail” should be the way to go in each and every state for elections this November. And forever after, for that matter. And with that, the left tipped its hat to its “never let a crisis go to waste” COVID-19 endgame. “This week,” said Jarrett, as Breitbart reported, “we launched Civic Cities, where we are working with mayors across the country.” TOP STORIES

                               Working for what? To kill the integrity of America’s election system. To ultimately, destroy the Electoral College and tip the scales of voting the Democrats’ way for years, even decades, to come. And to do so on the wings of teaching civility in politics. Civic Cities is the left’s latest way of pretending like it’s working on behalf of the citizens of the United States while actually working to undercut the Constitution, free market and concept of individual rights, and brainwashing the next generation in good old-fashioned socialist collectivism. “We’re building Civic Cities across the nation — cities which provide the following: Solutions Civics, [that] teaches No-Blame problem solving of government issues to high school students,” reads one bullet point from the Citizens Campaign website. Yada yada, so on and so forth. “No blame” is code for “no accountability.” No accountability for Democrats, that is. Anyhow, apparently, as part of Civic Cities, youth are being trained to think of voting as an at-home endeavor. “We’re working in high schools,” Jarrett said, “because people who are first-time voters tend to be lifelong voters. We have colleges and universities. We have the business community engaged.” The endgame? “We should have vote-by-mail in every state,” she said. “We should have early vote in every state. Everybody should be able to go online to register. Why is it leaders are not making it as easy as possible for us to vote as opposed to trying to suppress the vote? We’re trying to close the age and the race gap. We’re confident that this is a long term plan.” And COVID-19 has provided the perfect platform to spring this long-term vote-from-home plan into effect. “This COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare the weaknesses in government and leadership,” Jarrett said. Oh, what a lucky day for Democrats that COVID-19 came along. Not only do Dems now have a tool to justify hiding away their subpar candidate Joe Biden in the basement — out of the comparatively hot gaffe zone known as The Field of Donald Trump’s Fire — but also, they can put in place the groundswell for a long-held dream of the left: to destroy America’s fair system of elections. “Vote-by-mail has not been in any way an indicator of vote fraud,” Jarrett said. And by that, she meant, in typical Democrat-slash-Orwellian-speak: Vote-by-mail is highly susceptible to fraud. And thanks to COVID-19, Democrats have a chance to usher in an electoral system rife with fraud they can exploit for decades to come. • Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter @ckchumley.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, tech companies have repeatedly been called upon to help solve a host of problems. They’ve certainly answered that call, filling in various needs ranging from education to logistics networks to use of drones for delivering medical supplies.  But not everything has been roses. Some governments around the world have been using tech to gain more power in the name of fighting COVID-19. More people should contest these abuses of power, lest the world devolve into a surveillance state. In Singapore, police used a remote-controlled robot to patrol a park. The robot monitored foot traffic and relayed messages to urge people to practice social distancing. In theory, this is an innocent-enough way of informing people of the dangers of COVID-19 and reducing exposure and transmission. In practice, it’s an instance of Orwellian overreach — “Big Brother is watching you.”  TOP STORIES

                               The Singapore government is sullying safety protocol, too, by keeping a centralized database of cases that anyone can view online. The database doesn’t divulge names, but it does keep location data. While that sounds less threatening, it’s still problematic. As The New York Times showed, identifying people based on location data alone is relatively easy. Sure, contact tracing can be an effective way of monitoring the disease’s spread and getting much-needed information to those who are at risk, but safeguards like opt-in programs and deletion standards must be put in place to protect citizens’ privacy. Meanwhile, in Poland, the government is requiring people to download a selfie application, wherein people who need to isolate for 14 days have to upload selfies of themselves at home to a government-run app. If they don’t, they’re subject to police visits.  In Israel, the government used phone location data to impose quarantine requirements “without compromise.” Thankfully, this particular program has since come to an end after an oversight group within Israeli parliament raised a stink. But the fact that this was ever implemented is seriously troubling. From policing robots to government selfie quota — none of this is good news for civilians, but perhaps the most alarming development so far is how some governments are now using drone technology to monitor citizens and enforce lockdowns and restrictions.  For example, take China, a notoriously authoritarian state. It has already used drones to enforce prevention measures, and many European countries are following suit. One police department in the U.K. is uploading drone footage to their social media profile to socially shame people for not complying with social distancing measures. In France, drones are being used to enforce lockdown orders by the government. If these measures aren’t challenged, then authoritarian regimes will run amok.  Even the United States has imported these kinds of draconian and authoritarian tactics. In New York, for example, law enforcement are using drones to spot and fine residents in an effort to enforce lockdown orders. California and New Jersey, too, have used drones as a method of monitoring and enforcing social distancing during lockdowns. New Jersey is using the tech to spot non-compliant citizens so they can issue them fines of up to $1,000. This is all “to help combat people not following social distancing,” according to one police department. While that may seem like a harsh invasion of privacy, a New Jersey police chief assures us it’s worth it “if it saves one life.” City authorities are making similar efforts to encourage social distancing among residents in Savannah, Georgia. Limiting human contact and curbing the infection rate are valid concerns, but shrugging off constitutional protections of privacy will have far-reaching implications for the future.  Thankfully, these actions and orders have not gone uncontested. People are becoming increasingly vocal in their criticisms of such programs. Groups such as the ACLU have expressed concern over the privacy questions raised by various track and trace programs, as well as access to cellphone location data. More people need to step up and express their concern in order to make sure that the government is not acting without any checks whatsoever. We have to think long-term during this coronavirus crisis; we can’t let the government use it as a reason to chip away at our rights as citizens. Here in America, the current outcry against what’s already happening simply isn’t enough. More of us need to speak up in defense of what’s rightfully ours. After all, if we allow the government’s tech overreach to be normalized, we may well find that the freedoms we surrender for a time are freedoms that we never get back. • James Czerniawski is a contributor for Young Voices.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: Donald Trump’s prospects for 2020 are better than one might think, despite being deluged with troubles that Job himself might not have endured. Yet, miraculously, he’s still very much in the game. Consider: A recent poll conducted for CNN found Joe Biden losing in each of 15 battleground states, with Mr. Trump again winning Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. A major reason: Voters prefer Mr. Trump over Mr. Biden when it comes to running the economy. In that special election in California’s 25th Congressional District, the GOP’s Mike Garcia, a son of a Mexican immigrant and a former Navy fighter pilot, handed the Republican Party its first pickup of a Democratic seat in the state since 1998, with the president making a highly publicized appearance on Mr. Garcia’s behalf. Barack Obama’s and Hillary Clinton’s much ballyhooed endorsement of Mr. Garcia’s challenger fell flat. TOP STORIES

                               Here’s another interesting tidbit: Las Vegas odds-makers had the president a slight favorite over the former vice president even before the major rise in the stock market and signs that a vaccine may come sooner rather than later. And while the president is being hammered by the media for pressing states to return to a semblance of normality, the majority of governors feel compelled to say they have plans for normality too, perhaps with an eye on Mr. Garcia’s win in California. A consideration in that contest, notes the Cook political report, was a “thin patience for lockdowns.”  The president is viewed by that CNN survey as slightly underwater on the coronavirus issue, with the media flogging him for his supposed failure to respond quickly and take the advice of his health care experts.  It’s hard to believe that any president would have acted sooner, with China telling us that the disease did not transfer easily from one human to another, with the WHO insisting it was unlikely to spread beyond China’s borders and with our our own top infectious disease experts taking Dr. Anthony Fauci’s view that the risk to America was “minuscule.” The first known case in the United States of COVID-19 was discovered in a young man who had returned to Washington State on Jan. 15 from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the disease. U.S. health officials were not overly concerned, believing the virus was confined largely to the Wuhan area and that there was “no evidence” that it would leap China’s national boundaries. Yet just seven days after the virus had been confirmed on Jan. 21, the president and his advisers quickly assembled a team of distinguished infectious disease experts to serve on the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Though the WHO wouldn’t label the virus a global threat until the 30th, the president declared a public health emergency a day later, blocking entry into the United States of most non-U.S. citizens arriving from China.  The China travel ban was the first of dozens of crucial actions taken by the White House, including airport screenings, quarantining, mitigating, distancing, etc., all approved by the task force’s world-class epidemiologists and virologists whom the president had selected. Furthermore, these steps have kept the American death rate per confirmed coronavirus cases lower than numerous Western European democracies, including Sweden, Switzerland and the Netherlands. The mammoth falsehood that the president had been whimsically rejecting the advice of his health care experts was put to rest by Dr. Fauci himself at the April 13 White House briefing. When Drs. Deborah Birx and Fauci urged the travel ban on China, Dr. Fauci stressed that the president said “yes” to their request. He said “yes” when both endorsed a European travel ban. And he gave a “yes” to a travel ban on the United Kingdom and Ireland. The first and only time that Drs. Birx and Fauci formally made a recommendation for “strong mitigation,” Dr. Fauci added, the president went for strong mitigation. When the president called for a partial reopening of the country in 15 days, he agreed to the 30-day delay that they said was crucial to its success. Indeed, the author cannot find notable divisions between the task force and the president on policy until after the official reopening of the states in May. And even those have been exaggerated. Early on the president was endlessly mocked for his view that COVID-19 would not be a major problem for the United States. But he was hardly going rogue, as the media pretends. His optimism was derived from the task force’s scholars on infectious disease, including Drs. Robert Redfield and Fauci, who, in turn, had been misinformed by China and the WHO. Dr. Redfield told reporters the disease was a China problem, but that “the risk to the American public is low,” repeating that comforting thought several times. Dr. Fauci ended his remarks this way: “I underscore what Bob said: We still have a low risk to the American public. … ” On multiple other occasions Dr. Fauci minimized the risk, telling USA Today on Feb. 17 that “the real and present danger” was the seasonal flu, while the coronavirus danger is “just minuscule.”  The media’s determination to convince voters that the president’s decisions were irrational is hardly surprising. But what is remarkable is that a president gut-punched by a pandemic, major job losses and an unforgiving media still finds he has a good shot at winning a second term. • Allan H.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: In every generation, long-settled issues hibernate like cicadas, patiently waiting until new controversies propel them to the surface. Thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, the latest of these hardy perennials is absentee voting. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California is the boldest Democrat, proposing that absentee ballots be widely distributed throughout his state — apparently like toilet paper (supplies of which remain limited). But this newest paper chase is motivated by the noblest of intentions: guaranteeing risk-free voting in the 2020 presidential election. After all, what does it matter if the franchise is effectively extended to the undocumented, the felonious, the homeless, the unlettered and the unentitled? Isn’t absentee voting just another form of social distancing to fight COVID-19? TOP STORIES

                               Benjamin Franklin’s timeless warning about the fragility of the American democratic experiment — “a Republic, if you can keep it” — is being studiously ignored and not just in California. Wherever two or more Democrats are gathered together, their familiar tropes are always close at hand. Try to discuss voter fraud and you are immediately charged either with racism or a thinly-disguised bias against immigrants.  Any suggestion that community voting records need to be periodically reviewed for citizenship (Are you here legally?); accuracy (Do you still live in this district?); or even mortality (Are you still alive?) will result in either impassioned arguments or nasty allegations that your real agenda is voter suppression. Can you imagine the catastrophic effects on our already strained banking system if our credit bureaus relied on this same kind of outdated, uncorroborated information? One of the most insightful sources on voting problems in California and elsewhere is the public interest group Judicial Watch. Its president, Tom Fitton, believes that “dirty (voter) rolls can mean dirty elections,” so the group aggressively files lawsuits whenever problems are uncovered. For example, one Kentucky investigation “found that 48 Kentucky counties … had more registered voters than citizens over the age of 18.” How widespread is the problem? In January, Judicial Watch announced that, with the assistance of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, it had found “2.5 million extra voter names” spread across 378 American counties.  Far from voter suppression, those alarming totals suggest that political machines of various stripes are aggressively engaging in vote harvesting. With the American political system in hyper-drive, correcting even the smallest of these anomalies is quickly condemned by one armed camp or the other. A new wrinkle on these old arguments began to emerge around the Memorial Day holiday. Since our military has a well-organized system of absentee balloting, why couldn’t similar arrangements reduce the threat of COVID-19? A federal judge in San Antonio, Texas, last week even opined that the problem of voter fraud was theoretical while the coronavirus is a clear and present danger.  I smiled because one of my most treasured personal souvenirs is a red-line version of the “Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act” signed into law in August 1986 by President Ronald Reagan. Working for Sen. John Warner as an Army Congressional Fellow, I managed that legislation while learning that bipartisan leadership is essential in protecting our citizen-soldiers. I had been one of those soldiers, several of my applications for military absentee ballots lost or ignored during successive Cold War assignments. After Congressman Al Swift, a Democrat from Washington, wrote a bill to strengthen absentee voting, Mr. Warner assigned me to shepherd its counterpart through the Senate. From organizing hearings to signing up co-sponsors — including both Jesse Helms and Edward Kennedy — bipartisan cooperation became the order of the day.  Keeping it that way meant consistently demonstrating two things: ballot security and the absence of any advantage to either party. The entire military chain of command would certify the bona fides of each soldier, sailor, airman and marine. Democratic and Republican witnesses assured the Senate that this legislation would provide both parties with a level playing field. The only real opposition came when a Virginia election official angrily shouted that, “Votin’ may be a raht, but absentee votin’ is a privilege!” — a statement I later included verbatim in the Senate record. But everyone else agreed that the proposed legislation was right, proper and badly needed. Those facts notwithstanding, this obscure law later helped to decide the presidential election of 2000. Remember Florida, the hanging chads and those troublesome military absentee ballots? Well, you’re welcome, America, but try to remember that this was a legacy of the ’80s, when partisanship ended on Capitol Hill every day at 5 p.m. as glasses were raised. Try expanding absentee ballot rights today only if you are encouraged by such helpful precedents as the Titanic, Lusitania and Hindenburg. • Ken Allard is a retired U.S. Army colonel and former NBC News military analyst now living in San Antonio, Texas.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: Look at recent headlines and it’s as if COVID-19 were sweeping across the nation as some sort of grisly ghost of death, leaving piles of bodies in the morgues, piles of bodies in the nursing homes, piles of bodies in the hospitals — even piles of bodies in the streets. But do the math and the truth is far less earth-shattering. As a percentage of the U.S. population, which WorldOMeters estimates for 2020 at just shy of 331 million, the coronavirus death count is 0.03%.

                               That’s miniscule. That’s teeny-weeny. That’s itty-bitty. But for that, America has lost its economy, its free market, its freedom, its Constitution. “U.S. coronavirus death toll tops 100,000 as Trump pushes to reopen,” Politico’s headline blared, above a story with a critical look at President Donald Trump’s insistence to get America back in business. The story went on to report how America “leads the world in reported confirmed coronavirus cases,” a number Johns Hopkins University now puts around 1.6 million. And even if those numbers were completely accurate — even if the data from hospitals could be trusted — then 1.6 million cases of coronavirus in a population of 331 million still seems pretty minuscule when put in context of percentages: that’s 0.48%. Again: miniscule. The more important number is the one that tells how many recoveries, right? But death is much more interesting to report. “US coronavirus deaths top 100,000,” wrote Reuters. “U.S. coronavirus death toll rises above 100,000 in world’s deadliest outbreak,” wrote CNBC. “U.S. coronavirus death toll surpasses 100,000,” reported CNN. “US coronavirus death toll crosses 100,000 in harrowing milestone,” wrote Fox News. Some context would be good here. Of course, a headline like “Coronavirus proves deadly for 0.03% of U.S. population” — while truthful —doesn’t exactly scream, stop the presses! It does, however, provide some cooler head insights into just how widespread this virus is, just how devastating its death count is — and ultimately, just how smart a move it is for this administration to adopt a policy line of opening the economy, and opening the economy but quick. The 0.48% of the U.S. population infected by the coronavirus may think it premature; the family and loved ones of the 0.03% who’ve died from COVID-19 may think it careless and even cruel — but fact is, destroying an entire country for such a minuscule number of victims is nothing short of crazy. America cannot stand still another moment and suffer the destruction of freedoms, free enterprise and the future for the sake of a few COVID-19 victims — for the fear there might be a few more. The national suicide must stop now. • Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley. Listen to her podcast “Bold and Blunt” by clicking HERE.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: There’s a too-little talked about outcome of all this rush to develop anti-COVID-19 measures in the health world, and in both government and private sectors, and it’s one that goes like this: If a self-described coronavirus mitigation product or action fails to do as promised, or worse, actually causes harm to a citizen or group of citizens, there’s no mechanism for accountability. There’s no means of suing. The government has exempted itself and all its willing COVID-19 product-developing partners from any sort of liability for mistakes, misconceptions, misunderstandings about proper usage — from anything that could come back to bite. How so? TOP STORIES

                               The Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act, or PREP Act, that’s how. That’s the measure that gives the Health and Human Services secretary the authority to declare certain entities off-limits to legal liabilities during times of national crises — like COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. “The Secretary’s March 17, 2020 Declaration (‘COVID-19 Declaration’) provides certain individuals and entities (‘Covered Persons’) with immunity from suit and liability under federal and state law against ‘all claims for loss caused by, arising out of, relating to, or resulting form the administration to or the use by an individual of a covered countermeasure’ … except for willful misconduct,” according to a post from JD Supra. What a free-for-all for the COVID-19 opportunist, yes? And they serve for both private businesses and government. Test positive for COVID-19 despite wearing a face mask advertised as a protection against the coronavirus? Too bad; the manufacturer cannot be touched. Too bad; the governor issuing face mask mandates cannot be touched. Too bad; the grocery store enforcing the unconstitutional face mask orders from the governor cannot be touched. Swallow a pill the pharmaceutical industry comes up with and sells as a means of strengthening immunity to fight off the coronavirus — and suffer devastating medical side effects? Too bad; so sad. Watch a family member who was abiding a government order die from COVID-19? Again, too bad; so sad. Move on; there’s nothing to see here — certainly nothing to sue. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo may have sent thousands of elderly coronavirus patients to their COVID-19 deaths at nursing homes around the state. But he won’t pay for it. Neither will the nursing homes. From The Guardian: “As Governor Andrew Cuomo faced a spirited challenge in his bid to win New York’s 2018 Democratic primary, his political apparatus got a last-minute boost: a powerful healthcare industry group suddenly poured more than $1m into a Democratic committing backing his campaign. Less than two years after that flood of cash from the Greater New York Hospital Association (GNYHA), Cuomo signed legislation last month quietly shielding hospital and nursing home executives from the threat of lawsuits stemming from the coronavirus outbreak.” The power of granting immunity is a wonderful thing. And now we have a rush to develop a vaccine before the end of the year that will stop the spread of the coronavirus? That, as industry best-practice and government guidelines dictate it takes between 10 and 15 years to develop a single safe and effective vaccine. Beware, Americans. “Currently,” JD Supra reports, “Covered Persons [under this PREP Act] are afforded immunity through October 1, 2024.” That’s four years of free-for-all COVID-19 countermeasure product design, production, marketing and sale without all that pesky shadow of accountability, liability and lawsuit. That’s four years of government actions and orders to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. If Cuomo is an example of what’s to come, Americans need to be on high alert. With PREP, it’s clear: The priorities are Big Business, Big Pharma and Big Government — the private citizens last. • Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: The coronavirus pandemic has exposed deep divisions in the United States, but in one crucial area, it has unified our nation. With more than 90,000 dead and nearly 1.5 million sick, the American people have decisively judged the country that created this crisis: Communist China. That’s the finding of a new poll commissioned by the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation and conducted by YouGov. In a representative survey of American adults, we discovered that 71% of the country believes that Beijing should be penalized for the coronavirus. There is deep public support for international sanctions, additional tariffs, refusing to pay interest on Chinese-held U.S. debt, and banning communist officials from traveling to America. A majority want Beijing to pay America and other countries for the lives and livelihoods it has destroyed. Only 17 percent don’t want reparations. More broadly, we found that a stunning 67 percent of Americans now view Beijing as an enemy or opponent. This tracks with a Gallup poll in March that showed U.S. favorability of China at an all-time low. TOP STORIES

                               We don’t have to wonder why the American people feel this way. By now it is well-known that Beijing’s oppression and secrecy hid the true nature of the coronavirus, allowing it to spread virtually unchecked around the world — but not within other provinces of China. Scientists in the United Kingdom have shown that if China had been honest and taken earlier action, there would have been 95 percent fewer cases globally. Instead, the Communist Party covered up the truth, with disastrous consequences for America and the whole world. But Americans aren’t just turning on China because of the current pandemic. The last few months are merely the latest proof that Beijing endangers U.S. security and prosperity, and it dovetails with the growing realization that China’s authoritarian vision threatens human rights everywhere, including our own. Our fellow citizens have watched with horror as the Chinese Communist Party has stepped up its campaign to conquer Hong Kong, thrown millions of Muslim Uighurs into modern-day concentration camps, and convinced U.S. companies like the NBA and others to censor free speech and toe Beijing’s propaganda line. No wonder Americans want to decouple our country from China and hold that regime accountable. Yet the greatest barrier to fulfilling the people’s wish isn’t geopolitics, commercial ties or anything of the kind. It’s something much simpler: The self-interest of our political and business leaders. From the moment President Nixon set foot in China in 1972 to the present day, U.S. elites have long been captivated by the promise of good relations with the Middle Kingdom. Politicians, from both parties, have sought to cement their own legacies by drawing our countries closer together. CEOs have salivated at the possibility of tapping such a huge consumer market and labor pool, envisioning lower costs and higher profits. Yet while these leaders have spent decades touting the benefits of ever-closer ties, over that same time, the American people have almost uniformly seen Communist China in a negative light. This unfortunate mismatch is still true today. Even now, the sense among high society is that Americans should accept the Chinese Communist Party’s growing power. Some, like many business leaders and the families of former U.S. presidents, continue to say that closer U.S.-China cooperation is the key to our future. Meanwhile, the current race for the White House features one man who voted for legislation that allowed China to decimate American manufacturing, and another man who, despite strong rhetoric and much-needed containment policies, has staked much of his legacy on striking an elusive trade deal with Beijing and has even praised Chinese President Xi Jinping’s “transparency.” But the American people don’t want deals or flattery. In their boundless common sense, our fellow citizens rightly see that Communist China and free, democratic America cannot co-exist cozily. This was becoming clear before the coronavirus. It is unmistakable now that Beijing’s actions have led to the death of nearly 100,000 of our family, friends and neighbors, and the suffering of millions more. There is an overwhelming post-partisan consensus that the United States must take a much stronger stance when it comes to Chinese oppression and aggression, whether morally, diplomatic, military or economic. The expectation is growing for our elected officials — Republican and Democrat — to reflect the unity of the nation and hold Communist China accountable. Americans are being told that we may have to “live with” the coronavirus for the time being and accept a new reality. But the American people are telling our leaders that we do not have to accept the Chinese Communist Party’s influence and propaganda within our country. We do not have to accept our manufacturing and medical dependence on China. These are things we can change. And most Americans think we should. • Marion Smith (@smithmarion) is executive director of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation in Washington, D.C.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: The current U.S. budget deficit could soon exceed a record $4 trillion. The massive borrowing is being driven both by prior budget profligacy and a hurried effort by the Donald Trump administration to pump liquidity into a quarantined America. The COVID-19 shutdown has left the country on the cusp of a self-inflicted economic collapse not seen since the Great Depression. Americans may soon have to service a staggering national debt of about $30 trillion — nearly $100,000 of debt for every American.

                               Democrats and Republicans can blame each other, either for spending too much or for too little taxation, or both. But both sides will agree that managing such an astronomical debt requires several frightening choices. One, Americans would be forced to live with permanent near-zero interest rates, or perhaps even negative interest rates. We are already seeing how the current low interest rates punish those who were thrifty and put away money in savings accounts. Negligible interest rewards those who borrow but forces savers to look for returns in volatile real estate or the risky stock market. In other words, there would be little interest paid out on the federal debt. The selling point for investors would be that the U.S. at least honors it bonds and debts and is safer than alternative global investments. America would become a permanent debtor that avoids paying much interest to anyone who lends it ever more money — on the cynical rationale that investors have no other safe place to put their money. Two, Americans, who are already taxed heavily at the local, state and federal levels, would simply have to pay even more. Top earners might pay a real tax rate of 60 percent to 70 percent of their incomes to government, with deleterious effects on incentives to create or earn further wealth. Gasoline prices are at astonishing lows, so some have advocated yet another federal fuel-tax increase, a national sales tax or a wealth tax on the rich. The problem with constant increases in taxation is the ensuing culture of even greater spending that inevitably follows and the destruction of individual incentive. Three, the government could make draconian cuts in spending, focusing mostly on entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare, along with defense, where the bulk of federal expenditures are found. Cutting Social Security and Medicare is usually political suicide. In times of growing tensions with China, Russia, Iran and North Korea, it would equally be foolish to slash defense spending. Instead, expect some sort of reductions in Social Security benefits for high-income Americans, along with higher Medicare deductibles for everyone. Four, the government could fall into the bad habits of the 1970s and simply expand the money supply, fuel inflation and pay down the debt with funny money. We would then likely experience the baleful consequences that a prior generation faced with stagflation and curative but staggeringly high interest rates during the Nixon, Ford, Carter and early Reagan administrations. Rather than fooling with interest rates and the money supply, a mixture of increased revenue and spending cuts seems wiser. Yet both are far harder to enact politically than just letting the Federal Reserve Board adjust national liquidity and interest. Five, the government could hope that new deregulation and more tax incentives might spur GDP growth of 3 percent or more per annum and thus “grow” our way out of deficits by radically expanding the economy. Such optimism is frequently voiced but rarely has prevented large budget deficits. A decade ago, the bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, headed by former Republican Sen. Alan Simpson and former Democratic official Erskine Bowles, charted a pathway out of debt. The commission outlined a holistic plan of gradual cuts and revenue increases. Its wise recommendations found little to no political support. In the first two decades of the 21st century, the United States has faced three existential crises. The first was the 9/11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, which prompted a global effort to fight radical Islamic terrorism. The second occurred in 2008, when the U.S. financial system and stock market nearly collapsed. The third began earlier this year with the COVID-19 epidemic and a quarantine that reduced the economy to its most shaky state since the 1930s. During the first two crises, we snapped back the economy with low interest rates, increased government spending and larger annual deficits — and passed the greater long-term debt to another administration, another Congress and another generation of Americans. We are postponing another rendezvous with reality. But as we near $30 trillion in debt, what cannot go on much longer soon probably won’t. • Victor Davis Hanson, a classicist and historian at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, is the author of “The Second World Wars: How the First Global Conflict Was Fought and Won” (Basic Books, 2017).

ANALYSIS/OPINION: The governors of all 50 states and the mayors of many large cities have assumed unto themselves the powers to restrict private personal choices and lawful public behavior in an effort to curb the spread of COVID-19. They have done so not by enforcing previously existing legislation but by crafting their own executive orders, styling those orders as if they were laws, using state and local police to enforce those so-called laws and — presumably when life returns to normal and the courts reopen — prosecuting the alleged offenders in court. It is hard to believe that any judge in America would permit a criminal trial of any person for violating a standard of behavior that has not been enacted into law by a legislature. We know this because under our system of representative government, separated powers and guaranteed liberties, only the legislative branch can craft laws and assign punishments for noncompliance. This is Constitutional Law 101. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch has written that the executive branch cannot enforce a law that it has written. If it does, we will have approached tyranny.

                               Have we approached tyranny already? During the past eight weeks, governors and mayors have closed most businesses, public venues and houses of worship, prohibited public assembly and restricted travel — all of which they have unilaterally decreed to be nonessential.   In his terrifying novel “1984” — which posits a future of total control of all persons by the government and total control of the government by one political party — George Orwell argued that he who controls the meaning of words controls the laws as well. That Orwellian truism has been manifested like never before here in America, where executive branch officeholders have used state and local police to restrain people from engaging in private and public behavior which they concede was lawful two months ago because today it is not deemed “essential.” Frankly, I am surprised at the ferocity of police enforcement and the lameness of police compliance. The police have taken the same oaths to uphold the same Bill of Rights — it’s not the Bill of Safety; it’s the Bill of Rights — as have all other officeholders. The police also know that it is unlawful for them to obey an unlawful order, particularly when they use force. The lockdown orders are all unlawful because none of them — none — has been enacted by a legislature, and all of them — all — interfere with fundamental liberties, each of which is guaranteed — guaranteed — by the U.S. Constitution. Please don’t misunderstand me. I recognize the scientific value of personal efforts to control contagion. But under the Constitution, these social-distancing, wear-your-mask, shut-your-business, stay-at-home edicts constitute mere recommendations that should induce rational voluntary compliance, because the government in America is without lawful power to compel compliance. The governors complain about resistance. They need to know that Americans will resist efforts to interfere in behavior that remains as moral, natural, lawful and constitutional as it was 60 days ago. Last week, President Trump, sounding fed up with gubernatorial lockdown orders, declared that religious worship is essential — meaning, in his opinion, all houses of worship should be opened — and he offered that he was prepared to “override” any governors who disagreed with him. When the president realized that he lacked any authority to override even unlawful gubernatorial decrees, he dispatched the Department of Justice to begin filing challenges to governors in federal courts and to argue that constitutional freedoms are being impaired by the states. I applaud this, but it is too little, too late. Where was the DOJ when Catholic priests were threatened with arrest for saying Mass or distributing palms and when Jewish rabbis were put in COVID-19-infested jails for holding funerals? At all these religious events, folks freely chose to exercise their freedom to worship; and to take their chances. These DOJ interventions provoked the question: Who should decide what goods, services or venues are essential — the states or the federal government? The question is Orwellian, as the answer is: neither of them. The government in America — state or federal — has no power and no right to determine what goods, services and venues are essential. Those determinations have been for individuals to make since 1776, and those individual choices have been constitutionally protected from the feds since the Bill of Rights was ratified in 1791 and from the states since the 14th Amendment was ratified in 1868. What is essential to the laborer or student or housewife may not be essential to the former Goldman Sachs partner who was elected governor of New Jersey, and who decreed last week, “It shall be the duty of every person or entity in this State … to cooperate fully” with his orders, or essential to the ideologue who is mayor of the Big Apple and who, for all his professed liberality, threatened to close permanently — permanently — businesses and houses of worship that flaut his guidelines. A duty is undertaken voluntarily or by nature, not by executive command, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy. And the government cannot take property away from its owners except for a legitimate public use and only for just compensation, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.  Governors and mayors can make all the dictatorial pronouncements and threats that they wish. But they cannot use public assets to enforce them. And when they seek to use force, those from whom they seek it should decline the offer.   In America, we decide for ourselves what produces happiness. We have never delegated to the government — ever — the power to make personal choices for us. And some of us are willing to take chances and even do “nonessential” things. The essence of the freedoms for which we have fought since 1776 is the liberty to be ourselves. • Andrew P.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: You needn’t be a hi-tech hipster to be familiar with Siri of Appleland or Alexa of Googleville, the artificially intelligent ladies at your beck and call now hanging out with a new kid on the AI block. Its name is contact tracing, and it’s being deployed in the battle to rein in COVID-19. Technically, contact tracing isn’t new. The D.C. Department of Health and other public health agencies are well-acquainted with the probing policies of contact tracing, which were deployed to connect the dots against such scourges as STDs, HIV/AIDS, Ebola, food poisoning and E.coli.

                               Artificial eyes can become productive tools — if privacy laws, regulations and rules are followed and apolitical. Still, think of contact tracing by way of a question: Would you entrust your personal and health data in the hands of a high school grad who barely earned a diploma and doesn’t know Georgia, the U.S. Peach State, from Georgia, the Eurasian nation-state? Here’s a brief description of how contact works. Apple and Google have joined the coronavirus fight by helping track people who have COVID-19. The “trackers” — government and nonprofit workers — ask the “tracked” persons who they might have been in contact with. Next, the tracked are asked to divulge where, when and with whom they had contact — including names and addresses. Now, when it comes to STDs, infected persons are asked to name and provide contact information for their sexual contacts, regardless of the relationship. Some lie, some provide a little information and some simply clam up. That’s human behavior for you. The same would apply to COVID-19, so be forewarned. Siri and Alexa are always listening, awaiting your request for safety recalls for food or toys. In fact, the only time they aren’t awaiting your command is when they are locked down, and I don’t mean locked down as we are in our homes. I mean off, unplugged. No AC, no DC. And don’t forget that smartphones, smart TVs and refrigerators, security systems, GPS systems and bluetooth connections can spread what comes out of your mouth, too — and AI speaks more than one language, and closed-circuit TV and cameras have ears. Now let’s turn to privacy and politics. The popular website WebMD recently reported this projection from Crystal Watson, a senior scholar with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security: “There are currently around 30,000 contact tracers  That might sound like not much, but it’s better than what it was at the start of this national emergency, when there were only 2,200 trained contact tracers in state health departments around the United States.” Understand, where governors, legislatures, mayors and town councils were once berating the Trump administration for shortages of masks, ventilators, hand sanitizer and toilet paper, they are now pressing to hire contact tracing and train their bureaucracies. Ms. Watson, again by way of example, estimated that states will need at least 100,000 workers trained in contact tracing. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said Tuesday morning that the city will have an estimated 200 contact tracers by June 1 and the response has been “tremendous.” The political and economic price tags for contact tracing are immeasurable at this junction, even though we won’t hit the polls until November. However, it’s safe to say our privacy won’t be the No. 1 concern with regard to technology, training, hiring and oversight. Politicians have yet to disclose how they will keep personal information of test results, contact tracing and treatment out of the hands of hackers, jerks, fly-by-night researchers and blackmailers. The issue begs the privacy question.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: Tennessee is reopening and it cannot come soon enough. In fact, I wish it would have come a whole lot sooner. More than a month ago I said as much in a letter I sent to our governor. I requested he lift these restrictions immediately for the good of all Tennesseans. Small businesses are faced with the prospect of closing for good. Workers are growing uncertain if they can support their families. We are losing millions in economic output. It’s all being inflicted unconstitutionally, with no regard to balanced distribution of power outlined in the Tennessee Constitution. And it has to stop. In my letter, I pleaded with the governor to end his stay-at-home orders because of the “destruction” on Tennessee’s economy, businesses and the men and women in the workforce. Not only does it impact us financially, but the mental health of our citizens is suffering as well with an increased rate of suicide — one week resulting in more deaths to suicide in Tennessee than to COVID-19. The data and medical research we’re now seeing no longer supports a shutdown, so it’s time to act. TOP STORIES

                               I am not just saying this for myself. It is what my constituents want. I know, I asked them. Among nearly 9,000 people I polled on Facebook on April 13, 55 percent told me they were in favor of lifting the restrictions imposed by the governor’s executive order. People are justifiably worried both about getting sick and being out of work. But there are reasonable precautions we all can take to prevent ourselves and others from getting sick. There is no way to prevent yourself from losing your job when you are stuck at home and your company is idle. I also do not think the governor had the legal authority to invoke an order that closed businesses, dictated Tennesseans’ health care decisions and prohibited people from exercising their right to gather. And, as an attorney who knows firsthand the importance of constitutional governance, it worries me just as much as the other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.  I am a Tennessee licensed attorney. I have been in practice for 30 years and have served as an assistant attorney general and an assistant district attorney general. I am also a former federal judicial law clerk. I have studied this. The governor claims he acted under the 2010 “Emergency Management Powers” afforded to him in Tennessee law. That law did grant him powers, but the state legislature did so unconstitutionally in giving the governor legislative powers in times of emergency. When it comes to the distribution of powers between the legislative, executive and judicial departments of state, the Tennessee Constitution is quite clear: “No person or persons belonging to one of these departments shall exercise any of the powers properly belonging to either of the others, except in the cases herein directed or permitted.” Nowhere in the state constitution do I see it directed or permitted for the state legislature to hand its power to the governor in a time of emergency. But beyond that, much like the U.S. Constitution, the Tennessee Constitution is premised upon the protection of unalienable individual rights that exist with or without government. This is clearly unconstitutional.  Along with my letter to the governor, I have also sent a letter to the state attorney general outlining my concerns. We need to be cautious and responsible during this time when it comes to the COVID-19 but also when it comes to our liberties. We cannot sit idly by. • Bruce Griffey is a member of the Tennessee House of Representatives and represents District 75.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: Just in case we needed a reminder, the debate over the desirability and duration of stay-at home orders during the current coronavirus pandemic has exposed the uncomfortable relationship that exists between science and democracy. Science points in the direction of the rule of the expert while democracy is rooted in the principle of popular sovereignty. While the American people and scientists have competing claims to rule (popular consent vs. scientific knowledge), each actually needs the other to survive peaceably and comfortably, so neither can afford to completely discredit or abandon the other. Modern, rights-oriented democracies like the United States desire much of what science has to offer, including a real shot at comfortable preservation for the many and not just for the few. There are good reasons, then, for democracies to be perplexed when it comes to the relationship they should seek with persons who have mastered the physical and natural sciences.   TOP STORIES

                               The tension between competing claims to rule based on popular consent on the one side, and scientific knowledge on the other side, only came to a head once the democratic model of government was shown to be defensible, principally by the Founding generation in the United States. Living with the tension between democracy and science in a responsible way requires that we distinguish the respective spheres within which “political” reasoning and “scientific” reasoning should prevail. This is easier asserted than accomplished, but doing this intelligently is critical to having a decent and competent democratic nation. One major distinction between the realm of politics and the scientific realm is that the political arena is dominated by matters that are fundamentally variable, something that is not true in the realm of science. Additionally, political decision-makers by definition are persons of practical action who are expected to deliberate and issue commands whereas scientists are not obligated to take action or issue commands. Political officials who are reputed to be “prudent” are persons who excel at adjusting policies to changing circumstances, including changing public opinions, and who recognize that “contingency” is a characteristic of political life. The prudent decision-maker understands that promoting the common good requires the continuous adjustment of a complex array of matters (e.g., political, economic, cultural, etc.) that are highly variable in nature.   The most esteemed political decision-makers are persons who are adept at adjusting policies in such a way as to promote what is good for human beings, which requires a recognition that some ways of behaving and conducting human affairs are better than other ways. Knowledge of this kind benefits more from good intuition and extensive experience than from the mastery of some body of scientific knowledge.  Admittedly, national and state officials who seek to act prudently need the knowledge that scientists possess in order to give people a good shot at enjoying the full benefits of living in a modern, right-oriented democracy. Political decision-making, however, ultimately should prevail in a democracy over the knowledge of scientists when it comes to matters bearing on the quality of life of the people, for example, deciding whether churches provide “essential” services. A political community that abdicates decision-making to experts on fundamental issues related to the way of life of the people is no longer a democratic community. Additionally, the kind of knowledge required to make intelligent decisions about what constitutes a healthy life for human beings (e.g., risk taking as community service and as a source of personal distinction) transcends the realm of purely scientific knowledge in the direction of morality. While good scientific knowledge may help when it comes to knowing how to survive, the consummate political knowledge of a George Washington or Winston Churchill makes survival with dignity possible. Consider how Founding-era Americans distinguished themselves for all time by following the prudent counsel of Washington and James Madison.  All of this accentuates the enormous responsibilities that fall to the people in a democracy. Nurturing a citizenry that is up to the task of selecting persons for public office who are capable of deliberating and acting prudently when it comes to the common good is enormously difficult. It was among the greatest challenges facing the Founders.   Carrying out this task well requires that citizens appreciate the extremely complex decision-making that is required to protect, restrain and/or balance diverse religious, racial, ethnic, economic and political interests, while also recognizing that political decision-making at its best should satisfy human longings that transcend creature comforts and mere survival. Despite the protestations of many journalists and political pundits, nothing about all of this is easy. Preserving the integrity and vitality of the nation during the COVID-19 pandemic will require that the American people possess the knowledge and the courage to insist on a prudential relationship between science and politics that preserves the democratic bona fides of our constitutional republic and also points us in the direction of rational, dignified existence — an existence that requires the discipline to control our fears and face adversity with the dignity appropriate to a free people — at this point, we have left the realm of scientific knowledge.      • David Marion is Elliott Emeritus Professor of Government and a faculty fellow at the Wilson Center for Leadership in the Public Interest at Hampden-Sydney College.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: The Trump administration issued new guidance this past week for religious institutions, calling churches and other places of worship “essential” institutions. Some critics have characterized the move as “siding with” churches, arguing that the decision was simply a political move to energize his base. But these critics have to answer two questions if they expect to be taken seriously. First, where is their outrage for other institutions that have been deemed “essential,” ranging from marijuana dispensaries to abortion clinics? Second, given that some exposure to risk is inevitable, why does reopening religious institutions under the appropriate guidelines pose a systematically larger risk? We take risks all the time — whether it’s driving in a car or getting take-out from a restaurant. So the mere presence of risk cannot be a deal breaker unless we want to get stuck in a constant paralysis of physical nihilism. Before unpacking these two important questions, it’s useful to take stock of the contribution that religious institutions play in the economy and, more broadly, society at large.

                               There is a large established scientific literature documenting that religious affiliation has played a major role in society, including the United States. Substantial empirical evidence exists linking religion with not only prosocial behavior (e.g., generosity and volunteerism), but also much lower risk with a wide array of deleterious outcomes, ranging from suicide to drug and alcohol abuse. These results that religion serves as a protective factor against many traumatic events throughout life hold across many different statistical samples and studies: Roughly 80 percent of studies on religion and spirituality finding a positive relationship between religion and measures of psychological well-being. In fact, not that the Great Recession of 2008-09 is a perfect analogue, but my recent research also shows that active Christians — those participating in a faith community and view faith as important for their daily life — were not only more likely to report that they were thriving and satisfied with their life overall, but also insensitive to local fluctuations in economy activity that depressed others’ self-reported well-being. Importantly, these results did not hold for those who simply answer the survey question saying that they ascribed to a particular faith — the protective effect of religion during the 2008 to 2017 period held only for those engaged with their church community. Admittedly, those ascribing to a secular worldview might interpret religion as a crutch that gives people false hope during crises. While that’s an important discussion to have, it’s beyond my pay grade. Rather, what is clear from the empirical literature is that religion is unambiguously linked with a wide array of measures of well-being and mental health, which is especially important during times of crisis.  Given the declines in mental health and rise in suicides over the course of the pandemic, and the large empirical literature that causally links these outcomes with economic declines, this isn’t just a debate for religious scholars to theorize over — it’s a public policy question and priority. Now, critics have argued that allowing for the reopening of houses of worship will pose unnecessary risk for the public health recovery. But the fact that there are such heterogeneous views here shouldn’t come as a surprise given that perceptions of policy actions during the COVID-19 pandemic have been best explained by political affiliation, rather than standard economic metrics. If these critics want to be taken seriously, why is it that they have said nothing about the many other institutions that have remained open in most states during the pandemic, such as marijuana dispensaries and abortion clinics? Given the obvious concerns with both of these, it is peculiar to say the least that ardent critics of the president have not raised their voice over these other “essential services.” Moreover, whether religious institutions pose a systematically greater risk to the spread of the virus is an open question. My recent research here shows that counties with greater social capital — which generally refers to levels of trust, shared norms, and relationships — had not only lower infection rates of COVID-19, but also lower growth rates in the spread of the virus.  Given that religious affiliation is one of the most important determinants of social capital, it seems likely that most religious institutions would be less likely to spread the virus, especially if the CDC guidelines are followed. Even Dr. Anthony Fauci has pointed out that the risk is not binary: “how you approach what you do in houses of worship really varies.” This means that each state and house of worship can apply the guidelines based on their own unique risk profile. While some might view President Trump’s decision as a political move, what matters to all of us is getting our country back to full health and economic dynamism. The empirical evidence here suggests that religious institutions are of central importance of human flourishing and unlikely to accelerate the spread or return of the virus. Haters are going to hate, but hopefully they can be more consistent. • Christos A.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: I see a war has broken out even as we talk of opening up our states’ economies. Perhaps I am overly-sensitive, but I get the feeling that there is serious disagreement between those who insist on covering their bodies to prevent the spread of the Wuhan virus and those who are taking their chances. The chance-takers wear no masks, no shields, no gloves, and absolutely never don one of those all-covering, full-body protective outfits that leave one looking like an astronaut in the Bulgarian space program. The full-coverage crowd I call the prophylactic wearers. The non-coverage crowd I call, well, I call them the non-coverage crowd.   Now in this battle over what protective attire is to be worn in public I intend to remain absolutely neutral. So far as I have been able to ascertain no one, neither among the prophylactic wearers nor among the non-coverage crowd, has taken me seriously on the one constructive recommendation that I have made during this crisis.  TOP STORIES

                               I suggested early on when Dr. Anthony Fauci and the pulchritudinous Dr. Deborah Birx were earnestly urging us to wash our hands after every possible exposure to the virus we go all the way. I suggested that we wash our hands and our feet. Possibly even blow your nose. Thus far I have heard nothing not even from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, not even from the Dial soap manufacturers. Nada from the handkerchief manufacturers.  Thus, I am staying out of the to-cover or not-to-cover controversy. In fact, I am staying home. I have undertaken a book assignment, and I am perhaps the only person who has not been in the least discommoded by the public health authorities of late with the possible exception of the president’s former lawyer Michael Cohen and his former campaign manager Paul Manafort. Both men have been released from prison because of the crisis and are finishing their sentences in the comfort of their own homes. I hope they at least will wash their hands and feet. What else do they have to do? Yet friends tell me it is getting pretty acrimonious out there in the grocery stores and the pharmacies, where both sides in the protective-attire battles are purchasing supplies. A lady told me the other day that she could not tell which side was more warlike. Both sides yelled at her when she stepped into the wrong lane.  These battles remind me of a coinage by the great Tom Wolfe. He coined the term “Championism” in his 2004 novel, “I Am Charlotte Simmons.” According to Tom, people suffer the “real emotions” of “exultation” or “depression” over the fate of those they deem their champions. They usually do not even know much about their champions, but by gum they are completely committed to him. They may have simply walked into a room and seen one team competing with another. Almost inadvertently they just find themselves pulling for that one team. They lose all sense of perspective because of “championism.” Now, as the battle lines are drawn between the prophylactic wearers and the non-coverage crowd, the political commentators will tell you it is all politics. The members of the non-coverage crowd are following the cues from our frolicsome, good-natured president, Donald Trump. The prophylactic wearers are serious, sober, followers of Dr. Fauci and the pulchritudinous Dr. Birx. Well, maybe they are. But allow me to add another thought. How about allowing a literary mind to have his say in the cacophony created by the voices of science and the political voices. There are among the millions of people dressed like they are ready for Halloween and the millions more dressed like normal human beings in an admittedly abnormal era those other citizens. The ones Tom Wolfe talked about. The ones who suffer from “championism.”  They are the people who walked through a room, saw a commentator shouting about COVID-19, and immediately went out and purchased a mask and gloves, and shield. There are others who were more relaxed. Possibly they left the room and purchased suntan lotion. Both sides are suffering the “exultation” or the “depression” of “championism.” The fact is, it seems to me, that not many people understand the Wuhan virus. So, go easy on each other, and as for me I am staying home, not because of a virus from China but because of a deadline. • R.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: Beware the contact tracing. The government wants it believed contact tracing is nothing but a simple friendly means of making sure Americans are protected from COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, both now and in the future, via testing, monitoring and providing necessary medical equipment and, in some cases, with supporting with quarantining. But there’s nothing friendly about it. Contact tracing is a frightening tracking and surveillance program that gives government near-total control of citizens. It’s billed as voluntary. But those who decline to participate are subject to legal enforcement at the hands of government. TOP STORIES

                               And on that last: That’s not opinion. That’s fact. That’s the government’s own language. Here’s the run-down of what’s coming on the heels of the coronavirus crisis — the “new normal,” as the health bureaucrats and left-leaning control freaks like to call it. First, the definition: Contact tracing is, at the root, a means of tracing where you’ve been and whom you’ve come into contact with, so as to give health professionals the knowledge they need to contain a disease’s spread. Sounds sensible, yes? Even by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s own definition, contact tracing sounds sensible. The CDC calls it a “core disease control measure employed by state and local health officials,” one that’s been employed, in fact, “for decades,” and one that’s decidedly a “key strategy to prevent the spread of COVID-19.” OK to that. But there’s a decided difference between self-reporting and with going where the government wants to go on this. This is where it veers off America’s course straight into communist country. On the CDC’s “Coronavirus Disease” webpage, “Principles of Contact Tracing,” is a section titled, “Social services and housing will be needed for contacts unable to separate themselves from others in their current living situation.” The section opens with this: “Separating contacts from people who are not exposed is critical to the success of any contact tracing effort and requires social supports for individual compliance and medical monitoring.” It goes on with this: “If possible, contacts should be asked to voluntarily stay home, monitor themselves and maintain social distancing from others.” And it finishes with this: “However, health departments have the authority to issue legal orders of quarantine, should the situation warrant that measure.” Disobey the government’s recommendation to quarantine — and the government has the authority to force a quarantine. How? By “legal orders.” How will those legal orders be enforced? Good question. The CDC, in that same section, gives clues: “Support services for consideration include but may not be limited to housing. …” Here comes the government, with some handy-dandy housing for quarantined individuals — just the kind of housing the could come in handy for those who either don’t have the means to self-quarantine, or who’ve been handed a “legal order” to quarantine. Oh, pishaw. This is America, land of the free — land of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA Act, with all its patient privacies and protections, right? That’s what H.R. 6666, the COVID-19 Testing, Reaching And Contacting Everyone Act, or TRACE Act, from Rep. Bobby Rush, Illinois Democrat, would have believed, anyway. H.R. 6666 calls for $100 billion to be spent in fiscal 2020 to “award grants to eligible entities to conduct diagnostic testing for COVID-19, to trace and monitor the contacts of infected individuals, and to support the quarantine of such contacts through mobile health units” and “as necessary, testing individuals and providing individuals with services related to testing and quarantine at their residences,” according to the text of the bill. And it makes clear that nothing in the bill would violate Americans’ health privacies and rights to choose — or, rights to refuse. That’s bunk. Government at your door? Government at your door to monitor COVID-19 patients? Government at your door to quarantine citizens? The “eligible entities” who get the $100 billion to do all this testing include medical professionals, nonprofit officials, and health people tied to public schools, high schools, colleges and other places of higher learning. Oh, and “any other” source deemed acceptable by the secretary of Health and Human Services, working with the director of the CDC. Count on this: Your children, tested, at school, for COVID-19 — or, for any other transmissible disease to come in the future that’s deemed a danger by federal, state and local health wonks. Back to the CDC COVID-19 contact tracing page. “Communities need a large number of trained contact tracers,” CDC reports. “The time to start building the trained workforce is now.” Johns Hopkins just released a training course for would-be contact tracers — and given all the folk put out of work by government stay-at-home orders, no doubt, there are a lot these would-be’s out there. And as Eagle Forum reported, some of the language put forth in this training is concerning at best, outright frightening at worst. In a section about dealing with the issue of autonomy and the right of the patient-slash-citizen to choose his or her own health care, the Johns Hopkins training video goes like this: “[E]ach person can make their own decisions. This is true unless the decisions they make or the things they do can harm someone else. And we all know that this is true. And in the case of contact tracing, it means that people can make their own decisions. But if they’re not isolating themselves or not quarantining themselves, that could harm someone else. It does put other people at risk so they do have some limits on their autonomy, or their ability to make their own decisions within the context of contact tracing.” In other words: Participate — or be deemed a hazard to health. And those who are deemed hazards to health are obviously incapable of making their own decisions. So the government must make those decisions for them. See the threats to individual freedoms here? What a tangled web that’s woven. The CDC puts out advisements and guidance. The Democrats in Congress put out the funding mechanism to carry out these same advisements and guidance. Johns Hopkins puts out the training guidelines for those hired to carry out those federal advisements and guidance. The states and localities carry the water from there. By the time the advisements and guidance come knocking on citizens’ doors — they’re in the form of orders and mandates. Don’t we already have that example in modern-day COVID-19 times, where the federal government, meaning the White House, recommends one thing, but states, meaning the governors, then take it to executive order extremes and make those recommendations into mandates? Yes, yes we do. But the CDC, Rush and his bill cosponsors, Johns Hopkins, and all the contact tracing partners at the state and local levels of government get to maintain plausible deniability on force. They all get to pretend that participation in contact tracing is voluntary — and that the only citizens who would refuse to volunteer are the citizens who are unable to make their own decisions due to some sort of psychological issue that could cause harm to self or others. It’s an utterly frightening government takeover of Americans’ freedoms, of citizens’ individual rights. Now add technology to contact tracing — and feel the real chill. Again, from the CDC’s own site: “Case investigation, contact tracing and contact follow-up and monitoring will need to be linked with timely testing, clinical services and agile data management systems to facilitate real-time electronic transmission of laboratory and case data for public health action.” Real-time data collection. Real-time public health action. How’s the government going to do that? The CDC is pushing for “proximity tracking” — “tools that use Bluetooth or GPS to track an individual’s exposure to cases.” That’s bureau-speak for government surveillance and tracking of individuals, in real-time. In smartphone time. In smartphone app times. What a surveillance society that’ll be. It’ll give government the power to see where the paths of COVID-19 patients cross with the paths of those who don’t have COVID-19; to alert those who don’t have COVID-19 of the paths they just crossed with those who have COVID-19; to go to the homes of those who were exposed to COVID-19 and test them, and monitor them, and quarantine them. And if need be, to get a legal order to quarantine them. Welcome to the “new normal” the left wants for America — a country of communist collectivism and total government control. Resist now, or forever our freedoms will vanish. • Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley. Listen to her podcast “Bold and Blunt” by clicking HERE.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: Writing and making public one’s opinions guarantees people will respond. Writers, performers and every human likely desire his or her thoughts, and even their life, to matter to others. The alternative is to become hermits. Like other opinion writers, I get my share of positive and negative letters, but during the Trump administration the level of invective for those questioning anything the president says seems to have become more intense. President Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are in a verbal battle that resembles schoolyard behavior I recall as a child: “Your mother wears combat boots,” said one kid. “Oh yeah, well your mother is (something I can’t print).” Fisticuffs or shoving soon followed before a teacher broke it up.

                               Mrs. Pelosi recently said the president has “doggy-doo on his shoes.” The president responded that the speaker has “mental problems.” He’s said worse about her, but it’s hard to imagine she could top (or bottom) the “doggy-doo” remark. Many people have written in response to my column last week on the danger of promoting hydroxychloroquine when the FDA, NIH and experienced physicians have said it is not recommended for prevention or treatment of COVID-19. Mr. Trump said he has taken the drug for two weeks to protect himself. I wrote that I recalled the number of snake oil salesmen who have been part of a history of medical quackery. While saying the president is not one of those, some readers took more than offense at what they considered the link and they let me know it. Some sent “proof” that the drug is effective for treating the coronavirus, but many of their sources lacked credibility. They ignored the sources I mentioned. I was called “stupid” and an “idiot” (is there a difference?) for daring to question the president’s repeated endorsement of the drug. One emailer said by writing that one column I had lost “all credibility.” I wonder if, after a very long career in journalism, there was ever a time when the writer believed I had credibility? Name-calling has become common in the Internet age and 24/7 news cycle. Increasingly, people read, or tune into, only those things that reinforce their beliefs. This is as dangerous as eating an unbalanced diet. Calling someone names does nothing to advance an argument. Debate is better, but that, too, seems to be on the endangered species list. A clever insult is far better than name-calling. A long-ago comment by a long-forgotten congressman about a colleague remains one of my favorite insults: “I have a minimum high regard for the gentleman.” The best response to an insult, though, is an ancient one: “A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger” (Proverbs 15:1). I tried that one on a recent correspondent and she apologized for the words she used. That created a dialogue, rather than a hostile confrontation and we were able to exchange views in a civil manner. No one I know has ever had his or her mind changed in response to incivility. My grandmother once threatened to “wash my mouth out with soap” if I even dared to say anything that violated her sense of decorum. That had a deterrent effect on me. Perhaps, if I were to give into my lower nature, I would respond to insults by saying that if they are writing me they aren’t writing ransom notes, but that would be uncivil and the ghost of my grandmother might return with a bar of soap in hand. • Cal Thomas, a nationally syndicated columnist, is the author of “America’s Expiration Date: The Fall of Empires, Superpowers and the United States” (HarperCollins/Zondervan, January 2020).

ANALYSIS/OPINION: The economy is in more dire straits than Washington politicians behave, and they need to put aside their partisan agendas and fencing on Twitter to save it. The Labor Department reported 20 million jobs lost in April, raising unemployment to 14.7 percent, and government statisticians believe the chaos caused serious undercounting. Adding idled workers still receiving payments from employers but incorrectly classified as employed, and those shut in, unable to look for work and hence not counted in the labor force, the jobless rate jumps to 23.5 percent. The survey was conducted in mid-April, but millions more filed for unemployment benefits during the weeks that followed, putting the real unemployment rate well above the 24.9 percent Great Depression peak.

                               Most visible are lost jobs in restaurants, airlines, non-emergency health care and entertainment, but a second wave is unfolding along the supply chain. For example, Boeing and GE’s aircraft engine division are girding for depressed air travel for several years, and cleaners, caterers, other business and child care services are losing customers. Half of small businesses may be closed permanently, and two in five displaced workers will never return to former jobs. Many newspapers are suffocating from lost ad revenue. Both political parties have been eager to exploit the crisis to stuff their long-term ideological agendas into stimulus packages — such as lopsided rules favoring unions for Democrats and tax breaks often favored by Republicans. Aid is arriving too late and with too many strings for quick distribution. Means testing slowed stimulus checks, and onerous bureaucratic conditions forced many small businesses to pass on grants and loans. All the bickering and bargaining delays the fire brigade while the economy is burning. The latest is the $500 billion in fiscal assistance requested by state governors. House Democrats painstakingly wasted time drafting a $3 trillion bill that includes sweet spots rich in Democratic votes and will result in weeks of wrangling with Senate Republicans. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell warns no bill gets past the Senate without tort reform. President Trump wants aid tied to sanctuary city policies. A package will emerge because neither party wants to bear blame for draconian school spending cuts but not before a lot more carnage in the economy. Earlier relief packages sent $150 billion to the states, but most of that was for extraordinary COVID-19 expenses. The recession has cost the states and municipal governments at least $270 billion in lost sales and income tax revenues, as well as from excise taxes on theater tickets, hotels and other services. Municipalities are cutting back on garbage collection and other basic health and safety services. State and local governments have shed 1 million workers — and that’s before they finally come to terms with slashing budgets for the second half of this year and next. State and local governments still employ 19 million — more than manufacturing and construction combined. To avoid Armageddon, Congress should quickly pass a plain vanilla $500 billion aid package and let the governors sort it.     Instead, as with the $3 trillion in packages that sent payments to households, small businesses, the airlines and others, Congress and the administration will burden the bill with lots of conditions and politically targeted complexity, the money will arrive too late to save millions of jobs. The public schools — trying terribly hard to protect students, faculty and staff by relying more on digital learning solutions — simply won’t have the cash needed to function effectively. The governors have given conservative lawmakers and Mr. Trump good cause to stiff them. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo faced down President Trump regarding authority to reopen New York’s economy and formed a coalition of Northeastern states but is now calling for an active federal partner in Washington to address his state’s financial problems. Gov. Gavin Newsom has repeatedly asserted California is a nation state. Fine, let Sacramento borrow in the bond market and raise taxes further, and see what that does to its credit rating and how many folks with professional skills — other than tech magnates residing in gated estates — still want to live in his paradise for the homeless and illegal immigrants. As for Mr. McConnell, it’s the pique of indifference to suggest that states and municipalities look to bankruptcy and higher taxes. States are as critical to the national economy, and nothing would slow solutions more than a trip through creditor reorganization, litigation and more taxes. Responsibility for the national economy still resides along Pennsylvania Avenue between the Oval Office and Capitol Dome. • Peter Morici is an economist and business professor at the University of Maryland, and a national columnist.  Manage Newsletters Copyright © 2020 The Washington Times, LLC.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: Great plagues have changed the course of history. Best known is the Black Death (1347-51), introduced to Europe from Asia through trade routes, carried by rats and transmitted by fleas.  This bubonic plague killed up to one-third to one-half of the population of Europe, almost literally burying the old social order that was medieval feudalism, wiping the slate clean for the rise of mercantilism, the Age of Exploration and the Renaissance.

                               Lesser known is the Antonine Plague (165-180 A.D.), introduced to the Roman Empire through trade with Asia, probably the measles or smallpox. The Antonine Plague, according to contemporary accounts, caused 2,000 deaths daily in Rome, an estimated 5 million deaths throughout the Empire, and devastated the Roman legions, hampering defense of the eastern and northern frontiers.  According to Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, for whom the plague is named, writing from his camp on the Rhine: “With their ranks thinned by the epidemic, Roman armies were now unable to push the tribes back.” (Macromannic Wars) The Plague of Justinian (541-542 A.D.), introduced to the Mediterranean and Europe from Asia, is one of the deadliest plagues in history, possibly the bubonic plague and rehearsal for the later Black Death. An estimated 25 million to 100 million died, perhaps as much as half the population of Europe. Byzantine historian Procopius, who eyewitnessed the Plague of Justinian, reports that in the capital, Constantinople, 10,000 died daily. He bitterly criticized Emperor Justinian for making matters worse with oppressive taxation, indifferent to the plague’s economic devastation: “When pestilence swept through the whole known world and notably the Roman Empire, wiping out most of the farming community and of necessity leaving a trail of devastation in its wake, Justinian showed no mercy towards the ruined freeholders. Even then, he did not refrain from demanding the annual tax, not only the amount at which he assessed every individual, but also the amount for which his deceased neighbors were liable.” (Procopius, Anekdota 558 A.D.)  The Plague of Justinian is one of the most consequential in history — preventing resurrection of a reunited Roman Empire: “The plague’s long-term effects on European and Christian history were enormous … The plague weakened the Byzantine Empire at a critical point, when Justinian’s armies had nearly retaken all of Italy and the western Mediterranean … the evolving conquest would have reunited the core of the Western Roman Empire with the Eastern Roman Empire.” (Cyril Mango, “Byzantium: The Empire of New Rome,” 1980) The plague buried the last chance for continuity of classical civilization in Western Europe, bringing on the Dark Ages. Perhaps the deadliest, most consequential, and most tragic plague in history has no name.  In the three centuries (1500-1800) after Columbus discovered America, European diseases, including smallpox and measles, to which Native American populations had no immunity, spread like wildfire through the New World, from Tierra del Fuego in the South to the Arctic Circle, killing 90 percent or more, emptying the continents of their original peoples. Happily, the coronavirus is proving far less deadly than the great plagues of history, with a mortality rate continually being revised downward, now much less than 1 percent. Coronavirus hardly deserves to be described as a plague at all. Nonetheless, the unprecedented reaction, many would say overreaction, of U.S. and allied governments — to contain the coronavirus by mass social isolation and suspending all but the most essential economic activity — may well have catastrophic consequences for Western Civilization. In three months, the U.S. economy has gone from being the most prosperous in history into a deepening New Great Depression from which there may be no quick recovery. More than 39 million Americans are unemployed, some 15 percent of the workforce, eclipsing the worst of the 1930s Great Depression. $6 trillion in new debt has been added, virtually overnight, by U.S. government spending on so-called “coronavirus recovery” to mitigate the disastrous effects of government-imposed unemployment and small-business closures. White House hopes for quick recovery sound like socialist fantasies about the miraculous power of government economic planning, not free market realism.  Government can strangle the “golden goose” but not force its corpse to lay eggs, as the Emperor Justinian discovered. Defense Secretary Mark Esper no longer talks about defense increases, but instead hopes for “flat” future defense budgets. But a New Great Depression means deep defense cuts, sharp decline of U.S. military power and a more dangerous world. The Pentagon needs to re-focus priorities on defense investments that buy the most security at the least cost. For example, space-based missile defense can shield America from growing nuclear and hypersonic missile threats in just five years for $20 billion. EMP and cyber-protection of electric grids and life-sustaining critical infrastructures can be achieved without spending defense dollars. The coronavirus New Great Depression may be our Plague of Justinian. It happens just when President Trump was rebuilding economic and military strength possibly capable of sustaining the post-1945 world order led by the United States — call it “Pax Americana.” Now, saving Pax Americana may be as unrealistic as Justinian’s hopes to resurrect the Roman Empire. As Justinian learned, when there is no money to pay the legions, the barbarians win. • Peter Vincent Pry, director of the Task Force on National and Homeland Security, served as chief of staff on the Congressional EMP Commission, and on the staffs of the House Armed Service Committee and the CIA.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: Good news (please see the accompanying table)! If you are under 65, in reasonably good health and do not have a vitamin D deficiency, you have only a tiny chance of dying from COVID-19. And if you are younger than 34, your chances of dying from the virus are so small as to be almost statistically undetectable. On the other hand, if you are 85 or older, are in a nursing home, have serious health problems and a vitamin D deficiency, you may be in real danger if you are exposed to the virus — but only a tiny portion of the population is in such a condition. The U.S. population is about 330 million, and the number of people who die each year from all causes is about 2.85 million or a bit less than 1 percent. To date, less than 100,000 people in the United States have died from COVID-19 or three-hundreds of 1 percent. (The peak in deaths appears to have already occurred but even if the number of deaths doubles from the current level, which is most unlikely, the total will be well under one-tenth of 1 percent).

                               Political leaders have shut down much of the world economy on the basis of bad information and the failure to ask the right questions. Any action to try to stop the spread of the virus should have been accompanied with a competent estimate of how many net lives would be saved by the action.  Net lives means how many people would die from COVID-19 compared to all of the additional lives lost through delayed diagnoses and treatments of cancer, heart disease and all other ailments due to the COVID-19 shutdown. The number of additional suicides and the misery of losing tens of thousands of small businesses, and the loss of liberty also needed to be factored in. Very little of any of that was done. Early in the year, the leaders of the World Health Organization (WHO) said the virus was unlikely to be transmitted from human to human (given its animal origin) and probably would not be a big threat. It soon became apparent that WHO had been wrong, and the threat was real. The folks at WHO were soon exposed as Chinese puppets — Communists lying? Who would have thought? A group out of Imperial College in the U.K., promoted a model that forecast 2 million or so deaths in the U.S. and millions elsewhere from the virus. This caused panic among the medical, political and media elites, which resulted in the worldwide shutdown. The model turned out to be deeply flawed, overstating the likely death toll by over 20-fold (aka gross incompetence, or worse). The fraudulent model was neither closely examined initially, nor rejected because it served certain political and media interests. Political opponents of President Trump were quick to blame him for not acting quickly enough, while ignoring the fact that when he shut down China travel on Jan. 31, they had criticized him for overreacting.  The media loved the story because fear sells newspapers and increases TV ratings, and they could blame it on the hated Mr. Trump. But as is typical with the many in the media, they did not think beyond stage I, and as the economy was needlessly sent into the tank, advertisers withdrew. Circulation and ratings may be up, but fewer advertisers are paying the freight, so many of those who promoted the panic are and will be losing their jobs. Ah, divine justice. Serious scholars, like Professor Anne Marie Knott of Washington University in St. Louis, a mathematician who also understands economics, has prepared a very clear short presentation, “Why you haven’t caught COVID-19,” explaining how the data demonstrates that most people, especially the young, will never contract the virus and for those who do, most will have a totally benign or mild reaction. Her presentation may be found on YouTube at: Anne Marie Knott: Why you haven’t caught COVID-19. Again, the only real danger is for a very small percentage of people over 65, except for those 85 and older, who have other serious problems. Ms. Knott’s analysis clearly shows that the costs of the shutdown are greatly exceeding the benefits. Mr. Trump, the political leaders in both parties, and particularly the mainstream media were too easily seduced by well-meaning “experts” like Dr. Anthony Fauci. Most of the medical experts, understandably, have a very narrow focus and do not fully consider total costs and benefits of their recommendations and actions. Now that we have sufficient global data and “petri dish” experiments (from U.S. Navy and commercial cruise ships that were quarantined for more than 14 days) to understand the real risks to various groups) there is no longer justification for most restrictions on those under 65. Resources should be concentrated on the elderly with underlying conditions — and the rest of humanity should be allowed to go free and resume normal lives. • Richard W.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: Did you hear the good news? Liberty University, which the media predicted would be Ground Zero  for a deadly outbreak of coronavirus, has not reported a single  on-campus case. Not one. This is welcome news to any person of goodwill. But not to the press. TOP STORIES

                               In March, the media went bat crazy, essentially accusing Liberty  President Jerry Falwell Jr. of risking mass murder by welcoming some  students back from spring break. The New York Times headline on March 29 was “Liberty University Brings Back Its Students, and Coronavirus, Too.” No, it did not. Most students stayed home. Mr. Falwell welcomed back  to the dorms those students who would have put themselves more at risk  by traveling, especially those from overseas. The college followed  strict health guidelines such as social distancing, and recommended that  students use online programs. On March 30, The Washington Post ran an editorial, “Irresponsible  decisions like Jerry Falwell Jr.’s put untold numbers of people at  risk.” The Post cited The New York Times’ contention that about a dozen  Liberty students “were sick with symptoms that suggested COVID-19.” It turns out that the students had common colds or the flu or  something other than COVID-19. Only one student tested positive, and he  was living off-campus. Several other universities, such as Rutgers, Pepperdine, Valencia and  Texas A&M, introduced similar policies, but only Liberty was  singled out for a press whipping. Well, why not? The media have hated the college since 1971, when  Moral Majority founder Jerry Falwell Sr. established it to give  Christians an alternative to “mainstream” academia. The sad truth is  that most colleges have morphed into Marxist hothouses where U.S.  history courses have given way to transgender studies, multiculturalism  and identity politics, and where students learn to despise their  country. Liberty offers a traditional curriculum, attracting students from all  over the United States and abroad, making it one of the largest private  universities in America. With 15,000 students on campus and 100,000  students online, Jerry Falwell’s dream has become a nightmare for the  progressive left. Added to the mix is Jerry Falwell Jr.’s outspoken support of  President Trump, before and after his election. Mr. Trump was Liberty’s  commencement speaker in 2017. On the other hand, Mr. Falwell’s sometimes  Trump-like retorts to critics may indicate that the New York wise guy  could be influencing Mr. Falwell more than the other way around. But we can’t get into either man’s head and see their actual mindset. Unlike the press, that is. On May 17, Washington Post editors looked into their handy replica of  Mr. Trump’s right-hand palm, read the lines, and came up with this in  the Sunday Outlook section: “Coronavirus testing is about saving lives.  Trump thinks it’s just about numbers, says journalist Fintan O’Toole.” In the same edition, fellow soothsayer Ruth Marcus’ column was  headlined: “To Trump, winning is all that matters.” Really? He has no  other motives? And he only thinks about numbers? Well, what do you expect from a very bad man with orange hair, as  he’s depicted each week in The Post comics section by Doonesbury  cartoonist Garry Trudeau, who is hopelessly locked in a “Hate Nixon”  mode updated to the Trump era? To underscore Mr. Trump’s assumed moral turpitude, The Post (and  we’re still working on the May 17 edition here) sent reporters all the  way to West Java, Indonesia, so they could produce a two-page spread  with a big color picture of a construction site. The headline: “Trump’s  business partner digs up graves to build resort.” Perhaps this is actually newsworthy. It’s usually the Democrats who commune with the dead, especially around Election Day. Well, if the Russian collusion smear didn’t work, and the Ukraine  phone call impeachment attempt is collapsing into a Biden disaster, why  not go for guilt by association? Talk about digging for a scandal. Back on Page One, The Post accused Mr. Trump of a “retaliatory purge”  because he fired the State Department inspector general who had  apparently been more at home when Mr. Obama was in the White House. Finally, the lead editorial on May 17, “The absurd cynicism of  ‘Obamagate,’” claims that “Mr. Trump would like to rewrite history,  making it seem as though the Russian investigation lacked firm grounding  and that a sinister Obama administration plot explains the misdeeds  that his own people committed.” Why, yes, that’s where the evidence has led, with the FBI being  exposed for its persecution of Gen. Michael Flynn and its “Crossfire  Hurricane” plan to prevent or cripple the Trump presidency. If you thumbed all the way through the May 17 edition of The Post,  you would be convinced that we are in the grip of a power-mad  authoritarian president. But what a difference a day makes. On May 18, The Post’s front page had this: “Trump seems poised to let  others lead on reopening: Governors, businesses make key calls as  critics see shrinking presidency.” Shrinking presidency? Well, which is it? Is he an overreaching authoritarian or a shrinking president? Likewise, will we ever learn whether Jerry Falwell Jr. has psychic  powers like a Post writer, or was he just lucky that he was right about  the coronavirus policy? Inquiring readers may never know. • Robert Knight is a contributor to The Washington Times. His website is roberthknight.com.

ANALYSIS/OPINION: Donald Trump won the presidency by riding a wave of common sense politicking that wasn’t so much politicking as it was speaking truth to patriot power — by condemning the senseless killings of American citizens at the hands of previously deported illegals, for instance, or by calling out the Democrats in the Republican Party who were working with elitist globalists to undercut U.S. sovereignty. And since then, on Make America Great Again ideals, on America First principles, Trump hasn’t disappointed. He’s been great for the economy, great for the little business guy, great for the voices of those mocked and derided and dismissed by the previous administration. He’s been nothing short of stupendous on fighting the D.C. cabal. He’s been bold, brash and oft-braggadocio — and bluntly put, a breath of fresh air in a field of snobbish elitism. But then came the coronavirus. And the mighty Trump has stumbled, taking with him, an entire nation of suffering Americans — minus the hand-rubbing gleeful Democrats using COVID-19 to best political advantage, of course.

                               Call this is a tough love moment. But Trump is leader of the free world, and is ultimately to blame for the ravaging of the Constitution and the dire economic condition of this nation due to COVID-19. As Harry S. Truman might say — as Harry S. Truman did say — “The buck stops here.” The buck stops at the desk of the one in charge. Trump never should have practically ceded the White House stage to medical bureaucrats and scientists like Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a practical proxy for billionaire Bill “Vaccine the World” Gates, a fawning supporter of World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, or to even global health expert Deborah Birx —amicably inclined to this administration as she seems. Trump, unknowingly, diluted his own authority. The fact is doctors are fallible. Doctors are also, well, doctors. They’re not economists. They’re not small business owners. They’re not farmers. They’re not teachers. They’re not politicians. They’re not even supposed to be political, right? (Yet they are.) They’re doctors, trained in the art of giving the best doctorly advice about whatever medical issue is presented and, in this sue-happy world we call modern America, to do so in a way that relieves them of any sort of legal liability. Give a doctor a headache patient and there’s a patient headed for a battery of expensive medical tests and prescription pills, yes? Enter the coronavirus. Give a doctor a COVID-19 patient and there’s a patient headed for worst-case scenario preventive treatments. Facts and science and truths be danged. So went the advisements of Fauci and Birx and all the other medical experts who emerged from offices and dark corners to speak, with whatever authorities they could muster from their higher-university lineages of learning. Their advisements were all based on best-guessed, worst-case cautions. They ratcheted up fears to the point their advisements and cautions trickled into the states and localities as mandates and orders. They admitted what they didn’t know; they acknowledged what they couldn’t predict with accuracy. But that didn’t stop the train of executive orders and unconstitutional crackdowns on civil, individual rights from steamrolling across America. This is where Trump stumbled. Trump could’ve balanced out the White House medical fear-mongering messaging with truths about the unreliable computer modeling; with truths about the conflicted interests of cash-strapped hospitals to inflate COVID-19 cases; with truths about the comparison of this virus with others — with comparison of the political response to this virus with others. Trump could’ve brought forward entrepreneurs to the White House podium to speak of their sad stories of forced government shutdowns of their businesses; or farmers, to show the devastations of dumped dairy and destroyed crops; or fitness club owners, to tell of dashed dreams and shuttered businesses. He could’ve cited statistics on suicides and rising alcoholism. He could’ve pointed to the outrage of keeping open marijuana shops, while shutting churches — the absurdities of sending police to chase down beach-goers and arrest mask-less subway riders. He could’ve invited social services’ experts to the Rose Garden to speak on the horrible increases in child sex abuse, or domestic violence, due to forced shut-downs, due to stay-at-home mandates. He could’ve balanced out the dire doctor predictions with somber statements from economists, entrepreneurs, from civil rights attorneys and constitutional experts, from church leaders, from psychologists and mental health professionals — all who could’ve given the sort of contextual analysis that went missing from this whole fear-fueled COVID-19 political response. Trump, in short, could’ve changed the messaging. Trump could have given a national tutorial on the uses and abuses of power. He could’ve better controlled the message. He could’ve condemned the knee-jerk messaging. He could’ve been the cooler head in the room, the one giving balance and context and calm-amid-the-storm leadership. He could’ve kept the doctors on a tighter leash, behind closed doors, so the media — the Trump-hating media — couldn’t take their statements and politicize them, use them to pack the biggest political punch. He could’ve kept the medical wonks as simply voices on a team of many — on a team that provided a more balanced, nuanced look at COVID-19 and its outcomes. And he could’ve been the guy who considered all those voices, all those recommendations, all those concerns and advisements and warnings, and who took the White House stage to make clear: This is the way it will be. This is the way it will not be. He could’ve reminded, daily, the out-of-control pols that in America, rights come from God, and cannot be trampled by government at whim. And then he could’ve harped daily on the emerging failures of science to bring forth the predicted gloom and doom of COVID-19 — as proof of the logic, say, of keeping America open for business. As underscore of the need, say, of keeping intact the Constitution. “Lockdowns failed to alter course of pandemic and are now destroying millions of livelihoods worldwide, JP Morgan study claims,” The Daily Mail wrote, in a head-shakingly regretful headline, just published this week. Trump had a chance to take a headline like that and say — see? America will not cower in fear. See? America has no need to cower in fear. But he stumbled. He misstepped. He now stands as mistaken as the fear mongers on this. And yet, still, Trump deserves another chance. Trump, for the good of the country, for the fate of our nation, needs to win a second White House term — he needs to stay around a while longer and beat back the elitists and globalists and socialists and worse who are hungering for our nation’s soul. He needs to fight off the leftists who have used COVID-19 to political advantage, and who are at this very point in time plotting to use another COVID-19-like crisis for even more political advantage. But he can’t make another mistake like this. America can’t afford another COVID-19. This country won’t survive another round. He needs to use his bully pit — his Twitter feed — his White House platform and the rest to take control of the COVID-19 dialogue and force a return to more MAGA times. America needs Trump to be Trump. • Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley. Listen to her podcast “Bold and Blunt” by clicking HERE.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) on Saturday announced that New York reached the lowest number of coronavirus hospitalizations and deaths since the start of the pandemic and stated on social media that they have “crushed” the curve, adding that New York City will be entering the first phase of reopening on Monday. “We did the impossible. On Monday NYC will open phase one. We didn’t just flatten the curve — we crushed it,” Cuomo stated: We did the impossible. On Monday NYC will open phase one. We didn’t just flatten the curve — we crushed it. #NYTough — Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) June 6, 2020  The Empire State reached a significant milestone on Saturday as the governor announced the lowest number of hospitalizations and deaths since the start of the pandemic weeks ago. Total hospitalizations on Friday slipped to 2,603 “from a record-high of 18,825 during the peak of the pandemic, and 35 people in New York passed away due to COVID-19, down from a record-high of 800 just eight weeks ago,” per the governor’s website. “Our metrics are all, today, very good. We are going to open the valve more than we originally anticipated because the metrics are so good,” Cuomo said on Saturday. “Compared to where we were, this is a big sigh of relief”:  As a result of the downward trend in coronavirus metrics, places of worship — including churches, synagogues, and mosques — will be able to reopen and operate at a 25 percent capacity during the state’s second phase of reopening. “Places of worship in the seven regions that have already entered phase two – the Capital Region, Central New York, the Finger Lakes, the Mohawk Valley, the North Country, the Southern Tier and Western New York – can reopen beginning tomorrow, June 7th,” according to the state’s website. “This is an acceleration for us because we are doing so well on the metrics, but people still have to stay smart,” Cuomo said. New York City, which was hit particularly hard by the virus, is “on track” to enter into the first phase of reopening Monday, June 8, as percent of positive coronavirus tests “has dropped from a high of 57 percent per day to two percent per day within the city.” New York State reported 381,019 positive cases and 30,066 deaths as of Saturday, the majority of which stem from New York City.

June 6 (UPI) — California Gov. Gavin Newsom has declared that TV and film productions may resume in the state on Friday. The industry has been largely shut down since mid-March due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed about 108,000 people in the United States to date. Productions will be “subject to approval by county public health officers within the jurisdictions of operations following their review of local epidemiological data including cases per 100,000 population, rate of test positivity, and local preparedness to support a health care surge, vulnerable populations, contact tracing and testing,” the California Department of Public Health said in a statement issued by the governor’s office Friday. It is unclear which TV shows and movies might go back to work on or around that date, however, since protocols still need to be approved, union agreements signed and protective measures put in place. Changes on set that are expected are coronavirus testing for casts and crews, regular temperature checks, improved hygiene and sanitation, and live audiences only when they wear masks and social distance.

Photographs show activists at the illegal Black Lives Matter protests in London have defaced the Cenotaph, which honours the fallen, on the 76th anniversary of D-Day. Sited on Whitehall near the Prime Minister’s official Downing Street residence, the Cenotaph — “empty tomb” — is Britain’s national war memorial, constructed and dedicated to the memory of “the glorious dead” in the First World War. It remains the focus of the country’s most significant acts of remembrance down to the present day, particularly on Armistice Day and Remembrance Sunday, and with June 6th being the 76th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy it would have, in normal times, likely been the focus of ceremonies honouring veterans of all colours across Britain and the former British Empire. Such ceremonies have been suspended virtually worldwide, however, as people are prevented from attending large memorials or even a typical funeral — but this did not stop Black Lives Matter supporters from staging a thousands-strong, closely-packed, and ultimately violent protest, ostensibly over George Floyd’s death on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean in Minneapolis.

Prior to defacing the Cenotaph, attendees at the Black Lives Matter protest — which both the Health Secretary and the Home Secretary urged people to stay away from, given it is unlawful and could lead to a resurgence of the coronavirus in Britain’s multicultural capital — had vandalised not just the statue of wartime leader Sir Winston Churchill in Parliament Square, but also the statue of Abraham Lincoln, the U.S. leader who was assassinated for leading the war to free America’s slaves in the 1800s.

Bars, gyms, day camps, schools, and campgrounds will be permitted to begin reopening the week of June 7 in counties that meet the California Department of Public Health criteria regarding coronavirus cases and hospitalizations, a department guidance released Friday detailed. The department’s statewide, industry-specific guidance allows sectors that have remained closed for weeks to reopen with certain modifications in place. The guidance provides broad instruction for professional sports, retail, schools, and shopping centers to resume operations. “The rules on schools and day camps will apply statewide. But only counties that have met certain thresholds on the number of cases, testing and preparedness will be allowed to start reopening the other sectors,” KPIX reported: 📢 #California has announced new guidance to help counties plan for the reopening of schools, childcare, and entertainment as well as new monitoring data to support local communities in a timely response to outbreaks: https://t.co/CbektJrGRb — CA Public Health (@CAPublicHealth) June 6, 2020  The state’s health department provides criteria for counties to proceed in reopening. Requirements include “stable hospitalizations of COVID individuals on a 7-day average of daily percent change of less than 5% OR no more than 20 COVID hospitalizations on any single day in the past 14 days” and “less than 25 new cases per 100,000 residents in the past 14 days OR less than 8% testing positive in the past 7 days.” The guidance also has requirements for testing capacity, contact tracing, and the potential for a hospital surge. The Golden State, which has a population of nearly 40 million, had 126,510 positive cases of the virus and 4,550 related deaths as of Saturday morning. A bulk of those cases and deaths stem from Los Angeles County.

The government of Equatorial Guinea joined Burundi in announcing the expulsion of the World Health Organization’s (W.H.O.) representatives there, citing a document that alleges they falsified the number of cases of the Chinese coronavirus. The Equatorial Guinea Foreign Ministry document, obtained by Agence France Presse (AFP), accused W.H.O. Representative Triphonie Nkurunziza of “falsifying” the country’s coronavirus figures after she claimed the country had been “severely affected” by the pandemic. “The government has asked her to go, we have received a document – she is accused of falsifying COVID-19 figures,” a source at the W.H.O. office told AFP. According to Dr. Nkurunziza, the Central African nation has recorded more than 1,000 coronavirus cases and 12 deaths nationwide, a relatively high figure given the population of just 1.4 million. “By population we estimate it to be one of the severely affected countries in terms of the number of cases,” the W.H.O.’s regional director for Africa Matshidiso Moeti told reporters this week. “The government has asked the W.H.O. to replace its representative Triphonie Nkurunziza in Equatorial Guinea,” she added. “We are currently working on doing that. I’d like to emphasize very much that we are committed to working with the government, particularly working to support the people.” Addressing the Senate late last week, the country’s Prime Minister Pascual Obama Asue said: “We don’t have a problem with the WHO, we have a problem with the WHO’s representative in Malabo.” Despite being declared persona non-grata, Nkurunziza currently remains in the capital of Malabo because there are no outbound flights. Led by President Teodoro Obiang since a 1979 military coup, Equatorial Guinea is one of Africa’s most authoritarian states with one of the region’s worst human rights records. In April 2016, Obiang declared himself the winner of the country’s presidential election with a staggering 93.7 percent in an election that the U.S. denounced as “neither free nor fair.” According to the State Department’s report on the country, major human rights violations include “torture; arbitrary detention by government agents; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; political prisoners; arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy; significant problems with independence of the judiciary; the worst forms of restrictions on free expression, press, and the internet, including violence, threats of violence, or unjustified arrests or prosecutions of journalists, censorship, site blocking, and the existence of criminal libel laws.” Equatorial Guinea follows fellow African nation Burundi in expelling W.H.O. representative Walter Kazadi Mulombo and several of his officials. Their removal was also dubious political circumstances after they raised concerns about holding mass political rallies in the run-up to last month’s presidential election. They were ordered to leave the country on Friday. Follow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.

Activists defaced and scaled Abraham Lincoln’s statue in Parliament Square, London, at a Black Lives Matter rally held in defiance of Britain’s anti-coronavirus regulations. Video from protest, estimated to be 15,000-strong at the time of publication, shows the Lincoln statue defaced with the graffiti reading “BLM” and naming George Floyd, Mike Brown, and other individuals said to have been killed wrongfully by the police. One side of Lincoln’s pedestal has also had a banner and several placards duct-taped to it, reading “RACISM IS A PANDEMIC TOO”, “SILENCE IS VIOLENCE”, “BLM”, and “ABOLISH THE POLICE”. Separate footage shows protesters physically scaling the statue to cheers from the closely-packed crowds, which assembled in defiance of Home Secretary Priti Patel and Health Secretary Matt Hancock warning that such gatherings were unlawful and could send coronavirus infections soaring again.

His is one of a small number of statues in the square, which sits opposite the Palace of Westminster which hosts the Houses of Parliament, dedicated to foreign leaders from the former British Empire, along with Mahatma Gandhi of India, and Field Marshal Jan Smuts and Nelson Mandela, both of South Africa.

This has caused considerable anger in the wider country, particularly as June 6th is the anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy, in which thousands of British, Commonwealth, and American soldiers lost their lives — and which veterans have been prevented from marking in any significant way due to the lockdown regulations, which continue to be vigorously enforced against the population at large despite BLM persistently flouting them with virtually no consequences.

“Progressive” ideology always rests on a conviction that the current “regressive” system is comprehensively unjust and must be destroyed by exploiting its weaknesses.  The most famous proponent of such tactics in recent years has been the late Saul Alinksy, the intellectual godfather of the modern Democrat Party, but former Soviet journalist and KGB informant Yuri Bezmenov laid out an even more concise strategy for subversion in a 1984 interview. Alinksy’s seminal book specified 13 Rules for Radicals, but Bezmenov had only four “stages of ideological subversion,” and they will sound very familiar to anyone following the current wave of left-wing riots, or the politicized final stages of the coronavirus panic before it: Demoralization, Destabilization, Crisis, and Normalization.  Bezmenov defined ideological subversion, or “active measures” as the KGB preferred to call it, as a “slow brainwashing process” to “change the perception of reality of every American to such an extent that despite their abundance of information, no one is able to come to sensible conclusions in the interests of defending themselves, their families, their community, and their country.” Stage 1: Demoralization Bezmenov said the first stage, Demoralization, could take 15 to 20 years to complete because “this is the minimum number of years it takes to educate one generation of students.” “Marxist-Leninist ideology is being pumped into the soft heads of at least three generations without being challenged or counterbalanced by the basic values of Americanism, American patriotism,” he warned in 1984, judging that the demoralization process had been “basically completed” by that point. “Actually, it’s over-fulfilled, because demoralization now reaches such areas where previously, not even Comrade Andropov and all of his experts would even dream of such tremendous success,” he added, referring to former KGB head and Soviet leader Yuri Andropov. “Most of it is done by Americans to Americans, thanks to a lack of moral standards.” Bezmenov explained that demoralization is important because it robs the targeted population of its ability to process valid information. Even when demoralization targets are “showered with authentic proof” of contrary positions, they simply “refuse to believe it.” Demoralization is quite obvious among today’s young people, whose faith in their country has been systematically destroyed throughout their lives by the education and media establishment. To take a recent high-profile example, the New York Times’ fraudulent “1619 Project” argued that “American history” actually began with the arrival of black slaves in North America and the Revolutionary War was fought by the colonists to preserve slavery. Although comprehensively debunked by actual historians, and even the original author has admitted her core thesis was not true, the 1619 Project is now part of some school curricula.   Another word for demoralization is guilt. Americans are routinely compelled to feel guilty about their society and national history. Guilt is the most powerful force in left-wing politics and academia. People will not accept the radical expansion of punitive government power unless they feel guilty and deserving of punishment. Stage 2: Destabilization The second stage, Destabilization, is much faster, requiring only two to five years under KGB doctrine. In this stage, the fundamentals of the targeted population’s economy, political system, and culture would be attacked, while the demoralized population could not mount much of a defense.  Bezmenov in 1984 found it “absolutely fantastic” how much influence Marxist-Leninist ideas had developed in the American economy and military. In essence, a demoralized population becomes willing to believe the worst criticisms of its own society, while learning to see defenders of that society as their enemies, while avowed enemies become natural allies. The defenders are held to strict standards, while anything goes for the most strident critics.  Whatever Bezmenov saw in the destabilized American society of the early 1980s with respect to the Soviet Union, it’s easy to see how the American Left has destabilized entire segments of modern society after demoralizing them. They see enemies everywhere, while no pro-American authority can be trusted. It’s hard to imagine a better illustration of demoralization followed by destabilization than hordes of anti-capitalist activists texting each other on their iPhones. Not coincidentally, hostile foreign powers like Communist China and Iran are reaching out to destabilized American communities and offering themselves as guides and allies. Their sales pitches aren’t exactly smooth, but they definitely are making an effort. A destabilized population becomes obsessed with hypocrisy as the ultimate political sin. They believe the best ideas – individual liberty, sovereign rights, capitalism, even the rule of law – are presented insincerely by sinister powers who seek to exploit and manipulate them. The precious resource of goodwill disappears from society as everyone comes to believe their neighbors hate them and cannot be trusted. Demoralized people lose faith in their nation, history, and ideals; destabilized people lose faith in each other. Stage 3: Crisis Once a society has been destabilized, Bezmenov said the time would be ripe to create a Crisis, which he estimated would take six to eight weeks in the Eighties. With turbo Internet speed, the modern era can punch out a crisis much faster than that. A crisis has the obvious benefit of panicking demoralized, destabilized people into abandoning their legal protections and constitutional ideals. During the coronavirus panic, people who brought up those ideals were treated like lunatics. The pendulum swung the other way with blinding speed during the riots. In the span of one week, the right to peaceable assembly went from a crazed defiance of common-sense lockdown rules to an urgent matter that utterly transcended the deadly pandemic. Suddenly, angry political demonstration magically cured the coronavirus, or made the projected wave of sickness and death into a purely secondary concern. If you wanted to work at the store so you could feed your family in late March, you were selfishly trying to “kill my Grandma to pad your bank account.” If you wanted to burn the store down in early June to protest white supremacy, nobody mentioned their imperiled grandmothers. The more subtle benefit of a crisis is that it tends to de-legitimize aspects of the existing system that have already been softened up by the long process of demoralization and destabilization. Those who control the organs of public communication have the power to decide which aspects of the system are supposedly indicted by the crisis.  For example, the dominant media Left will go to great lengths to avoid painting the coronavirus as an indictment of the flabby, blinkered, bureaucratic Big Government that grew over the past few decades, and it will not discuss the failures of left-wing mayors and governors. On the contrary, the pandemic was used to attack the competence of Republican governors who turned out to be entirely correct in their actions, as in Florida and Georgia. During the riots, the media is completely uninterested in discussing the incompetence of left-wing officials who allowed violence to rage out of control with deadly consequences. Somehow the lesson of wanton violence that killed people and destroyed countless livelihoods became “let’s get rid of the police altogether.” The threat of a crisis is essential for terrorizing the middle class into accepting a political agenda that is actively hostile to its interests, which leads to the fourth stage of subversion: the offer to make the pain and fear go away by accepting political domination. Stage 4: Normalization “After a crisis, with a violent change of the power structure and economy, you have a so-called period of Normalization that may last indefinitely,” Bezmenov said, arriving at the fourth stage of subversion. “Normalization is a cynical expression borrowed from Soviet propaganda,” he explained. Interestingly, it also happens to be the core theme of the 2020 Democrat presidential campaign. “When the Soviet tanks moved into Czechoslovakia in 1968, Comrade Brezhnev said, ‘Now the situation in brotherly Czechoslovakia is ‘normalized.’ This is what will happen in the United States if you allow all the schmucks to bring the country to crisis, to promise people all kinds of goodies and a paradise on Earth, to destabilize your economy, to eliminate the principle of free-market competition, and to put a Big Brother government in Washington, D.C. with benevolent dictators like Walter Mondale, who will promise lots of things – never mind whether the promises are fulfillable or not,” Bezmenov cautioned. As things turned out, Walter Mondale never got his chance to be a benevolent dictator, and to some extent Bezmenov’s four-step model of subversion could be applied to almost any political campaign. They almost all begin with telling voters things are awful, crises have erupted, and normality can be restored only by voting for the challenger (or preserved only by voting for the incumbent). Bezmenov, however, was insistent that American left-wing professors and civil-rights leaders were deliberately running Andropov’s strategy with a conscious effort to achieve destabilization, the step that truly distinguishes ideological subversion from the usual promises to put a chicken in every pot. “They are instrumental in the process of subversion only to destabilize a nation,” he said of the academics and activists. “When their job is completed, they are not needed anymore. They know too much. Some of them, when they get disillusioned, when they see that Marxist-Leninists come to power, obviously they get offended. They think that they will come to power. That will never happen, of course. They will be lined up against the wall and shot.” The American version of this process probably would not end with the mass execution of inconvenient intellectuals, but there is a parallel in what would happen to the intellectual supporters of the current riots if the Democrats win in 2020. They would discover that the victorious Democrat Party is not at all interested in their systemic criticisms of public union employees, such as police officers. Many bones would be thrown to activist groups to purchase their loyalty – and, much more importantly, the loyalty of their leaders – but not the one concession they ostensibly care about the most: a system that makes it easier to discipline and fire government employees. This metaphorical lining up and shooting of intellectuals is already happening with Lockdown Forever enthusiasts, who only a few days ago were hammering out passionate arguments that American businesses must remain shuttered for weeks or months to come, and anyone who dared to question their dire warnings was a selfish monster willing to kill other people’s grandmothers to pad out their 401k accounts. In the blink of an eye, Lockdown Forever went from the vital engineers of a politically useful crisis to inconvenient obstacles for the new crisis, nationwide riots.  Most of the lockdown gurus sensed this shift in the political winds and quickly trimmed their sails, hammering out new screeds that claimed protesters are probably immune to the coronavirus somehow, or even more incredibly, that another outbreak would be a small price to pay for righteous political activism: Dozens of public health and disease experts have signed an open letter in support of the nationwide anti-racism protests. "White supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to COVID-19," they wrote.https://t.co/EewPNgDSu3 — NPR (@NPR) June 2, 2020  These are the same medical activists who were shrieking in March that the coronavirus could kill millions of Americans if lockdowns were not imposed immediately, and just a few weeks ago, left-wingers were obsessed with calculations that showed COVID-19 is exceptionally deadly to the black community. But suddenly the risk of millions of deaths, 70 percent of them purportedly likely to be black Americans, means nothing compared to the vital urgency of protesting against “white supremacy.”

The British government has made wearing masks mandatory on public transport as part of the country’s lockdown measures, with fines for violations. However, the move came after thousands of far-left protesters and rioters were free to break social distancing rules in London without punishment. Transport secretary Grant Shapps made the announcement on Thursday that from June 15th, wearing masks will be compulsory under “conditions of travel” for trains, buses, and other forms of public transport. Those not wearing them may be refused to board or even face fines. Mr Shapps said: “Alongside transport operators, this will be enforced by the British Transport Police if necessary, but I expect the vast majority of people won’t need to be forced into this.” The face-covering may be a store-bought or homemade mask or even a scarf. Young children and those with disabilities or who have difficulty breathing are exempt. The British Medical Association (BMA) and London’s left-wing mayor, Labour’s Sadiq Khan, have called for the requirement to be rolled out to restaurants, shops, pubs, and other enclosed public spaces. PICS: Antifa, Black Lives Matter Flood London Despite Lockdown, Police Do Little https://t.co/ySrdWGyW0R — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 31, 2020  The United Kingdom still maintains some of the strictest lockdown rules in the world. Britons facing additional requirements in order to simply be allowed on public transport comes as images in the media showed thousands of Black Lives Matter and Antifa protesters marching in close proximity through London, largely without masks, in almost total disregard for the rules other law-abiding citizens are expected to follow. The reaction of London’s Metropolitan Police was to “encourage” protesters to remember that “there are still restrictions in place to prevent its spread, which include not gathering outside in groups of more than six people”. Rather than demanding protesters obey the rules, however, many London police officers instead kneeled to Black Lives Matter protesters, including outside of the Prime Minister’s Downing Street residence. Wednesday’s demonstration then quickly descended into violence, with rioters assaulting and punching police officers yards from the prime minister’s official residence. Just days before, peaceful anti-lockdown protesters in London’s Hyde Park were arrested for “breach of Covid-19 regulations” with some fines being issued. Exclusive Video: Peaceful Anti-Lockdown Protestors Arrested at Demonstration in London https://t.co/NsbvSCHBdl — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 1, 2020  Whether or not being faced with the blatant hypocrisy will cause Britons to reject en masse the enforcement of mask-wearing remains to be seen. However, Breitbart London’s James Delingpole believes that the recent Black Lives Matter protests have “killed” lockdown. Writing on Friday, Delingpole observed: But how do all these strictures square with the events of the last few days, in which thousands of people, in Hyde Park and elsewhere, have been permitted to gather in huge crowds in support of Black Lives Matter in flagrant contravention of all social distancing rules? Well they don’t, obviously, and anyone with half a brain can see this. He pointed out the “official hypocrisy, double standards, and general stupidity” of the government’s lockdown position, saying: So, for example, as I discovered the other week, if you’re protesting against the lockdown the police will turn up mob-handed and threaten you with arrest for inadequate social distancing. But if you’re part of menacing mob claiming to be outraged by an incident that happened 4,000 miles away across the Atlantic in an entirely different legal jurisdiction, then as far as the authorities are concerned no action need be taken short of arresting people physically beating up police officers. “I think the Black Lives Matter protests — certainly the UK version — are dangerous, stupid and wrong for a number of reasons,” he concluded. “But I’m grateful to them for one thing: they’ve made it quite impossible for anyone with even half a brain to see the ongoing lockdown as anything other than a ridiculous joke.” Australian media in London confronted and chased by the mob live on-air yesterday.

SAINT-LAURENT-SUR-MER, France (AP) – At least the dead will always be there. All too many have been, for 76 years since that fateful June 6th on France’s Normandy beaches, when Allied troops in 1944 turned the course of World War II and went on to defeat fascism in Europe in one of the most remarkable feats in military history. Forgotten they will never be. Revered, yes. But Saturday’s anniversary will be one of the loneliest remembrances ever, as the coronavirus pandemic is keeping almost everyone away — from government leaders to frail veterans who might not get another chance for a final farewell to their unlucky comrades. Rain and wind are also forecast, after weeks of warm, sunny weather. “I miss the others,” said Charles Shay, who as a U.S. Army medic was in the first wave of soldiers to wade ashore at Omaha Beach under relentless fire on D-Day. Shay, 95, lives in France close to the beach where he and so many others landed in 1944. He knows of no U.S. veterans making the trip overseas to observe D-Day this year. “I guess I will be alone here this year,” Shay said before he performed a Native American ritual to honour his comrades by spreading the smoke of burning white sage into the winds lashing the Normandy coast Friday. The eerie atmosphere touches the French as well as Americans. “The sadness is almost too much, because there is no one,” said local guide Adeline James. “Plus you have their stories. The history is sad and it’s even more overwhelming now between the weather, the [virus] situation and, and, and.” The locals in this north-western part of France have come out year after year to show their gratitude for the soldiers from the United States, Britain, Canada, and other countries who liberated them from Adolf Hitler’s Nazi forces. Despite the lack of international crowds, David Pottier still went out to raise American flags in the Calvados village of Mosles, population 356, which was liberated by Allied troops the day after the landing on five Normandy beachheads. In a forlorn scene, a gardener tended to the parched grass around the small monument for the war dead, while Pottier, the local mayor, was getting the French tricolour to flutter next to the Stars and Stripes. “We have to recognize that they came to die in a foreign land,” Pottier said. “We miss the GIs,” he said of the U.S. soldiers. This protest in London now has nothing to do with George Floyd.  It is anarchy in the face of weak leadership.  To desecrate The Cenotaph tells us these people hate our values, our culture and our country. Enough. pic.twitter.com/CtfKtg1Aqq — Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) June 3, 2020  The pandemic has wreaked havoc across the world, infecting 6.6 million people, killing over 391,000 and devastating economies. It poses a particular threat to the elderly — like the surviving D-Day veterans who are in their late nineties or older. It has also affected the younger generations who turn out every year to mark the occasion. Most have been barred from travelling to the windswept coasts of Normandy. Some 160,000 soldiers made the perilous crossing from England that day in atrocious conditions, storming dunes which they knew were heavily defended by German troops determined to hold their positions. Somehow, they succeeded. Yet they left a trail of thousands of casualties who have been mourned for generations since. Last year stood out, with U.S. President Donald Trump joining French President Emmanuel Macron at the American cemetery in Colleville-sur-Mer, on a bluff overlooking Omaha Beach. A smattering of veterans were honoured with the highest accolades. All across the beaches of Normandy tens of thousands came from across the globe to pay their respects to the dead and laud the surviving soldiers. The acrid smell of wartime-era jeep exhaust fumes and the rumble of old tanks filled the air as parades of vintages vehicles went from village to village. The tiny roads between the dunes, hedges and apple orchards were clogged for hours, if not days. Heading into the D-Day remembrance weekend this year, only the salty brine coming off the ocean on Omaha Beach hits the nostrils, the shrieks of seagulls pierce the ears and a sense of desolation hangs across the region’s country roads. “Last year this place was full with jeeps, trucks, people dressed up as soldiers,” said Eric Angely, who sat on a seawall wearing a World War II uniform after taking his restored U.S. Army jeep out for a ride. “This year, there is nothing. It’s just me now, my dog and my jeep,” the local Frenchman said. Three-quarters of a century and the horrific wartime slaughter of D-Day help put things in perspective. Someday, the COVID-19 pandemic, too, will pass, and people will turn out to remember both events that shook the world. “We don’t have a short memory around here,” Pottier said with a wistful smile. I don’t care what the cause, or how deep the anger, there is simply no excuse for denigrating the Cenotaph, a war memorial to mark the millions who died for the liberty that today’s generation take for granted  The Fallen’s lives matter, too 🙏🏻 pic.twitter.com/jZdCGvpKLc — Martin Daubney (@MartinDaubney) June 3, 2020  ___ Virginia Mayo contributed.

On Friday’s broadcast of CNN’s “AC360,” host Anderson Cooper said that protesters are “putting themselves at greater risk” from coronavirus because “That is how urgently people want real and lasting change” and remarked on the White House not arranging its chairs for a press conference for social distancing by saying, “So much for all those warnings by Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx and the Coronavirus Task Force.” Cooper said, “For 11 days now, we have been hearing the call for change in this country. It’s coming from the ground up, from people of all races and backgrounds and in the middle of a pandemic. Just think about that for a minute as you look at the live demonstrations on your screen. Not only are people risking their safety by speaking out and confronting police, which is something most people never do in their lives, they’re also putting themselves at greater risk from a virus that’s already killed 109,000 people in this country, a virus which is still here, still transmittable, still killing people all around the world. That is how urgently people want real and lasting change in the wake of George Floyd’s killing by police nearly two Mondays ago. It’s how badly they want an end to what has been a long-running and deadly injustice to African Americans in this country, and to redeem the country’s long-standing promise of equal justice under the law.” He later added that the chairs at the White House’s press conference earlier in the day were “deliberately not arranged for social distancing. Because, in the words of the deputy press secretary, it looks better. So much for all those warnings by Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx and the Coronavirus Task Force. The president has clearly decided the virus is not a winning topic for him anymore.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

Friday, during an interview that aired on Huntsville, AL radio’s WVNN, Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) discussed how his East Texas congressional district was handling the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, and what he foresaw as overcoming the impact could mean. During the discussion, Gohmert also referenced the Hong Kong flu (H3N2) pandemic of the late 1960s and how different his experience with that was compared to coronavirus. “[I] was just in high school, had just got in high school back during the Hong Kong flu, ’68, ’69,” he said. “I’ve been reading a lot about that, and I remember the talk about it. We lost 100,000 or so Americans back then to that virus. We didn’t have a vaccine for it, much like coronavirus didn’t have a vaccine. But, I don’t remember any business being shutdown.  I don’t remember anybody being told they had to wear a mask or anything.” The Texas Republican congressman explained that given the willingness of the country to accept requirements and restrictions put in place by governmental bodies to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus in current-day America seemed to show the country was much more “tolerant” of government power. “I know we’ve done more and improved more, but I think Americans now are much more tolerant of having big government tell them what they can and can’t do, especially the millennials are more accustomed to telling them what they can or can’t do,” Gohmert continued. “I see that as the difference between now and past pandemics. There will probably be a little resurgence — hopefully not much more than this one. A lot depends on us.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor

New York City, New York rioters arrested for crimes considered “low-level” will not face any charges after nights of rioting, looting, and setting fires. Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance says his office will not prosecute any rioters who were charged with crimes like unlawful assembly or disorderly conduct. The announcement means the overwhelming majority of hundreds of rioters in New York City will likely not face any criminal prosecution. Vance’s office said in a statement The prosecution of protestors charged with these low-level offenses undermines critical bonds between law enforcement and the communities we serve.Days after the killing of George Floyd, our nation and our city are at a crossroads in our continuing endeavor to confront racism and systemic injustice wherever it exists. Our office has a moral imperative to enact public policies which assure all New Yorkers that in our justice system and our society, black lives matter and police violence is a crime. We commend the thousands of our fellow New Yorkers who have peacefully assembled to demand these achievable aims, and our door is open to any New Yorker who wishes to be heard. Only rioters who were arrested and where there is evidence that they contributed to attacks on police officers, looting, or destruction of property will face criminal charges. Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s (D-NY) “bail reform” law — which eliminated bail for a number of nonviolent and violent crimes in New York state — is successfully freeing at least 400 rioters and looters from jail without ever having to pay bail. The bail reform law eliminated bail for suspects accused of second-degree manslaughter, aggravated vehicular assault, third-degree assault, promoting an obscene sexual performance by a child, criminally negligent homicide, aggravated vehicular homicide, and about 100 other crimes. In March, New York City Police Department (NYPD) officials said that in the first 58 days of the year, close to 500 suspects who would have been kept locked up in jail if not for the new bail reform laws had been rearrested for committing an additional 846 crimes. Nearly 300 of these crimes included murder, rape, robbery, felony assault, burglary, grand larceny, and grand larceny auto. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Jihadists in Indonesia are calling for violent attacks on Chinese-run businesses amid surging anti-Chinese sentiment in the Muslim-majority nation. In the midst of an economic recession caused by the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, foreign workers in Indonesia compete for dwindling local jobs with Indonesians. This has seeded resentment toward the Chinese, who make up the majority of Indonesia’s foreign workforce, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported on Thursday. Sofyan Tsauri, a former al-Qaeda terrorist who served five years in prison for helping to arm terror groups and now supports Indonesia’s counterterrorism efforts, said on Monday, “Some jihadis have called for the burning and robbing of Chinese shops.” He made the comment following his participation in a webinar on Monday by the Indonesian think tank Center for Radicalism and Deradicalization Studies, the SCMP reported. According to Sofyan, jihadis have called for attacks on Chinese businesses on social media platforms, including Facebook, for the past six months. The calls to action have been made by members of Indonesia’s Islamic State affiliate, Jemaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), members of al-Qaeda, and other jihadist groups operating in Indonesia. Sofyan said that jihadis were already preparing to launch a terror attack in Indonesia, implying that it was a question of when, not if, they strike. “[An attack] has to be anticipated and not be dismissed. There needs to be caution,” Sofyan warned, adding that regions of Indonesia where jihadis have been known to operate – such as the islands of “Sulawesi, Sumatra, and West Java”– should exercise vigilance. He explained that the ongoing Chinese coronavirus pandemic has caused serious vulnerabilities to crop up within Indonesia’s government and society, creating optimal conditions for the terrorists to strike. As examples, Sofyan cited the general distraction of the national government in dealing with the public health crisis and the swelling of anti-Chinese sentiment among Indonesians, itself a result of the pandemic-induced economic recession. According to the SCMP, in April, Indonesia’s Manpower and Transmigration Ministry said that 2.8 million people had lost their jobs as a direct result of the economic recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic, adding that an additional 70 million “informal workers” were “at risk” of unemployment. As of May, a total of 98,900 foreign workers were active in Indonesia’s workforce, less than 0.1 percent of Indonesia’s total workforce of 124 million, the SCMP reported. Of foreign workers, the Chinese accounted for the largest group – 35,781 workers– followed by the Japanese at 12,823, and South Koreans at 9,097. China invests heavily in Indonesia and is the nation’s second-largest foreign direct investor. In 2019, Chinese companies invested $4.7 billion in Indonesia. Though long-standing, Indonesian resentment toward Chinese foreign workers has increased significantly during the current recession. According to the report, many Indonesians have recently criticized the government for allegedly favoring Chinese workers over locals in allotting work contracts, prompting the government to respond. In early May, lawmakers in southwestern Indonesia’s Sulawesi province denied the planned arrival of 500 Chinese foreign workers contracted by Chinese metalworking companies in Indonesia hoping to employ them instead of locals. Although the Chinese companies had already managed to secure work permits for the group from Jakarta’s central government, the act was overridden by Indonesia’s Ministry of Manpower, which postponed the workers’ arrival, citing concerns that it would spread coronavirus. Mohd Adhe Bhakti, the executive director of Indonesia’s Center for Radicalism and Deradicalization Studies, warned that if the Indonesian government fails to stand firm in denying the entry of foreign workers, especially the Chinese, to the country, terrorist attacks in the near future are “highly possible.” Speaking to the SCMP, Bhakti pointed to an attack on Monday of a police station in South Kalimantan, in which a police officer was killed with a sword by a group of suspected pro-Islamic State terrorists. The incident occurred on Pancasila Day, a public holiday celebrating the birth of Indonesia’s secular, national ideology. Bhakti says that the attack’s occurrence on a national holiday was no coincidence, as terrorists prefer to stage attacks on dates of symbolic significance. He advised Indonesians to remain alert to future terror attacks on major holidays. In the past, jihadis have planned or carried out terror attacks during the Christmas holiday and on New Year’s Eve. Last Christmas, the Indonesian government deployed 200,000 police officers to guard against threats of violent attacks from jihadis during the Christian holiday.

In a unanimous 7-0 decision, the Michigan Supreme Court sided with 77-year-old barber Karl Manke over Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Friday. Whitmer and Attorney General Dana Nessel have been relentlessly pursuing Manke, attempting to force the closure of his shop during the coronavirus pandemic. Great Lakes News reported on Facebook late Friday that the Court ruled unanimously in favor of the Owosso barber — a stunning decision, given the narrow 4-3 ideological split in favor of conservatives.  According to Great Lakes News, Manke’s attorney, David Kallman, called it the “biggest, most lopsided victory of his career.” Whitmer and Nessel fined Manke and stripped him of his license after he repeatedly refused to close his business in defiance of Whitmer’s executive orders. A Michigan Court of Appeals upheld that Manke’s license suspension was valid, but the Supreme Court decision reversed that. Manke was defiant after the Appeals Court ruling and told WILX, “I’m still open, still working until they cut my hands off.” Breitbart News caught up with Manke during the recent “Operation Haircut” protest. He said the response during the protest and the support for his stand was “overwhelming,” and called himself “a Michigan small town barber that just wants to work.” “This is an oppressive move on this governor’s part,” Manke said, observing that it “reflects almost a police state.” “I refuse to stand down on this,” he said. “I wasn’t this rock star three weeks ago,” Manke told Breitbart News, but Whitmer made him one. He thanked God for the development. “I’m still standing up. I still have that courage,” Manke said. Manke’s full speech at the protest was aired on The Kyle Olson Show:  Kyle Olson is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Chinese authorities are concealing information surrounding yet another outbreak of the Chinese coronavirus in northeastern Harbin, according to local residents who spoke with the Epoch Times. Residents told the Times that they knew of at least five people who have died of the coronavirus whose cases authorities have not disclosed publicly. One interviewee under treatment added that, at one hospital, there are around 30 patients who are yet to make a full recovery and remain in isolation. The statements contradict Chinese officials, who claim that the last coronavirus patient was discharged on May 16 from the hospital where he was being treated. “We are very anxious, but the doctors said they have no solutions,” patient Zhang Lng was quoted as saying. “They didn’t give us any medicine, and are hoping our bodies recover by ourselves.” The virus began spreading in the central Chinese city of Wuhan last year and spread across the country before infecting people around the world. Having been the first country to face the pandemic, Chinese health officials declared in April that they had largely defeated the virus and could begin returning to life as normal. However, there have been multiple reports of allegedly minor outbreaks spreading across several Chinese provinces, including Heilongjiang, of which Harbin is the capital. Communist officials appear eager to cover these up, presumably to strengthen the narrative that China was one of just a handful of countries to successfully manage and eradicate the virus. Last month, the Chinese Communist Party’s senior medical advisor warned that the country could face a second wave outbreak of infections due to a lack of immunity among the broader population. “The majority of … Chinese at the moment are still susceptible to the Covid-19 infection, because of a lack of immunity,” Zhong Nanshan, the Communist Party’s most prominent medical mouthpiece during the outbreak, told CNN. “We are facing a big challenge. It’s not better than the foreign countries I think at the moment.” China is widely understood to have covered up key information about the virus before it threatened the world, a decision that likely cost thousands of lives and enormous damage to the global economy. A recently leaked report compiled by the Five Eyes intelligence alliance determined that the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) turned a blind eye as Chinese authorities went about “disappearing” whistle-blowing doctors, censored information about the outbreak, destroyed samples of the virus in laboratories, and refused to hand over samples to international experts, thus delaying ongoing efforts to develop a cure or a vaccine for the virus.

During an interview with WTOP on Friday, White House Coronavirus Task Force member Dr. Anthony Fauci stated that the recent protests are “a perfect setup for further spread” of coronavirus and told people “if you can avoid the demonstration, if you can, fine. If you can’t, make sure you wear a mask.” Fauci responded to a question on what goes through his mind when he sees crowds gathering and people being hit with tear gas and other things that cause them to cough on each other by stating, “What runs through my mind is what does every time I hear about or see the congregation of large crowds at a time and in an area — a geographic area where clearly there is active infection transmission. It’s a perfect setup for further spread of the virus in the sense of creating these blips, which might turn into some surges. So, I get very concerned, as my colleagues in public health, when they see these kinds of crowds. I mean, obviously, not only are they congregating physically close to each other. But often, when they start screaming and demonstrating, which is part of the process of demonstrating, I’m not criticizing that, but I’m saying what it’s going to be leading to is a likelihood that you might have situations where you would force the spread of infection, and that’s really of concern.” Fauci declined to say that such a scenario is “likely. … But there certainly is a risk. I would say that with confidence, that when you have the congregation of crowds, as we’ve been seeing now. I mean, I’m here in Washington, D.C., and you look at the TV, and you see what’s going on, particularly, and the situation in which there is a lot of confusion and some — a little bit of chaos, people running back and forth, taking their masks off, being close in proximity. That absolutely poses a risk that there might be spread of infection.” He added that people have the right to demonstrate, “but it’s a delicate balance. Because the reasons for demonstrating are valid, and yet, the demonstration itself puts one at an additional risk. So, the only thing we can do as public health officials is to keep warning people, be careful. If you are going to go out, please make sure you wear a mask, and you keep the mask on at all times. Because I’ve seen, on TV, as the demonstrations start to heat up, people might take their masks off when they’re starting to yell and scream and demonstrate. Keep your mask on. First of all, if you can avoid the demonstration, if you can, fine. If you can’t, make sure you wear a mask.” (h/t Business Insider) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

The Las Vegas strip began to breathe new life on Thursday as some casinos started to reopen after 78 days without gambling because of the Chinese coronavirus lockdown. In the wee hours of Thursday, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported: Nevada casinos reopened for gaming at 12:01 am. Thursday, ushering in guests eager to try their luck 78 days after resorts were closed because of the COVID-19 [disease caused by the coronavirus] pandemic. Certain amenities, including buffets and shows, remain closed. Not all properties will reopen Thursday, and those that do will follow a new set of health and safety protocols. Guests can expect to see lots of plexiglass, masks, and social distancing reminders.    The Las Vegas casinos that opened their doors did so as part of Nevada’s phase two reopening process, which began May 29. Yahoo Finance noted: Led by the reopening of casinos held by Wynn Resorts, Caesars Entertainment, MGM Resorts, and Las Vegas Sands, Thursday marked a return to operations at many of Sin City’s most frequented attractions. Even MGM’s famed Bellagio’s fountains were roaring again to the tune of Elvis’ Viva Las Vegas. But as the coronavirus pandemic threat continues, analysts are warning that a total return to normalcy for gaming stocks might not be as quick as hoped. Despite a slow trickle back to booking activity, Morningstar senior equity analyst Dan Wasiolek estimates it could take until 2023 before Las Vegas revenues return to pre-COVID-19 levels.

Amazon has reversed its refusal to publish an e-book from author and former New York Times reporter Alex Berenson, a prominent critic of the ongoing Chinese virus lockdowns. The e-commerce giant chose to approve Berenson’s book following coverage from Breitbart News, as well as backlash from figures on social media including Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk. In its email to Berenson, Amazon initially informed the author that it would not be publishing the book. “Due to the rapidly changing nature of information around the COVID-19 virus, we are referring customers to official sources for health information about the virus. Please consider removing references to COVID-19 for this book,” said Amazon. Berenson told Breitbart News that his book, Unreported Truths About COVID-19 And Lockdowns Part 1: Introductions and Death Counts and Estimates, was merely “an introduction and a discussion of death coding, death counts, and who is really dying from COVID, as well as a worst-case estimate of deaths with no mitigation efforts.” “I briefly considered censorship but assumed I wouldn’t have a problem both because of my background, because anyone who reads the booklet will realize it is impeccably sourced, nary a conspiracy theory to be found, and frankly because Amazon shouldn’t be censoring anything that doesn’t explicitly help people commit criminal behavior.” Amazon spokeswoman Sarah Elison now says the book was removed in error, according to the Washington Post.  On Twitter, Musk called Amazon’s decision “insane” and called for the online retailer to be broken up, calling it a “monopoly.” Time to break up Amazon. Monopolies are wrong! — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 4, 2020  “I think Elon’s decision to highlight the censorship spurred Amazon to move quickly. It’s possible they would have backed down eventually, but his tweets made their position indefensible,” said Berenson.

NBC News’ Peter Alexander, a member of the White House Press Corps, shouted a question at President Donald Trump during a Rose Garden press conference on Friday morning: “How would a better economy have protected George Floyd?” The president held the conference to celebrate Friday’s unexpectedly good May jobs report, showing that the U.S. economy had added 2.5 million jobs, rather than losing some 8 million jobs, as expected. The unemployment rate fell to 13.3% rather than rising to 20%. After the president finished his remarks, he prepared to sign an extension to the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which the administration credited for much of the rebound in the jobs numbers. Trump said that a growing economy was “the greatest thing that can happen for race relations.” Shortly thereafter, NBC’s Alexander shouted his question: “”How would a better economy have protected George Floyd?” Floyd was killed by police on Memorial Day, after he was arrested for allegedly trying to use a counterfeit $20 bill. He had lost his job due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Chicago Tribune noted: Before he died after being pinned for minutes beneath a Minneapolis police officer’s knee, George Floyd was suffering the same fate as millions of Americans during the coronavirus pandemic: out of work and looking for a new job. Floyd moved to Minneapolis from his native Houston several years ago in hopes of finding work and starting a new life, said Christopher Harris, Floyd’s lifelong friend. But he lost his job as a bouncer at a restaurant when Minnesota’s governor issued a stay-at-home order.
… Harris said Floyd was laid off when Minnesota shut down restaurants as part of a stay-at-home order. He said he spoke with Floyd on Sunday night and gave him some information for contacting a temporary jobs agency. The president did not take that question, or any other. An undated photo provided to the Associated Press by a friend of Floyd’s showed him at work as a security guard: This undated file photo provided by Christopher Harris shows George Floyd. Floyd died May 25, after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck until he stopped breathing. (Christopher Harris via AP, File) Many of the new jobs consisted of people returning to their workplaces after temporary layoffs due to the pandemic. Black unemployment remained steady in May, despite improvements for whites and Hispanics. Joel B.

Catholic League president Bill Donohue slammed New York mayor Bill de Blasio Friday for his irrational coronavirus lockdown rules and anti-religious animus. Dr. Donohue underscored the arbitrary nature of de Blasio’s provisions on what is allowed and not allowed in New York City during coronavirus. While the mayor has severely curtailed religious practice in the city, he has defended the rights of citizens to form huge gatherings to protest, even violently, and obviously without social distancing or masks (except perhaps antifa masks). “What if, instead of protesting, a very small group of people want to go to a church, synagogue, mosque, or temple?” Donohue asked. “They don’t want to protest, just pray. They pledge to stay six feet apart. They promise not to engage in violence. Can they do so? No.” When a reporter for a Jewish newspaper called out the mayor for the irony of allowing throngs to take to the streets in a mass assembly, but denying permission for a small church service, he got indignant, Donohue notes. “Four hundred years of American racism, I’m sorry, that is not the same question as the understandably aggrieved store owner or the devout religious person who wants to go back to services,” de Blasio replied. The upshot, Donohue writes, is that de Blasio has decided to “privilege” protesters, many of whom are well-off white folks, “all because he thinks that protesting racism justifies jettisoning his shutdown.” The hypocrisy grows even thicker because of the mayor’s own, well-known racism, Donohue notes, since he has adopted racial quotas, repeatedly promoting policies that discriminate against Asian Americans by denying them seats in New York’s public schools. De Blasio has also denied black and Hispanic parents the advantages of school choice, quashing the opportunities for charter schools and other avenues toward educational advancement. Perhaps most disturbing, however, is the mayor’s hostility toward religious faith. “This is a man who raised money for the communists in Nicaragua when he was young, and traveled, illegally, to Castro’s Cuba for his honeymoon, lying to his own children about where it took place,” Donohue writes. The mayor also boycotted the St. Patrick’s Day Parade for years and recently lashed out at Rev. Franklin Graham “because the minister thinks marriage should be between a man and a woman.” “This is the profile of an extremist,” Donohue concludes. “He throws the health of New Yorkers overboard to allow for a jammed protest he likes, and then invokes his health edict to ban people of faith from attending their house of worship.” Follow @tdwilliamsrome

The Supreme leader of Afghan terror group the Taliban may have recently died from the coronavirus, Afghanistan’s Khaama Press reported on Tuesday, citing information from a report by the American magazine Foreign Policy. According to the report, sources with knowledge of development within the Taliban’s ranks confirmed to Foreign Policy that the jihadi leader Mullah Hibatullah Akhundzada tested positive for coronavirus. The acting director of the Taliban’s military operations, Mawlavi Mohammad Ali Jan Ahmad, told the magazine Akhundzada is “sick but is recovering.” Khaama Press points out that at least three other Taliban figures told Foreign Policy under the condition of anonymity that Akhundzada died while receiving treatment for coronavirus symptoms. The Taliban has refused to officially comment on its leader’s health status so far. According to Khaama Press, recent unconfirmed reports indicate that Mullah Yaqoob, the son of the Taliban’s late founder, Mullah Mohammad Omar, has been appointed as the interim leader of the Taliban, further strengthening support of the claims that Akhundzada has died. Reports last month indicated that Mullah Yaqoob had been appointed as the Taliban’s military chief following a reorganization of the terrorist group’s leadership, suggesting Yaqoob was already primed to assume a top role. News of the Taliban leadership shuffle comes shortly after the Afghan government released hundreds of Taliban prisoners last week in response to a reportedly unexpected ceasefire called by the Taliban during the Islamic holiday weekend known as Eid al-Fitr at the end of May. On May 26, the Afghan government said it planned to release 900 Taliban prisoners in the following days. The Afghan government says it expects the Taliban to reciprocate by releasing members of Afghan security forces currently detained by the terrorist group. The prisoner exchange was proposed in February by the U.S. as a way to build goodwill between the two sides; the Taliban refuses to recognize Afganistan’s government as legitimate, claiming it is the country’s true ruler. This has lead to repeated breakdowns in peace talks set up by foreign supporters of a peaceful Afghanistan, such as the U.S.

Zimbabwe police arrested 1,312 people nationwide on Tuesday for violating coronavirus quarantine measures as authorities reinforce lockdown restrictions, Zimbabwe’s state-owned newspaper The Herald reported on Thursday. National police spokesman Paul Nyathi confirmed Tuesday’s arrests to the newspaper. Security officials cited a “growing laxity” in people’s adherence to restrictions on movement as the main reason for the high number of arrests over the 24-hour period. Since March 31, law enforcement officials in Zimbabwe have arrested a total of 52,041 people for violating quarantine measures. According to the report, Zimbabwe police said they are making “special efforts” to track down escapees from coronavirus quarantine centers, a growing problem in the country that poses a major public health risk. On May 29, Zimbabwe police said they were “hunting down” over 100 people who escaped quarantine centers, which the national health minister referred to as “our source of danger” when describing the breakouts at the time. On Thursday, authorities said 158 people had escaped from quarantine and police had tracked down and arrested 26 of them. Police have also been cracking down on people entering the country illegally and said they had arrested 97 “border jumpers.” Zimbabwe requires people returning from abroad to enter a 21-day quarantine period at state-run quarantine centers to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Nearly all of Zimbabwe’s new coronavirus cases last week were linked to these quarantine centers. They reportedly hold hundreds of people returning to the country from abroad, sometimes involuntarily. Most of Zimbabwe’s returning travelers left the country seeking work in neighboring South Africa, the regional economic hub, or in Botswana, with which it also shares a border. “The total number of escapees from various quarantine centers in provinces across the country is now 158,” Nyathi said on Thursday. “Escapees who have been arrested are now 26 following the arrest of a 40-year-old woman who absconded from Vuti Quarantine Center in Mashonaland West. Since May 16, police have arrested 97 border jumpers and smugglers.” “We continue to urge the public to be health and security conscious and assist the police and other security services in the maintenance of law and order,” Nyathi added. On Tuesday, Zimbabwe’s government ordered troops and police to reinforce coronavirus lockdown measures in the capital, Harare, amid a recent surge in coronavirus infections which had “more than tripled” to 203 as of June 2, according to national health authorities.

The unemployment rate fell to 13.3 percent and payrolls unexpectedly rose by 2.5 million workers as the easing of restrictions on business activity and government aid led to new hiring in May. The U.S. unemployment rate fell below last month’s record-high 14.7 percent, which was the highest on record in data going back to 1948. Economists estimate that the unemployment rate reached 25 percent during the Great Depression, although that predated the scientific economy-wide record keeping the government now deploys. The job gains mark a sudden turnaround from a month earlier, when the economy shed a staggering 20.5 million jobs, by far the worst monthly decline on records back to 1939. Economists had expected the unemployment rate to rise to nearly 20 percent and the economy to shed an additional 8 million jobs. The mandatory closures of many businesses and stay-at-home orders slammed what had been a very healthy labor market hard. The economy added jobs for 113 straight weeks through February, a record streak of growth. The unemployment rate was 3.5 percent in February. And yet job creation was running very hot, with the economy adding an average of 211,000 new jobs each month. The government has undertaken unprecedented efforts to support employment and provide aid to those who have lost their jobs. Around 150 million taxpayers received stimulus payments of up to $1200 for adults in their household plus additional amounts for children. The Treasury’s Paycheck Protection Program is backing $669 billion of loans to small businesses that can be forgiven if borrowers do not lay off workers. The federal government has been providing an additional $600 on top of state unemployment benefits, paying some Americans more than they earned on the job. Recent data suggest the labor market has been stabilizing and is now improving. The number of people applying for unemployment benefits has declined every week since hitting a record high 6.8 million in March. Last week, this number fell to around 1.8 million. Over 40 million new claims have been made for unemployment since the wave but ongoing claims are just over 20 million, indicating many Americans have been rehired after losing jobs. In May, employment in leisure and hospitality jumped by 1.2 million after falling by 7.5 million in April and 743,000 in March. Bars and restaurants hired an additional 1.4 million workers following a combined 6.1 million in job losses in April and March. Construction employment jumped by 464,000 in May, gaining back almost half of April’s decline. Dentist offices added 245,000 jobs. Health care employment overall rose by 312,00. Retail shops added  368,000 jobs in May, after a loss of 2.3 million inApril. Over-the-month job gains occurred in clothing and clothing accessories stores were 95,000. Auto dealers added 85,000. General merchandise stores added 84,000. Manufacturers added 225,000 jobs, about evenly split between the durable and nondurable goods components. Twenty-eight thousand of those were in auto making plants.

“When the facts change,” said 20th-century economist John Maynard Keynes, “I change my mind.” State governors and public health officials should follow this example in light of recent CDC data showing that Covid-19 is much less deadly than originally thought. The CDC recently revised its death rate estimate down to just 0.4 percent. And for many demographics, it is far less than that. Public officials should pivot from “flattening the curve” to “flattening the fear.” The data demonstrate that younger and otherwise healthy Americans face little risk of dying from this disease. Most people should immediately get back to living their daily lives without fear, boosting our beleaguered economy. One percent of counties in the country account for more than half of all Covid deaths. Ten percent of counties account for more than 90 percent of all deaths. Nearly half of the counties in the country haven’t experienced a single coronavirus death. Yet safe counties are often beholden to state reopening timelines based on conditions in major cities where Covid is often far more prevalent. Keeping these areas that have been relatively untouched by the coronavirus closed for business is a violation of residents’ basic civil liberties and is unnecessarily contributing to our dire economic situation. According to a recent analysis by Avik Roy at Forbes, 42 percent of all coronavirus deaths have come in nursing homes. In many states, nursing homes and assisted living facilities account for far more than half of all deaths—81 percent in Minnesota and 70 percent in Ohio. If governments pursued a tailored Covid response moving forward, protecting nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and the most vulnerable, we could dramatically reduce the Covid death rate while letting the vast majority of Americans resume something akin to a normal life. We can isolate the few to protect the many instead of isolating the many to protect the few. Like location, age is also a strong risk indicator. According to the most recent CDC data, more than 80 percent of all Covid deaths are among those over 65 years old. Those aged under 55 account for just seven percent of all Covid deaths. And the overwhelming majority of deaths are among those with at least one other underlying medical condition. It’s irrational for young and healthy people to live in fear of this disease. The original intent of flattening the curve was to not overwhelm our healthcare system. By working together, we have accomplished this goal. With this accomplished, government officials, business leaders, and the media must now flatten the fear—the consequences of which are just as dire as the disease. Our nation is paralyzed because people are paralyzed by fear. Over the last ten weeks, more than 40 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits, and one-third of small businesses won’t reopen. These numbers represent real people with lost paychecks and shattered dreams. Economic consequences breed societal problems. Alcohol and drug abuse have skyrocketed, with hard liquor sales up by about 75 percent. Prescriptions for anti-anxiety medication are up by about one-third. Community experts worry about associated spikes in domestic violence and suicides. The national Disaster Distress Helpline saw a 338 percent increase in call volume in March compared with February. Suicide rates generally rise by about one percent for every one percentage point increase in unemployment. Patients are avoiding necessary care due to unnecessary hospital restrictions against seeing non-emergency patients. Oncologists, who treat cancer patients, have recently seen their patient counts fall by nearly half. Sadly, we will have more victims of Covid who never had the virus. Extending stay-at-home orders could cause “irreparable damage,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the lead member of the White House coronavirus task force, on May 22nd. “I don’t want people to think that any of us feel that staying locked down for a prolonged period of time is the way to go.” The facts are in. Covid poses a low risk to ordinary Americans, yet Covid fear poses an enormous risk to our society. Flattening the fear will not only save lives and livelihoods but help prevent the unraveling of the fabric of American life. Alfredo Ortiz is the president and CEO of the Job Creators Network. C.L.

TEL AVIV – Eighty-seven schools around Israel have closed over coronavirus cases and nearly 10,000 students and staff members are in quarantine.  Of those, 300 people have been diagnosed to be sick with the virus, the Education Ministry said. The development comes amid an uptick in cases that began last week with 115 new infections in a 24-hour period – the highest in a month. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday announced “any school where a virus case is diagnosed will close.” the Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement. In addition, foreigners on their post-high school gap year, including yeshiva and seminary students, will no longer be permitted to enter the country, Interior Minister Arye Deri announced. The statement from Netanyahu’s officer said the prime minister had “directed Education Minister Galant to work on achieving solutions for protection and distancing for pupils and teaching staff. Cases that are found will continue to be dealt with. The Prime Minister instructed that the situation be monitored and assessed.” Gallant maintained the current infection rates do not justify shutting all schools down and added that doing so constituted “an irresponsible blow to students, parents and teachers.” Israel had 17,429 confirmed cases and 291 deaths as of Thursday morning.

On Thursday’s broadcast of CNBC’s “Mad Money,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) touted the Heroes Act and said that “If we want to open up the economy, and we all do, we need to defeat the virus, and that’s testing, tracing, treatment, and isolation.” Pelosi said, “Well, first of all, let me just say that the Heroes Act is an answer, in many ways, to the challenge that our economy faces. If we want to open up the economy, and we all do, we need to defeat the virus, and that’s testing, tracing, treatment, and isolation. And we don’t have a vaccine and we don’t have a cure, but we do have a method to defeat the vaccine – excuse me, the virus. And we have to do that. So, that’s one way to open the economy.” She continued, “The other way is to honor our heroes. Let’s keep these people working. The money that we’re putting into state and local governments to pay our healthcare workers, our first responders, our sanitation, transportation, teachers, and the rest are keeping people working. Otherwise, the states will have to fire some and raise taxes or some combination thereof. So, this is about the economy. It’s about stimulus. And the third is putting money in people’s pockets.” Pelosi later added that she wants to see money spent “to bolster the working families in America who have lost their jobs because of no fault of their own, whom [the] virus is debilitating in terms of getting the economy moving again, until we test, trace, treat, and isolate, as we wear our masks.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

Riots erupted in Western Mexico where protesters set fire to one police officer and physically clashed with several others. Rioters also set fire to multiple police vehicles. The incidents were not over the BLM protests in America, but to protest the death of a local day laborer who was allegedly killed by police for not wearing a coronavirus mask. The riots began on Thursday evening in Guadalajara, Jalisco, when hundreds of protesters took to the streets demanding justice over the death of Alejandro Giovanni Lopez at the hands of local police officers in May.

Amazon failed to protect its employees from the coronavirus at a New York warehouse facility, according to a lawsuit filed by three employees from the warehouse. AFP reported that the complaint filed in federal court Wednesday said the “relentless pace of work at Amazon facilities” led to poor working conditions and that company policies “discourage workers from leaving their workstations to wash their hands and from taking the time to wipe down their workstations.” The legal action comes after one employee from Amazon’s Staten Island, New York, facility was fired for speaking out about the company’s response to the coronavirus. Amazon, however, claimed the employee was disobeying protocol about what to do in the pandemic. One of the three workers in the suit claimed they caught coronavirus “from workers who were explicitly or implicitly encouraged to continue attending work and prevented from adequately washing their hands or sanitizing their workstations,” according to the lawsuit. The three workers and their families are seeking a number of changes, including a more transparent leave and sick time policy, better contact tracing for infected workers, and back pay for quarantine leave. The complaint alleges that Amazon continued to allow workers on the job even after they made contact with infected individuals. Amazon, which received high praise during the early part of the pandemic for hiring 175,000 additional employees to deal with increased demand, says it has improved its health and safety at its facilities. “We are saddened by the tragic impact COVID-19 has had on communities across the globe, including on some Amazon team members and their family and friends. From early March to May 1, we offered our employees unlimited time away from work, and since May 1 we have offered leave for those most vulnerable or who need to care for children or family members,” a spokesperson for the tech giant said in a statement. “We also invested $4 billion from April to June on COVID-related initiatives,” the statement continued, “including over $800 million in the first half of this year on safety measures like temperature checks, masks, gloves, enhanced cleaning and sanitization, extended pay and benefits options, testing, and more. This includes two weeks paid leave for any COVID diagnosis or quarantine, and launching a $25 million fund to support our partners and contractors.” But Amazon has had trouble putting its money where its mouth is. The company recently ended hazard pay for its warehouse workers instituted after the outbreak of the coronavirus while Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos had a net worth increase of $32 billion since January. The company’s record on censorship has also led much to be desired. Amazon recently banned a book about the coronavirus from lockdown critic Alex Berenson after Bezos and company suggested that he, “Please consider removing references to COVID-19 for this book.” When Berenson refused, they banned his book from being featured on Amazon’s Kindle Direct Service.

Beijing’s decision to hide the severity of the novel coronavirus during the early stages of the outbreak, a move that allowed the disease to spill over to other countries, has rendered communist China an “existential threat” to the globe, a survivor of the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre proclaimed on Wednesday. China is the birthplace of the lethal and highly contagious Chinese coronavirus. Referring to China’s coronavirus “cover-up” during a Tiananmen remembrance event online on Wednesday hosted by Students for a Free Tibet, Fengsuo Zhou, a survivor of the massacre and founder of Humanitarian China, declared, “With this communist party in power, the world is doom to repeat such a disaster.” “This totalitarian regime, its globalization, and digital power, it cannot coexist with the universal values we love,” he added.  “Today’s China, under the CCP [Chinese Communist Party], it has become an existential threat to the world because there’s a pandemic we are all suffering from all over the world,” the Tiananmen massacre survivor explained. “This was because of a cover-up because there’s no freedom of people who can talk. There’s no way.” His comments came on the eve of the 31st anniversary of the incident in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square in which Chinese communist troops thwarted student-led protests in a bloody crackdown on June 4 and 5, 1989. Demonstrators were calling for democracy, free speech, and a free press, among other things. Although there is no official count, as the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has endeavored to keep precise information about the incident a secret, estimates place the number of casualties in the thousands. Alluding to China’s muzzling of whistleblower doctors who did not toe the CCP line of keeping silent about COVID-19, Zhou noted during the event on Wednesday: Even the doctors, for example, very early [in the coronavirus outbreak], end of last year, Dr. Li Wenliang, discovered that this was striking like SARS [Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome]. He raised alarms to his internal circle — his friends, and family – warning them and he was censored. Later he died of it, months later, and that’s why it spread to so many people and now. So many killed and so many infected. Health officials have named the coronavirus itself SARS CoV-2. The Trump administration has lambasted Beijing for allowing the lethal and highly contagious novel coronavirus to spread by mismanaging its response and covering up the extent of the outbreak during its early stages, with the help of the China-influenced World Health Organization (W.H.O.), a United Nations entity. U.S. intelligence and independent assessments have determined that China did cover up the severity of the coronavirus. Beijing reportedly muzzled and jailed whistleblowers and critics in a move that allowed the disease to spread and ravage other countries. Both China, the birthplace of the novel coronavirus, and the W.H.O. have denied the assertions. In late May, Trump announced he was severing ties with the W.H.O., ending U.S. taxpayer-funded aid to the U.N. agency for not doing enough to stop the spread of the virus. America is the agency’s top source of funding. The Trump administration has also taken action to prevent China from stealing research for vaccines and treatments to combat the Chinese coronavirus.

Chinese dissidents and human rights advocates gathered online Wednesday evening for a candlelight vigil to remember those killed during the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, urging the world not to look away or tolerate communist China’s crimes. The Victims of Communism Memorial Fund, a human rights organization dedicated to carrying the memory of those afflicted by left-wing totalitarianism, organized and broadcast the event. Given ongoing Chinese coronavirus social distancing measures, speakers “attended” the event from separate locations. The event occurred in the shadow of vandals, acting amid a nationwide wave of radical leftist violence, defacing Washington, DC’s, Victims of Communism memorial – a statue of the “Goddess of Liberty,” which Tiananmen protesters hoisted in the square before the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) rolled its tanks in.  In addition to discussing the lasting legacy of the pro-democracy advocates killed on June 4, 1989, in Beijing, the speakers noted that the communist policies that led to the complete erasure of the Tiananmen Square massacre from the Chinese internet, Chinese history books, and the Chinese public memory in the country are behind the obfuscation that resulted in extended delays in alerting the world to the potential threat of the newly discovered coronavirus in Wuhan, China. “Unfortunately, the evil regime of the Chinese Communist Party [CCP] is still raging on the land of China, and it is still using brutal and cruel methods to suppress and persecute the Chinese people,” Chen Guangcheng, a Chinese human rights attorney and former political prisoner, said at the vigil. “Not only we must not forget the CCP’s June 4th massacre, but we must also record each and every crime that the CCP has done to persecute the Chinese people over the past 30 years, and be prepared to hold them accountable.” “The appeasement policy must come to an end,” he added. Chen made the case that the communist regime’s “existence poses great threats to the freedom, security, and health of the people around the world. … in short, if the CCP evil regime is not destroyed, the world would not have real security and freedom.” “When a regime runs roughshod on its own people, it will sooner or later bring disasters beyond its border in one way or another,” Jianli Yang, the founder and president of Citizen Power Initiatives for China, said at the event, making the argument that an appropriated outraged global responses to the Tiananmen massacre would have prevented an emboldened China from deceiving the world on the coronavirus pandemic. “It is a well-established fact that if, when the coronavirus first broke out in Wuhan, there had been any space in society and government to sound the alarm – if the government had not suppressed the truth and misled the world – hundreds of thousands of lives would have been saved,” Yang said. “By the same token, if the Chinese communist regime, instead of slaughtering the Tiananmen protesters, had accepted their request of political reform, the world would not have been plunged into the catastrophe we are experiencing today.” Leaked Chinese documents show that the first diagnosed cases of novel coronavirus in Wuhan were identified in November 2019. China did not make public the discovery of a new virus until January, and multiple reports have revealed evidence that Beijing pressured the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) to hide evidence that the virus was transmissible from person to person. Pastor Bob Fu, the head of the Christian human rights organization China Aid, asserted that Beijing is using “the same pattern of lying, covering up, and afflicting so many millions of lives” in its response to the pandemic as it did with the crackdown in 1989. The Chinese Communist Party has been claiming [throughout] the past 31 years that nobody had been killed in Tiananmen Square, so they are good at telling lies and covering up,” Fu said. “A year ago, the Chinese communist regime unleashed this coronavirus, the Communist Party virus, to not only afflict millions of Chinese, but still afflicting millions, hundreds of millions of citizens around the globe.” “Because of that, millions of American children and throughout the world are not able to go to school. Millions of moms cannot send their children, cannot bring their children to churches, the synagogues, to mosques. This is a crime against humanity,” he affirmed. The Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation concluded the event by offering in absentia its Human Rights Award to Chen Qiushi, a citizen journalist who disappeared, likely detained by Chinese political police, while attempting to report on the reality in Wuhan at the height of the outbreak there. Participants then all lit candles in their homes in honor of those who died fighting for basic human dignity 31 years ago. Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.

On Thursday morning, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer told protesters to wear a mask and stay six feet apart. Later in the day, she appeared to violate her own rules. “I encourage everyone who is protesting, if you are out demonstrating or out congregating at all, please wear a mask and please try to stay six feet away from others,” she said on Mojo In The Morning. Whitmer, who is angling to be Joe Biden’s vice presidential running mate, participated in a protest in downtown Detroit over the death of George Floyd. She marched along as the closely packed large group chanted, “Hands up, don’t shoot,” and “This is what democracy looks like.” Whitmer, wearing a cloth mask, was standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Bishop Charles Ellis and Lt. Gov. Garland Gilchrist. VIDEO: Hundreds marching today in a walk to honor the life of George Floyd.

It must be a step forward in this march toward justice.” – @GovWhitmer pic.twitter.com/jv0qE6d7S8 — Chris Meagher (@chrismeagher) June 4, 2020  The Detroit News asked Whitmer’s office about the apparent hypocrisy. Tiffany Brown claimed the “unity march” didn’t violate Whitmer’s latest order because it states, “Nothing in this order shall be taken to abridge protections guaranteed by the state or federal constitution.” “That includes the right to peaceful protest,” she said.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer told radio show Mojo In The Morning on Thursday that she understands the “Defund Police” sentiment being pushed on social media by young people in the wake of George Floyd’s death. “What would the world be like without police?” Whitmer was asked by one of the hosts.  “I understand the frustration and the sentiment,” the governor responded, adding that “the youth of our country are going to take up the lead soon,” but that she’s “concerned about the sweeping observations people have.” The hosts noted U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) shared similar anti-police views on Twitter, such as this that she retweeted: Trump has given a green light to cops and militias to beat, maim and kill people with impunity.  He has now illegally activated the military to maintain power and use force on civilians. The red line has been crossed too many times.  He must resign.  Our lives depend on it. pic.twitter.com/DLmBwHKgfU — Movement 4 Black Lives (@Mvmnt4BlkLives) June 2, 2020  Whitmer touted quotas in the Michigan State Police, saying she has created an “equity and inclusion office,” which will increase minority applicants to “at least” 25 percent and the female trooper pool by 20 percent. As the appearance concluded, the governor was confronted by a caller who said he was “insulted” when Whitmer told residents that they should “Google” how to cut their own hair amid the ongoing lockdown of the state. He told her 49 other states are allowing salon services, a stat she disputed. “I made an off-hand comment about if you needed a trim you could Google it,” Whitmer said. She said barbers and stylists are “professionals.” “If my comment offended people, I do apologize for that. It certainly wasn’t my intent.” The caller also asked Whitmer what data she is looking at to inform her decisions. She didn’t answer that question. Kyle Olson is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) on Thursday said he is hoping to “get to ‘yes'” on having the Sunshine State host the Republican National Convention in August. “But to just rule out a convention at this stage, I think, is a mistake,” DeSantis said during a Thursday appearance on Fox & Friends. “So we’ve said we want to get to ‘yes’ on it, and I think you’ll be able to do it.” “We understand that there’s a virus. What can we do to be able to have activity in a way that’s safe?” the governor, who is moving the bulk of the state to stage two of reopening on Friday, told the network. “To just say no to everything, I don’t think is going to work. So we want to be able to do it, and I think we could do it in a safe way,” he added, urging officials to “be creative”: The last thing you would want is [for] delegates [to] go and end up getting ill … but I think that there’s probably ways we can do it. So, ‘We want to get to yes on it’ has basically been my message. Let’s be creative, and let’s figure out a way to do it. President Trump on Tuesday announced that he is in search of a different place to host the upcoming Republican National Convention — an announcement that followed North Carolina officials failing to guarantee that the convention would be able to proceed in Charlotte as planned due to coronavirus-related concerns: Had long planned to have the Republican National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, a place I love. Now, @NC_Governor Roy Cooper and his representatives refuse to guarantee that we can have use of the Spectrum Arena – Spend millions of dollars, have everybody arrive, and… — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 3, 2020  …millions of dollars, and jobs, for the State. Because of @NC_Governor, we are now forced to seek another State to host the 2020 Republican National Convention. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 3, 2020  “We have been committed to a safe RNC convention in North Carolina and it’s unfortunate they never agreed to scale down and make changes to keep people safe,” Gov. Roy Cooper (D) responded. “Protecting public health and safety during this pandemic is a priority,” he added: We have been committed to a safe RNC convention in North Carolina and it’s unfortunate they never agreed to scale down and make changes to keep people safe. Protecting public health and safety during this pandemic is a priority. — Governor Roy Cooper (@NC_Governor) June 3, 2020  Jacksonville, Florida, is among cities under consideration — cities that include Nashville, Las Vegas, and Orlando — to host the political event: We welcome the opportunity to host the @GOPconvention in Jacksonville.

I’m hopeful, but that’s a heavy lift,” he continued. “They need a home and here is where the red carpet would be rolled out by our governor, by Mayor Curry, and by the Republican Party and Duval County like no other city in America,” said Dean Black, chairman of the Republican Party of Duval County. “It is a battleground city, a battleground state, a battleground county, and I think our chances are extremely, extremely good,” he added. The convention is slated to take place August 24-27.

No new cases of the novel coronavirus have been reported among those who flocked to the Lake of the Ozarks over Memorial Day weekend, a top Missouri health official revealed on Wednesday. “The answer, to our knowledge, is no,” Dr. Randall Williams, Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, said on Wednesday when asked if there were emerging cases stemming from the crowded weekend. Concerns escalated after throngs of partygoers flocked to the Lake of the Ozarks, ignoring both social distancing guidelines and the broader call to avoid large crowds. One of the attendees, who reportedly visited various bars, restaurants, and an outdoor swimming pool, later tested positive for the virus and may have been contagious during the getaway: No covid concerns at the lake of the ozarks😳 #loto pic.twitter.com/Yrb4UNM64u — Scott Pasmore (@scottpasmoretv) May 24, 2020  Positive COVID-19 patient was at crowded Lake of the Ozarks bars over Memorial Day weekend https://t.co/L5AASU2YBR — KMOV (@KMOV) May 29, 2020  At the time, the St. Louis Metropolitan Pandemic Task Force warned that the crowds could cause “needless suffering and potential strain to our health care systems.” “Without a doubt, this type of activity, this type of behavior increases the risk of transmission, which means it can only go in one direction,” Dr. Alex Garza said at the time. St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson also sharply criticized the crowds, deeming their actions “irresponsible and dangerous.” Despite that — and the lack of adherence to guidelines, no new cases stemming from the Lake of the Ozarks partiers have been reported. According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, during Wednesday’s press conference, officials also detailed the overall decrease in positive cases and the “big drop in the number of hospitalizations from COVID-19.” “Our hospitals are not overwhelmed. Our positivity rate continues to decline. People are recovering, and we are moving forward,” Gov. Mike Parson (R) said. The revelation comes as protests, sparked by the death of George Floyd, broke out in the streets after weeks of lockdown orders and social distancing guidelines, which warn against large gatherings. “We don’t know what will happen to these numbers after we see the results of lots of people being together in very large groups during the demonstrations and protests,” Mayor Krewson said, signaling concern. “Some folks were wearing masks, some folks weren’t. But certainly, folks were not social distancing,” she added. “So we’ll see — fingers crossed — let’s hope that doesn’t result in a big bump up.” “As far as whether hospitals are able to breathe a sigh of relief after Memorial Day gatherings, Garza said officials ‘will give it a couple more days,'” the Dispatch added.

A person with knowledge of the situation says the NBA’s Board of Governors has approved a 22-team format for restarting the league season in late July at the Disney campus near Orlando, Florida. The format calls for each team playing eight games to determine playoff seeding plus the possible utilization of a play-in tournament for the final spot in the Eastern Conference and Western Conference postseason fields, said the person who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Thursday because the league had not yet revealed the vote result publicly. It is the most significant step yet in the process of trying to resume a season that was suspended nearly three months ago because of the coronavirus pandemic. There are numerous other details for the league to continue working through — including finalizing specifics of what the testing plan will be once teams arrive next month at the ESPN Wide World Of Sports complex and the calculating the financial ramifications of playing a shortened regular season. Another person, also speaking to AP on condition of anonymity because the details of the ongoing talks have not been publicly released, said the National Basketball Players Association and the NBA are continuing to work on a “lengthy” medical protocols document. The details of that document will be shared with teams once those discussions are completed, said the person, who added that teams should receive them in plenty of time for them to prepare for expected mid-July arrivals at the Disney-ESPN complex. If all 22 teams that are going to Disney play their allotted eight games before the postseason begins, the NBA would play 1,059 games in this regular season. That means 171 regular season games would be canceled, which could cost players around $600 million in salary. Those 22 clubs would play somewhere between 71 and 75 regular season games if the Disney portion of the schedule is completed, down from the customary 82-game slate. The teams who didn’t qualify for the restart will see their seasons end after having played somewhere between 64 and 67 games. But one of the biggest hurdles is now cleared, and if things go according to plan an NBA champion for a season unlike any other will be crowned in October. The season could go into that month if the league goes ahead with its plan for the same playoff rules as usual, that being every round utilizing a best-of-seven format. Thursday’s move by the board of governors — one that came, coincidentally, on the same day this season’s NBA Finals would have started if these were normal times — was largely a formality. The NBA considered countless restart options after suspending the season on March 11, whittled that list down to four possibilities last week and from there the 22-team plan quickly began gaining momentum. The 22-team plan includes all teams that were holding playoff spots when the season was stopped, plus all other clubs within six games of a postseason berth. Milwaukee, the Los Angeles Lakers, Boston and reigning NBA champion Toronto had already clinched playoff berths. Now with only eight games remaining for each team, it means that eight other clubs — Miami, Indiana, Philadelphia, the Los Angeles Clippers, Denver, Utah, Oklahoma City and Houston — have postseason spots secured, and Dallas virtually has one as well. That leaves nine teams vying for three remaining playoff berths. In the East, Brooklyn, Orlando and Washington are in the race for two spots. In the West, Memphis, Portland, New Orleans, Sacramento, San Antonio and Phoenix will jostle for one spot. If the gap between eighth place and ninth place in either conference is four games or less when the shortened regular season ends, those teams will go head-to-head for the No. 8 seed. The team in ninth place would have to go 2-0 in a two-game series to win the berth; otherwise, the No. 8 seed would advance to the postseason. Thursday’s decision also means that the seasons for Atlanta, Cleveland, New York, Golden State, Minnesota, Detroit, Chicago and Charlotte are over. The Knicks will miss the playoffs for the seventh consecutive season, the third-longest current drought in the league behind Sacramento and Phoenix — who still have chances of getting into the playoffs this season. And with the Hawks not moving on, it also means Vince Carter has almost certainly played the final game of his 22-year NBA career — the longest in league history. Carter, the first player in NBA history to appear in four different decades, has steadfastly insisted that he is retiring after this season. He appeared in 1,541 NBA games, behind only Robert Parish (1,611) and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (1,560) on the league’s all-time list.

The vast majority of counties in Florida are moving into the next stage of reopening on Friday, Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) announced on Wednesday. Almost the entire state will be moving into the second phase of reopening after a month in phase one. Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach, which were hit particularly hard by the novel coronavirus, will be excluded. However, they can seek approval to enter into the second phase of reopening with a letter from the county mayor or administrator. DeSantis explained on Wednesday: We started with phase one about a month ago but we only did the 64 counties, excluding the three large southeast Florida counties and the reason why we did that was those southeast Florida counties represented I think at that time about 60 percent of all the cases hospitalizations and fatalities, they still represent the bulk of those. The governor already eased some of the restrictions lifted in phase two, allowing salons and barbershops to operate at a limited capacity. Nonetheless, phase two allows bars and pubs to operate at a 50 percent capacity inside and full capacity outside, and restaurants will be able to offer top-bar seating. Phase two also allows retail stores and gyms to operate at full capacity while maintaining sanitization and social distancing guidelines. Entertainment businesses are also permitted to operate at 50 percent capacity. That includes movie theaters, bowling alleys, concert houses, playhouses, and auditoriums. People are still encouraged to avoid gatherings of more than 50, and DeSantis’s administration advises that employees of nursing homes and long-term care facilities undergo coronavirus testing “on a routine basis”: pic.twitter.com/jJRHYVjLFx — Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) June 3, 2020  pic.twitter.com/lrbjQE1uhZ — Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) June 3, 2020  pic.twitter.com/jjGNSTcFyC — Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) June 3, 2020  For more information on Phase 2 in Florida, see the full presentation here: https://t.co/OhtQbk99Vk pic.twitter.com/W7z98lgkil — Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) June 3, 2020  Florida, which has a population of over 21 million, had 60,183 total coronavirus cases and 2,607 related deaths, according to the Florida Department of Health’s numbers on Thursday.

Amazon, the world’s dominant online distributor of books and e-books, censored a book about the Chinese virus from lockdown critic and former New York Times reporter Alex Berenson. Jeff Bezos and company gave Berenson a suggestion on how to adjust his approach: “Please consider removing references to COVID-19 for this book.” After widespread criticism of the company, Amazon reversed its decision and has agreed to publish Berenson’s e-book. Berenson’s book, titled Unreported Truths About COVID-19 And Lockdowns Part 1: Introductions and Death Counts and Estimates, was to be the first in a series of short e-books about the coronavirus. The author planned to publish via Amazons’ Kindle Direct service, which allows authors to self-publish electronic books. But Amazon said no. In an email from Amazon that the author published on Twitter, the online retail giant informed the author that the book “does not comply with our guidelines,” and that Amazon customers are being referred to “official sources” about the virus. “Due to the rapidly changing nature of information around the COVID-19 virus, we are referring customers to official sources for health information about the virus. Please consider removing references to COVID-19 for this book.” Oh fuck me. I can’t believe it. They censored it. pic.twitter.com/GfPEr7OiV2 — Alex Berenson (@AlexBerenson) June 4, 2020  Berenson is well-known for his 2019 book Tell Your Children: The Truth About Marijuana, Mental Illness and Violence, which challenged the prevailing liberal orthodoxy that cannabis has little to no harmful effects. Berenson’s book argued that the drug is in fact linked to mental illness and violence. In comments to Breitbart News, Berenson explained the topic of his now-censored e-book on the coronavirus, calling it “An introduction and a discussion of death coding, death counts, and who is really dying from COVID, as well as a worst-case estimate of deaths with no mitigation efforts.” Berenson added, “I briefly considered censorship but assumed I wouldn’t have a problem both because of my background, because anyone who reads the booklet will realize it is impeccably sourced, nary a conspiracy theory to be found, and frankly because Amazon shouldn’t be censoring anything that doesn’t explicitly help people commit criminal behavior. (Books intended to help adults groom children for sexual relationships, for example, should be off-limits – though about 10 years ago Amazon did not agree and only backed down from selling a how-to guide for pedophiles in the face of public outrage.)” “I have no idea if the decision was made by a person, an automated system, or a combination (i.e. the system flags anything with COVID-19 or coronavirus in the title and then a person decides on the content),” said Berenson. “I am considering my options, including making the booklet available on my Website and asking people to pay on an honor system, but that will not solve the problem of Amazon’s censorship.” “Amazon dominates both the electronic and physical book markets, and if it denies its readers a chance to see my work, I will lose the chance to reach the people who most need to learn the truth — those who don’t already know it.” For updates on Berenson’s book and upcoming works, you can follow him on Twitter. Following the publication of this article and widespread pressure on social media, Amazon reversed its decision and agreed to publish Berenson’s book.

Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D) joined a large gathering of protesters in Harrisburg on Wednesday, just weeks after slamming local leaders and business owners as “cowardly” for moving to reopen their counties and businesses outside of his far-reaching lockdown orders. Wolf, who threatened business owners who signaled they would move to reopen their businesses outside of his guidelines, marched with protesters in Harrisburg on Wednesday, seemingly unbothered by the stark violations to his own orders. Dauphin County, home of Harrisburg, moved to the yellow phase last week, which prohibits large gatherings of more than 25: I want Pennsylvanians to — as safely as possible — get back to the activities they most enjoy. Remember that as long as #COVID19 is a threat, no social activity outside your home where you will run into others is completely without risk of catching this virus. pic.twitter.com/Y7OeoqNl02 — Governor Tom Wolf (@GovernorTomWolf) May 30, 2020  Photos show Wolf congregating with a large crowd, which is prohibited under the yellow phase of reopening.

May 11 business owners were called cowards for wanting to reopen their businesses, and today the governor is actually marching in that. Is that not in violation of your order and his order for large gatherings?” a reporter asked. “The governor has always said that people have the right to protest and to demonstrate and the right of free speech,” Levine, whose birth name is Richard, said. “And so overall, we want large gatherings — such as maybe a party or some type of concert — to be under 250 people. But we are not restricting people’s right to protest,” Levine continued. “There are obviously significant social issues, you know, that are present that people feel that they need to have a voice, and so the governor is always supportive of that and is participating in that,” he added: This is why you have reporters at press conferences. Levine is asked about @GovernorTomWolf calling officials coward and then marching today in Harrisburg. Wait for the end. pic.twitter.com/6VkaYyMpwr — Real_Dave_La_Torre 🍿 (@David_LaTorre) June 3, 2020  Wolf made waves last month after accusing business owners and leaders, clamoring to reopen amid his restrictions, of engaging in a “cowardly act.” He also said that lawmakers “urging businesses to risk their lives and risk the lives of their customers or their employees by opening prematurely” were “engaging in behavior that is both selfish and unsafe.” “To those politicians who decide to cave in to this coronavirus, they need to understand the consequences of their cowardly act,” Wolf said, lecturing business owners as well. “By opening before the evidence suggests you should, you’re taking undue risks with the safety of your customers,” the governor warned. “That’s not only morally wrong; that’s also really bad business,” he continued, threatening them with the loss of their health department certificate, liquor license, or certificate of occupancy.

The former head of Britain’s foreign secret intelligence office, Sir Richard Dearlove, has claimed that coronavirus originated in a Chinese laboratory and escaped, quoting a study that found some elements of COVID-19 had been “inserted” and did not evolve naturally. He also suggested that the academic community suppressed the original paper because it was explicit in its blame of China. Scientists from around the world maintain that the virus originated in either bats or pangolins before spontaneously jumping to humans. However, the 75-year-old former spy chief referenced a Norwegian-British study that points to a man-made interference in the virus. According a paper written by Professor Angus Dalgleish of St George’s Hospital, University of London, and Norwegian virologist Birger Sørensen seen by The Telegraph, scientists had found “inserted sections” on the virus’s surface. It had “unique fingerprints” which could not have been a result of natural evolution but likely “indicative of purposive manipulation” in a lab capable of producing “chimeric viruses of high potency”. Sir Richard said the study was a “very important contribution to a debate which is now starting about how the virus evolved and how it got out and broke out as a pandemic”. He told the newspaper that the study will “shift the debate”, causing countries to “rethink how it treats its relationship with China and how the international community behaves towards the Chinese leadership”. The paper has not been without controversy, with one scientist, John Fredrik Moxnes of the Norwegian military, seeking to have his name removed from it. Other members of the scientific community have dismissed the findings. The original version of the paper was not accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Academic journals had rejected it on the grounds that it was “unsuitable for publication”. Sir Richard, however, suggested that this reception to the first paper may be due to its politically incorrect findings. The former spy chief revealed that the article had been rewritten several times. An earlier version, seen by the newspaper, said it was factually correct to call coronavirus the “Wuhan virus” (Wuhan having two labs studying bat coronaviruses). It had also said that they had proven “beyond reasonable doubt that the Covid-19 virus is engineered”. “We are aware that these findings could have political significance and raise troubling questions,” the original paper had said. After being rewritten to reduce explicit blame on China, the paper was eventually accepted for publication in the Quarterly Review of Biophysics Discovery. China Lied, People Died: Five Eyes Report Details CCP Coronavirus Cover-up https://t.co/sHLCxA7ZRt — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 2, 2020  “This [the first] article was submitted to a… journal, which refused it within a week of receiving it, and in the same period accepted for publication two or three Chinese articles that relate to the virus, within 48 hours,” Sir Richard told The Telegraph’s Planet Normal podcast published on Wednesday. “So I mean, as this debate about the virus develops, I think all this material is going to be in print and is going to embarrass a number of people, I think. Let’s suggest that the Chinese maybe have too much say in their journals, in what appears and what doesn’t.” China has maintained that it was not responsible for the outbreak. But reports in recent months have revealed that China had deliberately destroyed evidence about the origins of the virus and “disappeared” whistleblower scientists who spoke out about coronavirus. The coronavirus pandemic coincides with growing tensions around Hong Kong as well as the rising concern of the security risks of engaging Huawei in building the UK’s 5G. Mr Dearlove called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to reverse his decision on Huawei, saying: “It’s important that we do not put any of our critical infrastructure in the hands of Chinese interests. So telecommunications, Huawei, nuclear power stations, and then things that, you know, we require and need in a crisis, like PPE. “We have allowed China so much rope that we are now suffering the consequences, and it’s time to pull the rope in and to tighten the way we do business. It’s very, very important that we keep a keen eye on this and do not allow the Chinese to, as it were, benefit strategically from this situation that has been imposed on all of us.” EU Kowtows to China, Revises Coronavirus Disinfo Report After Pressure from Chinese Communist Party https://t.co/BVGmBzWBxw — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 25, 2020 

While I no longer believe in polls, I do believe in trends, and the current polling trends for President Trump are terrible. Over the past seven or eight weeks, according to the reliable RealClearPolitics Poll of Polls… Trump’s job approval has sunk from 47.3 percent to 43.5. His disapproval number has jumped from 49.5 percent to 54 percent. The public’s approval of Trump’s handling of the coronavirus has completely flipped, from 51 percent approve to just 43 percent approve — from 45 percent disapprove to 54 percent disapprove. Against Joe Biden in their upcoming 2020 match-up, Trump went from a 4.4 point deficit to what is now nearly an eight-point deficit. And let’s not forget that in 2016, the national polls called the race right. Though not as sharp, the trend is the same in the swing states — moving away from Trump. But… It is important to remember how wrong the state polling was in 2016. The good news in the polling, and it’s not a small thing, is enthusiasm. In the June 1 Washington Post poll, Biden beats Trump by ten points, 53 to 43 percent. In late March, Biden was only up two points, 49 to 47 percent. But on the issue of enthusiasm, 90 percent of Trump’s voters are enthusiastic, compared to just 74 percent of Biden voters. The other two pieces of good news are that Slow Joe Biden is a terrible politician and there’s plenty of time and a million news cycles between now and Election Day. If you don’t believe the polling trends, stop reading here, because I do believe the trends, and I’m going to analyze why I believe Trump’s numbers are sinking… During a crisis, a president really only has one job: to project steadiness. That’s it. That’s all the American people really want from their leaders. That’s why Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-NY) can screw absolutely everything up with his coronavirus response and still enjoy huge approval numbers. That’s why Iraq could fall completely apart on former President George W. Bush in 2004 and he still won his reelection. That’s why a radical like Barack Obama could beat war hero John McCain, who came off as erratic and neurotic. Calm, cool, unruffled, and steady is the key… Trump either refuses to behave in his own best interest during the dual crises of the coronavirus and these riots, or he’s incapable of behaving in a way that’s in his own best interest. You know, I like Trump being Trump … when times are good. When 100,000 people are not dying, when the economy is not imploding, and when dozens of Democrat-run cities are not on fire, Trump being Trump makes my day. I like that he hits back at the media, hijacks the news cycle with his Twitter feed, and blasts back twice as hard at his critics. I not only like it; I think it’s good politics, most especially when Deep State Traitors like James Comey are trying to legitimize a coup. I’ll tell you something else I have no problem during normal times… If Trump wants to troll the execrable Joe Scarborough over a dead intern. I’ll pop the popcorn. That scumbag Scarborough and his Trophy Wife have been falsely accusing Trump of everything from being a Russian spy to genocide… In normal times, during good times, I would find that hilarious and just. When 100,000 Americans are dead, and the economy is imploding, and dozens of Democrat-run cities are on fire, I find it childish, selfish, and self-destructive. As is encouraging your supporters to show up in what will almost certainly be a violent confrontation in front of the White House. As is repeatedly shouting “LAW & ORDER!” out of nowhere. As is re-tweeting a guy who says the “only good Democrat is a dead Democrat.” As is continuing to engage in grudges, grievances, silly insults, and petty fights. What’s even more frustrating is that Trump’s done a solid job managing both the coronavirus and the riots. He’s also said a lot of the right things, but his refusal to calm down, project steadiness, and rise above it all is undermining all the good work. Trump’s problems all started right here — he was doing just fine and earning solid approval numbers handling the coronavirus until he allowed the corporate media to bait him into overriding his own message and burying vital information the public needed under those endless and godawful briefings where he wrestled with the media pigs for hours. To what end? Why? As far as I’m concerned, that was all Trump’s fault because he allowed his (perfectly understandable) hatred for the media to get the best of him, and the result was not only the implosion of his own approval ratings, but necessary public information imploding in a fit of presidential pique. Over the past six or so weeks, he’s at least put an end to those destructive briefings, but the presidential steadiness is still not there … because Lil’ Joey Scarborough said something mean. For five years, Trump has told us he is perfectly capable of acting presidential if he wants to, but when sliding poll numbers can’t make him want to act presidential, I start to wonder. When projecting steadiness and calm would go a long way towards beating the bastards Trump wants so badly to beat and he still doesn’t, I start to wonder. I’m still going to crawl over glass to vote for the guy, but I’m pretty disgusted right now. Forty million people are out of work, our cities are on fire… Trump needs to do better, for the country’s sake and his own. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.

The British government is reportedly talking with Japanese firm NEC and South Korean company Samsung about diversifying the UK’s options for technology, in another strong signal that Britain is serious about pulling Chinese Huawei out of her telecommunications networks. British officials spoke with NEC in May about bringing the Japanese company into Britain’s 5G market through a trial programme called “5G Create”, according to a source speaking to Bloomberg. The Johnson administration is also reportedly speaking with South Korean company Samsung about developing 5G infrastructure, according to the Bloomberg report published on Wednesday. The British government has been under pressure from international allies after Johnson gave the go-ahead to Huawei to build 35 per cent of the UK’s next-generation 5G network. Five Eyes intelligence-sharing partners the United States and Australia have warned that engagement of the effectively state-owned Chinese company was a security risk, with Huawei able to build a backdoor into British networks, which can be used by Beijing spies. Last month, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), part of the signals intelligence service the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), announced that it would conduct a security review of Huawei’s involvement in Britain’s 5G following U.S. sanctions on the company. Tory rebels who are against the prime minister’s plans to employ Huawei hope that the report is a means of formally cutting ties with Huawei over the 5G deal. China Trying to Drive Wedge Between UK and U.S. with Huawei, Says Senator https://t.co/JDmkm8dADu — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 3, 2020  Prime Minister Johnson declined to deny on Wednesday he is looking for a way out of the arrangement, which has not yet been passed into law. He said during Wednesday’s Downing Street press briefing: “On high-risk vendors in our critical national infrastructure… we’ve got to make sure that we have solutions for the UK that protect UK security.” But periphery reports strongly suggest that has changed his mind. Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Dominic Raab is reportedly leading up “Project Defend”, which will examine the UK’s economic resilience. It will report on vulnerable supply chains that are strategic for national security but which may be dependent on foreign countries, including China. The review was reportedly activated after the UK struggled to source medical equipment during the coronavirus lockdown, with items like masks and ventilators coming from the communist superpower. It is believed the review will be used as a blueprint for self-sufficiency. An earlier report had revealed that the UK was reliant on China for 71 “critical goods” categories including electronics, personal protective equipment (PPE), and pharmaceuticals. Even if the UK does pull Huawei out of future 5G plans, the Chinese tech firm still makes up around one-third of the country’s 4G mobile network service antennas and is used by major providers EE, Three, and Vodaphone. British officials have also therefore been tasked with drawing up plans to pull Huawei out entirely by no later than 2023. Mr Johnson is also said to be exploring state financial aid for tech companies to replace dependence on Chinese tech firms. The need to shore up and protect British companies come after Nigel Farage had warned that Chinese interests are lining up for a “fire sale” of British tech businesses affected by the economic downturn caused by the Wuhan coronavirus, with senior Conservatives echoing those concerns.

A racehorse named for Dr. Anthony Fauci reached the finish line at a safe enough distance from others that would have made his namesake proud. Fauci the 2-year-old colt finished a distant second to a horse named Prisoner and was well ahead of third-place Indoctrinate in his much-anticipated debut Wednesday at Belmont Park. In a sport known for topical names, Fauci is the first of a series of horses inspired by the coronavirus pandemic and the latest tribute to the respected director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Social Distancing, Self Isolation, Flatten the Curve, Herd Immunity and No Spectators have also been registered with the Jockey Club. Co-owner Phillip Antonacci picked the name Fauci in mid-March after the 79-year-old started doing daily coronavirus briefings from the White House. The Antonacci family, like Fauci, is Italian-American and from Brooklyn. “We wanted to honor the service that he’s given to the whole world: beside COVID, fighting all the other infectious his whole life,” Antonacci said. “Throughout the whole thing, he seemed like a voice that knew what was going on and, without trying to be too political, kind of calmed things and provided real data behind what was going on.” Antonacci hoped to name a filly after Dr. Deborah Birx. In the end, though, Antonacci said he didn’t have horse good enough to name after the coordinator of the White House’s virus task force. This colt who debuted Wednesday was named Fauci in part because his owners thought he’d be a special horse. Trainer Wesley Ward has seen that since the then-unnamed horse got to his barn in September. “He’s a beautiful colt, done everything right on the track in the mornings, got a beautiful mind on him to where he’s not fractious or anxious and seems very, very intelligent,” Ward said. “He’s just a real easygoing guy. Not much bothers him.” Antonacci has sensed a lot of hype surrounding the horse because of his name. Since the global pandemic began, Dr. Fauci’s likeness has been used for a plush doll, a bobblehead and a donut, and he has a namesake beer. And now a thoroughbred. “He’s a really, really good horse,” Ward said. “Especially with the name that’s been assigned to him, you know that he’s got to live up to the name.” Ward said depending on how Fauci comes out of his first race, he could be headed to Royal Ascot in England for the Coventry Stakes in mid-June. Fauci’s debut coincided with the first live horse racing in New York since March and amid protests nationwide following death of George Floyd in Minnesota. Jockeys stood for a moment of silence to pay respects for those who died of COVID-19 and in tribute to medical professionals, then took a knee in the paddock prior to the first race as a show of solidarity with protesters in the wake of Floyd’s death. “There’s a lot going on in the world right now and we wanted to show respect to all causes, and to all people, and to show that we here at (the New York Racing Association) support everybody,” jockey Reylu Gutierrez said. “Horse racing, in general, supports all ethnicities. Horse racing is a worldwide sport and it doesn’t matter what color you are, what religion you are, or what ethnicity you are. What matters in horse racing is that we are one.”

Despite starting a gradual return to normal activities this week, Mexico recorded the most Coronavirus fatalities in one day. Mexico ranks seventh in the world for deaths and fourteenth for cases. During their daily news conference, Undersecretary of Health Hugo Lopez Gatell and his staff revealed that Mexico currently has 101,238 confirmed cases and another 44,869 undergoing testing. The nation has recorded 11,729 fatalities tied to the virus. Al 03 de junio de 2020 hay 101,238 casos confirmados, 16,829 confirmados activos y 44,869 sospechosos por #COVID19. Se han registrado 157,354 negativos, 11,729 defunciones confirmadas, 948 defunciones sospechosas y fueron estudiadas 303,461 personas. 1/3 pic.twitter.com/Xlwbbo0KRx — Hugo López-Gatell Ramírez (@HLGatell) June 4, 2020  The government figures show that Mexico recorded 1,092 fatalities in one day, the most to date. Mexico also recorded the most new daily cases with 3,912. Mexico still ranks high globally despite admitting to undercounts. The nation has only conducted a total of 303,461 tests. Lopez Gatell admitted that some of his figures only include cases from government hospitals. This discrepancy has led several state health officials to release their own figures which show between 20-40 percent more cases. Ildefonso Ortiz is an award-winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.

Actress Alicia Silverstone revealed that she has been taking baths with her nine-year-old son while isolated in quarantine due to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. “My son and I take baths together, and when he’s not with me, I take a bath and that really feels nourishing and comforting,” the Clueless star said in a recent interview with the New York Times. This does not appear to be Silverstone’s only headline-making (if not head-scratching) parenting method, as the report added that the actress has also put her son, Bear Blu, on a vegan diet, and that she has even “bird fed” him — chewing food in her own mouth first, before passing it to him to eat. The report added that a spokesperson for Silverstone clarified that Bear Blu prefers a vegan diet. Moreover, in her 2014 book, The Kind Mama, on diet, lifestyle, and parenting, the Ass Backwards actress explained that her son — who was just a few years old a the time — had “never had a drop of medicine,” as Silverstone does not agree with immunization. “People said lots of different things, and I was sort of ‘the freak,'” said the Clueless actress. “And I guess I’ll take pride in that because it is hard to be the person that’s speaking out, and it is hard to be the person that is saying the thing that isn’t what everybody else wants to hear.” In sharing her daily routine while in quarantine, Silverstone said she “always bring[s] everything back to diet.” “When I don’t eat well, I don’t feel well, and then my moods go all over the place,” Silverstone told the New York Times. The report added that while in quarantine, Silverstone also lost her friend and former co-star Mark Blum, who died of the Wuhan coronavirus in March. “It’s a really sad, scary time for so many people,” she said.

TEL AVIV – Israeli researchers have developed a “disinfection tunnel” which they say could enable mass gatherings by spraying visitors with a sanitizing water-based liquid.  The walk-through tunnel, the joint venture of scientists at Bar Ilan University and the Karmiel-based industrial automation company, RD Pack, would reduce the danger of crowds at synagogues, hospitals, schools, sporting events and concerts even while a pandemic rages. The tunnel has the ability to spray thousands of people with an aerosol using electrochemical technology that eliminates bacteria and viruses, including microbes from the coronavirus family. The tunnel itself is made of aluminum and polycarbonate. “When people walk through the tunnel, their whole body gets sprayed with the disinfectant, which works fast and efficiently, and provides the complete sterilization of a person,” said Eran Druker, business development manager at RD Pack. According to the university researchers, the disinfectant is both safe for the environment and for use on humans. “This disinfectant substance is extremely effective, 100 times more so than a regular disinfectant, and the advantage is that the substance is also unstable,” Izaak Cohen, who developed and patented the disinfectant together with Eran Avraham and Doron Aurbach, said. “Due to the substance being unstable, it is more friendly to the environment. Other disinfectants are more stable and remain on you, and can cause all sorts of burns. The more stable they are, the less friendly they are to both you and the environment.”  Dr. Izaak Cohen, a researcher at Bar-Ilan University, walking through the sanitation and disinfection tunnel  (Photo: Yoni Reif) The tunnel is currently awaiting approval from the Health Ministry. “The objective is to create an active process that does not interfere with daily routine,” Druker said. “People think that coronavirus is over, but it is still with us. As people are no longer proactive in disinfection and cleaning, we are creating the opportunity for disinfection and breaking the chain of infection.”  

During an interview with Newsmax TV’s “Spicer and Co.” on Wednesday, President Trump stated that social distancing is needed, it’s too soon to go back to normal, and criticized Democratic elected officials for being “tough as hell on keeping people locked up in their houses” and “very weak” on handling riots and looting. Host and former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer asked, “I haven’t heard a lot about social distancing and gathering since all of these large protests and riots. [Does] that mean that social distancing is over?” Trump responded, “No. It’s not over.” He added, “We want to be back to normal, but it’s a little bit soon, but I watch these protesters, and they’re the ones that are all claiming social distancing, everything else, it’s really interesting. They do that, and then they’re jumping on top of each other by the thousands when they’re screaming and ranting and raving, which is not a good thing. I mean, we’re going to have to see how that works out.” Trump also stated that it’s “very interesting with these liberal mayors, liberal Democrats — and governors, how they’re tough as hell on keeping people locked up in their houses. But when it comes to ending the crime and those stores being broken into, and the looting…they’re very weak on crime.” He also said that the initial shutdowns were needed. Because without them, far more people would have died. Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

A report published Wednesday evening indicated George Floyd had coronavirus approximately two months before his death, though multiple autopsies did not attribute his death to the illness. Ed O’Keefe of CBS News said on Twitter that the official autopsy found George Floyd had coronavirus, which could be a significant development in the case if medical officials follow their pattern of categorizing deaths related to the disease. JUST IN: Official autopsy report finds #GeorgeFloyd had #coronavirus. Hennepin County Medical Examiner's full report says he tested positive April 3. — Ed O'Keefe (@edokeefe) June 4, 2020  According to O’Keefe, who cited the Hennepin County Medical Examiner, Floyd tested positive on April 3rd. Multiple autopsies were completed and arrived at differing conclusions. CBS News reported: Dr. Allecia Wilson, one of the pathologists who conducted the independent autopsy, said Monday afternoon that Floyd died as a result of mechanical asphyxiation. But the report released later Monday by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s office said Floyd died of “cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint and neck compression.” The manner of death was ruled homicide, but the office noted that “is not a legal determination of culpability or intent.” A preliminary autopsy report cited earlier by prosecutors said the county medical examiner’s review “revealed no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation.” In April, Minnesota, along with many other states, began attributing deaths to coronavirus if no test was done and the deceased was suspected of having the illness. Via the Minnesota Department of Health: If a diagnosis of COVID-19 is suspected or likely “ …it is acceptable to report COVID-19 as ‘probable’ or ‘presumed’.” That could have an impact on Floyd’s suspected cause of death. There have been several instances around the country where an individual had COVID-19, but died under unrelated circumstances, and the death was blamed on the virus. In May, a Colorado man had a blood alcohol level of .550 and died of alcohol poisoning, but his cause of death was later changed to coronavirus, Fox News reported. Michigan counted deaths “with COVID-19,” as opposed to “of COIVD-19,” leading some to accuse the state of cooking the numbers. In Alabama, “a bedbound patient with aspiration pneumonia in one lung and a person with a buildup of fluid and partial collapse of one lung” had their deaths attributed to coronavirus, according to the Washington Post. “In this country, we’ve taken a very liberal approach to mortality,” Dr. Deborah Birx said at a press briefing on April 7th. “The intent is, right now, that … if someone dies with COVID-19, we are counting that as a CODID-19 death,” she said.

Former Rep. Allen West (R-FL) highlighted Facebook and Twitter’s politically-driven and arbitrary censorship of information, contrasting the platforms’ facilitation of operations executed by Antifa and Black Lives Matter while censoring disagreement with public health authorities’ positions. West joined Tuesday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with host Rebecca Mansour and special guest host Ed Martin to discuss ongoing unrest, protests, and riots following the death of George Floyd. West remarked, “What infuriates me more than anything else is that these social media platforms are being used by groups like Antifa and Black Lives Matter to organize, to get out their orders and instructions, but when we had everyday Americans that wanted to have rallies about the unconstitutionality of these stay-at-home orders and the lockdowns and shutdowns — I call it illegal martial law and house arrest — Facebook and Twitter threatened to censor them … Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey need to stop making decisions based upon their ideological agendas.” LISTEN:  “[The killing of George Floyd] was heinous,” West stated. “It was offensive. It was evil. It was tyrannical and despotic to see someone put their entire weight in their left knee on the carotid artery of a man who was handcuffed, and his crime was forgery — $20 bills — not armed robbery, not attempted murder, or aggravated assault. So, he was not armed or any danger to any of those four police officers that were there around him.” West continued, “There is no excuse for what we see happening in America. It just goes back to the Rahm Emanuel mantra of never letting a good crisis go to waste.” “Antifa is a domestic terrorist group,” West declared, “and we need to peel the onion back. We need to find the leadership. We need to find the resourcing. Black Lives Matter is no better. Black Lives Matter does not show up in Chicago or any of the other major urban population centers across the country run by Democrats, where you see black-on-black crime. They say nothing about the atrocious fact that 20 million black babies have been murdered in the womb thanks to Planned Parenthood, which was founded by a white supremacist and a racist.” West went on, “I see people cherry-picking and using the theme of racism and being a racist to fit an ideological agenda, and we have got to have strong voices to stand up and push back against this. If we cannot maintain law and order in our streets, then we’re going to see the undermining of our constitutional republic.” “We now have a domestic enemy,” West said. “We have an enemy that, without a doubt, has declared that they want to undermine this constitutional republic. They want to replace it with a governing system that is completely different.” West added, “We cannot have these seditious organizations and groups that are running amok in the United States of America and recruiting people.” November’s elections present a choice between individual sovereignty and collective enslavement, determined West. “It comes down to understanding the right and true relationship between the individual citizen and the institution of government,” West said. “In the United States of America, the individual citizens — if you read our Declaration and our Constitution — are sovereign. And why is the individual sovereign? Because their inalienable rights come from their creator, God, not from man.” West articulated a fundamental distinction between left-wing ideology and conservatism. “There are people that believe that the institution of government should be supreme and sovereign over the individual, and that’s not what we have in America,” West explained. “We have to decide, are we going to be individually sovereign or are we going to be collectively subjugated?” West went on, “We have to decide, do we want to be victors or do we want to be victims? We have to decide, do we want to be economically empowered or do we want to be economically enslaved? There is no greater time in the history of the United States of America to draw a clear delineation in these two very different philosophies of governance.” West concluded by noting the links between Antifa, Black Lives Matter, and the Democrat Party. “Barack Obama said we’re five days away from fundamentally transforming the United States of America, and they believe that they can do that,” West recalled. “That’s why you see them out there on the streets, using fear, intimidation, coercion, and violence to get the ends that they want.” Breitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.

As of June 16, President Donald Trump’s administration will bar all passenger planes originating in China from entry to the U.S. The order, announced by the U.S. Department of Transportation, applies to Air China, China Eastern Airlines Corp, China Southern Airlines Co, Hainan Airlines Holding Co, Sichuan Airlines Co, and Xiamen Airlines Co. Despite the agreement to restrict travel, airlines have continued to regularly ferry passengers from the origin point of the novel coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, both Delta and United have requested permission to resume flights to China, though the country “remains unable” to say when it will “allow U.S. carriers to reinstate scheduled passenger flights,”  according to a formal order signed by the Transportation Department top aviation official Joel Szabat. In a statement on Wednesday, Delta said “we support and appreciate the U.S. government’s actions to enforce our rights and ensure fairness,” while United said it looks forward to resuming passenger service between the United States and China “when the regulatory environment allows us to do so.” The decision will enforce a level of parity between both sides, eliminating the lopsided permissions currently in effect. “We will allow Chinese carriers to operate the same number of scheduled passenger flights as the Chinese government allows ours,” the department said in a separate statement. Additionally, China will no longer be allowed to use charter flights to “further [increase] their advantage over U.S. carriers in providing U.S.-China passenger services.”

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with survivors of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre at the hands of Chinese communist troops on Tuesday afternoon, amid strained relations between the United States and China over the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic and Hong Kong protests. The meeting came two days before the 31st anniversary of the incident in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, where Chinese communist troops thwarted student-led protests in a bloody crackdown on June 4 and 5, 1989. Protesters were calling for democracy, free speech, and a free press, among other things. There is no official death count for the number of victims of communist violence that day, as the Chinese Communist Party has endeavored to keep precise information about it a secret. Most estimates suggest thousands of peaceful protesters, many students, killed by Chinese military forces. Beijing played down the number of casualties, estimating the events led to the death of 241 people (including soldiers) and wounding of 7,000 others, the Encyclopedia Britannica noted. China reportedly sentenced many of those detained in Tiananmen Square to varying lengths of time in prison and executed others. “In the years since the incident, the government generally has attempted to suppress references to it,” Britannica added. “Public commemoration of the incident is officially banned.” In a statement on Wednesday, Morgan Ortagus, a spokesperson for State, revealed that Pompeo met with four of the Tiananmen protesters. Ortagus stated: Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo was honored to meet yesterday with Wang Dan, Su Xiaokang, Liane Lee, and Henry Li – four of the thousands of brave participants in the heroic protests for democracy that were brutally put down by the Chinese Communist Party on June 4, 1989. pic.twitter.com/W6ATJykhre — Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) June 3, 2020  A traditional Chinese-language report from Channel News Asia (CNA) first identified the four participants in the meeting with Pompeo. According to the State Department’s public schedule, Pompeo met with the Tiananmen Square massacre survivors at 2:30 p.m. on Tuesday, June 2. Although China has officially banned public commemoration of the Tiananmen events, Hong Kong residents have held an annual vigil on the anniversary of the crackdown, even after the region reverted to Chinese administration. This year, however, China will not allow Hong Kong to mark the massacre’s anniversary, Pompeo said, describing the move as unprecedented. On Monday, Pompeo wrote on Twitter that the pro-Beijing Hong Kong government did not approve the June 4 Tiananmen vigil, saying: For the first time in 30 years, Hong Kong authorities denied permission to hold the [Tiananmen Vigil]. If there is any doubt about Beijing’s intent, it is to deny Hong Kongers a voice and a choice, making them the same as mainlanders. So much for two systems. It starts; so soon. For the first time in 30 years, Hong Kong authorities denied permission to hold the #TiananmenVigil. If there is any doubt about Beijing’s intent, it is to deny Hong Kongers a voice and a choice, making them the same as mainlanders. So much for two systems. — Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) June 2, 2020  In recent weeks, Hong Kong has been home to pro-democracy protests increasingly challenging the Chinese Communist Party’s tightening grip on the region after Beijing moved to crush the island’s autonomy. U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has lambasted China’s move, threatening to take action against the Asian giant, like stripping Hong Kong of special trading privileges. Under the “One Country, Two Systems” policy signed after Britain handed the island over to Beijing, Hong Kong was granted autonomy while its residents enjoy quasi-democratic freedoms inconceivable in China. Officially, Hong Kong is a special administrative region of communist China. Since taking office as Secretary of State in 2018, Pompeo has issued statements in early June condemning the Tiananmen Massacre. This year is no different. Ortagus, Pompeo’s spokeswoman, stated on Wednesday: Today we honor the brave Chinese people whose peaceful calls for democracy, human rights, and a corruption-free society came to a violent end when the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) sent the People’s Liberation Army into Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989, armed with tanks and guns. … Thirty-one years later, the total number of missing or dead Tiananmen protesters is still unknown. The United States continues to applaud their aspirations, and the American people stand with the families still grieving their lost loved ones, including the courageous Tiananmen Mothers who have never stopped seeking accountability for their children’s deaths, despite great personal hardship and risk. We reiterate our call for a full, public accounting of those killed or missing. We mourn the victims of June 4, 1989, and we stand with the people of China who continue to aspire to a government that protects human rights, fundamental freedoms, and basic human dignity. Pompeo’s meeting with Tiananmen survivors will likely fuel tensions between China and the United States in the South China Sea and beyond. Today, the U.S. protests the PRC’s unlawful South China Sea maritime claims at the @UN. We reject these claims as unlawful and dangerous. Member States must unite to uphold international law and freedom of the seas. #FreeAndOpenIndoPacific https://t.co/h6UCoBnnnb — Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) June 2, 2020  The demonstrations, which reportedly began in May 1989, and the subsequent repression at the hands of Chinese communist troops spilled outside of Beijing to cities across the country and beyond in events that came to be known as the May Fourth Movement. American officials instituted sanctions on China over the 1989 massacre. U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has accused China of allowing the lethal and highly contagious COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, to spread by mismanaging its response and hiding the extent of the outbreak during its initial phase. China, the birthplace of the coronavirus, denies the assertions.

The media is reporting that “health experts” signed an open letter supporting the protests that have, in many American cities, devolved into violent riots that have destroyed neighborhoods and businesses, because “white supremacy is a public health issue” that has contributed to the spread of the coronavirus. The protests were sparked by the death of a black man, George Floyd, who died in police custody in Minneapolis on Memorial Day. The letter is, in fact, signed by physicians, medical organizations, and academics, but scores of others who are described as “community stakeholders” also signed the document. “White supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to COVID-19,” the letter says. The letter also says that while large protests could spread the virus and some of the recommendations like social distancing still apply, “do not disband protests under the guise of maintaining public health for COVID-19 restrictions.” On the other hand, the letter said protesters should not be arrested because crowded cells could spread the virus and that protesters should “demand that law enforcement officials also respect infection prevention recommendations by maintaining distance from protesters and wearing masks.” The letter also tells people they should donate to pay for the bail of people arrested at protests or riots. “We continue to support demonstrators who are tackling the paramount public health problem of pervasive racism. We express solidarity and gratitude toward demonstrators who have already taken on enormous personal risk to advocate for their own health, the health of their communities, and the public health of the United States. We pledge our services as allies who share this goal,” the letter says. The letter talks about police “violence” but not the violence in some protests, including some protesters who set businesses on fire and looted businesses. Dozens of public health and disease experts have signed an open letter in support of the nationwide anti-racism protests. "White supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to COVID-19," they wrote.https://t.co/EewPNgDSu3 — NPR (@NPR) June 2, 2020  Taxpayer-funded National Public Radio (NPR), however, did not include much of the details in its report on the letter, instead turning to a source that did not sign it, Dr. Elaine Nsoesie, an assistant professor of global health at Boston University. “Data is showing that blacks and Latinos have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 in many states,” Nsoesie said. “Racism is one of the reasons this disparity exists.” “Racism is a social determinant of health,” Nsoesie said. “It affects the physical and mental health of blacks in the U.S. So I wouldn’t weigh these crises separately.” Follow Penny Starr on Twitter.

Remember when the Internet and TV commercials and public service announcements were all filled with healthcare workers holding up signs that said “We’re Here For You, Stay Home for Us”? Do you remember all that emotional blackmail? It was all over the place. The message was basically this: Dear Ungrateful Commoner: We’re out here risking our lives on the front lines, and we selfless and brave healthcare heroes need you to remain on lockdown and lose your jobs and your businesses and give up everything that makes life living,  for us… Cuz we’re brave and awesome, so we need you to destroy the economy that might get the Orange Bad Man reelected, even though, if you’re under 50, the coronavirus is no more lethal than the flu Remember all that sanctimonious, anti-science garbage? Well, guess what… It was all bullshit. Many of us knew that at the time. But now we know that our oh-so precious healthcare workers also knew it was bullshit, because look at them now… No, really, look at them now openly encouraging mass gatherings of people. Tell me if I got their science correct… You’re killing grandma and making life harder for all of your precious healthcare heroes if you leave your home to attend church, use the swings at a local park, play a game of basketball, gather in groups of ten or more, or attend a house party… But if you leave your home and completely ignore every social distancing rule to attend a massive gathering of humanity to protest, riot, loot, and burn Democrat-run cities — well, according to these very same healthcare heroes, that’s no problem at all. You know, cuz burning down predominantly black neighborhoods is fighting the virus of racism in a country that just elected a black president and enjoyed the lowest black unemployment rate in history — at least until we all told you to stay home … for us. Seriously, look at our “We’re Here For You, Stay Home for Us” healthcare heroes now. Watch as they openly cheer a mass-gathering, and not just anywhere, but at the coronavirus ground zero of New York City: EARLIER IN NYC: Hospital staff applaud protesters amid COVID-19@SarahWaltonNewspic.twitter.com/iyBni3GNdS — Breaking911 (@Breaking911) June 3, 2020  Tell me… how did we go from this… Please #StayHomeMN #covid #FlattenTheCurve @AbbottHospital pic.twitter.com/Skzc7TLL8L — Abbott Northwestern Internal Medicine Residency (@Abbott_IM) March 19, 2020  To this… EARLIER IN NYC: Hospital staff applaud protesters amid COVID-19@SarahWaltonNewspic.twitter.com/iyBni3GNdS — Breaking911 (@Breaking911) June 3, 2020  Tell me… How did we go from being shamed and practically accused of being a serial killer for wanting to get a haircut, to — LOL — this: Dozens of public health and disease experts have signed an open letter in support of the nationwide anti-racism protests. "White supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to COVID-19," they wrote.https://t.co/EewPNgDSu3 — NPR (@NPR) June 2, 2020  Overnight, we went from America’s health experts telling us that attending church will kill grandma to America’s health experts telling us “they support the demonstrations — because racism also poses a dire health threat.” In other words, all of the so-called science was tossed out the window as soon as a pet cause made that necessary. Don’t waste any energy getting angry… Just remember this the next time our healthcare “experts” try to shove you around and control you with their “science.” America’s experts are only experts when it comes to lying, to manipulating us with fear into a box where they can boss us around. If anything, take away something positive from this… As I said yesterday, we owe a debt of gratitude to the rioters. After all, it was America’s left-wing terrorists in Antifa and Black Lives Matter who exposed the lockdowns as a left-wing hoax, as a total fraud, as purely political. And I don’t know about you, but the rioters who exposed this aren’t rioting in my neighborhood. They’re not rioting out here in Rural America. Nope, the only place they’re rioting and looting and burning is in Democrat-run cities. So those stupid enough to vote for Democrats are getting what they voted for, while the rest of us learned an important lesson about how phony, dishonest, and partisan our healthcare “experts” are. It’s all good.  Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.

Venezuela’s rightful president Juan Guaidó announced an agreement with Nicolás Maduro’s socialist regime and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO, a subsidiary of the World Health Organization) on Tuesday to seek assistance in dealing with the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. The agreement, signed Monday in Caracas, will establish the necessary “priorities” for dealing with the pandemic, including the rapid detection of cases, epidemiological surveillance, and the effective treatment of those infected. “Both parties propose to work in coordination, in coordination and with the support of PAHO, in the search for financial resources that contribute to strengthening the country’s response capacities in the face of the new coronavirus,” the Maduro regime’s Communication Minister Jorge Rodríguez said in a state television address on Tuesday. “The coronavirus does not respect or discriminate against gender, orientation, or political party,” he continued. “So this is good news, a good start so that we can deepen our work together to combat the coronavirus.” Guaidó confirmed on Twitter that after “months of fighting and insistence, we have finally convinced the PAHO to provide the necessary donation to the National Assembly to handle the pandemic in Venezuela.” “Our politics is based on saving lives, in dealing with the emergency, and ending this dictatorship,” he added. Neither side has confirmed the estimated amount required for the plan and has not reported under what conditions the resources would be distributed. Luego de meses de insistencia y lucha, logramos que la OPS reciba la donación aprobada por la AN para atender la pandemia en Venezuela. Nuestra política se centra en salvar vidas, en atender la emergencia y salir de la dictadura. Urge el Gobierno de Emergencia Nacional. https://t.co/4QHmH34psf — Juan Guaidó (@jguaido) June 3, 2020  In a statement, Guaidó’s team assured that the agreement allows money to put emergency funds “into the hands of international organizations” and not the socialist regime. They added that the donation had been “approved” by the country’s National Assembly, the country’s last legitimate lawmaking body. This fact does not appear in the document released by Rodríguez, who accused the opposition leader of trying to “politicize something that does not have to be politicized.” Despite its alleged commitment to removing the Maduro regime from power, mainly through the imposition of crippling economic sanctions, Washington celebrated the “coordinated association” agreement between the two sides. “It is an important step, but only a democratic transition will save Venezuela from catastrophe,” the U.S. Embassy said in a statement. Gobierno Interino de @JGuaido firmó acuerdo con la OPS de asociación coordinada con el régimen para enfrentar el #COVID19, priorizando necesidades urgentes de atención médica de venezolanos. Es un paso importante, pero solo transición democrática salvará Venezuela de catástrofe https://t.co/GdcmWdTJRa — Embajada Virtual de los EE.UU., Venezuela (@usembassyve) June 3, 2020  The agreement raises further questions about the veracity of Venezuela’s official coronavirus figures. Health authorities claim that just 1,819 people have contracted the disease, leading to 18 fatalities. The country’s decrepit “universal” healthcare system and the vulnerability of its poverty-stricken population arouse suspicion regarding the numbers. The PAHO has previously faced accusations of enabling slave labor in relation to Cuba’s slave doctor system, in which the Castro regime forces doctors to work abroad while taking a large percentage of their pay. In 2012, the PAHO was a signatory to a deal signed by Brazil’s socialist leadership and Cuba’s regime to introduce a program known as “Mais Médicos” (More Doctors) and received a payment from the Brazilian government as a result. The deal signed this week underlines Guaido’s rapidly dwindling authority as Venezuela’s legitimate yet effectively powerless president, which has led him to repeatedly try to enter negotiations with the Maduro regime in return for supposed concessions. After several rounds of discussions, Guaidó conceded that he had given up negotiating with such a “deadly dictatorship.” A nationwide survey taken at the time found that 87.6 percent of Venezuelans opposed any form of dialogue with Maduro.

Stocks rose on Wednesday as investors glimpsed signs that the economy had bottomed, coronavirus infections are waning, more government aid is likely, and President Donald Trump’s move to quell riots in D.C. may have stemmed the civic unrest around the country. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 527 points, or 2.05 percent. The S&P 500 moved up 1.36 percent, its fourth day of gains. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 0.78 percent, climbing within two percent of the all-time high hit in February. All 11 sectors of the S&P were up. Industrials and financials were the best performing sector, rising by 3.91 percent and 3.83 percent respectively. Communications services and consumer staples were the worst, rising by just one-fifth of a percent. The top gainer on the Dow was Boeing, followed by American Express, J.P. Morgan Chase, and Exxon Mobil. Home Depot, Walmart, Intel, and United Health were the only Dow stocks to lose for the day.  

NEW YORK (AP) — Major League Baseball rejected the players’ offer for a 114-game regular season in the pandemic-delayed season with no additional salary cuts and told the union it did not plan to make a counterproposal, a person familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity Wednesday because no statements were authorized.
Players made their proposal Sunday, up from an 82-game regular season in management’s offer last week. Opening day would be June 30 and the regular season would end Oct. 31, nearly five weeks after the Sept. 27 conclusion that MLB’s proposal stuck to from the season’s original schedule. MLB told the union it had no interest in extending the season into November, when it fears a second wave of the coronavirus could disrupt the postseason and jeopardize $787 million in broadcast revenue.
While management has suggested it could play a short regular season of about 50 games with no more salary reductions, it has not formally proposed that concept. Teams and players hope to start the season in ballparks with no fans, and teams claim they would sustain huge losses if salaries are not cut more. The sides agreed to a deal March 26 in which players accepted prorated salaries in exchange for $170 million in advances and a guarantee that if the season is scrapped each player would get 2020 service time matching what the player accrued in 2019. That deal called for “good faith” negotiations over playing in empty stadiums or at neutral sites. The union has said no additional cuts are acceptable. MLB’s proposal on May 26 would lower 2020 salaries from about $4 billion to approximately $1.2 billion, establishing a sliding scale of reductions. Players at the $563,500 minimum would get about 47% of their original salary and those at the top — led by Mike Trout and Gerrit Cole at $36 million — would receive less than 23%. The union’s offer would have salaries total about $2.8 billion, leaving each player with about 70% of his original salary.

Amazon announced this week that it is ending its two-dollar pay increase for warehouse workers instituted after the outbreak of the Chinese virus. Meanwhile, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has enjoyed a net worth increase of $32 billion since January. According to a report by Business Insider, Amazon is killing the two-dollar pay raise that warehouse workers received at the outset of the Chinese virus pandemic. Although Amazon warehouses were overwhelmed with demand in March and April, reports suggest that Amazon’s warehouse operations have mostly returned to normal. Some warehouse employees even claim that they recently been asked to take voluntary time off. In short interviews with Business Insider, Amazon warehouse workers around the nation expressed their frustration with the company’s decision to end the pay raise. “The $2 an hour won’t have much effect on my life — I find kind of laughable,” one warehouse worker in New Jersey said. “There are others though who can really use it and with the present circumstances they should actually be increasing it instead of taking it away.” “It just kills me that the company cares nothing about what a pay cut will do to morale,” a South Carolina Amazon worker said. “Almost everyone is very disappointed and angry,” one Amazon warehouse worker in Indiana said. “We want the pay until the masks go away.” Breitbart News reported in April that America’s billionaire executives have seen significant increases in their wealth during the coronavirus pandemic. At the same time that 26 million Americans were forced to file for unemployment, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Tesla CEO Elon Musk saw their wealth increase by ten percent. Stay tuned to Breitbart News for more updates on this story.

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday factory orders in April fell 13.0 percent, the biggest month-to-month fall in records dating to 1992. Orders fell 11 percent in March, revised down from the initially reported then record-setting 10.3 percent decline. The decline was slightly less than the 14 percent forecast by economists. Business investment was weaker than it looked in last week’s initial reading. Orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft, a proxy for business investment, fell 6.1 percent compared with the prior estimate of a 5.8 percent decline. Durable goods orders were revised down from a 17.2 percent decline to a 17.7 percent decline. Wednesday’s data included the first look at nondurable goods orders. These fell 9 percent. The overall picture is one of an economy in deep contraction in April and March. But data since then suggest the economy probably hit rock bottom in that period and has been recovering as businesses have been permitted to reopen.  

President Donald Trump in an interview on Tuesday mocked former Vice President Joe Biden for continuing to wear a mask. The president pointed to a speech that Biden gave on Tuesday about race relations, where the former vice president removed his mask. “He took his mask off for the first time in a while, I haven’t seen his face for a long time,” Trump said. Trump spoke about Biden in an interview with Fox News host Brian Kilmeade on Wednesday morning. The former vice president has religiously worn his mask in recent months, even while delivering remarks or even while maintaining social distance outdoors. Trump mocked Biden for putting the mask back on while he was speaking. “Actually, then he started speaking through the mask again, he feels comfortable with a mask on I think, even though there was no one near him, which is interesting,” Trump said. Biden criticized Trump for fanning the “flames of hate” and trafficking in “fear and division” for political gain. But Trump mocked Biden for successfully reading a speech written by his staff after leaving his basement quarantine. “That speech was written, he didn’t say that, he repeated the words, that’s all, that speech was written for him because he doesn’t speak like that,” Trump said.

Polling across six swing states shows a tightening presidential race, as President Trump and Joe Biden (D) find themselves neck and neck, according to a Change Research/CNBC survey released this week. Change Research conducted the poll May 29-31, surveying 3,958 likely voters in six battleground states Trump won in 2016 — Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Biden holds just a one-point advantage over the president across the six states — a lead within the poll’s +/- 1.56 percent margin of error. The individual results indicate a tight race across the board. Trump leads in Pennsylvania by four points and Arizona by one point, while Biden leads in Florida by three points, Michigan by two, and North Carolina by one. Both are tied in Wisconsin, seeing 45 percent support each: Joe Biden has a 7-point lead over Donald Trump nationally (48% Biden, 41% Trump). That is up from his 3-point lead two weeks ago and his greatest lead to date. Across the six battleground states Trump won in 2016, Biden now leads by 1 point (47% Biden, 46% Trump). This is a 3 point shift in the margin since our last wave and the first time Biden has led. Biden and Trump are at parity in Arizona (+1 Trump), North Carolina (+1 Biden), and Wisconsin (even), Biden leads in Florida (+3) and Michigan (+2), and Trump leads in Pennsylvania (+4). #NEW @CNBC /@ChangePolls:#Pennsylvania Trump 50%Biden 46%___#Arizona Trump 45%Biden 44%___#WisconsinTrump 45%Biden 45% — Political Polls (@PpollingNumbers) June 3, 2020  NEW @CNBC/@ChangePolls  Florida:Biden 48% Trump 45%__Michigan:Biden 48% Trump 46%__North Carolina:Biden 46% Trump 45% — Political Polls (@PpollingNumbers) June 3, 2020  While the election remains several months away, experts and critics appear to be taking recent polling data with a grain of salt, as many pollsters and establishment media outlets failed to accurately predict Trump’s victory in many of those battleground states and, ultimately, his shocking defeat of Hillary Clinton in 2016. The survey coincides with the country’s gradual reopening following coronavirus shutdowns, which has been inundated by protests, many of which have turned violent. Trump addressed the nation in a Rose Garden speech on Monday, vowing to restore law and order in the event that state leaders fail to adequately act and stop the lawlessness dominating their streets. While Biden has criticized violent protests, he has also blamed police for escalating tension. “There’s no place for violence, no place for looting or destroying property or burning churches or destroying businesses,” he said in part, adding, “Nor is it acceptable for our police, sworn to protect and serve all people, to escalate tension, resort to excessive violence.”

TEL AVIV – An employee at the Prime Minister’s Office has been confirmed with coronavirus, potentially compelling Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to go into self-quarantine for the third time in as many months. The development comes amid an uptick in cases that began last week with 115 new infections in a 24-hour period – the highest in a month. The infected PMO worker, a technical staffer, was in a room with Netanyahu, Israeli media reported. “A worker at the office tested positive for coronavirus,” the statement from Netanyahu’s office said. “At the moment, an epidemiological investigation is being conducted, at the end of which appropriate guidelines will be given to those who came in contact with him.” Netanyahu entered self-quarantine on two occasions over the past three months, once in March after an advisor was diagnosed with the virus, and again in April when then-health minister Yaakov Litzman contracted it. The PMO worker was infected by a family member linked to a student at the Gymnasia Rehavia high school in Jerusalem, where more than 130 students and staff members were confirmed to be coronavirus carriers. Thousands of students and their families went into quarantine as 21 schools around the country racked up cases. The Health Ministry warned Sunday that it might order the shuttering of all high schools if outbreaks continue. According to the first Israeli antibody study, between two and three percent of the population has contracted the virus. That figure, representing up to 270,000 Israelis, is at least 10 times higher than the number of confirmed cases. Researchers conducted serological tests on blood samples of 1,700 Israelis.  

On Tuesday, Oklahoma State star linebacker Amen Ogbongbemiga said he tested positive for the coronavirus after he attended a protest in Tulsa. The six-foot-one, 21-year-old player made his announcement in a tweet on Tuesday. “After attending a protest in Tulsa AND being well protective of myself, I have tested positive for COVID-19. Please, if you are going to protest, take care of yourself and stay safe,” he wrote. After attending a protest in Tulsa AND being well protective of myself, I have tested positive for COVID-19. Please, if you are going to protest, take care of yourself and stay safe. — Amen Ogbongbemiga (@closedprayer) June 3, 2020  Ogbongbemiga reportedly discovered his diagnosis after being tested on Monday when he returned to the Oklahoma State campus to resume training with the school’s football program, ESPN reported. Now, instead of resuming his training, he will be quarantined in special housing and will undergo frequent testing until he is cleared of the virus. Still, it seems unlikely that Ogbongbemiga contracted the virus at a protest he only attended the day before. The coronavirus does not develop that quickly. Last year, the Canadian-born Ogbongbemiga was voted defensive MVP for the OSU Cowboys, and was ranked sixth in the Big 12 conference with 100 tackles. He also ranked fifth in the conference with tackles for loss taking 15.5 yards from his opponents Follow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry dismissed leaked World Health Organization (W.H.O.) documents on Wednesday as “seriously inconsistent with facts” after the Associated Press revealed the agency had concerns that the Communist Party was hiding pivotal information on the Chinese coronavirus. The AP reported on Tuesday that the leaked documents it had access to showed that senior W.H.O. officials were extremely frustrated in the early days of the pandemic with China for, among other things, delaying sharing information on the virus’s genome for over a week. In the months following the initial announcement of the discovery of a new virus, reports revealed that Chinese Communist Party officials had destroyed early samples of the virus obtained from Wuhan, where it originated, making it impossible for scientists to study its early evolution. The AP report also revealed W.H.O. officials complaining that Beijing was sharing information with the global agency “15 minutes before it appears on CCTV,” the communist state broadcaster, and that some feared a public rebuke of China would result in the Communist Party physically harming its doctors and scientists. “I don’t know where these ‘internal documents’ come from, but I can assure you that certain reports were seriously inconsistent with facts,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian – who rose to prominence on the world stage for claiming, without evidence, that the U.S. Army may have caused the Chinese coronavirus pandemic – asserted on Wednesday. “Since the outbreak of COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus], China has been acting with openness, transparency, and a high sense of responsibility,” Zhao said. “We have been in close and good communication and cooperation with W.H.O. and its office in China. We will continue to support W.H.O. in leading the global fight against the virus with concrete actions and work with the larger international community to uphold global public health security.” Zhao stopped short of denying the accuracy of the AP report or denying the authenticity of the documents the AP alleged to have access to, suggesting that Beijing does not have evidence that the W.H.O.’s alleged private concerns did not actually occur. Instead, Zhao left open the possibility that W.H.O. officials were, in fact, frustrated and concerned over Communist Party obstruction of scientific development to fight the virus, and branded their concerns “inconsistent with facts.” The Global Times, one of China’s most belligerent English-language state propaganda outlets, also did not offer any refutation of what the AP alleged about the W.H.O., failing to use the word “alleged” when relaying that the AP “cited recordings of internal U.N. meetings and internal documents claiming the W.H.O. publicly praised China in a bid to pull more information out of the Chinese government.” “Although the W.H.O. continued to publicly commend China, the recordings show they were concerned China was not sharing enough information to assess the risk posed by the new virus, costing the world valuable time,” the AP report asserted on Tuesday. Among the transgressions the W.H.O. documents show officials accusing China of committing were observing the party “sat on releasing the genetic map, or genome, of the deadly virus for over a week after multiple government labs had fully decoded it, not sharing details key to designing tests, drugs, and vaccines.” The internal documents showing that China stalled for as much as two weeks on sharing information like the genome of the novel coronavirus directly contradicts one of the most vocal points of pride in the Communist Party’s version of the Chinese response to the pandemic. While reports have indicated China knew of coronavirus cases as early as November 2019, the regime released the genome in late January, nearly a month after it shut down the wet market in Wuhan it claimed was the origin of the virus and after it alerted the W.H.O. to the existence of that virus. Chinese regime propagandists have insisted disclosing the genome of the virus occurred at nearly record time. The AP report also claimed W.H.O. officials felt threatened, according to their internal documents, by the Chinese regime, to compliment Beijing or risk losing all access to any information. Non-compliance with regime praise, they reportedly considered, may also lead to violence against Chinese scientists who may have disagreed with Beijing’s secrecy. Chinese officials are known to have arrested at least eight health workers in the early weeks of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan for posting advice on social media on how to contain a contagious disease. At the time, both Beijing and the World Health Organization were insisting that the Chinese coronavirus was not transmissible from human to human. The AP report follows a similar report from Reuters last month claiming that senior officials within the W.H.O. were frustrated and concerned about Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus’ insistence on complimenting and defending China on the world stage. “We knew how it was going to look, and he can sometimes be a bit naive about that, but he’s also stubborn,” an anonymous W.H.O. official told the news agency. “The [W.H.O.] advisers encouraged Tedros to use less effusive language [in praising China] out of concern about how he would be perceived externally, the person familiar with the discussions said, but the director-general was adamant, in part because he wanted to ensure China’s cooperation in fighting the outbreak,” Reuters asserted.
The German newspaper Der Spiegel published a report shortly before Reuters revealed that German intelligence agencies had reason to believe Chinese dictator Xi Jinping pressured Tedros to delay declaring the coronavirus epidemic a pandemic – meaning no global community was safe – and not to announce that the virus was contagious.

Zimbabwe’s ruling leftist party, Zanu-PF, will stage anti-U.S. demonstrations on Thursday at the United States Embassy and the European Union Ambassador’s office in direct violation of the country’s ban on large gatherings to contain its worsening coronavirus outbreak, New Zimbabwe reported on Tuesday. Zanu-PF’s national political commissar Victor Matemadanda confirmed the planned demonstrations at a press conference in the capital, Harare. Matemadanda said he “invited” Nelson Chamisa, president of the opposition party Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), and his supporters to join the anti-U.S. demonstrations. On Sunday, U.S. National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien described Zimbabwe, China, and Russia as “foreign adversaries.” He accused them of using social media to stoke unrest and “sow discord” in America, currently enduring violent and, in some cases, deadly riots nationwide following the recent death of a black man named George Floyd while in police custody in the state of Minnesota. The officer involved in his death was arrested. In response, Zimbabwe’s foreign ministry spokesman James Manzou reportedly summoned U.S. Ambassador to Zimbabwe Brian Nichols on Monday to “explain” O’Brien’s remarks. After the meeting, Nichols reminded Zimbabwe’s ruling party of its longstanding record of violations against human rights. He said: Mr. Floyd’s killer was charged with murder in days. Every American official, from our president to Minneapolis African-American Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, has vowed to deliver justice. Zimbabweans surely wonder when, after so many years, Patrick Nabanyama, Itai Dzamara, and Paul Chizuze will get justice? Americans will continue to speak out for justice whether at home or abroad. The ambassador referred to missing Zimbabwean political activists from opposition parties who have disappeared without a trace in recent years after standing up to the ruling party. News of the planned demonstrations comes as Zimbabwean troops and police reinforced coronavirus lockdown measures in Harare on Tuesday, tightening control of people’s movement amid a recent surge in coronavirus infections. Zimbabwe health authorities say the number of cases has “more than tripled” to 203 over the past few days, Reuters reported on Tuesday. President Emmerson Mnangagwa had recently eased Zimbabwe’s lockdown since it was first imposed at the end of March to curb the spread of the deadly virus. The MDC accuses the ruling party of taking advantage of the government’s restrictions on movement during the pandemic to target its members, calling Tuesday’s reimposed lockdown in Harare politically motivated. “So if this is about Covid-19 [Chinese coronavirus] why is it only happening in Harare? This appears to be more about politics than medicine or health,” MDC senator David Coltart wrote on Twitter. The MDC says Mnangagwa’s Zanu-PF party is “trying to suppress protests over a worsening economy” and attempting to “stop MDC supporters from gathering at the courts” where the MDC leader’s lawyer was due to appear after being arrested by ruling party authorities on Monday.

Health officials in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have confirmed a new outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in the country’s northwest, Voice of America (VOA) reported on Monday. The revelation comes as health authorities struggle to contain a separate Ebola outbreak in eastern DRC. The country is also currently battling a Wuhan coronavirus upsurge and the world’s largest measles outbreak, according to the report. Authorities identified the center of the new Ebola outbreak as Mbandaka, the capital of the DRC’s Equateur province. The city is home to over one million people and is known as a transport hub, located on the Congo River. At a press conference on Monday, DRC health minister Eteni Longondo said “four people have already died” from Ebola in Mbandaka, Al Jazeera reports. “The [DRC’s] National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) has confirmed to me that samples from Mbandaka tested positive for Ebola,” the minister said at the briefing. Equateur province previously battled an Ebola spike from May-July 2018 that killed 33 people. “This is a province that has already experienced the disease. They know how to respond. They started the response at the local level [on Sunday],” Longondo said. According to the report, health authorities in eastern DRC have been battling an Ebola flare-up that began in 2018 and has killed 2,280 people. This outbreak emerged in North Kivu province in August 2018. It then spread to the neighboring Ituri province, the site of ongoing inter-ethnic violence which further complicates the disease’s spread there. A recent U.N. report said that from March to May, over 200,000 people were displaced by violence from tribal hostilities in Ituri province. In March, DRC health officials had expected to declare the Ebola outbreak in Eastern DRC officially over after the last known Ebola patient was discharged from treatment. On April 10, however, a new case of Ebola was recorded in North Kivu province. The ongoing epidemic in eastern DRC is the world’s second-largest Ebola outbreak on record and the country’s single worst. The severity of the outbreak has exhausted the country’s hospitals. In March, a U.N. report declared the DRC’s healthcare system to be “on life support.” A recent coronavirus flare-up in the DRC further threatens the country’s public health. At press time on Tuesday, the DRC had recorded 3,326 infections and 72 deaths from the Chinese coronavirus.

Businesses in the United States shrank their payrolls by 2.76 million, according to a report Wednesday from ADP and Moody’s Analytics. This was far better than expected and indeed outside of the range of estimates. Economists had estimated the ADP private payrolls figure to show a loss of between 3.3 million and 11 million, according to Econoday. The median estimate was for a loss of 8.6 million jobs. April’s payroll figure was revised to show a smaller job loss, 19.6 million instead of the earlier reported 20.2 million. The report suggests the labor market may be healthier than it has looked to many economists. It is possible that businesses kept many workes on in anticipation of reopening in May or hired workers back. The Trump administration’s Paycheck Protection Program, which makes loans to small businesses that can be forgiven if they do not layoff workers, is also likely supporting employment more effectively than expected. It is also possible that the ADP report may not be accurate in these wild times. In the past, it has missed some big shifts in the economy. ADP estimates that Friday’s non-farm payroll number from the U.S. government will show a contraction of 8.6 million jobs. That is slightly higher than the Econoday consensus expectation of a loss of 7.7 million jobs. The hospitality and leisure category, the hardest hit in April, shrank by 105,000 jobs, according to the report. That was the best performing sector and likely reflects the deep cuts in prior months. There just were not that many jobs left to lose. Trade and transportation was the worst performing category in the services in May, losing 826,000 jobs. Overall the services sector lost 1,967,00o jobs. The good producing sector lost 794,000, with 719,000 coming from manufacturing.  

Teenage climate worrier Greta Thunberg has been watching the tumultuous riots that have erupted across America over the past week and voiced disappointment at what she sees. Late Sunday night she took to Twitter to register her displeasure and issue a call for “global structural change”: Devastating to see the development taking place in the USA.Centuries of structural and systematic racism and social injustice won’t go away by itself.We need a global structural change.The injustices must come to an end. #BlackLivesMatter pic.twitter.com/V5NWJFm0Qh — Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) May 30, 2020  The call to social action by the teen came just three days before she restarted her global campaign against all manner of “climate sins” by lashing the Danish capital Copenhagen for channeling waste water overflow into the sea. As Breitbart News reported, Thunberg expressed anger that these actions are coming from “the same Copenhagen who claim they’ll be climate neutral by 2025,” doubtless a disappointment to her and her supporters who see global climate action as a necessity for the very survival of the planet. Thunberg’s return to castigating the world for climate errors both real and perceived comes after an admission in March it’s “extremely likely” she contracted the Chinese coronavirus but subsequently “basically recovered” from it. The 17-year-old said she and father exhibited coronavirus-like symptoms at the time and chose to self-quarantine for two weeks following a trip through western Europe. Now she has added the U.S. to her expanding list of global concerns.

BERLIN (AP) – Europe’s unemployment rate ticked up modestly last month, contained by use of labor programs that have kept millions of workers on payrolls and as some people stopped looking for work, official data showed Wednesday. The jobless rate in the 19 countries that use the euro rose to 7.3% in April, the first full month when pandemic lockdowns hit the continent, from 7.1% in March, statistics agency Eurostat said Wednesday. Europe’s rise in unemployment has been moderate by international standards because employers are making extensive use of government-backed short-time work programs that allows them to keep employees on the payroll while they await better times. In Germany, Europe’s largest economy, the federal labor agency pays at least 60% of the salary of employees who are on reduced or zero hours. Some 10.66 million people were registered for that program in March and April, and 1.06 million followed in May, the labor agency said — though it stressed that this doesn´t mean all of them were actually put on short-time work. Germany has a population of 83 million. The European jobless figures also appear flattered by the fact that some unemployed people likely stopped looking for work and stopped counting as jobseekers. That seems to be the case in a country like Italy, where the jobless rate actually fell, to 6.3% from 8% in seasonally adjusted terms. In Germany, the unemployment rate rose modestly to 6.3% from 5.8% according to its own labor agency measures. On Wednesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s governing coalition was spending a second day hammering out a stimulus package meant to help kick-start the economy. It’s expected to be worth as much as 80-100 billion euros ($89-112 billion). Germany already is offering a total of more than 1 trillion euros in aid via various packages, which include money to tide small companies and individual entrepreneurs through virus-related closures and to pump capital into bigger companies where needed. The crisis has derailed the government´s dedication to keeping its budget balanced, long a point of pride. After six years in the black, it is borrowing 156 billion euros to finance the existing rescue packages and cover an expected shortfall in tax revenue. Germany started loosening coronavirus restrictions on April 20, about a month after they were introduced, and the easing has gathered pace since. However, the economy went into a recession in the first quarter and that is expected to deepen in the current quarter.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has claimed that “herd immunity” from the Wuhan coronavirus will be achieved by Autumn of 2021 at the earliest. Josep Jansa, an epidemiologist at the ECDC, said that the Chinese virus continues to change rapidly and that the agency has been reluctant to give solid advice for issues like international travel. But he said that the ECDC has offered indicators to EU member states on what stage of the infection they may be in. The epidemiologist added, during an interview with Finnish broadcaster YLE on Monday: “People have learned to do the right thing in terms of hygiene. This first wave is also waning. We believe that the situation will calm down by the summer.” Jansa went on to speak of the negative consequences of the virus, saying: “The situation has serious consequences for society. Unemployment, debt, poverty are rising. It is very difficult for very many people. Many have lost relatives. Some have lived in complete isolation, and it affects mental health.” Swedish Virus Deaths 'Catastrophically High' But Herd Immunity Not on Horizon https://t.co/dCU3qCmaY5 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 23, 2020  While most countries enacted lockdown measures to stop the spread of the virus, Sweden did not and has been seen by some as adopting an approach to achieve so-called “herd immunity”. A report from last month revealed that only 7.3 per cent of Stockholmers, the area in Sweden most affected by the virus, had antibodies against the virus, the number reduced to just 3.7 per cent nationwide. Jansa said herd immunity, which can require up to 60 per cent of the public to have antibodies, is unlikely to be seen anywhere in the world in the coming months. “Herd immunity will not be achieved until the Autumn of 2021, not here in Stockholm either. There will be some degree of protection, but herd protection requires that 60 per cent of people have contracted the disease,” he said.

Those protesting the police involved death of George Floyd can now receive funding if they are injured, bail money if they are arrested, and money to pay for coronavirus-related medical bills thanks to Saturday Night Live star Chris Redd, who announced a fund he set up for what he called “front line protesters.” “I’m working on a relief fund for front line protestors who may contract COVID19 over the next couple of weeks due to body to body contact. I would hate for my people fighting for justice struggle later because of it. If you would like to help, let’s connect!,” Redd said on Monday. By Tuesday night, the fund was live and well on its way to reaching its goal of $250,000. And here we go!!!!https://t.co/M4VTgrjnpS — Chris Redd (@Reddsaidit) June 2, 2020  The fund’s mission statement? As thousands of people take to the streets to protest racial discrimination and the many Black Lives lost at the hands of injustice,  we also have the unfortunate fact that this deadly pandemic is still upon us. The lives at risk of the injustice being fought against are also the most vulnerable to COVID-19. Many will not be in position to pay the inevitable cost associated with their brave efforts. This fund is to assist those that contract this disease while protesting and other protest related injuries as many are being attacked while speaking out. Monies raised, the fundraiser says, will help get protesters tested, help with coronavirus-related medical bills, and will provide bail money should protesters be arrested. Chris Redd is just the latest Hollywood star to either donate or help raise funds for those taking to the streets to protest across the country. The fund went live on the heels of a dark week in America, as mass looting, vandalism, and terror were rampant across the country. In New York City, where Chris Redd lives, NYPD Chief of Department Terence Monahan said his officers “made 700 arrests” on Monday night. “So, if there were 2,000 out here. We put handcuffs on 700 of them. The problem being is that they’re back out here again tonight,” Monahan said. The looters, Monahan said, are “using the cover of protests to fill their pockets.” As of this writing, Redd’s fund has raised more than $66,000.

ROME — Dr. Alberto Zangrillo, the head of intensive care at the San Raffaele hospital in Milan, told Italian media Sunday that Italy has beaten the coronavirus and it is counterproductive to keep attention focused on it. Speaking on the RAI 3 television network, Dr. Zangrillo said that “the swabs performed over the last 10 days showed a viral load that was absolutely infinitesimal in quantitative terms compared to the ones carried out on patients a month or two ago.” Professor Zangrillo was citing a new study by Massimo Clementi, director of the Microbiology and Virology Laboratory at the San Raffaele hospital, which is due to be published shortly. The Lombardy region, where the hospital is located, has been Italy’s hardest hit in terms of absolute numbers of those infected by the coronavirus as well as in fatalities. The study shows that, “in reality, from the clinical point of view, the virus no longer exists,” Zangrillo said. The doctor declared that his conclusions are corroborated by studies from Milan’s Vita-Salute San Raffaele University as well as by Italian virologist Dr. Guido Silvestri, chair of pathology at Emory University in Atlanta, who has stated that the retreat of COVID-19 “continues undaunted.” Zangrillo also said that to continue drawing attention to the coronavirus can wind up looking “ridiculous” from the perspective of clinical virology. Italian officials, who have gone to great lengths to encourage caution, reacted swiftly to Dr. Zangrillo’s comments. “I can only express great surprise and absolute puzzlement over the statements made by Professor Zangrillo,” said Franco Locatelli, the head of Italy’s supreme health council. “Just look at the number of new cases confirmed every day for evidence of the persistent circulation of the virus in Italy.” In point of fact, however, there were only 318 new cases discovered in all of Italy during the 24-hour period from June 1-2, despite aggressive testing, true to the ongoing trend in reduction. On June 2, the number of active cases of coronavirus in Italy dropped below 40,000 for the first time since late March, to a total of 39,893, continuing a declining trend of some 10,000 per week. Deaths with coronavirus during the same 24-hour period fell to 55 out of an average 1,800 deaths per day in Italy from other causes. Globally, 360,412 people have died with the coronavirus, according to Johns Hopkins University, putting it roughly in the range of worldwide deaths from the 2008-2009 swine flu, estimated at between 151,700 and 575,400 people. Coming to Zangrillo’s defense, Dr. Matteo Bassetti, director of the infectious diseases clinic at the San Martino hospital in Genoa, said Monday that the virus seems to have lost much of its lethal force. The coronavirus “may now be different: the firepower it had two months ago is not the same firepower it has today,” he said. Follow @tdwilliamsrome

During a press conference on Tuesday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) said that while he is concerned that protesting in New York City might cause a resurgence of coronavirus cases, “grappling with an extraordinary crisis, seated in 400 years of American racism…is not the same question as the understandably aggrieved store owner or the devout religious person who wants to go back to services.” De Blasio was asked why he was merely recommending that protesters stay home, while retail stores were banned from opening and religious services with more than 10 people were banned and whether there were different rules for different people. He responded, “We’re in the middle of a national crisis, a deep-seated national crisis. There is no comparison. I’m sorry, I do feel for the store owners. I really do. … And I’m so happy that on Monday, we’re going to start to open up.” After talking about the coronavirus numbers, de Blasio said that religious leaders in the city have said they wouldn’t move prematurely. He also expressed concern that there might be a resurgence of the coronavirus because of the protests, and that he wishes people would stay home in the name of health. He added, “But this is the other piece of the equation, when you see a nation, an entire nation, simultaneously grappling with an extraordinary crisis, seated in 400 years of American racism, I’m sorry, that is not the same question as the understandably aggrieved store owner or the devout religious person who wants to go back to services.” De Blasio also stated that the protests have only taken place over a few days are taking place outdoors and there’s less risk than having people indoors.

Donald Trump Jr. on Monday wondered why the establishment media’s obsession with restrictions spurred by novel coronavirus virtually disappeared, asking why such outlets are no longer condemning “mass gatherings that would have been so deadly due to COVID 19 just a few days ago” as rioters take to the streets. “Why is the media no longer concerned, and often almost gleeful, about all the mass gatherings that would have been so deadly due to COVID 19 just a few days ago?” Trump asked, noting the shift in coronavirus coverage as weeks of emphasizing social distancing abruptly came to a halt. “I guess these people magically aren’t ‘killing their grandmas’ by going outside anymore?!?” he added: Why is the media no longer concerned, and often almost gleeful, about all the mass gatherings that would have been so deadly due to COVID 19 just a few days ago? I guess these people magically aren’t “killing their grandmas” by going outside anymore?!? 🙄 — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) June 1, 2020  Many progressive personalities who condemned Americans taking part in the peaceful Reopen America protests across the nation — and who criticized the president for urging states to reopen — are refusing to extend the same critiques to protesters flocking to the streets this week and participating in demonstrations that have been, largely, dominated by violence and looters. “@realDonaldTrump already has the smell of death on him, and he is going to get more people killed with his ignorance, cowardice, chaos & incompetence. Period. This ain’t a carnival game,” actor Jeffrey Wright said in April: 👉🏾@realDonaldTrump already has the smell of death on him, and he is going to get more people killed with his ignorance, cowardice, chaos & incompetence. Period. This ain't a carnival game. Liberate America.✊🏾🇺🇸 — Jeffrey Wright (@jfreewright) April 17, 2020  Actor Ron Perlman implied that Trump was guilty of negligent homicide for his tweets promoting the liberation of states, and pop star Pink blasted Americans who gathered to demand leaders to reopen the country so they could get back to work: Maybe we should all protest the protesters?Hand out waivers for people to sign that says if they get sick they wave their right to healthcare.then they also agree to pay hospital bills of any single person they come in contact with. I feel like I’m living in the movie IDIOCRACY. — P!nk (@Pink) May 2, 2020  She has not extended the same proposal to this week’s protesters. Social distancing guidelines and restrictions limiting the gatherings of large groups still remain in place in most parts of the country. However, many members of the establishment media have demonstratively eased their calls for coronavirus-era safety precautions as chaos, in the name of “justice,” consumed U.S. streets.

A police lieutenant colonel has become the latest Russian official to mysteriously fall from a window amid the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, local media reported Monday. The 45-year-old woman, identified solely as Yulia B. by local authorities, allegedly fell from the fifth floor of Moscow City Clinical Hospital No. 24 on the evening of May 30th, where she was being treated for the coronavirus. She was described as a senior expert for the Forensic Center of the Interior Ministry, a government agency. Initially, reports suggested that she had died on impact, although these have since been contradicted by claims that she survived, but is currently being treated at an intensive care unit. According to Komsomolskaya Pravda, the policewoman left her ward to go into the corridor and consequently “fell” from the window and landed on the grass below. There has been no information on what caused her to fall. The incident comes after three Russian health workers fell out of windows over the past two months in mysterious circumstances during the coronavirus outbreak. All three of them had also expressed concerns about the Kremlin’s response to the pandemic. The most recent of these victims is 37-year-old Alexander Shulepov, who last month fell from the second floor of a hospital in rural Voronezh, breaking several ribs and suffering a skull fracture. He is understood to have survived his injuries. In April, the acting head doctor of a hospital in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk, Elena Nepomnyashchaya, died soon after another supposed fall from a window at the hospital where she was in charge. Before the incident, she had complained about her staff being forced to treat coronavirus patients without the necessary personal protective equipment (PPE). The previous day, Dr. Natalya Lebedeva — the head of the emergency medical service at Star City, where the majority of Russia’s cosmonauts are trained — allegedly committed suicide by jumping from the building after failing to contain the outbreak. The hospital insisted her death was merely a “tragic accident.” Falling or defenestration from buildings appears to have become a signature manner of death for numerous government critics in Russia over the past decade. Before this year’s incidents, the most recent case was that of the 32-year-old investigative journalist Maxim Borodin, who was thrown out of a fourth-floor window in April 2018 after investigating Russia’s military involvement in Syria. Having initially slow to pick up cases, Russia has now become one of the countries most badly hit by the coronavirus. As of Tuesday, Russian health authorities had recorded 423,741 coronavirus infections and 5,037 deaths, although some analysts believe the figure could be much higher as a result of lack of testing or even government coverups.

The massive protests over the death of George Floyd across the United States, which have devolved into rioting and looting mostly at night, cast doubt on the partial reopening of several non-essential businesses in cities plagued by the unrest as of Tuesday. Moreover, coronavirus testing sites have shut down in at least four states — Pennsylvania, Florida, California, and Illinois, over the violent protests, “limiting cities’ ability to track the virus just as thousands of people participate in crowded demonstrations across the country,” Politico reported Monday. Tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets in cities across America, with many rioting and looting at night, to express anger over the death of George Floyd, a black man, at the hands of the Minneapolis police. Two independent autopsies have deemed Floyd’s death a homicide. Now-fired white police officer Derek Chauvin kneed Floyd’s neck for several minutes. The mass gatherings in dozens of cities have prompted fears by government leaders and health experts of a spike in cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, which has disproportionally plagued minority populations. Many of the demonstrators have disregarded coronavirus mitigation policies imposed by local and state governments, particularly social distancing. The delayed reopenings could intensify the coronavirus negative impact on the economy, including the job market for minorities. In the nation’s capital on Monday, Mayor Muriel Bowser said the city is “very concerned” about the potential for a COVID-19 spike in the wake of several days of massive protests and riots, the local Fox 5 News reported. The mayor has scheduled D.C. to continue its phased reopening of non-essential businesses this week after starting the process last Friday, May 29. District officials have been relying on the community spread metric to make reopening decisions. While the city has excluded COVID-19 ­cases at confined facilities when calculating the community spread of the virus, Dr. LaQuandra Nesbitt, the city’s top public health official, said the city would take cases from the mass gatherings into account, the Washington Post revealed. Dr. Nesbitt proclaimed: As we ramp up our contact tracing, we will try as best as we can to link their exposure to having participated in one of these events, but it could be tricky to do so. If people are going to work, if they are going to dine in at the outdoor restaurants and we do a complete interview of all the activities that they participated in, we may be able to link their activity or participation to one of these protests. D.C. officials said Monday they would announce the criteria for lifting the additional restrictions on non-essential businesses later in the week. On Sunday, the Seattle Times reported that in that city, there is “fear the weekend’s destruction could make recovery even more difficult for businesses already wounded by the pandemic shutdown.” “This isn’t going to make that any easier,” Jon Scholes, CEO of the Downtown Seattle Association, told the Seattle Times. “It’s something we’ve just never seen in downtown Seattle.” In California, some businesses are also considering postponing the reopening over the demonstrations. Santa Clara County Public Health Officials eased the shelter-in-place order last Friday, allowing in-store retail, outdoor dining, and other opportunities. However, store owners received an urgent alert by the Alameda Business District, warning them to “consider boarding up their storefronts,” ABC 7 News reported on Tuesday. Other regions in California are also delaying the reopening until further notice. On Monday, the Los Angeles Times reported: South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa has postponed its planned reopening following the significant protests, violent clashes between demonstrators and police, and looting that have rocked Southern California in recent days. The upscale mall had planned to throw open its doors for customers Monday following a lengthy coronavirus-related closure but, in an online message, officials said the reopening would be delayed to an unannounced date. On Monday, CNBC pointed out that the demonstrations might derail Nevada’s scheduled reopening of casinos on Thursday. “Las Vegas is getting ready to launch a ‘Welcome Back’ ad campaign to encourage visitors to come. But now guests will have to weigh not only the risks of coronavirus but also of civil unrest,” the news outlet noted. “The current circumstances are tragic and negative for any business that requires physical access — certainly casinos would be included,” David Katz, a gaming industry analyst at Jeffries, told CNBC. The protests turned riots may also impact the planned reopening of casinos in Missouri, the news outlet added. In places like Chicago, where Mayor Lori Lightfoot (D) said the city would move forward with its third-phase reopening plans for Wednesday despite the protests and rioting, businesses may not be ready to reopen their doors. On Monday, the Chicago mayor reportedly acknowledged: I’m concerned about businesses all over the city who were preparing and saw the additional resources that they were putting in to opening up their businesses, community groups that were ready to start fully engaging with them. For many of those people, those resources and efforts were reduced to kindling or went down in flames. Minnesota Tim Walz (D) declared on Saturday that a spike in coronavirus cases is “inevitable” after the protests and riots.

The Associated Press (AP) on Tuesday reported on leaked documents from the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) that showed its officials were well aware China was withholding vital information about the coronavirus in January, even as W.H.O. leadership extravagantly praised China for its transparency. The AP report described a massive disconnect between W.H.O.’s public statements and the private frustration of its officials as the Chinese “sat on releasing the genetic map, or genome, of the deadly virus for over a week after multiple government labs had fully decoded it, not sharing details key to designing tests, drugs, and vaccines.” The report noted that even after a Chinese lab seemingly broke with Communist Party officials and published the genome of the Wuhan coronavirus, “China stalled for at least two more weeks on giving W.H.O. the details it needed, according to recordings of multiple internal meetings held by the UN health agency in January.” “Although the W.H.O. continued to publicly commend China, the recordings show they were concerned China was not sharing enough information to assess the risk posed by the new virus, costing the world valuable time,” the AP report said.  One W.H.O. official ruefully noted that the international health organization was getting vital information about the coronavirus “15 minutes before it appears on CCTV,” the Chinese state television network. The AP oddly insisted these revelations “do not support the narrative of either the U.S. or China,” even though it is exactly the narrative of the U.S. that China withheld information and gave W.H.O. false information, and W.H.O. spread those falsehoods while commending Beijing for its high degree of cooperation. The AP writers seemed to think W.H.O. should get a break because its officials were privately seething in frustration, rather than enthusiastically “colluding” with Beijing as willing agents of its political agenda. For example, some of the emails uncovered by the AP show W.H.O. officials worrying that if they openly accused China of wrongdoing, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) would stop cooperating entirely, and might even commit violence against Chinese scientists who were trying to help. That’s hardly a refutation of the U.S. narrative, since American critics have long suspected W.H.O. played softball with China – putting hundreds of thousands of lives around the world at risk – because it knew Beijing was ready to play hardball with them. It also does not speak well of W.H.O. that its officials refused to discuss the report with Associated Press interviewers unless they could be supplied with “audio or written transcripts of the recorded meetings, which could not be supplied while protecting sources.” In other words, they would not say anything unless they knew they had been caught red-handed spreading false information about a historically devastating pandemic to the world. The leaked documents also confirmed that W.H.O. knew the CCP was preventing Chinese scientists from discussing the coronavirus and ordering the destruction of samples, which is a direct contravention of W.H.O. protocols. W.H.O. Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was fully aware of these issues, but deliberately chose not to mention them when he finally declared a global health emergency at the end of January, instead gushing over the “incredible things” China had supposedly done to “limit the transmission of the virus to other countries.” Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) was quick to note that the AP report confirmed some of the worst suspicions critics held about both W.H.O. and the Chinese government. “Now we know for sure that Communist China hid critical data that could have altered the global response to the pandemic,” Scott said on Tuesday. “Communist China was more concerned with their global image than with saving lives. And instead of exposing Communist China’s deceit to the global community, the World Health Organization praised their response and was complicit in China’s cover-up.” “The W.H.O. clearly is not qualified to handle a worldwide health crisis, which is why I’m leading an investigation into their failures that led to the spread of the coronavirus,” Scott continued. “The president was right to cut funding to the WHO, and now the U.S. must take steps to hold Communist China accountable for the spread of the virus.”

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) dismissed growing impatience with her economic lockdown orders Monday and recommended residents take to the Internet to learn how to cut their own hair. Whitmer is easing some restrictions in the coming weeks, but has not budged on allowing barber shops and hair salons to legally reopen. Hair salons will still not be open, even though the stay-at-home order has been lifted. Governor Whitmer suggests people Google how to cut hair. Read More: https://t.co/Y78IJOJAnM pic.twitter.com/5nY400hblt — Mid-Michigan NOW (@midmichigannow) June 1, 2020  “Like me, you need a haircut desperately? A couple more weeks of this and we may be back in a place where we’re able to do that safely,” she said. “It’s still going to require strict protocols. It’s still going to require every one of us keeping our guard up and doing the right thing,” she continued, saying she hopes to take more steps before July. “But we’ve got to follow the data. And so if you’re one of those people that’s going to Ohio, I hope, I pray,” she said, holding up a mask, “that you’re doing your part not to bring COVID-19 home.” For those who have not traveled, she said, “Google how to do a haircut or throw your hair in a ponytail or curl it and get through the next couple of weeks so we can resume some of these things.” Whitmer’s Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs requires 1,800 hours of coursework “satisfactorily” completed in order to obtain a barber license in Michigan. Last Wednesday, a coalition of more than 350 salons, barber shops, and spa owners unveiled an eight-step plan to safely reopen their establishments. “Michigan’s licensed cosmetologists, barbers and their team members are capable, ready, and excited to get back to work meeting the needs of our clients,” Lisa Dennison, a regional director for Michigan Supercuts and Cost Cutters salons, said, WDIV reported. “Our salons have always met detailed health and safety standards, and we’ve developed a comprehensive plan to go even further to keep everyone who walks through the door healthy. We urge Gov. Whitmer to lift her ban on our jobs immediately.” Kyle Olson is a reporter for Breitbart News.

The establishment media and Democrats are encouraging Americans to go out and riot, which proves the coronavirus lockdowns are purely political. Item: You can’t social distance when you riot. Item: You can’t social distance when you protest. So we now know these lockdowns and all this crap about social distancing was a lie, because what you have here are the media encouraging their own viewers to riot and protest, and Democrats encouraging their own voters to riot and protest… And I think it’s safe to assume if the media and Democrats believed the coronavirus would kill their viewers and voters, they would not encourage such a thing. Here are some perfect examples… The hideous Gretchen Whitmer, the hideous Democrat governor of Michigan, spent weeks gleefully punishing her own constituents for the sins of going to church, buying garden seeds, getting a haircut, and holding house parties… Anyone who dared ignore Gretchen’s Kafka-esque outlawing of the very things that make life worth living, were harassed, fined, arrested, and basically terrorized by the State — all in the name of the threat of the coronavirus. And God help those who dared protest her tyranny, God help those protesters, who she shamed, blamed, and used to extend her anti-science lockdowns. Well, well, well — will you look at the hideous Gretchen now… Suddenly large gatherings and the coronavirus is no real problem in Michigan! How else to explain why the hideous Gretchen all of a sudden turned around to support large gatherings (unless, of course, you’re going to church). So we can at least thank the rioters for exposing the hideous Gretchen for the tyrant she really is. What’s more, after the rioters encouraged her to come out in favor of large gatherings, Gretchen’s entire rationale for lockdowns collapsed to a point where she finally surrendered on Monday and put an end to them. Thank you, rioters! And then there’s Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who led by example to prove lockdowns and social distancing are purely political by taking it to the streets! Yep, there she was, a walking-talking (but not very bright) piece of proof America’s political class know these lockdowns are a joke… There she was protesting outside the White House on Saturday with a large group of people who were definitely not practicing social distancing… There she was, openly violating Washington DC’s lockdown orders… Once again, let’s thank the rioters for exposing the truth. What more proof do you need than that, than a U.S. Senator violating these anti-science lockdowns? Well, how about the media’s turnaround? For two months you’ve had CNNLOL, MSNBC, the New York Times, and the Washington Post literally shrieking at anyone who dared go to church, the beach, or a house party… But now, thanks to the rioters, the media have all come out in full-throated support of violating lockdowns and ignoring social distancing. The facts about these pointless lockdowns are this… If you’re under the age of 50, the coronavirus is no more lethal than the seasonal flu. Almost all of these rioters are under the age of 50, so there is no real threat. Hell, those in their teens and twenties are probably in more danger of dying in a car accident than of the Chinese Flu. Bottom line: there is no reason to keep anyone but the elderly in quarantine. But in order to keep us locked down, in order to ensure Trump’s economy went south and they could institute cheat-by-mail, Democrats and the media (but I repeat myself) refused to inform us of those facts. Thanks to the rioters, we are finally liberate from that lie. When the rioters flooded into dozens of Democrat-run cities, Democrats like Whitmer and Harris, and fake news outlets like CNN and MSNBC, had no choice but to end their opposition to lockdowns and stupid social distancing rules. What else could they do? They had to support their left-wing terrorist allies in Antifa and Black Lives Matter. So what we have now are Democrats eating each other alive with all this blue on blue violence, which has no effect whatsoever on those of us in Red America — well, other than the fact that these riots have  finally forced and end to the coronavirus tyranny. So… That’s called a win-win. And when you add in the fact that Democrat and media support for these riots proves beyond any doubt there is no need for cheat-by-mail, that’s called a win-win-win.  Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

Nigel Farage has said that China’s increasingly aggressive foreign policy stance since it let the Wuhan virus loose onto the world must force Prime Minister Boris Johnson to get tough on the communist country. Leaked documents from the World Health Organization (WHO) revealed that China had withheld vital information on coronavirus in the early days of the outbreak. While for a fortnight afterwards, China delayed sharing critical information to the WHO on human-to-human transmission, according to records obtained by the Associated Press and reported on Tuesday. The latest report of a Chinese coverup of the deadly pandemic has handed the West more impetus to get tough on China. Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, in particular, has been consistent in calling for the British government to take a stronger position on the communist state’s transgressions on the global stage. Speaking to The Sydney Morning Herald on Tuesday, Mr Farage noted that China had shown its “true colours” in recent weeks, with its increased aggression towards those who call for the eastern powerhouse to take responsibility for the spread of the virus. Last month in retaliation for Canberra calling for an independent investigation into the virus’s origins, China put an 80 per cent tariff on Australian barley. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has also called for an international probe into origins of coronavirus. The calls were timed with several reports that the UK is planning to pull out of a deal for the all-but-state-owned Huawei to build 35 per cent of the UK’s 5G network, which intelligence allies warn represents a security risk. In response, Chinese state-owned media said that the UK would pay a “price” for expelling the tech firm.

Amidst the intimidation, Mr Farage said: “It’s not something we can do that’s cost-free; it isn’t cost-free but, in terms of strategy, in terms of geopolitics, this is the biggest geopolitical struggle since the fall of the Berlin Wall 30 years ago.” Mr Farage has already committed to boycotting “mass-produced Chinese rubbish” and urged fellow Britons to do the same. After coronavirus exposed Britain’s reliance on China for medical equipment, the government said that would be exploring self-reliance from the communist state as well as looking to aid the growth of British tech companies to wean the UK’s telecommunications networks off of Huawei by 2023, with the company already imbedded in Vodaphone’s, EE’s, and Three’s infrastructure.

Comprised of the usual G7 members — the U.S., UK, Italy, Germany, France, Canada, and Japan — Russia, South Korea, India, and Australia may also be invited, signalling the American president is looking to bolster support in the zone surrounding the communist superpower. The UK’s defence committee chairman Tobias Ellwood has also proposed the formation of an “Atlantic Charter 2.0” with the United States and Britain “leading the pursuit to design a new and defendable international architecture”. “Its purpose would be to establish a fresh international framework to promote and defend human rights, democracy, and trade (including digital) in contrast to the closed model envisioned by Beijing,” Mr Ellwood said on Tuesday. Mr Farage warned, however, that if Mr Johnson does not take this opportunity to stand up to the Communist tyrant, the Brexiteer is ready to return to frontline politics to campaign for Britain to do so instead. “And of course if the Brexit Party does have to reactivate you can rest assured that China will be up there in one of the top two or three policies,” Mr Farage said. “With my base, the debate on China has started [but] it’s still got a long way to go.” Exclusive: ‘Freedom and Autonomy in Hong Kong is Dead’ Says HK Watch Founder https://t.co/Xksx9OY0pd — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 28, 2020 

Green Party mayor Femke Halsema, who was photographed at a protest without a mask, has been accused of “spitting on” residents over her handling of the mass demonstration. A protest march in Amsterdam took place on Monday, with residents coming out in sympathy with Black Lives Matter protests in the United States and organisers saying they also wanted to bring attention to racism in Europe, as well. Among the thousands who turned out was the hard-left Green Party mayor of Amsterdam Femke Halsema, who mingled with the tightly-pressed crowds and was photographed without a mask covering her face. Dutch government coronavirus lockdown rules make a 1.5 metre spacing between pedestrians in public a legal requirement, but only strictly require masks be worn while on public transport — a demand backed up by police action and fines. Hoe is dit nog uit te leggen aan al die Amsterdammers die – ook financieel – lijden onder de coronaregels die wél door Femke #Halsema zijn gehandhaafd? pic.twitter.com/6by9rX4kBw — Forum voor Democratie (@fvdemocratie) June 1, 2020  The appearance of the mayor, and the fact the protest was able to take place at such a large scale at all while the country is otherwise being strictly controlled over coronavirus, has led to heavy criticism, reports Het Parool. All partner parties of the nation’s centre-right coalition government have condemned the event, remarking the images of so many Dutch residents out and protesting in public would undermine public faith in the coronavirus restrictions. Geert Wilders, leader of the Dutch Party for Freedom — a noted anti-mass migration campaigner who lives under constant police supervision because of his outspoken criticism of Islamism — noted Tuesday that “Halsema must go!” and told Ongehoord Nederland that it was unacceptable for the mayor of a great city to behave like a street activist and that she had shown no respect for the rules the rest of the Dutch people are expected to live by. Dutch journalist at the state NOS broadcaster Joris Van Poppel noted on Tuesday that ultimately, the mayor’s future would be decided in two weeks’ time if there was a sudden spike in coronavirus infections traced back to the demonstration she allowed to go ahead. Responding to criticism, Mayor Halsema said she only expected hundreds, not thousands, to turn up to the rally. To disperse it would have required police to deploy “with a hard hand”, and she was not willing to do that. Supporters of the mayor protested on Twitter that because many people at the demonstration wore face masks, outrage about the event was hypocritical. The apparent hypocrisy of the mayor’s protest appearance has been underlined by prominent Amsterdam residents, who compare the mayor attending the protest unmasked this week with her blocking the annual Second World War commemorations that were due to take place on May 4th. Rather than the typical annual commemorations of the Netherlands being liberated from Nazi occupation on May 4th-5th, which sees mass crowds laying flowers in the same city square as Monday’s demonstration, a small number of dignitaries including Mayor Halsema, the Dutch king, and a single survivor of the war laid flowers in an empty square instead. Amsterdam theatre producer Albert Verlinde was cited by Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad as expressing that frustration when he said: “Ms Halsema personally intervened so there should be only one survivor on the [Amsterdam city square] to lay flowers and now she allows this, while hard-working entrepreneurs and well-meaning Dutch do their utmost to comply with the 1.5-metre rule… Halsema spits in our faces.”

Liberty University announced this week that it had zero Chinese virus cases on campus during the spring semester. The university was criticized by mainstream media outlets over its decision to reopen the campus open in March at the outset of the outbreak. University President Jerry Falwell Jr. wrote in a letter to students, ““We are thankful to God that nobody who lived in a campus residence hall or who worked in a campus office tested positive for the virus.” According to a report by the College Fix, Liberty University reported zero cases of the Chinese virus despite criticism that the university prematurely reopened their campus to students in March when they returned from spring break. At the same time, most universities and colleges around the nation had already decided to suspend campus operations to mitigate the spread of the virus. But this week, Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. told students that no students or staff contracted the Chinese virus during the spring semester. “We are thankful to God that nobody who lived in a campus residence hall or who worked in a campus office tested positive for the virus,” Falwell said in a message to students. “No positive COVID-19 test anywhere in our region was linked to Liberty students who returned to their dorm rooms after Spring Break.” “The only COVID cases in the university community were employees working from home or offices off-campus and their infections were all traced to contacts in the local community with persons infected with COVID who were not related to Liberty,” Falwell added. During an interview on Fox News, Falwell Jr. said that their approach to the Chinese virus crisis should be a “model” for other universities. Student Carter Chapman argues that the university was able to maintain standard campus operations by restricting large gathering and access to common areas. “All classes were moved online and all university buildings were open but were restricted to ten people at a time,” said Chapman. “There were no places to sit and relax as all tables, chairs and booths were taped off and closed due to the virus.” Stay tuned to Breitbart News for more campus updates.

Maine Democrat Gov. Janet Mills reversed her decision last week to allow restaurants in the state’s southern counties to reopen June 1, suggesting to owners they sell already purchased perishable foods to prisons at the government contract rate. Just days before restaurants in Cumberland, York, and Androscoggin Counties were slated to reopen to allow for indoor dining with health and safety measures in place, the governor reversed course, claiming an uptick in COVID-19 cases in the region. “A date for the reopening of dine-in services in these counties is yet to be determined,” the Mills administration said. Mills’ decision to block the restaurants from reopening as the vacation season is underway, caused an uproar among business owners who had already purchased sufficient food for potential customers, called back employees, and implemented health and safety measures, the Maine Examiner reported: Mills was the recipient of further backlash, however, when she advised restaurant owners stuck with perishable foods of the “opportunity” to sell their provisions to the Maine Department of Corrections (MDOC) “at a price equivalent to the price paid for the same items through MDOC’s food contract.” In a statement to Breitbart News, Maine Rep. Larry Lockman (R) said Mills “imposed martial law lite” on Mainers back on March 18. “Her dictatorship has been marked by no less than 55 executive orders,” he said. “The first one forced restaurant owners statewide to close their dining rooms, without any prior notice, and toss the contents of their food lockers into the dumpster. Now she’s sucker-punched dining establishments in Maine’s three southern-most counties with her flip-flop on re-opening.” The Mills administration said in a statement released Saturday MDOC would “support” the restaurants: The MDOC has capacity to purchase perishable and non-perishable food items, except for dairy, at a price equivalent to the price paid for the same items through MDOC’s food contract. Purchased food will be served to staff and inmates. Restaurants interested in selling to MDOC would need to be a registered vendor (PDF)with the State of Maine. Payments to vendors typically take two weeks. “I hope this move will provide some measure of relief to businesses in these counties as we work to protect public health, keep Maine people healthy and alive, and mitigate the spread of this deadly virus so we can safely reopen,” Mills said. “There is no scientific basis for these orders,” Lockman said. “It’s all about the arbitrary exercise of unchecked executive power by an unreconstructed 1960s radical who posed as a moderate to win election in 2018.” As the Bangor Daily News reported Tuesday, to date, 284 Mainers have been hospitalized with the infection caused by the Chinese coronavirus, and 89 people have died. There have been 2,349 confirmed and likely cases in the state. Those who have fully recovered from the illness number 1,586, leaving 674 active and likely cases, a drop from 684 on Sunday. Last week, a federal judge allowed to stand Mills’ order requiring tourists to self-quarantine for two weeks after entering Maine, which is known as “Vacationland.” The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a statement of interest in support of a lawsuit by campground and restaurant owners. According to a statement by Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband of the Civil Rights Division: The United States Constitution requires government to protect the privileges and immunities of all citizens in our nation. These privileges and immunities include the right of Americans to travel freely anywhere in our country, and state governments cannot limit the right of out-of-state Americans to travel to their state unless doing so is substantially related to protecting the public safety. The Department of Justice remains committed to defending the constitutional rights of all Americans no matter where they live. The department will continue to be especially vigilant of any infringement on the right to travel that unduly harms the ability of Americans to earn a living and support their families. In response to the DOJ’s statement of interest, Mills said, she was “deeply disappointed – and frankly disgusted – that the U.S Department of Justice is making a concerted effort to undermine the health of the people of Maine.” The governor added the DOJ did not raise similar objections “when the President and his own task force took steps to limit travel.” Mills said the required quarantine for visitors is “a proven tool to prevent the spread of this deadly disease.” “It seems to me that [the DOJ’s] only actual ‘interest’ here is, at best, political or, at worst, to harm Mainers, not defend them,” she stated. Lockman, however, said, “Jackboot Janet has effectively killed Maine’s summer tourist season, and, with it, hundreds, perhaps thousands of family-owned independent businesses.” “I’m afraid the damage to Maine’s fragile small-business economy will be permanent and irreversible,” he added.

As Mexico returns to normal activities, health officials revealed the country surpassed 10,100 fatalities from Coronavirus (COVID-19). The most recent figures rank Mexico seventh globally for fatalities and 14 for confirmed cases despite widespread allegations of under-counting. During a nightly news conference, Mexico’s Undersecretary of Health Hugo Lopez Gatell and staff revealed the most recent numbers showing 93,435 confirmed cases and 10,167 fatalities. Al 01 de junio de 2020 hay 93,435 casos confirmados, 16,303 confirmados activos y 38,497 sospechosos por #COVID19.

The real scope of the pandemic could be much worse since Lopez Gatell and his staff are widely accused of under-counting cases. Lopez Gatell admitted his figures only accounted for government hospital patients. That practice pushed several states to release their own figures showing between 30 to 50 percent more infections. Mexico continues to see between 2,500 to 3,200 new cases per day. The country began its return to normal activities on Monday where businesses in some regions are allowed to resume operations in a limited capacity.

PARIS (AP) – Parisians who have been cooped up for months with takeout food and coffee will be able to savour their steaks tartare in the fresh air and cobbled streets of the City of Light once more – albeit in smaller numbers. The city famed for its vibrant cafe society and coffee culture will get some of its pre-lockdown life back as cafes and restaurants partially reopen Tuesday. The Paris City Hall authorized the opening of outside seating areas, but indoors will remain closed to customers until at least June 22. Dampening the mood of new freedom, social distancing of one meter (about three feet) between tables will be obligatory and drastically reduce the numbers. For the city well-known for its tiny chairs and fashionably-small 50-centimeter-wide (20-inch-wide) round tables that often touch, this will lower capacity in some outside areas by over half. To help matters, the normally space-restricting Paris City Hall is now allowing restaurateurs to be expansive – and have issued an authorization for them to enlarge their outside areas, or create one, without the normal legal red tape until Sept. 30. To do this, they will have to sign a charter promising to respect “pedestrian traffic, the cleanliness of the premises, safety or even noise reduction vis-à-vis residents.” But some restaurateurs have said that they haven’t received the charter, and the details remain fuzzy and confusing.

Amsterdam Restaurant Tests ‘Greenhouse Dining’, as Europe Opens Up https://t.co/rMhWZx1MJb — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 6, 2020  Xavier Denamur, who owns five of the Marais´ most popular cafes and bistros with around 70 employees, was mixed in his reaction about the reopening. “It´s amazing that we´re finally opening up, but the outside area is just a fraction of the inside space,” he said. In one of his restaurant-bars La Belle Hortense, he said that out of a normal capacity of 126 people, there will just be room for eight. “It´s a start,” he conceded, but “two in three outside tables had to be removed.” Customers will have the freedom to eat without wearing a mask, but as soon as nature calls they will be required to don one to go to the inside bathroom. Some have complained that the government´s speedy announcement of the plans, just five days before reopening, were also problematic. “It was confirmed on Thursday, and with the holiday weekend it´s been almost impossible to order all the necessary products from Rungis,” Denamur said, referring to the Paris region´s principal food market.

ROME — Italians across the country are increasingly fed up with the bureaucratic slowness of returning life to normal after strict lockdowns, according to a survey. A survey of Italians during the final week of May reveals the highest levels of anger as a predominant emotion since the lockdowns began in early March. While feelings of uncertainty and vulnerability both diminished in the last week of May, these were replaced by growing ire at the government’s reluctance to relinquish its stranglehold on society. As Italians feel more and more confident in their overall health situation, they are losing hope in the future, reveals the survey, conducted by the marketing research company SWG. Survey by SWG market research company The underlying malaise and increasing rage were in evidence this past weekend, as protests erupted up and down the peninsula, from Milan to Sicily. The anger is chiefly directed at Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and many of the demonstrators called for his resignation as well as respect for the constitution, which guarantees basic freedoms. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> According to an analysis by Roberto Arditti, the president of Kratesis, a strategic management consultancy firm, the evident growing discontent among Italians is a powder keg that will explode if government does not accelerate a return to normal. While we have witnessed a decline in the primary emotions that dominated the long lockdown phase, only one has grown, that of anger, Arditti observes. The anger, which has increased from 17 percent in mid-March to 23 percent today, is still manageable, but only if swift action is taken, he states. According to Arditti, there are two primary causes of the rising resentment, namely the proverbial slowness of the public administration, that seems unable to take immediate action when it is called for, as well as recent discussions over continued isolation of certain regions, which risks provoking deeper divisions in the country. If the response to the current crisis are slow in coming, “the anger of the Italians could turn into a tsunami,” Arditti said. Italy is set to open up to interregional and international travel on Wednesday, but continuing restrictions on hotels, coffee bars, restaurants, and firms has made going back to business difficult and in many cases impossible. Last week, the iconic restaurant Dal Fortunato near the Pantheon in Rome posted large notices outside the building saying that there is no way for the establishment to reopen under current conditions.

On MSNBC on Monday, Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf (D) defended imposing an 8:oo p.m. curfew on the city by stating that the looting on Sunday, which impacted minority neighborhoods where people had already been hurt by the coronavirus. She also stated that while protests on Monday had been peaceful up to that point, if people don’t disperse when the curfew time comes, they will be arrested. She argued that such an action is needed, and “these types of demonstrations are really endangering public health.” Schaaf said that the protest on Friday, “was used as really a foil by people that were intent on doing damage and violence. But then last night was extremely different. We had groups all over our city, vandalism, looting, in, particularly, neighborhoods that are the most impacted by the coronavirus. Our neighborhoods in East Oakland and the Fruitvale where our African American and Latino communities live and depend on these businesses. They were hit last night.” She added that “there are two different things going on and let us not conflate them. There is legitimate protest and anger and grief over yet another killing of a black man at the hands of police, and this is within the context of the larger travesty of racism in America. And there is a group that is taking advantage of this moment to commit illegal acts, to do damage, to steal, to cause chaos. And we believe that those are two very different groups of people.” She concluded that the protests going on at the moment were a “beautiful, peaceful, family demonstration in solidarity with George Floyd and the quest for justice in our country. It’s going along beautifully. We are facilitating that peaceful demonstration, but when 8:00 comes tonight, we will be very clear that people must disperse. We will warn them. We will give them a safe way to exit an area. But if they do not, we will arrest them, and that is what we believe is necessary under these unprecedented conditions. And remember, you know, we were the very first region in the country to shut down our economy, to impose shelter-in-place, because of the coronavirus. So, our core small businesses are already suffering. We also believe that these types of demonstrations are really endangering public health.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

Violent protests erupted this weekend between “antifascist” radical leftists and supporters of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro across the country’s largest cities. The large organized “act against fascism and in defense of democracy” in Sao Paulo was reportedly organized by fans of the Corinthians soccer club. “We need to retake this space. The street is ours. We’ll be back next week,” one protester said as he was applauded by others, according to O Globo. The march attracted supporters of conservative President Bolsonaro, many of whom came dressed in the yellow and green colors of the Brazilian flag. AGORA NA AVENIDA PAULISTA.Ato contra o fascismo e em defesa da Democracia. O ato foi chamado pela Gaviōes da Fiel e vai unir outras torcidas organizada. “Hoje é o primeiro e vai se espalhar pelo Brasil” Por Lina Marinelli/jornalistas livres#fascistasnãopassarão pic.twitter.com/u2iS6VsZ3E — Jornalistas Livres (@J_LIVRES) May 31, 2020  The arrival of the conservative counter-protesters prompted Brazilian police to place a cordon between them to keep the peace. The two groups then proceeded to shout insults at each other. Conservatives reportedly began shouting, “go to Cuba!” to the leftist protesters, while the leftists replied, “go take chloroquine, cattle!” Bolsonaro has been a supporter of research suggesting that the drug chloroquine may be useful in combatting the Chinese coronavirus, a claim that has become a point of tense contention along ideological lines. One of the two health ministers Bolsonaro has fired during the pandemic claimed the president wanted to officially label chloroquine safe for use against coronavirus. “Go to Cuba” became a common slogan against the left in Bolsonaro’s 2018 campaign, a reply intended to highlight the ties between the Castro regime and the past presidents belonging to the socialist Workers’ Party (PT), Dilma Rousseff and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. In Rio de Janeiro, hundreds of protesters converged on the square in front of the state government palace Sunday chanting, “I can’t breathe! I can’t breathe!” an apparent reference to the riots in the United States in response to the death of Minnesota resident George Floyd, killed by a police officer. The Rio de Janeiro protest compared police brutality in the United States to that within Rio’s favelas, or slums, with signs calling on the police to “Stop killing us” and declaring that the “favela asks for peace.” “We are here today because we want to live,” one activist named Santiago told Voice of America. We are here today because we are tired of this genocidal state. We are here to say no more, no more!” In Brasilia, Bolsonaro attended an event organized by his supporters in continued protest against the lockdown measures imposed in response to the Chinese coronavirus by local authorities around the country. Having arrived on horseback and without a facemask, he did not make any remarks but instead greeted those in attendance, holding children in his arms and posing for selfies with his supporters.

As of Monday, health authorities have confirmed close to half a million confirmed cases of coronavirus and over 28,000 deaths, although some analysts believe these figures are below the actual number due to widespread lack of testing.

Over 70 people violently stormed the Karachi Civil Hospital in Pakistan on Friday night after alleging that the hospital administration “delayed handing over the body” of a coronavirus victim to his family, Pakistani newspaper Dawn reported on Saturday. At least one doctor was injured in the attack after she was “slapped” by one of the victim’s relatives, with one hospital official describing the mob as “beating doctors” during the assault. The mob vandalized the medical facility and “forcibly took away the body” of the victim. In videos taken of the mob at the hospital’s entrance, dozens of people are seen removing medical equipment, such as stretchers, from the facility and “breaking the sanitizer gate” at the entryway, Dawn reported. A local journalist for Pakistani newspaper the Express Tribune shared video footage of the mob attack, reporting that “the attackers had iron rods [and] knives” and shouted, “There is no corona[virus]. This is all a drama of doctors.” Karachi police and hospital officials said that a male patient was brought to the hospital early Friday morning “complaining of a heart problem” and died while being treated, according to Dawn. Suspecting the patient had coronavirus, the doctors conducted a test, which came back positive. The man’s relatives refused to accept the test results, accusing the doctors of declaring him to be positive for coronavirus “even though he was normal.” They then claimed the hospital was purposefully delaying the release of the man’s body and mobbed the facility late Friday night to forcibly retrieve it. Responding to allegations that the medical facility had delayed the release of the body, the hospital’s medical superintendent, Dr. Khadim Hussain Qureshi, told Dawn that doctors at Karachi Civic had followed the national government’s standard operating procedures (SOPs) for handling bodies of people who die from coronavirus. “We are government servants. We only follow what the government tells us,” he said. “It takes time for the [coronavirus test] result to be received,” he added. Qureshi expressed concern over the mob’s violent assault on doctors: What kind of ethics are these? Doctors are already putting their lives in danger to save people; the public should support them. The way they have resorted to beating doctors … if doctors refuse to work, who will save [the people]? A senior Karachi police official speaking to Dawn anonymously said that the hospital administration had not approached police to file a “first information report” (FIR), or the basic document to report a crime in Pakistan. He said that the police had decided to register a criminal case against the people involved in the attack over “charges of rioting and creating hindrances in official work.” Karachi police officials have also asked the hospital administration to supply CCTV footage of the incident so that authorities may identify and arrest suspects, according to the report. On May 14, a similar attack occurred at a different Karachi hospital, with a mob of at least nine people vandalizing a hospital ward and forcibly retrieving the body of a coronavirus victim they believed to be withheld from family by hospital authorities. Police arrested at least nine people involved in the attack and said no one was injured during the incident. Pakistan’s failing healthcare system struggled to treat citizens prior to the coronavirus pandemic due to the country’s poor infrastructure. Now, amid a recent increase in coronavirus cases and with the nation’s lockdown restrictions on peoples’ movement recently lifted, Pakistan’s hospitals are overwhelmed with the burden of treating a surging number of infections. National health authorities have warned they may be forced to reinstate a lockdown following the most recent spike in cases caused by the Eid al-Fitr Islamic holiday weekend at the end of May. At press time on Monday, Pakistan had recorded 72,460 infections and 1,543 deaths from the Chinese coronavirus. However, a lack of medical supplies such as testing kits and personal protective equipment (PPE) coupled with a general reluctance to test properly by the national government means Pakistan has tested just a small fraction of the population. The true number of coronavirus cases is likely much higher than reported.

President Trump activated the full D.C. National Guard on Sunday afternoon to protect life and property, after rioting throughout the weekend, the defacement of  monuments, and the setting fire to a historic church near the White House. A spokesman for the D.C. National Guard said “hundreds” of National Guardsmen — soldiers and airmen — are now added to other D.C. National Guard units that had been activated over the past four days. Trump was able to activate the National Guard forces versus a governor doing so, as D.C. is not a state and there is no governor to act as the approving authority. He activated them on Sunday at 5:00 p.m. D.C. National Guard Commanding General Army Maj. Gen. William J. Walker will command the Guardsmen. He will decide how to deploy and disperse them around the city to protect personnel and property, according to the spokesman. The Guard will be working with the U.S. Park Police, the federal police force for the district’s federal parks and monuments. They are working “24/7,” said spokesman Air National Guard Capt. Edwin Nieves, Jr. Nieves said the National Guardsmen may be armed by the order of the President for personal protection since they are not acting in a law enforcement role. They will also be wearing personal protective equipment and using crowd control equipment such as shields. The tasking for the National Guard across the country comes amid their mission to also assist with the fight against the coronavirus.   Follow Breitbart News’s Kristina Wong on Twitter or on Facebook.

Hong Kong police branded the city’s annual memorial for the victims of the Communist Party massacre at Tiananmen Square, Beijing, a “major threat to public health” on Monday, refusing to offer a permit. Every year since the massacre, beginning in 1990, Hong Kong has organized a candlelight vigil in honor of those killed during the 1989 massacre in Beijing. The vigil usually takes place in the city’s large Victoria Park, attracting thousands of people. Police have allowed the move without objection — including after China took over Hong Kong in 1997 — until this week. Hong Kong’s pro-China officials extended restrictions of public gatherings meant to contain the spread of the Chinese coronavirus last month, scheduling them to end June 5. When organizers submitted a request to hold the annual vigil on June 4, police said no. “Public assemblies are a high-risk activity due to large crowds gathering,” the police department said in a letter rejecting permission for the vigil. “Police believe that the event will not only increase participants’ chances of contracting the virus but also threaten citizens’ lives and health, thus endangering public safety and affecting the rights of others.” The letter was addressed to the organizer of the event, Richard Tsoi, vice-chair of Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China. Tsoi told reporters that his group may file an appeal, though they had also begun encouraging people to engage in a socially distanced candlelight vigil by holding candles at their doorsteps. The local broadcaster RTHK also highlighted impassioned comments from alliance Secretary-General Lee Cheuk-yan at a press conference on Monday in which he called the vigil a “litmus test” for One Country, Two Systems, the policy China agreed to govern Hong Kong under after the end of British rule. The policy prevents China from imposing Communist Party laws on the city and prevents the city from asserting national sovereignty. “In a way it’s a litmus test of one country two systems, if they suppress us, it means that one country two systems is no more,” Lee said, expressing concern that observance of the anniversary at all may soon be illegal. Hong Kong has seen a return of the pro-democracy protests that swept the region last year in the past month, as authorities were forced to ease coronavirus restrictions due to a lack of significant numbers of cases. The latest wave of protests is against a “national security” law passed by Beijing’s National People’s Congress, the Communist Party legislature, which allows Beijing to arrest and imprison Hong Kong residents for crimes such as “treason” and threats against the national security of China. As the Congress did not specifically enumerate elements of these crimes — but most dissent within China is tantamount to treason — Hongkongers have expressed alarm that they no longer possess freedom of expression. At the press conference Monday, Lee noted that vigil attendees typically chant, “end one-party dictatorship,” which may now be illegal. Lee also disparaged the alleged public health concerns to ban the vigil as “totally unreasonable and unscientific.” “We will mourn individually. We hope that there will be candles lit up in various districts across the city including ours at Victoria Park,” Lee announced. “Each candlelight vigil is self-initiated and does not constitute an assembly.” Hong Kong currently bans public gatherings of over eight people, so the organizers are hoping that small groups of eight will pop up throughout the city with candles. In addition, the Alliance has announced an online “vigil” and moment of silence that night. The Tiananmen Square massacre of June 4, 1989, killed an untold number of people, believed to be at least in the thousands, who had gathered peacefully in the nation’s capital to demand pro-democratic reforms. In 1989, the influence of the Soviet Union was waning in much of the world and uprisings against communist regimes spreading. Communist Party officials in Beijing responded by killing as many as possible, including many young people and students, in a military assault Beijing celebrated as recently as last year. Outside of Hong Kong, the Communist Party strictly censors searches related to the massacre. On June 4, even trying to conduct online searches for words like “today” could yield no results. In an exception, state media covered the massacre last year approvingly, a rare acknowledgment it ever occurred. Without mass killings, “China would have followed the way of the Soviet Union and collapsed,” an “expert” told the state-run Global Times. “That incident was a political turbulence and the central government took measures to stop the turbulence which is a correct policy,” China’s defense minister General Wei Fenghe said last year. “The 30 years have proven that China has undergone major changes China has enjoyed stability and development.” Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.

Monday at a press conference, Gov. Charlie Baker (R-MA) accused President Donald Trump of “bitterness, combativeness, and self-interest” amid the protests and looting in reactions to George Floyd’s death and the coronavirus pandemic. Earlier during a conference call, the president said governors and mayors were “weak” for not jailing protesters. Baker said, “I heard what the president said today about dominating and fighting. I know I should be surprised when I hear incendiary words like this from him, but I’m not. At so many times during these last several weeks, when the country needed compassion and leadership the most, it simply was nowhere to be found.” He continued, “Instead, we got bitterness, combativeness and self-interest. That’s not what we need in Boston. It’s not what we need right now in Massachusetts. And it’s definitely not what we need across this great country of ours either.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Government leaders and health experts fear the novel coronavirus, which has disproportionally plagued minority populations, could spread rapidly during mass protests over the death of George Floyd. On Sunday, Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) warned during NBC News’s Meet the Press that the protests, which tend to descend into rioting and looting at night, could “compound” the deadly and highly contagious COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus: I’m concerned that we had mass gatherings on our streets when we just lifted a stay at home order and what that could mean for spikes in coronavirus cases later. In fact, I’m so concerned about it that I’m urging everybody to consider their exposure — if they need to isolate from their family members when they go home and if they need to be tested — because we have worked very hard to blunt the curve. And while I saw some people with masks last night, others didn’t. When I saw some people social distancing, other people were right on top of each other. So we don’t want to compound this deadly virus and the impact it’s had on our community. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) expressed a similar sentiment on CNN’s State of the Union, saying he is “a little bit concerned” about the protests fueling the further spread of the coronavirus. He proclaimed: Right now, the immediate concern is to lower the temperature, stop the looting, and potentially keep our citizens safe from the riots that are going on. But the next step is to worry about this, what we have been focused on for the past couple of months, is the safety — dealing with this coronavirus. And there’s no question that, when you put hundreds or thousands of people together in close proximity, when we have got this virus all over the streets, is — it’s not healthy. There’s about a 14-day incubation period. So, two weeks from now across America, we’re going to find out whether or not this gives us a spike and drives the numbers back up again or not. Over the weekend, Breitbart News reported that some political leaders, namely in Minnesota and New York, fear that the mass protests and riots are an ideal breeding ground for COVID-19. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) expressed concerns about the riots’ impact on coronavirus, declaring on Saturday that “it’s inevitable” the demonstrations will lead to an increase in cases. “I am deeply concerned about a super-spreader type of incident,” the Democrat governor said. “We’re going to see a spike in COVID-19. It’s inevitable.” Minnesota State Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm issued a similar warning last Thursday. “We know, large gatherings do pose a risk in any epidemic, but certainly where we stand today with the state of COVID-19 spread in our community,” she said. “Knowing that we have community spread, we just want to again encourage folks who gather to be mindful of the risk.” Officials in New York, considered the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States, shared Gov. Walz’s fears about the potential for a rise in coronavirus among protesters. On Saturday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) proclaimed: I would still wish that everyone would realize that when people gather, it’s inherently dangerous in the context of this pandemic, and I’m going to keep urging people not to use that approach, and if they do, they focus on social distancing and wearing face coverings. “The last thing we would want to see is members of our community harmed because the virus spread in one of these settings,” he added. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) echoed De Blasio over the weekend, saying protestors and rioters “don’t have a right to infect other people.” On Monday, Cuomo indicated the demonstrations could jeopardize the state’s huge gains against the deadly virus. The protests and riots sweeping cities across the nation, including New York City, “could potentially be infecting hundreds and hundreds of people, after everything that we have done,” the governor noted. He added, “We have to take a minute and ask ourselves, what are we doing here?” Public health experts also warned that the crowds participating in the protests across American, numbering at the very least in the tens of thousands, could cause a surge in COVID-19 cases. Dr. Howard Markel, a medical historian who studies pandemics, told the New York Times: Yes, the protests are outside, but they are all really close to each other, and in those cases, being outside doesn’t protect you nearly as much. Public gatherings are public gatherings — it doesn’t matter what you’re protesting or cheering. That’s one reason we’re not having large baseball games and may not have college football this fall. “There are a huge number of asymptomatic carriers, and that makes it hugely risky,” he added. In an interview with CBS News’s Face the Nation, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), predicted that mass demonstrations would lead to new “chains of transmission.” Floyd died last Monday after a Minneapolis after Derek Chauvin, a now-fired white police officer, kneeled on his neck for several minutes in an incident caught on camera. Floyd was unarmed. On Friday, authorities charged Chauvin with third-degree murder and manslaughter.

The government has effectively made it illegal for people who don’t already live together to have sex, as that would be considered a “gathering”, and against the coronavirus lockdown social distancing laws. New amendments to the lockdown law loosen most of the major restrictions than had been put in place in March, including easing restrictions on senior citizens and those with underlying health conditions. Schools can reopen on Monday, and people can gather outside, including in gardens, in numbers of up to six as long as social distancing is still maintained. But a new line to the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) Bill adds on Monday: “No person may participate in a gathering which takes place in a public or private place indoors, and consists of two or more persons.” It says elsewhere, according to The Mirror, that “no person may, without reasonable excuse, stay overnight at any place other than the place where they are living”. The law means that both the person visiting and the person whose house is being visited could be fined £100, or £50 if paid within 14 days. Lawyers went to work on Twitter to discuss the interpretation of the law, with Human rights barrister Adam Wagner writing on Sunday: “I can’t believe I’m about to tweet this. From tomorrow sex between two (or more) people in a private place who do not live in the same household is a ‘gathering’ between 2 or more people and is therefore illegal.” However, George Pertez QC put forth that if the visitor was a prostitute, then that might be permissible “as that is reasonably necessary for work purposes”. Professor Lockdown Resigns After Breaking Own Lockdown Rules to Meet Left-Wing 'Open Marriage' Lover: Report https://t.co/N8LmFZSrKS — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 5, 2020  Police, however, will not have the power to forcibly enter your home to stop you having intercourse with a lover from another address. A spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the Metro that police could only enter a property “where they suspect serious criminal activity is taking place under separate and existing laws”. The spokesman added that police would continue “exercising their common sense and engaging with the public”. The Police Federation of England and Wales had said in April that it wanted increased powers to forcibly enter private houses to see if there were illegal gatherings. Constabularies and police forces across the country had come under criticism for their tyrannical approach to enforcing the lockdown. Such examples have included pouring black dye into a body of water in a beauty spot to deter swimmers, using a drone to follow dog-walkers, and shaming people for going for a drive out of boredom or families who walked to the shops together. Last month, the Crown Prosecution Service said that it was going to review every fine and prosecution made under the coronavirus legislation after it was found that the law had been applied either incorrectly or in a heavy-handed manner. The government’s scientific adviser Neil Ferguson, the author of the UK’s lockdown measures, resigned from his post after it was revealed that he had broken lockdown to have at least two liaisons with his married lover. Police said at the time that they would not be investigating further Mr Ferguson’s lockdown breach.

MADRID (AP) – Spain on Monday reported no official deaths from the new coronavirus in a 24-hour period for the first time since March. The development is “very, very encouraging,” emergency health response chief Fernando Simón said. Also, Spain recorded only 71 new COVID-19 infections over the past 24 hours, he told a news conference. “We are in a very good place in the evolution of the pandemic,” Simón said. “The statistics are following a trend. They are going in the right direction.” Spain reported its first two deaths on March 3. Another was reported two days later. Spain´s number of infections and death jumped exponentially. On April 2, it recorded 950 deaths in 24 hours – the peak death toll. The official death toll now stands at 27,127, with 240,000 confirmed cases. Spain was the second European country after Italy to be forcefully hit by the pandemic before it also spread death in France and Britain. One of the world´s strictest lockdowns was put into place in mid-March and managed to eventually reduce the pressure on hospitals after some were overwhelmed with patients suffering from the virus. The lockdown is gradually being relaxed as the medical situation improves. The Spanish government has warned, however, that the threat is not over and that the loosening of restrictions could be reversed. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said last weekend he will be asking parliament for an extension of the government´s special emergency powers for another two weeks. That enables authorities to order people to stay home. Simon said recent hot spots caused by people holding unauthorized “fiestas” can potentially bring a major new resurgence. “We are still at risk. Any of these outbreaks can mean a new wave of infections,” he said. “We must remain cautious.”


Sadiq Khan has written a letter to the government in which he called for an extension to the Brexit transition period to avoid “needless and hazardous” impacts during the economic crisis spurred on by the Chinese coronavirus. The Europhile mayor of London wrote to the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove — the minister in charge of the country’s Brexit talks with the European Union — saying that an “extension to the transition period is now urgently needed to give businesses and public services some certainty” during the coronavirus crisis. “The last thing the country needs as it tries to find a way back from the devastation wreaked by coronavirus is more chaos and uncertainty,” he wrote, per City A.M. “I urge the government to put political ideology aside and pursue the pragmatic route of seeking an extension to the negotiations so that we and our European partners can focus on recovery from Covid-19,” he added. The move by Khan comes in opposition to the party line set out by Labour leader Keir Starmer, who said last week that the issue of Brexit was “over” and pledged not to campaign to rejoin the EU. “We’ve left the EU, and therefore the Leave/Remain argument is over and the only argument now is what sort of a deal we have with the EU and what sort of deals we have with the rest of the world,” Starmer said. Brexit Day: Sadiq Khan ‘Heartbroken’ Britain is Finally Leaving the EU https://t.co/dPn7dmP2Ba — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 31, 2020  Khan’s attempt to stymie the UK from reclaiming full independence from the bloc comes after the EU’s trade negotiator, Michel Barnier, wrote a letter to a group of Europhile MPs, saying that the bloc would support extending the transition period by up to two years. The proposed delay would effectively postpone Brexit until 2023 — seven years after the British people voted to leave. A government spokesman said in response to the mayor’s letter: “An extension to the transition period would bind us into future EU legislation, without us having any say in designing it, but still having to foot the bill as we would still have to make payments into the EU budget.” “The EU themselves have said that their next budget will be unusual, and we would have no say in what it would go towards. “We need to be able to design our own rules, in our best interests, to manage our response to coronavirus – without the constraints of following EU rules,” the spokesman added. Teams of negotiators from the UK and the EU will meet this week and meetings between Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are scheduled for next month. The top negotiator for the UK, David Frost, has pledged that if there is no progress made, Britain will walk away from talks and begin preparing to trade with the bloc on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms. “It’s the firm policy of the government that we will not extend the transition period and, if asked, we would not agree to it,” Frost said. London Mayor Sadiq Khan says "structural racism" in Britain has led to more racial minorities dying from coronavirus. https://t.co/sAUVrZc4Fr — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) April 22, 2020  Follow Kurt on Twitter at @KurtZindulka

First Lady Melania Trump on Monday spoke out against the violent protests blighting major cities across the country. “Saddened to see our country and communities being damaged and vandalized,” she wrote on Twitter. “I ask everyone to protest in peace and focus on taking care of one another and healing our great nation.” Saddened to see our country & communities being damaged & vandalized.

She also urged Americans to continue working to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. “I’ve seen our citizens unify and take care of one another through COVID19 and we can’t stop now,” she wrote. She also offered her sympathies for the family of George Floyd, who died after a police officer pressed his neck with his knee for several minutes while putting him into custody. Floyd’s death sparked protests across the country. “My deepest condolences to the family of George Floyd,” she wrote. “As a nation, let’s focus on peace, prayers & healing.” Saddened to see our country & communities being damaged & vandalized.

ROME — Pope Francis has called for priority to be given to persons rather than to the economy in responding to the coronavirus pandemic. “I make an appeal: that nobody lacks healthcare,” the pope said during his Regina Caeli message in Saint Peter’s Square Sunday. “Care for people, instead of saving for the economy. Care for people, who are more important than the economy.” “We people are temples of the Holy Spirit, the economy is not,” the pontiff insisted. The pope has often proposed a dichotomy between opting for people or opting for the economy, but it is not apparent how this clean differentiation works. The economy does not exist independently of people and when people lose their jobs and their savings, it is these real people and those who depend on them who suffer as a consequence. According to a series of reports, in fact, poor people are suffering disproportionately from the economic downturn caused by the extreme measures adopted to counter the coronavirus pandemic. While many affluent people have reserves of savings and can get by even without working for a while, the poor do not have this luxury since a great many live from paycheck to paycheck. One recent report predicted that the rise in the suicide rate caused by lockdowns and job losses in Australia will exceed deaths from the Wuhan coronavirus by a factor of ten. Researchers from Sydney University’s Brain and Mind Centre said they expect a 50 percent rise in the national suicide rate because of the economic and social impact of government responses to the virus, which will drive deaths to as much as ten times higher than those causes by the coronavirus itself. Italy, on the other hand, has reported large numbers of people who are paid under the table and therefore have no unemployment benefits when they are unable to work. Some 300,000 people are paid under the table in Sicily alone, out of 3,700,000 in all of Italy, and most now find themselves without any income, a situation that the Mafia could exploit as people get desperate, warned Leoluca Orlando, the mayor of Palermo, Sicily. “Discomfort and malaise are growing and we are recording worrying reports of protest and anger that is being exploited by criminals who want to destabilize the system,” Mr. Orlando said in late March. “The more time passes, the more resources are exhausted,” he said. “The little savings people have are running out.” “In the south, there is a very fragile socio-economic balance, where black market work, mafias, and crime thrive,” noted the former president of the Italian Senate, Pietro Grasso. “There is a portion of population that leaves the house in the morning with the sole aim of feeding their family, without a reference point. All these families now have no chance of finding a solution to their livelihood,” he said. Last week, the Italian newspaper Il Giornale reported that nearly a third of the country’s businesses will not reopen and millions will remain without work or income, part of the long-term human cost of Italy’s nationwide coronavirus lockdown. In the United States as well, a number of social commentators have suggested that the damage caused by lockdowns could be worse than those of the virus itself. “Many large companies can withstand a few weeks without revenue but that isn’t true of millions of small and mid-sized firms,” one Wall Street Journal op-ed noted. The human cost of government-mandated shutdowns in terms of job losses and bankruptcies will “exceed what most Americans imagine,” the article stated, adding that shuttering the national economy will result in “a tsunami of economic destruction that will cause tens of millions to lose their jobs.” In a 2015 press conference Pope Francis confessed that he has “a great aversion” toward the economy because his father was an accountant and used to bring his work home with him on the weekends, and that, in fact, he does not actually “understand” the economy very well. If this is indeed the case, humility and good sense would seem to dictate that sweeping statements denouncing attention to economic recovery in favor of helping “people” would be better left unsaid. Sometimes, saving the “people” means saving the economy that puts food in their mouths and clothes on their backs. It is hard to imagine a more effective strategy for helping real people than by putting them back to work. Follow @tdwilliamsrome

AP MADRID – Spain´s national statistics office said that it received zero international tourists in April after the nation had closed its borders at the height of its coronavirus outbreak. In April 2019, 7 million tourists spent 7 billion euros ($7.8 billion) in Spain. Spain is waiting until July to reopen its border for foreign tourists. In the meantime, authorities are encouraging Spaniards to vacation inside at home. Tourism is a pillar of Spain´s economy. Eighty million annual visitors generate 12% of Spain´s gross domestic product and help employ 2.6 million people. Amid the global economic slowdown provoked by the pandemic, Spain´s government forecasts its economy will shrink by 9% and unemployment to reach 19% this year. Meanwhile museums are reopening in the Netherlands. AP reports: In the Netherlands, some of the most beloved museums in the world reopened to the public, with Rembrandt´s The Night Watch and Van Gogh´s Sunflowers back on show. And out of gratitude, visitors to the Van Gogh museum even received a real sunflower upon their departure. At the Mauritshuis in the Hague, the gaze of Vermeer´s Girl with the Pearl was also enticing visitors to come back. All such treasures had been hidden from the public for over two months as the nations was forced into lockdown measures for the coronavirus. At the most famous institution, the Rijksmuseum, visitors even got to hear that the blockbuster show “aravaggio-Bernini. Baroque in Rome” was being extended until September. Museums all over the world have been struggling to get through the pandemic crisis and UNESCO has said that one in eight might have to close their doors for good. Some of the major institutions in Europe have been losing over 2 million euros ($2.2 million) a month. Rembrandt´s The Night Watch

On Monday morning, certain states in Mexico will be given permission to return to a “new normal” as they restart from lockdown. The push to reopen comes as the country climbs to seventh place globally for Coronavirus fatalities. During a daily news conference, Mexico’s Undersecretary of Health Hugo Lopez Gatell said the nation will follow a color-coded system based on the number of cases in each state. Most of Mexico is listed “red” as the virus spreads with an approximate fatality rate of 11 percent.

Lopez Gatell admitted that some of the figures in his reports only account for cases in government hospitals. This discrepancy pushed several states to release their own statistics that show between 30-50 percent more cases. Ildefonso Ortiz is an award-winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.

Democrats locked young people down for no valid reason for an indeterminate amount of time and now we got riots. Huh? How about that? What did you idiots expect? Did you think you could lock down millions and millions and millions of young people for no valid reason, give them no reopen date — rob them of their jobs, of school, of structure; remove the social outlets — sports, bars, parties — that allow them to burn off energy and aggression, to blow off steam, and there would be no consequence? Worse still, and exclusively in the Democrat-run states and cities that have so far seen the worst violence (Minneapolis, Los Angeles, Chicago, Detroit, New York), young people are still locked down, and they’re locked down with no end in sight because their idiot political leaders (all Democrats) keep moving the goalposts and still refuse to offer a clear reopening deadline to grab hold of. And then there is the simple fact young people were and are locked down for no valid scientific or moral reason. It’s just a fact that if you’re under 50 years of age, the coronavirus is no more fatal than the seasonal flu. Nevertheless, even though people in their teens and twenties are probably in more danger of dying in a car accident than they are of the coronavirus, we shut them down, we shattered their lives… We locked them down, annihilated whatever structure they had — we killed their source of income, told them they couldn’t gather, couldn’t go to camp, they lost graduation ceremonies that can never be repeated and graduation parties they dream of all year… We boarded up the basketball hoops, poured sand in the skateboard parks, closed the parks and beaches, eliminated church functions, outlawed parties… Hell, we outlawed just hanging out and playing grab-ass with your buddies, which is the perfect way to blow off some steam. And in many of these Democrat-run cities, there’s still no end in sight. Just when the citizens of these states and cities believe their Democrat leaders are going to set them free, it’s two more weeks, two more weeks, two more weeks… This is madness. The curve is bent and has been bent for more than a month. Remember that? Remember when we were told we had to lose our jobs and social lives and everything that makes worth living to bend the infection curve, to ensure our health care systems weren’t overwhelmed? Remember when we were told that was The Goal? Well, the curve is not just bent, it’s flattened, and in 98 percent of the country the system was never in any danger of being overwhelmed… But here we are, two more weeks and two more weeks and two more weeks, and there are still Democrat governors who still have their citizens locked down… And for no good reason —  unless you believe keeping entire cities locked down to damage the economy to get Rapey Joe Biden elected is a good reason. Listen, I’m not saying that there would not have been some violence after what those cops did to George Floyd (cops who are part of a police department that’s been run by Democrats for 48 years). Another Ferguson or Baltimore was certainly possible without these pointless lockdowns. But, come on, this no longer has anything to do with Mr. Floyd. Listen, when you’re teenager or a twenty-something who’s been locked down for weeks, and have lost faith the lockdown will ever end, a little of the ol’ ultra-violence looks pretty good, like a choice way to finally blow off that steam, socialize, and feel a part of something other than your iPhone and crappy apartment. Plus, these riots are media approved! That’s the best part! The media will scold and shame you for going to the beach, attending church, enjoying a block party, or hanging out at the park. That’s verboten. But as soon as people started gathering to riot… Well, did you notice how the very same media that shamed churchgoers and kids partying in the Ozarks turned around to justify and excuse massive crowds of people gathering and socializing? You see, according to the media (who set all the rules), pick-up basketball is evil, looting and burning is moral. What the hell did you expect to come from that? “Woe to those who call evil good and good evil.” Listen, don’t get me wrong… I don’t really care about any of this. You see, I live in Rural America… Y’all want to vote for the Democrats who lock people down until they blow up, that’s your choice. Y’all want to support a media that encourages people to burn down your neighborhood, that’s your choice. It’s a free country. You get what you vote for and you fools got riots. Out here in Red America, we all we got is peace and quiet… Out here in Red America, these riots are merely a reality show called TOLDJASO. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

One of the witnesses who reported Dominic Cummings for allegedly breaking lockdown drove 250 miles during it himself, while another now admits he made up a sighting of the adviser — supposedly as a joke. Retired teacher Robin Lees reported Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s chief adviser to the police after seeing him near Barnard Castle, where he had made a short drive to see if he was well enough for a longer journey back to London. Durham Constabulary, which did not find that Mr Cummings’ initial trip from London broke the lockdown rules, has said the Barnard Castle outing may have been a “minor breach”. However, the Mail on Sunday now suggests that the man who reported Mr Cummings to the police force “broke lockdown regulations himself by making a 526-mile round-trip from Barnard Castle to London to bring his university student daughter to the family home. “My daughter came back from Canada and isolated in London. She never came home for seven weeks. I didn’t break any lockdown rules. I went and collected her after we were told we could,” Lees insisted to reporters, referring to an easing of travel restrictions on May 11th to allow people to drive as far as they pleased — although the Mail on Sunday notes that “this was only if they were going to an outdoors location and as long as the social distancing protocol was observed.” “I tell the truth and I do not like this intrusion into my family and this is absolutely nothing to do with them,” Lees complained — somewhat ironically, given Cummings did himself move from London to Durham to make sure his 4-year-old would not be without childcare if he and his wife were incapacitated by their coronavirus infections. “I do object to my family being involved. This is nothing to do with my family, right? I have had a lot of stuff on Twitter,” Lees added. ‘Social distancing’   pic.twitter.com/yEHWYmjxvA — Michael Heaver (@Michael_Heaver) May 24, 2020  The revelations come as another supposed witness to Cummings’ movements during lockdowns, Remain supporter Tim Matthews, reveals he outright fabricated his sighting of Cummings — lending credence to the Brexiteer’s insistence that allegations of a second trip to Durham are wholly false. “I made that up afterwards, a few days ago in fact,” Matthews admitted. “I modified it for a little bit of comedy value,” he added, referring to Strav running app data which he doctored in order to make it look as though he was in an area where Cummings was alleged to have travelled. “I undid it later, I’m sorry. A bit of comedy value even if it was really inappropriate,” Matthews added.

ROME — Pope Francis urged Christians Sunday to work for unity and warned them of the triple threat of narcissism, victimhood, and pessimism. In homily on the feast of Pentecost, which commemorates the coming of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles, the pope said that there are three main enemies “always lurking at the door of our hearts: narcissism, victimhood, and pessimism” and each of these has been present during the coronavirus pandemic. “Narcissism makes us idolize ourselves, to be concerned only with what is good for us,” he said in St. Peter’s Basilica. “The narcissist thinks: ‘Life is good if I profit from it.’ So he or she ends up saying: ‘Why should I give myself to others?’” This temptation has been especially evident during the health crisis, he suggested, where selfishness and a retreat into one’s own concerns has been in evidence. “In this time of pandemic, how wrong narcissism is: the tendency to think only of our own needs, to be indifferent to those of others, and not to admit our own frailties and mistakes,” he said. “But the second enemy, victimhood, is equally dangerous,” the pontiff continued. “Victims complain every day about their neighbour: ‘No one understands me, no one helps me, no one loves me, everyone has it in for me!’” Like narcissists, professional victims are self-centered, but this malady reveals itself in a slightly different way. “How many times have we not heard these complaints! The victim’s heart is closed, as he or she asks, ‘Why aren’t others concerned about me?’” he said. “In the crisis we are experiencing, how ugly victimhood is! Thinking that no one understands us and experiences what we experience.” The third enemy is pessimism, according to which nothing is going well in society, politics, or the Church, Francis said. “The pessimist gets angry with the world, but sits back and does nothing, thinking: ‘What good is giving? That is useless.’” This temptation has also manifested itself during the pandemic, the pope concluded, and shows itself especially in exaggerating the problem and believing that nothing will ever return to normal. “At this moment, in the great effort of beginning anew, how damaging is pessimism, the tendency to see everything in the worst light and to keep saying that nothing will return as before!” he said. “When someone thinks this way, the one thing that certainly does not return is hope.” These three enemies disguise an unnamed idolatry, the worship of a false god, Francis said. The narcissist’s idol is the mirror, the “mirror-god,” he said, while the victim worships the “complaint-god” and the pessimist worships the “negativity-god,” each of which leads to a loss of hope and of appreciation for the gift of life. “We need the Holy Spirit, the gift of God, he said, because He “heals us of narcissism, victimhood and pessimism” and heals us from “the mirror, complaints, and darkness.” Follow @tdwilliamsrome

ROME — Pope Francis said this weekend the coronavirus pandemic should transform people’s lives for the better, opening the way for a “more Christian society.” “When we get out of this pandemic, we will not be able to continue doing what we have been doing, and how we have been doing it. No, everything will be different,” the pope said in a video-message for the Christian feast of Pentecost, commemorating the coming of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles. “Out the great tests of humanity — and among them the pandemic — people come out either better or worse. They do not come out the same,” Francis said in his Spanish-language address. Having suffered the lockdowns, people should be more attuned to the needs of others, he said, and more disposed to tackle the “pandemic of poverty.” “All the suffering will have been useless if we do not build together a fairer, more equitable, more Christian society, not in name, but in reality, a reality that leads us to Christian conduct,” he continued. “If we do not work to end the pandemic of poverty in the world, with the pandemic of poverty in each of our countries, in the city where each one of us lives, this time will have been in vain.” “Today more than ever we need the Father to send us the Holy Spirit,” the pope said, because the world needs true witnesses to Jesus. “Today the world suffers, it is wounded. We live in a very wounded, suffering world, especially the poorest, who are discarded,” he said. “When all our human securities have disappeared, the world needs us to give it Jesus. It needs our witness to the Gospel, the Gospel of Jesus.” “We do not save ourselves. No one is saved alone. Nobody,” Francis said. “We know it, we knew it, but this pandemic that we live has made us experience it in a much more dramatic way.” “We have before us the duty to build a new reality,” he added. “The Lord will do it and we can collaborate, since he says, ‘I make all things new.’” Follow @tdwilliamsrome

NEW YORK (AP) — Major League Baseball players proposed a 114-game regular season Sunday, up from 82 in management’s offer, but no additional pay cuts beyond the one they agreed to in March, a person familiar with the plan told The Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because no details were announced. Opening day in the coronavirus-delayed season would be June 30 and the regular season would end Oct. 31, nearly five weeks after the Sept. 27 conclusion that MLB’s proposal stuck to from the season’s original schedule. The union offered scheduling flexibility to include more doubleheaders. Players, like MLB, would increase postseason teams from 10 to 14. While management proposed an expanded postseason for 2020 only, the union offered it for this year and next. A player would receive about about 70% of his salary under the union plan. MLB’s offer Tuesday included a sliding scale in which those at the $563,500 minimum would get about 47% and those at the top — led by Mike Trout and Gerrit Cole at $36 million — would receive less than 23%. All players would have the right to opt out of the season under the union plan. Those who meet qualifications for high risk or reside with a person who qualifies as high risk would receive salary and major league service. Others who opt out would receive major league service time but no salary. If the postseason is not held because of a second wave of the pandemic, the union plan calls for $100 million of the approximately $2.8 billion in salary to be deferred with interest, payable in November 2021 and November 2022. Only players whose original 2020 salaries were $10 million or more would be subject to having money deferred. The union estimates high-payroll teams would have up to $7 million in payroll relief, the person said.

Several peaceful protestors — including the brother of former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn — were arrested at an anti-lockdown demonstration at Speakers’ Corner in London. On Saturday, at least five protestors were arrested by police for allegedly breaking the national lockdown rules by gathering in Hyde Park. Piers Corbyn, a British meteorologist and the brother of the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, sarcastically told police officers that he came to the park for a “picnic”. The climate change sceptic and anti-lockdown activist claimed in a speech: “We’ve got to take back control of the National Health Service (NHS) from this Covid operation. In April, as many people committed suicide in the whole year, there are more people dying because of the Covid lockdown than it is saving.” “The National Health Service has become a Nazified propaganda machine for ‘contagion’. They’re telling us — they said the Jews had contagion — they’re saying everybody in this country could have possible contagion. So, therefore, they can be followed and locked up, ghettoized. We have the Nazification of the National Health Service and we oppose it absolutely,” Corbyn added. After his short speech, Mr Corbyn was arrested by police, who took him away in a van. Mr Corbyn was also arrested earlier this month during a similar anti-lockdown protest in Hyde Park. At the May 16th protest, Breitbart London’s James Delingpole was threatened with a fine and possible arrest by a member of London’s Metropolitan Police for attending the event, despite his “key worker” status as a journalist. There have been over 14,000 fines issued by police during the lockdown since it was introduced on March 23, by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. One protester told Breitbart London: “Isn’t it extraordinary that in the whole history of the world, we’ve never had such a thing as ‘lockdown’ before, so where did that idea come from? Well, it came from Wuhan didn’t it? “So the rest of the world looks at this concept of lockdown — based on these completely erroneous figures — and thinks ‘Well we’ll copy it’. So with that, the Communist Party [of China] have managed to take down the global capitalist system institutions without even firing a bullet,” she concluded. In response to the demonstration, a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police said: “A small number arrests have been made at each site for breach of Covid-19 regulations and some fixed penalty notices issued.” PICS: Antifa, Black Lives Matter Flood London Despite Lockdown, Police Do Little https://t.co/ySrdWGyW0R — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 31, 2020  Follow Kurt on Twitter at @KurtZindulka    

A Cleveland business owner whose cupcake shop got destroyed on Saturday night by rioters said that during the Chinese virus pandemic, she couldn’t have imagined her business getting “hit worse than ever.” Colossal Cupcakes — a popular vibrant and colorful cupcake shop located in the heart of downtown Cleveland, Ohio — was completely “destroyed” by rioters on Saturday evening, according to a report by Fox 8 News. “A gunshot went off and the main window went down. Protesters started pouring into the store,” said Kelly Kandah, the owner of Colossal Cupcakes, to Fox 8. Kandah, who lives nearby her cupcake shop, said that she rushed to the store to close it down upon hearing that rioters were on the move in the city. At the time of closing, four employees were still inside the shop. “I thought if they saw me there, they wouldn’t want to hurt anyone,” said Kandah. “But they started throwing bricks and paint cans and stuff at me and the staff. We hurried and rushed into the back bathroom but they kept coming through the windows.” From there, the store owner barricaded herself with her four employees inside the bathroom and locked the door. She then called the police. “It was horrible,” she said. “We were just listening to them destroy everything. I was so scared in so many ways.” Kandah said that she and her employees remained locked inside the bathroom, only to come out after hearing that police had entered the cupcake shop. “Everything is gone or destroyed,” said Kandah of what remains of her store. “The chandeliers are ripped down, the actual cupcake cases are gone. They took our princess chairs and used them to destroy other cases.” “There is nothing left in there, just glass,” she added. “We just got through what I imagined would be our hardest time, the COVID crisis,” said Kandah. “I never imagined we could get hit worse than ever.” Other businesses in the area were also broken into on Saturday night, including the Cleveland Indians Team Shop and CVS, according to Fox 8. Riots taking place in cities across the country appear to be in response to the death of George Floyd, who died on Monday after former police officer Derek Chauvin was seen pressing his knee onto Floyd’s neck. On Friday, the state of Minnesota announced that Chauvin was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Following Floyd’s death, days of protests ensued, which quickly devolved into the violent riots that are now taking place across the country. The riots have involved looting, buildings being set on fire, businesses destroyed, the White House going on lockdown, and people being beaten and killed. The riots have prompted the mayors of several cities across the country to issue curfews in an attempt to quell the chaos, with some even calling on their state’s governor to activate the National Guard for help. On Saturday, Ohio governor Mike DeWine activated the state’s National Guard to help respond to the violent riots in Cleveland. On Sunday, President Donald Trump announced that the United States will be designating the violent leftist group Antifa as a terrorist organization.

The chairman of the Republican Party in New Mexico on Saturday lambasted the state’s Gov. Michelle Lujan-Grisham (D), suggesting she is a hypocrite for violating her coronavirus lockdown order to make a frivolous jewelry purchase and accused her of lying about it. Asked about the governor breaking her own lockdown rule back in April, Steve Pearce told Breitbart News Saturday host Matthew Boyle, “All across the country Democrat governors think of themselves above the law.” “I think that’s the pattern that we’re seeing,” he added later. “This sense of entitlement. This sense of not having to live by the same rules that they impose on the rest of us is really angering a lot of people and is devastating to New Mexico’s economy.” He went on to accuse Lujan-Grisham (pictured), a potential running mate for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, of lying about violating her stay-at-home order. “Her staff said well [the jewelry] was actually delivered at the curb and then they changed their story — well it was actually delivered to the home of one of the staffers,” Pearce explained. “All of that stuff was not permitted in New Mexico at the time.” He pointed out the state forced a business in Albuquerque to shut down for making curbside sales, consistent with what the governor claimed to have done to get her jewelry in the same city. “An Albuquerque nursery was doing the same thing showing pictures online. People would come and pick up a plant at the curb,” he said. “They were shut down” around the time that the governor made the jewelry purchase under similar circumstances back in April. “The governor’s office is now saying innovative businesses could’ve done the same thing [make curbside sales] if they had any ingenuity about them, just total lies coming out of the governor’s office,” Pearce declared. “And that’s what should make people mad that number one, you do it, number two you get caught, and number three you lie about it.” Our Governor is the latest Democrat to decide that the rules they impose on their citizens to address the COVID-19 pandemic don’t apply to her. A bombshell report reveals that the governor violated her own stay-at-home order to stock up on some high-end jewelry. — New Mexico GOP (@NewMexicoGOP) May 27, 2020  On April 6, New Mexico Health Secretary Kathy Kunkel issued a public health order, prohibiting non-essential businesses like jewelry stores from making any in-person sales. It was not until May 1 that the health order allowed retail curbside pickup. The governor made the jewelry purchase in April. In an interview with the Albuquerque Journal, Nora Meyers Sackett, a spokeswoman for Lujan-Grisham, argued the governor did not violate the lockdown order because it was “contact-free purchase.” She claimed a friend of the governor picked up the purchased item form outside the home of one of the jewelry store’s employees. Ultimately, the governor claimed she purchased the jewelry during the shutdown to “support a local business.” The GOP chief agreed with the Breitbart News Saturday host that Gov. Lujan-Grisham is distracted by her desire to be Biden’s vice president, and has taken her eye off the ball of helping New Mexico residents deal with the coronavirus. “I think she’s trying to stamp some sort of invisible credentials the rest of us don’t see,” Pearce said.

Michel Martin, the black host of National Public Radio’s Weekend Edition Saturday, said “protesters” in Minneapolis have been subjected to tear gas and other enforcement while “mostly white protesters” who gathered in Wisconsin and Michigan last month to push for governors to allow businesses to reopen after the coronavirus lockdown were “heavily armed” and “occupied” the state capitols. The report comes as riots break out in Minnesota and across the country after the death of George Floyd at the hands of police officers on Memorial Day. “This hour, we’ll have the latest from Minneapolis and an update on protests nationwide,” said Martin on the taxpayer-funded media outlet’s weekly program. “But first, we want to take a moment to note how the unrest over Floyd’s death comes at an extraordinary time for America, as the country takes the first tentative steps to reopen from a pandemic lockdown, a crisis in which black and brown Americans have experienced disproportionate sickness, death and economic harm.” “It’s also a moment where other disparities are in full view,” Martin said. “For example, recent protesters in Minnesota have been subjected to tear gas, and President Trump has spoken of using the military to restore order, while last month, heavily armed, mostly white protesters in Wisconsin and Michigan occupied state capitals to demand that businesses be allowed to reopen, at times openly confronting law enforcement.” “Few arrests took place,” Martin said, followed by a soundbite of one of those protesters from last month saying, ‘The guns are fine. We are allowed to bring guns. We are allowed to bring them here.” “President Trump called those protesters very good people and said this about them,” Martin said, followed by an edited soundbite from President Donald Trump. “They seem to be very responsible people to me, but it’s – you know, they’ve been treated a little bit rough,” Trump said in the selected soundbite. “Yesterday in a tweet, President Trump referred to the protesters in Minnesota as thugs, writing the word in all capital letters,” Martin said.

As far as Washington Nationals pitcher Max Scherzer is concerned, there is no reason to continue talks with the league about pay cuts during the negotiations for a revamped 2020 baseball season. Scherzer, who is one of the player reps in talks with Major League Baseball about the scheme to launch a truncated 2020 season, now seems very pessimistic about an agreement being reached. The Nats player issued a statement on Wednesday: After discussing the latest developments with the rest of the players, there’s no reason to engage with MLB in any further compensation reductions. We have previously negotiated a pay cut in the version of prorated salaries, and there’s no justification to accept a 2nd pay cut based upon the current information the union has received. I’m glad to hear other players voicing the same viewpoint and believe MLB’s economic strategy would completely change if all documentation were to become public information. pic.twitter.com/nWKtqGSQo4 — Max Scherzer (@Max_Scherzer) May 28, 2020  Scherzer is a member of the eight-player MLBPA executive subcommittee. The other members include Andrew Miller (Cardinals), Daniel Murphy (Nationals), Elvis Andrus (Rangers), Cory Gearrin (Twins), Chris Iannetta (Yankees), James Paxton (Yankees), and Collin McHugh (Red Sox). A major stumbling block for the negotiations is that the teams have closed their books, and the numbers are unavailable for the players to look at to double-check what the league is saying about the effects the COVID-19 pandemic is having on finances. The player’s union is reportedly preparing a counter-proposal to the league’s offer for a 2020 season featuring a more than 100-game schedule and guaranteed prorated salaries. However, if Scherzer’s sentiment is pervasive, then it looks like the two sides are still not in the same ballpark on negotiations.

Jim Bognet, a former Donald Trump administration official, told Breitbart News Saturday swing district Democrat Rep. Matt Cartwright (D-PA) is “out of touch” on the coronavirus pandemic as well as the George Floyd protests and riots. Bognet (pictured) hopes to unseat Cartwright in Pennsylvania’s eighth congressional district, a pivotal swing district that could help Republicans recapture the House in 2020. The eighth district Republican primary is on June 2. Bognet said his campaign has garnered significant momentum ahead of the congressional primary. Bognet told Breitbart News Saturday host Matthew Boyle, “We are in great shape, we’re gaining a lot of momentum, you can feel the energy and excitement. People are really enthusiastic about coming out and voting for President Trump to get him more votes than ever before in Pennsylvania. We know we are going ahead looking into the fall, that we are going to be ground zero. We need to win Pennsylvania; the campaign can feel the energy, reaching thousands of voters every day on the phones.”  Boyle noted Bognet had been ahead of the curve on many issues, such as calling for a travel ban from China in the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak. Bognet said Republicans need to take back seats such as Pennsylvania’s eighth district because a Republican-controlled House will protect President Donald Trump from future impeachment shams. “I ran for this office to protect President Trump,” Bognet said. “If we don’t get a Republican House, he will be impeached again in 2021.  We can never let that fiasco, sham, and tragedy happen again. So that is my mission.” Bognet said Trump has worked to improve the lives of the black community and the death of George Floyd was a tragedy; however, he cautioned rioting would not heal the nation’s wounds. He said, “It is a tragedy, national tragedy, George Floyd died. It made me sad; it was very disturbing. I was so glad that President Trump reached out to his family, to offer some solace. And Trump has done amazing things for the black community,” including criminal justice reform. Bognet continued: But there is no excuse for rioting. There is no excuse for burning down your own city. There is no excuse for Antifa agitators to come in, whip people up and try to have mayhem and destruction happen. It’s so sad because you know who it hurts, Matt? It hurts the people in that community. It hurts their brothers and sisters who poured their lives into building laundromats and small shops and businesses, and they burn, and then I saw a guy crying as his business was burning down last night. That was horrible. Bognet said this moment could serve as a catalyst for future criminal justice reform. He added that in a similar manner to the coronavirus response, Democrat Gov. Tom Wolf and Cartwright have not led on criminal justice. Bognet said, “This can be a moment where we get some really positive reforms done. You see police misbehavior? We have to go after it. Because it besmirches the name of the 99.99 percent of good cops. And what I saw the other day was disturbing to a large degree I’m very glad that they brought charges. We cannot allow our neighborhoods to be burned down and when these blue state governors and blue state mayors, instead of taking decisive action, like I think President Trump would have if he was a governor, you know Matt, we’ve seen it with Gov. Wolf, and we’ve seen with Matt Cartwright, they are so out of touch they don’t even know what’s going on in the ground. We’ve seen it with coronavirus, and now we’ve seen it with these riots, the people in these communities are going to feel the pain from this.” Breitbart News Saturday airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 10:00 A.M. to 1:00 P.M.

As the world grapples with the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, ongoing turmoil in the Middle East and Beijing’s brutal interventions in Hong Kong, the organization once charged with offering solutions to such problems is sidelined with nobody listening to its calls for “peace, harmony and global unity.” U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has bemoaned a “lack of leadership” during the world’s worst series of crises since 1945. “Where we see power, we sometimes do not see the necessary leadership,” he said recently. AFP reports even after more than two months of negotiations, the 15 Security Council members are still unable to reach agreement on a resolution supporting a call from Gutteres for a global cease-fire while the world battles the Chinese coronavirus. At the U.N., there is a sense the globalist body is drifting and dysfunctional, even as it continues to plead for more money to fund its operations: <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> “In the past, when you had disagreements among members of the Council, it was compartmentalized,” said a U.N. official, speaking on grounds of anonymity to AFP. “So your adversary one day on a particular issue was your best ally the next day on another issue. What we see now is everything spilling over. “So there are camps, or there are disagreements which just spill over from one issue to another,” the official said, clearly alluding to the situation in Hong Kong, where tough new Chinese security legislation has pitted the two leading permanent members of the U.N. against each other. “The tensions between the U.S. and China are really problematic” for the world body, meaning the Security Council is “not able to move forward on a range of things,” the official added. At a press conference Thursday, Guterres expressed his regret the coronavirus pandemic had not evoked a greater sense of unity from world powers. “If the present crisis shows something, it is our fragility. Collective fragility. When we are fragile, we should be humble. When we are humble, we should be united and in solidarity,” he said, in remarks directed to members of the Security Council. As Breitbart News reported, Guterres has been working for months to secure a global ceasefire to enable countries to stop the spread of the virus that first appeared in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year. Today I am calling for an immediate global ceasefire in all corners of the world. It is time to put armed conflict on lockdown and focus together on the true fight of our lives – the #COVID19 pandemic.https://t.co/F6JRA6ekvZ pic.twitter.com/7WgtFMk5GC — António Guterres (@antonioguterres) March 23, 2020  Oxfam International is just one global charity to register its frustration with the U.N.’s impotence, publishing a report saying the globalist cause has been totally ignored. The cease-fire remains unattained due to the Security Council’s “diplomatic failure” to collectively broker a resolution amid the deadlock, the Oxfam report observed, and its absence is expatriated by years of investment in peace-building and countries continuing to sell weapons for use in war-torn regions. “We expect leadership from the council as well as many of those countries who say they support a cease-fire, but who nevertheless remain active participants in conflicts around the world conducting military operations, selling arms and supporting third parties,” Oxfam Interim Executive Director Jose Maria Vera said in a statement. The U.N. recently called for $2 billion to be transferred from wealthy countries to the poor via the globalist body as an aid in tackling the global pandemic which fell short. The slim financial response prompted another call for funds last month, lifting the target to $6.7 billion to accommodate the U.N.’s all new, specially updated global plan to counter the viral epidemic. Trouble is, nobody is listening to a word the U.N. says, even as it burns through those member financial contributions and a yearly budget of $3,073,830,500 it approved for itself to cover the year 2020.

TEL AVIV – Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday offered Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro help and cooperation to combat the coronavirus in the South American country, which is not the epicenter of the pandemic. According to a statement from his office, Netanyahu expressed “solidarity of the Israeli people with the Brazilian people over the spread of the corona pandemic in Brazil.” The Israeli leader also “offered cooperation with Brazilian industries in manufacturing the medical equipment necessary to deal with the pandemic,” the statement said. Netanyahu also offered to organize discussions between the two countries’ teams of experts in order to pass along Israel’s accumulated experience in dealing with the virus. Bolsonaro, for his part, congratulated Netanyahu on forming his new government and said he expects to continue strengthening bilateral relations together. Brazil has confirmed about 375,000 coronavirus cases, second only to the U.S. Because of the lack of testing, the real number is also believed to be much higher. The countries share warm ties. In a visit to Jerusalem last year, Bolsonaro professed his love for Israel in Hebrew, telling Netanyahu, “Ani ohev et Israel,” or “I love Israel.”

SKOPJE, North Macedonia (AP) — North Macedonia has decided to extend a state of emergency for another two weeks because the coronavirus pandemic shows no sign of slowing down. President Stevo Pendarovski announced the extension of on Saturday following a meeting of the National Security Council. The country´s health authorities reported five new deaths and 35 infections in the previous 24 hours, days after the government allowed bars, cafes and restaurants to reopen. The government does not plan to make the establishments close again. North Macedonia had a total of 2,146 confirmed virus cases as of Saturday, including 131 deaths.    

IVANO-FRANKIVSK, Ukraine (AP) – Wearing a white biohazard suit, a face shield and a blue mask over his mouth and nose, the Rev. Yaroslav Rokhman is hard to recognize as a priest when he visits terminally ill patients at a Ukrainian care centre. But his words still bring comfort to the dying. Rokhman, a clergyman in the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, is pleased just to be performing one of a cleric’s most heartfelt duties again. As the coronavirus pandemic’s grip slowly recedes in Ukraine, priests received clearance on May 22nd to resume religious services and to visit the sick and bereaved. “Patients missed the support and spiritual care. They needed a priest. They needed to pray and talk,” he said while attending to patients at a palliative-care facility in Ivano-Frankivsk, a city 450 kilometres (270 miles) west of the capital of Kyiv. Galina Shamineva, a 34-year-old mother of two with cancer, was heartened to see Rokhman, his intimidating protective gear notwithstanding. “I feel good — all thanks to you,” she said from her bed. “I really needed to be able to confess and partake in the sacrament.” Rokhman spoke to Shamineva in a soothing way and made the sign of the cross with his gloved hands. “Sometimes I cry, but I never give up. I’m fighting ’til the last breath,” she told him. In Chernivtsi, one of the Ukrainian cities hit hardest by the virus, the Rev. Vasyl Gasynets has returned to conducting services at his Greek Catholic church, wearing vestments along with a mask while giving Holy Communion. Members of the congregation also were masked as they stood near each other, as did some choir members as they sang. “Our church was clean before the pandemic. And it’s clean during the pandemic. We respect our people. We want everyone to be healthy,” Gasynets said. “We want them to believe that in the house of God, Jesus Christ, Holy Church, everything is clean.” Regulations to prevent the spread of the virus widened a religious fault line in Ukraine. The Orthodox Church of Ukraine and the Greek Catholic Church complied with government restrictions on holding services. But the rival Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which is affiliated with the Russian Orthodox Church, resisted. After the Russia-linked church allowed people to attend Easter services, authorities filed criminal cases against five priests. If convicted, they face prison sentences of up to eight years. At the church’s world-renowned Pechersk Monastery in Kyiv, more than 100 clerics were infected with the virus, and at least three died. Ukrainian authorities reported 393 new confirmed cases on Saturday, down from some 500 new cases a day earlier in May. The country has recorded a total of more than 23,000 confirmed cases and 696 deaths.  

A United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) report has revealed that as many as 650,000 migrants are currently waiting in Libya, ready to cross the Mediterranean Sea to Europe. The report notes that the Chinese coronavirus pandemic could have a major impact on mass migration, but the outbreak has also made such movements increasingly difficult to predict. “The global crisis caused by the pandemic is unprecedented and it is difficult to predict its impact on human trafficking and migrant smuggling,” the report stated, adding that the severe economic consequences of prolonged lockdowns could fuel a surge of migration from various countries, Il Giornale reports. The UN report states: “This suggests that the travel and movement restrictions caused by Covid-19 are not stopping the movement of people fleeing conflict, violence and dangerous and inhuman conditions,” and added that Libyan migrants are forced to use the services of people smugglers. “Information from Libya, where around 650,000 migrants and refugees are currently registered, suggests that the Covid-19 public health crisis has not discouraged people from trying to reach Europe.” Cargo Vessel Unloads Migrants in Sicily As Migrant Route Numbers Rise https://t.co/HU6nenHUmJ — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 10, 2020  While the number of migrants entering the European Union has decreased overall during the coronavirus outbreak, Italy has seen a surge in new arrivals in recent weeks. On the long-term impact of the pandemic on mass migration, the UNODC report predicted that “Future economic downturns are likely to have an impact in terms of movements of people to the richer countries.” Migrants who have arrived in Italy during the coronavirus lockdown have been placed under quarantine aboard vessels off the coast. A report released earlier this month revealed that Italian taxpayers were paying as much as €4,000 per month per migrant in order to maintain the quarantine. Alessandro Pagano, a member of populist leader Matteo Salvini’s League (Lega), slammed the costs, saying: “We are not talking about a third-hand dinghy, but of a ship equipped with a self-service restaurant, pizzeria, ice cream parlour,  pub with special wine assortment, play area and video room, double or quadruple cabins with services and even luxury suites.” Farage: French Navy Coordinates with UK Authorities to Transfer Boat Migrants to England https://t.co/aVQwxcHAPn — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 21, 2020 

WASHINGTON (AP) – The European Union on Saturday urged President Donald Trump to rethink his decision to terminate the U.S. relationship with the World Health Organization as spiking infection rates in India and elsewhere reinforced that the pandemic is far from contained. Trump on Friday charged that the WHO didn’t respond adequately to the pandemic and accused the U.N. agency of being under China’s “total control.” The U.S. is the largest source of financial support for the WHO, and its exit is expected to significantly weaken the organization. Trump said the U.S. would be “redirecting” the money to “other worldwide and deserving urgent global public health needs,” without providing specifics. The head of the EU’s executive arm urged Trump to reconsider. “The WHO needs to continue being able to lead the international response to pandemics, current and future,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. “For this, the participation and support of all is required and very much needed.” The WHO wouldn’t comment on the announcement but South African Health Minister Zweli Mkhize called it an “unfortunate” turn of events. “Certainly, when faced with a serious pandemic, you want all nations in the world to be particularly focused … on one common enemy,” he told reporters.

A federal judge has allowed to stand Maine Gov. Janet Mills’ (D) order requiring tourists to self-quarantine for two weeks after entering the state, which is known as “Vacationland.” On Friday, U.S. Judge Lance Walker denied a motion for preliminary injunction while the lawsuit proceeds. A group of Maine campground and restaurant owners, who claim the governor’s executive order is discriminatory against visitors to the state and harmful to their businesses, is challenging the rule. The Portland Press Herald noted Mills’ reopening plan has extended the two-week self-quarantine regulation for visitors through at least July. The judge’s decision comes in the wake of a statement of interest filed by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) in support of the lawsuit by the campground and restaurant owners. According to a statement by Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband of the Civil Rights Division: The United States Constitution requires government to protect the privileges and immunities of all citizens in our nation. These privileges and immunities include the right of Americans to travel freely anywhere in our country, and state governments cannot limit the right of out-of-state Americans to travel to their state unless doing so is substantially related to protecting the public safety. The Department of Justice remains committed to defending the constitutional rights of all Americans no matter where they live. The department will continue to be especially vigilant of any infringement on the right to travel that unduly harms the ability of Americans to earn a living and support their families. In response to the DOJ’s statement of interest, Mills said, she was “deeply disappointed – and frankly disgusted – that the U.S Department of Justice is making a concerted effort to undermine the health of the people of Maine.” The governor added the DOJ did not raise similar objections “when the President and his own task force took steps to limit travel.” Mills said the required quarantine for visitors is “a proven tool to prevent the spread of this deadly disease.” “It seems to me that [the DOJ’s] only actual ‘interest’ here is, at best, political or, at worst, to harm Mainers, not defend them,” she stated. A group of Maine legislators sent a letter nearly two weeks ago to U.S. Attorney General William Barr, requesting an investigation into Mills’ numerous executive orders during the coronavirus crisis, and claiming she has “exceeded her executive authority.” Among the specific concerns the lawmakers cited are Mills’ “arbitrary distinction between ‘essential’ and ‘non-essential’ businesses; denial of Maine citizens’ “right to assemble” in churches with gatherings of more than ten people; and her executive order “establishing quarantine restrictions on travelers arriving in Maine.” “She ordered churches, restaurants, motels, state parks, and campgrounds to close their doors as ‘non-essential’ enterprises, while allowing abortion clinics and ice cream parlors to carry on business as usual,” Maine Rep. Larry Lockman (R) said in a statement to Breitbart News. “Mom-and-pop retailers have been shut down, but the big box stores never missed a beat.” “Before it’s over, the lockdown will kill more Mainers than the virus, in addition to killing tens of thousands of jobs and small businesses,” Lockman said. “And for what?” he asked. “On a typical day, no more than three dozen COVID-19 patients are hospitalized statewide, in a state of 1.3 million people.”

Howard County, Maryland, has reversed course on a ban on receiving the Eucharist during Masses this weekend as church services resume in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. Calvin Ball, the county executive, said Thursday in an update to his executive orders: Since Governor Hogan announced a modified reopening of restaurants yesterday, Howard County revisited all food consumption restrictions. As Howard County moves closer to a full Phase 1 Reopening, also as of 5:00 p.m. Friday, May 29th, food consumption restrictions will be lifted for faith institutions. Ball issued an order on Tuesday that stated, “There shall be no consumption of food or beverage of any kind before, during, or after religious services, including food or beverage that would typically be consumed as part of a religious service.” However, as Catholic News Agency reported, the Archdiocese of Baltimore said it had “serious concerns” about the public health guidance placing a ban on the Eucharist as a condition for churches to hold Masses. “Such restriction would restrict the distribution of holy Communion, an integral part of a Catholic Mass,” the archdiocese said in a statement. “In fact, if the priest could not consume the Body and Blood of Christ after consecration, it would not be a valid Mass”:  Archbishop William Lori said in a tweeted video message to Catholics of his archdiocese, “Without question, we’ve been apart for way too long, and we are hungry for the nourishment that the Eucharist provides”: "We have been apart for far too long and we are hungry for nourishment that the Eucharist provides," Archbishop William Lori says in special message to parishioners about the gradual reopening of churches. https://t.co/x9NmNT8sjl — ArchdioceseBaltimore (@archbalt) May 26, 2020  The archbishop said parishes in some jurisdictions are open this weekend “with limited attendance” for the feast of Pentecost. Lori cautioned that a “one size fits all” approach to reopening parishes “isn’t possible,” and she referred Catholics to their individual pastors for further guidance. Mary Ellen Russell, a spokeswoman for the archdiocese, said, “We are very pleased to hear that Howard County will be lifting their restrictions on faith institutions regarding food consumption.”

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) shared an infographic on Saturday via Instagram with guidance for protesters, which she entitled “PROTESTING SAFELY,” including a warning of “white supremacists” who “may be infiltrating these protests.” Her recommendation came during ongoing demonstrations, protests, and riots in several cities following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Despite encouraging and supporting unrest, Ocasio-Cortez simultaneously advises her Twitter followers to avoid “public places” due to the coronavirus outbreak: To everyone in NYC but ESPECIALLY healthy people & people under 40 (bc from what I’m observing that’s who needs to hear this again): PLEASE stop crowding bars, restaurants, and public spaces right now.

4. STAY SAFE and take care of each other. Further centralization of political power and enforced material equality should be the response to current unrest, determined Ocasio-Cortez. She said: If you are calling for an end to this unrest, and if you are calling for an end to all of this, but you are not calling for the end of the conditions that created the unrest, you are a hypocrite.  If you’re trying to call for the end of unrest, but you don’t believe health care is a human right, if you’re afraid to say, ‘black lives matter,’ if you’re too scared to call out police brutality, then you aren’t asking for an end of unrest. You are asking for injustice to continue, and for your people to continue to endure the violence of poverty, the violence of lack of housing access, the violence of police brutality, and not say a damn thing. That’s what you’re asking.  So if you’re out here calling for the end of unrest, then you better be calling for health care as a human right. You better be calling for accountability in our policing. You better be supporting community review boards. You better be supporting the end of housing discrimination. You better be standing up to for-profit real estate developers that are intimidating people and trying to evict them from their homes. That’s what you better be calling for, because if you don’t call for those things and you’re asking for the end of unrest, all you’re asking for is the continuation of quiet oppression. So if you want the end of unrest, then you should be asking for measures that actually liberate people in their lives from the oppression of economic and social inequity. Ocasio-Cortez regularly qualifies justice as “economic,” “social,” and “racial.” Follow Robert Kraychik on Twitter.

The protests across the nation over the death of George Floyd are fueling fears in U.S. cities that the demonstrations could exacerbate the spread of the novel coronavirus outbreak, which has disproportionally ravaged minority populations. At the very least, thousands of people, many of them from minority communities, have taken to the streets to express outrage over Floyd’s death while disregarding mitigation policies like social distancing meant to stem the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Minority communities have “been most traumatized by the dual crisis of a COVID-19 pandemic and an economic crisis that we’re facing right now,” St. Paul, MN Mayor Melvin Carter (D) pointed out during a press conference Saturday. “Those same communities are being re-traumatized right now as our black-owned barbershops, as our immigrant-owned restaurants as local generational family-owned businesses are damaged and destroyed night after night,” he added. “This must stop.” Some protesters are wearing masks, but Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) told reporters on Saturday they are doing so for the wrong reasons — to wreak havoc without being recognized and “take advantage of this situation.” “I will continue to stress because it seems like a lifetime ago: We are still in the middle of a pandemic and passed 1,000 deaths yesterday. We still have hospitals on the verge of being overrun with COVID-19,” Gov. Walz declared. “We are in the middle of a pandemic right now,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey (D) added, echoing Walz. “We have two crises that are sandwiched on top of one another.” On Thursday, health officials in Minnesota also warned that the mass protests were almost sure to fuel new COVID-19 cases. The Star Tribune quoted State Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm as saying: People are moved to want to speak and to want to gather in solidarity and in protest, and we certainly honor and respect that right. As we know, large gatherings do pose a risk in any epidemic, but certainly where we stand today with the state of COVID-19 spread in our community. Knowing that we have community spread, we just want to again encourage folks who gather to be mindful of the risk. Violent rioting and looting have been raging in Minnesota’s Twin Cities, particularly in Minneapolis, where Floyd died after Derek Chauvin, a now-fired white police officer, kneeled on his neck for several minutes in an incident caught on camera. Floyd was unarmed. The havoc that began in Minnesota has spread to urban centers across America, including New York City. “You have a right to demonstrate. You have the right to protest. God bless America,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) declared during his coronavirus briefing Saturday. “You don’t have a right to infect other people. You don’t have a right to act in a way that’s going to jeopardize public health.” “Even if you think you’re a superhero because you’re young and you’re strong, you can get it and then infect someone else,” he added. “So it’s just wholly irresponsible… You can have an opinion, but there are also facts, and you’re wrong not to wear a mask.” Protests, including peaceful demonstrations, have been sweeping the nation since Floyd’s death on Monday as many cities began a phased reopening. “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” Minnesota Gov. Walz said. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear, and disrupting our great cities.” At least initially, some Democrats, including Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, endorsed the protests that have spiraled out of control. On Friday, Authorities have charged fired police officer Chauvin with third-degree murder and manslaughter.

During Friday’s Democratic Weekly Address, Rep. Frank Pallone (D-NJ) stated that the HEROES Act “lays the foundation we will need to ease social distancing and safely reopen the economy.” Transcript as Follows: “Hello, I’m Congressman Frank Pallone from New Jersey. This week, our nation mourns the loss of 100,000 Americans to the coronavirus. It’s a staggering number and grim milestone. Families all around our nation continue to grieve lost ones, oftentimes from a distance. While it’s difficult to even comprehend this loss, it reminds us that we must come together to combat this terrible virus so that we can save lives and protect communities in the weeks and months ahead. This national emergency requires every aspect of government to work together. We must reduce the spread of the virus so we can confidently begin to reopen our economy and get more than 40 million Americans, who’ve lost their jobs as a result of this pandemic, back to work. And the only way we can do that is through a coordinated national strategy: a strategy that significantly boosts testing and invests resources into contact tracing, surveillance and containment. We simply cannot fight this pandemic if we don’t know who has it and where it is being spread. And that requires a national strategy and response. Unfortunately, President Trump and his Administration have failed to provide the consistent and stable leadership that is necessary to guard our nation through this public health and economic crisis. Instead of showing leadership, competence and vision, the Trump Administration is shirking all responsibility and is instead forcing states to find their own way out of this pandemic. For months, the President has refused to develop and implement a national testing program. For months, we’ve been promised millions of tests were right around the corner and that everyone that wanted a test could get one. These promises have been hollow. Testing is getting better, but public health experts continue to warn that our country is far short of the testing we need. And the failure of national leadership has forced states to compete against each other to procure tests and the vital supplies needed to administer tests from the private market. We simply cannot allow the Trump Administration’s failures to persist, and that’s why House Democrats took bold action and passed The Heroes Act earlier this month. This legislation continues our ongoing commitment to providing the health care resources and support needed to combat the coronavirus crisis. The Heroes Act will strengthen testing by finally requiring the Trump Administration to develop comprehensive, coordinated strategies for testing, contact tracing and surveillance. The Administration will be required to include clear benchmarks and timelines. It will also be forced to publicly report key metrics. These requirements are critical to bringing much needed transparency to our nation’s response efforts. It will allow us to see if the Trump Administration is fulfilling their promises and hold them accountable when they are not. The Heroes Act also provides up to $75 billion in grants to support robust testing, contact tracing, surveillance and containment activities. It also provides additional funding to communities that have a high number of COVID-19 cases or are experiencing a surge, as well as for areas with populations experiencing disparities. This includes low-income and the uninsured, communities of color, people with disabilities and other underserved communities. We simply cannot beat this virus without these efforts in place. The Heroes Act builds on the progress we have made and lays the foundation we will need to ease social distancing and safely reopen the economy. Now, it’s time for the Senate to act. Unfortunately, to date, Senate Majority Leader McConnell continues to delay and obstruct. This cannot continue. With more than 100,000 Americans dead, we must collectively find solutions, like The Heroes Act, that will help us finally stop the spread of this virus. It is the only way we will be able to protect the American people, and safely and confidently reopen our communities. I thank you for listening, and please, stay safe.” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett

MANCHESTER, England (AP) – Sports events will be allowed to resume in England from Monday without any spectators, providing they comply with the government’s coronavirus protocols. The guidance for elite sports bodies was published by the government on Saturday as COVID-19 lockdown restrictions that were imposed in March are eased further. “The wait is over,” Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said. “Live British sport will shortly be back on in safe and carefully controlled environments.” It paves the way for the planned June 17 return of the Premier League, the world’s richest soccer competition. “There is still much work to be done to ensure the safety of everyone involved,” Premier League chief executive Richard Masters said. The government announcement allows English cricket authorities to plan for international series against West Indies and Pakistan. Formula One is also exploring two races at Silverstone from July, with the season yet to start. The first competitions to return on Monday are set to be horse racing, snooker and greyhound racing which lined up events in anticipation of the end of an 11-week shutdown of sports. British horse racing employs tens of thousands of people and the absence of meets since March 17 has left many facing “considerable hardship,” according to the Jockey Club. “The lockdown has been an incredibly hard period for our industry and it will be a long road back to recovery,” Jockey Club chief executive Delia Bushell said. “While we are not a human-contact sport, extensive plans are nevertheless in place to create the safest possible environment for participants.” Athletes and other staff will be required to travel to venues individually and by private transport where possible. Screening for coronavirus symptoms is required before entering. Where social distancing cannot be maintained – staying 2 meters (6 feet) apart – activities need to be risk assessed and mitigated. Media have been told to “minimize crossover” with others at the venue, including players. There is also a request that “during any disputes between players and referees, or scoring celebrations” they must stay apart. “This guidance provides the safe framework for sports to resume competitions behind closed doors,” Dowden said. “It is now up to individual sports to confirm they can meet these protocols and decide when it´s right for them to restart. “This is a significant moment for British sport. By working with clinicians every step of the way, we are creating the safest possible environments for everyone involved.” The first major event after the resumption of sports is set to be the 2,000 Guineas horse race next Saturday at Newmarket, with jockeys wearing face masks. But the government is not yet prepared to allow non-elite sports to resume, denying regular citizens the chance to play cricket and football in a park. “We are working hard to get grassroots sport back up and running safely too, so that people can reunite with their own football, rugby or cricket teammates and get back on their pitches, fields or athletic tracks,” Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston said. “But we will only do this when it is safe and appropriate to do so, based upon scientific advice.” The government, however, will from Monday allow groups of six people from different households to exercise outside as long as they remain 2 meters apart. Currently only two people from different households can meet up. Though the Covid-19 deaths per day have fallen in Britain since the peak in April, another 215 were still reported on Saturday by the government, bringing the known death toll in all settings including hospitals and care homes to 38,376. Deputy chief medical officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam said it was still a “very dangerous moment” but added the return of sports events without spectators “is not going to have any meaningful impact” on the infection rate.

BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Romania’s prime minister has paid fines totalling about $600 for smoking indoors and holding a meeting in a government building where several Cabinet ministers and other participants did not follow social distancing rules. In a photograph published in Romanian media, Prime Minister Ludovic Orban and others can be seen smoking with food and bottles of alcohol on a table. No one in the photo wore a mask or maintained the required spacing. Orban told the Mediafax news agency that the picture was taken on May 25th, his birthday. The foreign minister and economy minister of Romania were among those attending. Romania has registered 19,133 confirmed coronavirus cases and 1,259 deaths.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has cashed in the first portion of an incentive-based stock options payout for keeping the company’s market capitalization at $100 billion along with hitting revenue milestones. The award is valued at about $775 million. CNBC reports that Tesla CEO Elon Musk has earned the first part of a huge incentive payout according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday. The payouts are linked to 1.7 million shares of Tesla which are valued at around $775 million based on Thursday’s closing market value. Tesla shares closed at $805.81 on Thursday and options have a strike price of $350.02. Thursday’s filing also set a day of July 7 for the company’s annual shareholders meeting, stating: “As of the date of this proxy statement, one of the 12 tranches under this award has vested and become exercisable, subject to Mr. Musk’s payment of the exercise price of $350.02 per share and the minimum five-year holding period generally applicable to any shares he acquires upon exercise.” Musk has earned the first portion of stock options for keeping Tesla’s market capitalization at $100 billion on a 30-day six-month trailing average. A 2018 regulatory filing outlined the conditions for the payout which included Tesla hitting trailing-fourth-quarter revenue of $20 billion or EBITDA (minus stock-based compensation) of $1.5 billion for Musk to get the stock award. Musk owned approximately 18.5 percent of Tesla as of May 1 according to FactSet, an ownership stake worth around $24 billion. Thursday’s proxy filing revealed that Musk’s stake in the company had risen to 20.8 percent, a total of 38.7 million shares, including 18.5 million used as collateral for the CEO’s personal debt. Musk’s full award is set to vest over 12 tranches with different milestone requirements reaching up to $650 billion in market capitalization for Tesla. Since the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic began, Tesla has focused heavily on reopening its manufacturing facilities. Breitbart News recently reported that Tesla plans to open its plant in Fremont, California, and has told workers their options are to violate the state’s stay-at-home orders and come to work, or stay home and forgo payment and benefits. In an email obtained by the Guardian from Tesla’s management to its workers, the firm stated: “Choosing not to report to work may eliminate or reduce your eligibility for unemployment depending on your state’s unemployment agency.” Tesla workers told the Guardian that they feel that Tesla’s management is using intimidation tactics in order to force them to return to the job by threatening to cut their pay and unemployment benefits. Breitbart News recently reported that Tesla has sued local authorities for attempting to enforce shutdown orders. In a post to the company blog on Saturday, Tesla stated that the county’s position had left it no choice but to take legal action to ensure that Tesla and its employees could return to work.

Rapper Lil Wayne interviewed doctor Anthony Fauci — the director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases — on his new radio show, Young Money Radio. “I want to say thank you for even considering being on this show, Dr. Fauci, I really do want to say thank you,” said Lil Wayne as he introduced Dr. Fauci to his show, which is hosted via Apple Music’s Beats 1 radio. “You made a prediction that the U.S. could experience 100,000 to 200,000 deaths,” the Grammy-winner added. “I saw a week later, you were forced to revise that estimate. What number do you think we’re at now?” Fauci estimated that the United States will likely see between 120,000 to 140,000 coronavirus deaths this year. “Well, as you mentioned correctly, Lil Wayne, we’re over 100,000,” said Fauci. “And we still have a number of states, cities, regions, that have active transmission of infection. So although we don’t want to predict an exact number, I think it’s probably going to be at least another 20 or more thousand, maybe 120,000, 140,000.”     We have two doctors on the show today — Dr. Dre, and the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases DR. FAUCI!  We’re facing the worst pandemic of our lifetime and he’ll be on to have a REAL discussion about its affect on our community. Watch LIVE on  #YoungMoneyRadio at 4pm PT/7pm ET on @applemusic. 🏾 A post shared by  Lil Wayne (@liltunechi) on May 29, 2020 at 1:39pm PDT “You gotta be careful, because you know, all of these predictions that we’ve made over these months have turned out to not be completely accurate,” added Fauci. “If we don’t make sure — as we’re trying to ‘open up America again’ — to get things back to normal, there’s gonna be people who are going to get infected, and we may get rebounds.” “So we need to be able to prepare ourselves to respond to those rebounds,” affirmed Fauci. The rapper then asked whether Fauci thinks that returning to normalcy will increase the risk of infection. “I see a lot of cities opening back up and people partying in large numbers,” noted Lil Wayne. “Do you think this will affect the numbers of deaths?” “I think it will,” said Fauci. “I think that if you look at the dynamics of an outbreak in any given state, city, or county, or region, if the infection level is really low, they can afford to be a little more brisk in how they open up and get back to some form of normality.” But if you have a state our a county or a city in which there’s still a lot of active infection, and you jump out there and prematurely do the kind of mingling and get rid of the distancing — you know, you saw those pictures on TV of people crowding at bars and at beaches — you gotta be careful of that because you might be tempting to fate to allow there be a rebound infection, so you gotta do this with care with prudence. To date, the 21 states that have eased lockdown restrictions since May 4 haven’t experienced significant increases in Chinese coronavirus hospitalizations and fatalities, according to an ABC News investigation. The report also said there wasn’t a spike in the rate of people testing positive for the disease. “I hope we’ll get a vaccine,” added Fauci at one point during the interview. “By December?” asked Lil Wayne. “We’ve already started the early phases of the vaccine trial in a number of different candidates,” said Fauci. “And we hope that if we get lucky — and I’m cautiously optimistic that we will — that by the end of this calendar year, the beginning of 2021, that we would have a vaccine that we could deploy to people throughout the country, and then other vaccines maybe throughout the world,” he added.

ROME — The Vatican has decried the rise in anti-Christian hate crimes throughout Europe as well as the discriminatory treatment suffered by Christians during the coronavirus lockdowns. Speaking on behalf of the Holy See, Monsignor Janusz Urbańczyk stressed the gravity of anti-Christian violence in an address at a conference of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) on intolerance and discrimination, Vatican News reported Thursday. The Holy See’s Permanent Representative to OSCE noted the disturbing increase in explicitly anti-Christian acts in Europe, including “threats, violent attacks, murders and profanation of churches and places of worship, cemeteries and other religious properties.” In 2019, Christian sites in Europe suffered a record number of attacks, with some 3,000 Christian churches, schools, cemeteries, and monuments vandalized, looted, or defaced. Reports chronicling the anti-Christian acts describe a broad spectrum of profanation including arson, defecation, desecration, looting, mockery, Satanism, theft, urination, and vandalism. The greatest number of acts of violence against Christian sites have occurred in France, where churches, schools, cemeteries, and monuments “are being vandalized, desecrated, and burned at an average rate of three per day,” the reports state. In his address this week, Msgr. Urbańczyk said he was concerned over the growth of the false idea “that religions could have a negative impact or represent a threat to the well-being of our societies” as well as the push to make prayer and religious practice a private matter with no place in the public square. Vandals Profane 100 Christian Tombs in French Cemetery https://t.co/1lsSKX2Z5v — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 1, 2019  The Vatican representative also took issue with government overreach during the coronavirus lockdowns resulting in “de facto discriminatory treatment” against Christian churches. “Rights and fundamental freedoms have been limited or derogated throughout the whole OSCE area,” he said, including the forced closure of churches and restrictions on religious services. Even in the midst of times of crisis, fundamental freedoms such as religious liberty must be respected, the monsignor declared. “Tolerance cannot be an alibi for denying or guaranteeing fundamental human rights,” he said.

China’s state-run Xinhua news service on Friday took great interest in an American researcher’s call for more aggressive censorship by Big Tech companies to reduce “misinformation.”  China’s censorship regime was originally justified as just such a crusade against false information and the regime’s apologists claim that is the primary goal of their million-censor army to this day. The article that caught Xinhua’s interest referred primarily to incorrect information about the Chinese coronavirus, which adds an extra layer of bitter irony since the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is the world’s undisputed heavyweight champion at spreading false coronavirus information: “The pandemic lays bare how tech companies’ reluctance to act recursively worsens our world. In times of uncertainty, the vicious cycle is more potent than ever,” said Joan Donovan, research director of the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School in Cambridge, Massachusetts. […] The senior researcher demanded that “tech companies become more transparent, accountable and socially beneficial,” while urging holding them to this commitment long after the pandemic. “Social media companies must flatten the curve of misinformation,” she added. The Chinese government would never leave it to any private companies to bulldoze that “curve of misinformation” according to their own notions of accuracy or fairness. In China, all of the misinformation bulldozers are driven by Communist Party officials, and a private company CEO who decided to “fact check” a statement by dictator Xi Jinping would never be seen or heard from again.  Dissident Xu Zhiyong, for example, who attempted to do just that in a scathing letter demanding Xi resign, is facing 15 years in prison for his “fact check.” Donovan’s article, which probably caught the eye of the Chinese Communist Party because she railed at length against President Donald Trump and “right-wingers” (and special guest star Elon Musk) for being too enthusiastic about using hydroxychloroquine to combat the effects of the coronavirus, perhaps inadvertently made the case that only a massive government censorship apparatus on the scale of the one constructed by Beijing could provide the level of inoculation against “misinformation” that she advocates: After blanket coverage of the distortion of the 2016 US election, the role of algorithms in fanning the rise of the far right in the United States and United Kingdom, and of the antivax movement, tech companies have announced policies against misinformation. But they have slacked off on building the infrastructure to do commercial-content moderation and, despite the hype, artificial intelligence is not sophisticated enough to moderate social-media posts without human supervision. Tech companies acknowledge that groups, such as The Internet Research Agency and Cambridge Analytica, used their platforms for large-scale operations to influence elections within and across borders. At the same time, these companies have balked at removing misinformation, which they say is too difficult to identify reliably. Moderating content after something goes wrong is too late. Preventing misinformation requires curating knowledge and prioritizing science, especially during a public crisis. In my experience, tech companies prefer to downplay the influence of their platforms, rather than to make sure that influence is understood. Proper curation requires these corporations to engage independent researchers, both to identify potential manipulation and to provide context for ‘authoritative content’. U.S. tech companies are not shy about admitting they cannot police everyone for misinformation, hate speech, and so forth. An ostensibly fair system can be made grossly unfair by applying it unevenly, which is the heart of the criticism from those who noticed that Twitter will contentiously label a post from President Trump for “glorifying violence” but seems untroubled by the Supreme Leader of Iran’s enthusiasm for genocide. The Chinese Communist Party does use “sophisticated artificial intelligence” as part of its massive censorship apparatus, but also has a huge number of human operators working to suppress speech the government dislikes. China imposes its censorship mandates on foreign speech as much as possible and blocks foreign sources of information it cannot control. The cost of such an operation is far beyond anything a profit-seeking company could pay and, as the current debate about Twitter censorship demonstrates, it is exceedingly difficult to find a standard of absolute truth or perfect fairness that would insulate private censors from complaints, retaliatory loss of business, and possibly legal action.  Hydroxychloroquine is, like everything else related to the coronavirus, a matter of much debate among the medical community. That community is still torn by vigorous arguments over whether surgical masks provide any protection from the pandemic. The World Health Organization, of which Donovan wrote approvingly in her article, continues to insist they do not, but masks have become tremendously important to the American Left and the Democrat Party, and its members regard challenges to the effectiveness of masks as “misinformation.” This, again, is not a problem for China. A high-ranking member of the ruling party in good standing would never be accused of spreading misinformation because the truth is whatever the Party says it is. If the truth changes tomorrow, the old truth becomes misinformation. If a high official falls from Party grace, he suddenly becomes a source of misinformation.  The CCP believes its approach is the only way to police the turbulent Internet for “truth,” so it is quite happy to hear people who haven’t thought all the way to the end of the censorship game take a few fumbling steps in its direction.

In Mudanjiang, a city in China’s northeastern Heilongjiang province, a recent spike in coronavirus cases has caused the government to reimpose a partial lockdown, the Epoch Times reported on Friday, with local reports indicating that authorities are sealing residents in their homes. Over the past three days, Mudanjiang health authorities announced that they had identified eleven asymptomatic carriers of coronavirus in the city. The news followed a period of several weeks in which authorities reported no confirmed or asymptomatic cases of the virus. According to the report, Chinese officials record asymptomatic cases separately from symptomatic, or confirmed, cases. Flights into and out of the city have been halted, along with train and bus services, according to the report. Students who had returned to school in recent days were ordered to return home. This is the third time Mudanjiang has faced lockdown restrictions. It was first locked down in January, along with most of China, after the initial Wuhan coronavirus outbreak late last year in the eponymous central Chinese city, then again last month following another outbreak. Students had just been allowed to return to school on May 25 when the third lockdown was announced, according to the report. On May 28, a local taxi driver surnamed Huang told the Chinese-language Epoch Times that residential compounds in Mudanjiang where asymptomatic carriers live have been fully “locked down” from the outside. “Shuguang Xincheng has 107 residential buildings and is one of the largest residential compounds in Heilongjiang Province,” Huang said. “The whole compound was locked down on the evening of May 25.” She added that the Lishui Lantian residential compound, where a colleague of hers resides, was also locked down. A video uploaded to social media by a Mudanjiang local on May 25 and shared by the Epoch Times supports Huang’s account of residences being fully “locked down.” It shows government workers at the Shuguang Xincheng residential compound installing a metal bar on the gate of a residential building, sealing it off from the outside. A similar lockdown was documented last month in Harbin, the capital of Heilongjiang province, located about 200 miles northwest of Mudanjiang. There, one local filmed a residential unit that had been locked from the outside by authorities, who placed an official notice on the gate stating that people suspected of having coronavirus lived inside the sealed compound. At the time, Harbin had officially admitted to just 58 cases of coronavirus, despite enforcing the extreme lockdown measures.

Some Wuhan residents admitted to state hospitals for coronavirus treatment have said they were left in prolonged isolation during their stay under torturous conditions, with at least one person allegedly committing suicide due to maltreatment, Bitter Winter, a human rights magazine, reported on Thursday. According to the report, one Wuhan resident wrote an open letter criticizing the Chinese government after his coronavirus patient mother was left in agony from poor treatment at state hospitals and subsequently took her own life. The man says that his 75-year-old mother was assigned to an isolation unit at a Wuhan hospital after being diagnosed with coronavirus on February 9. “I feel blindsided and cheated by the government,” the man wrote in his letter, blasting the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) “propaganda machine” that “promote[s] … news about its solid attempts to fight the epidemic, how the epidemic was put under control, and how many patients were treated, fully recovered, and were released from the hospital.” He said his mother’s death proves the CCP coronavirus propaganda is a lie. “During her isolation, no doctor treated her at all, and no one gave her injections, medicine, or other most basic care to prevent the deterioration of her condition,” the man wrote. The man’s mother told him that she was not the only coronavirus patient left unattended in the isolation ward. According to her account, two older women assigned to her wing were “barely breathing” and “constantly soiled their beds,” but no one came to clean or check on them. Left along in such desperate conditions, the woman told her son that she “had no choice but to wait for her death.” After a week in the isolation ward, the woman was transferred to Wuhan’s No. 3 Hospital, where doctors again failed to administer her any treatment. The man wrote that doctors did nothing more than take his mother’s temperature each day. “On February 26, the hospital declared my mother cured of coronavirus, and she was transferred to a medical observation facility for 14 days,” the Wuhan resident says. According to the man’s account, his mother was discharged from the observation facility on March 11 despite a persistent fever that had not yet abated. The woman had also been suffering from an “unbearable” stomach pain that her son says was still present when she was discharged. The woman’s family then took her to another local general hospital in the hopes of finding treatment elsewhere. However, doctors there refused to admit the woman, claiming her condition “did not meet hospitalization standards.” The man says the family tried other hospitals but were unsuccessful. Without further recourse, the family took the woman home, despite her fever and “severe [stomach] pain.” At home without treatment, the woman grew desperate from her condition in the subsequent weeks. “My mother gave up all hope,” the man wrote in his letter. “On April 15, she ingested pesticide and killed herself.” Several accounts of coronavirus patients facing “isolation without treatment” have been documented on Chinese social media in recent weeks and months, with some describing the isolation wards as “death camps.” “The hospital repeatedly said they gave me the best treatment design, but in reality, they did nothing for me,” a 23-year-old university student from Wuhan wrote on her Weibo account (China’s version of Twitter) in March while in an isolation ward for coronavirus patients in Wuhan. The account was reportedly part of a suicide note, as the woman threatened to take her own life. “I’ll die in discontent!” she said. In April, another Wuhan resident whose parent died after contracting coronavirus in a Wuhan hospital on February 1 blamed the local government for the death. The Wuhan coronavirus was first documented in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Before authorities had publicly admitted there was an epidemic in Wuhan, Zhang Lifa took his father to a Wuhan hospital in January for medical treatment unrelated to the virus. While admitted, the man contracted the virus and later died. Zhang says the authorities’ “lies and cover-ups” during Wuhan’s initial coronavirus outbreak late last year were directly responsible for his father’s death.

A Cuban poet and political activist claimed this week that Cuban dissidents confined to their home during the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic are essentially under house arrest, with the Communist regime taking advantage of the conditions to further silence anti-government voices. Amaury Pacheco lives in Alamar – less than ten miles east of Cuba’s capital, Havana – with his large family. They have been confined to their home under strict coronavirus lockdown measures for several weeks, which should apply to most Cubans on the island, but police, dissidents say, have been more intensely enforcing the measures against them. A poet and vocal critic of Cuba’s Communist regime, Pacheco told the Spanish newspaper Diario de Cuba that he has come to understand firsthand how the government has taken advantage of mandatory restrictions on people’s movement during the pandemic to further repress political dissent. Forced home confinement during the pandemic has significantly hindered traditional methods of protest, according to Pacheco. Before, activists would stand up to repressive regimes in person, he said, using their bodies to occupy public space in a physical demonstration that spoke volumes. Historically, Pacheco says, “[w]e take to the street. We break the mantra that the street belongs to the revolutionaries. We give it another meaning. We set aside those old tropes and present our physical bodies in their place.” “[The new conditions] have created some anxiety for me because there are arrests [of dissidents],” he said. Pacheco continued: The government has taken advantage of Covid-19 [Chinese coronavirus] to convert our houses into prisons. I understand that there are many measures that are important, but a government that takes advantage of and treats all citizens as criminals … It detains activists, people who are against obscure decrees that go against freedom of expression. During and after Covid-19 [the Chinese coronavirus pandemic] what will we do? … Will our activism collapse because the government has gained ground and has detained us in our very homes? The artist said that during the pandemic, almost all political activism in Cuba has been pushed online. “[All the activism] has spilled over onto the internet. There is more communication now because people are there, Cubans in Cuba, and those in other parts of the world,” he said. Pacheco said that political writing and poetry that the Communist regime might not allow people to share publicly remains free to be published in online forums. “Now we present poetry online as perhaps we could not have presented it in public spaces. In that sense, it [the transition to online activism] has been a benefit,” the poet said. Pacheco says he and his wife, also an artist, are homeschooling their four children – ages 8, 9, 11, and 12 – during the pandemic, adding that they had already been supplementing their children’s state-mandated education prior to the lockdown. “The education they give at school is very bad. We have noticed in recent years that there were elements missing in [the state-mandated curriculum that] we have had to supply as parents,” the writer said. Homeschooling prior to the pandemic was illegal in Cuba. Schools serve as pivotal indoctrination centers, teaching allegiance and zeal for the Communist Party. Cuban officials have famously imprisoned parents for homeschooling. Last year, Pastor Ramón Rigal and wife Ayda Expósito, were sentenced to two years and a year and a half in prison for insisting on homeschooling their children to avoid their indoctrination with communist values. Expósito recently concluded her sentence. In his interview with Diario de Cuba, Pacheco also mentioned that he had witnessed the infamous bread lines that many Cubans are forced to stand in for state food rations. Pacheco said he and his family had stocked up on basic supplies prior to the pandemic and were fortunate enough not to have to wait in these lines yet. He said many people wait in long lines only to receive nothing as the food supplies run out before they reach the end of the line.

Authorities in Blackburn said they will “take action” over a gathering of Muslim men praying in the streets which constituted a “serious breach” of coronavirus lockdown measures. Police in Lancashire had granted “special permission … to perform the [Muslim] call to prayer” in Blackburn to mark Eid, according to a letter signed by Assistant Chief Constable Peter Lawson and local government leader Mohammed Khan. But the document, which was seen by BBC Asian Network, reportedly emphasised that individuals must “pray privately in their home” as “restrictions on congregational prayers had not been lifted”. “Not on the street, not in congregation with an Imam leading the prayer, not with amplified microphones and not with road closures,” the authorities specified. Eid prayers on the streets of Blackburn…forwarded as received. pic.twitter.com/aiP4e1gwa5 — Rahila Bano (@rahilabano) May 25, 2020  Blackburn with Darwen Council said they would “take action” against organisers of the gathering, which saw Muslim men praying in the street to celebrate the end of Ramadan with no regard to social distancing or other coronavirus regulations, after footage of the event was uploaded to social media. Sayyed Osman, the council’s director of adult services, suggested that “the whole community feels let down” by the event, which appeared to breach Wuhan virus guidelines on social distancing and public meetings. “No permission was given for any such gathering and we see this as a serious breach of the national lockdown,” he said, claiming that it was “only a very small minority” who had prayed on the street. “We are working with the police to take action against the individual who organised the gatherings.” Multicultural Blackburn is said to be one of Britain’s least socially cohesive places, with the “Muslim Asian and white communities were living worlds apart” in a kind of informal segregation, according to a BBC investigation in 2007. A follow-up investigation by the BBC in 2018 found that the situation had, if anything, significantly worsened, with the broadcaster — not normally keen to highlight the downside impact of diversity on the country — quoting one South Asian heritage migrant saying: “There were probably about half a dozen Asian families here [when I arrived], nowadays there’s probably half a dozen white families left” — with “very little prospect for integration”. In 2007 @BBCPanorama made a programme in Blackburn, which was becoming segregated along ethnic and religious lines. Now Panorama has returned and found a town that is even more divided. https://t.co/9mdybOfnV2 pic.twitter.com/LgDDrI9Eyr — BBC News Press Team (@BBCNewsPR) January 22, 2018  Breaches of lockdown rules became a major political issue in Britain, with Boris Johnson’s political advisor Dominic Cummings — who is loathed by the liberal media and establishment over his role in Brexit — has been subjected to a weeks-long witch hunt following claims he flouted restrictions. Breitbart London previously compared the media uproar over Cummings, which attracted international attention, to the lack of establishment interest when globalist Irish leader Leo Varadkar was pictured at a topless barbecue in the park with multiple friends. The picnic was dismissed as a “storm in a bag of cans” with the assertion that Varadkar “did no harm” being made in the Irish Times — a newspaper which previously printed multiple pieces condemning British prime minister Boris Johnson for his refusal to sack Cummings. In one article, which decried Britain and America as “racist” nations “full of white people”, it was claimed that Cummings having held on to his job had revealed “a British political establishment that is obnoxious, its corruption and lies hiding in plain sight”.

MOSCOW – Russia has recorded nearly 9,000 new cases of the coronavirus, roughly consistent with the increases reported over the past two weeks. The national coronavirus task force said Saturday that 4,555 Russians have died of Covid-19 and 396,575 infections have been confirmed overall. The relatively low mortality rate compared with other countries has prompted scepticism domestically and abroad. In a bid to dispel suspicions that authorities are trying to lower the death toll for political reasons, Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova explained Friday that Russia’s count contains only those confirmed to have died of the infection, but she also gave figures for people who tested positive for the virus but died of other causes. If all categories are counted as Covid-19 deaths, the nation’s total toll for April would stand at 2,713, or nearly 60 per cent more than the previously announced number.    

BERLIN (AP) – Chancellor Angela Merkel will not personally attend a meeting in the U.S. with the leaders of the world’s major economies if President Donald Trump goes ahead with it, unless the course of the coronavirus spread changes by then, her office said Saturday. After cancelling the Group of Seven summit, originally scheduled for June 10-12 at Camp David, Trump said a week ago that he was again considering hosting an in-person meeting of world leaders because it would be a “great sign to all” of things returning to normal during the pandemic. Immediately after that announcement, Merkel suggested she had not yet made up her mind on whether to attend in person or by video conference, but her office told the dpa news agency she has now made a decision. “As of today, given the overall pandemic situation, she cannot commit to participating in person,” her office said. It added that the chancellor would continue to monitor the coronavirus situation in case things change.

Greece released a list of 29 countries whose nationals will be allowed to visit the country on holiday but several countries such as Britain and Sweden were notably absent. Tourists from the approved countries who arrive in airports in Athens and Thessaloniki will be checked for Chinese coronavirus symptoms, with the checks based on the passport of the traveller and not where the flight originated. The list of approved travel countries was created after announcements by the European Air Safety Agency (EASA) and includes several European countries such as Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Denmark, along with countries outside of Europe such as New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, and even China. All travellers attempting to enter Greece from countries not on the list, according to a report by newspaper Proto Thema, will have to undergo a mandatory two-week quarantine upon arriving. The Greek Ministry of Tourism said that the new policy would go into effect on June 15th and is the first phase of opening the country back up to international travel. Danes Want to Re-open Land Borders to Everyone Except No-Lockdown Sweden https://t.co/A2nX8Gi4Xo — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 17, 2020  The second phase, expected to start on July 1st, will involve all airports in Greece accepting international flights and a second “red list” created of countries that have not managed to keep the spread of the virus under strict control. While the list includes countries like Austria, Germany, and Hungary, it does not include countries like the United Kingdom and Sweden where infection rates continue to grow. Sweden has also been largely isolated by neighbouring Scandinavian countries due to a large number of infections and deaths in the country as a result of the Chinese virus and their refusal to lock down. Mika Salminen, health safety manager at Finland’s Institute for Health and Welfare said that it was much riskier for the country to allow in Swedish tourists, as opposed to those from Denmark or Norway. “It is a political decision, but the actual difference in the spread of infection is a fact, and I suppose the government, of course, takes that into account,” he said. The British government, on the other hand, did lock down — but never implemented travel bans or mandatory periods of self-isolation on people coming into the country.

A new poll released by USA Today/Ipsos found that one in five, or 20 percent, of teachers say they are not likely to return to their schools should they reopen in the fall. The “parallel” online polls of the views of 505 K-12 teachers and 403 K-12 parents were conducted May 18-21. The polls’ credibility intervals, which are similar to a margin of error, are plus or minus five percentage points for the teachers’ survey and 5.6 points for the parents’ survey. According to the polls, 83 percent of teachers said their job is more difficult now, while 71 percent of parents said they believe teachers are working harder. However, a report at Education Week in April observed that teachers have had many more “flexible arrangements” during the coronavirus crisis. “The actual amount of time teachers are expected to instruct on a daily or weekly basis is shorter,” the report noted. “But they must reserve specific times for ‘office hours,’ when they are available to help students and parents individually.” In the USA Today/Ipsos teachers’ poll, 76 percent said online learning is causing children to fall behind academically, and 24 percent said public school teachers are paid fairly. However, less than half, or 46 percent of parents, said online learning is causing their children to fall behind, and 40 percent of parents said teachers are paid fairly. USA Today/Ipsos noted that, in a separate poll of parents, six in ten, or 60 percent, said they will likely pursue at-home learning in the fall even if their public schools reopen, including 30 percent who said they are “very likely” to continue at-home learning options. A RealClear Opinion Research poll released two weeks ago found 40 percent of families are more likely to choose to homeschool their children or engage in virtual learning even after schools reopen. Additionally, an EdChoice poll released in April found 52 percent of parents have a more favorable opinion of homeschooling since the school closures due to the coronavirus. “As our world has changed, almost everything we do has changed, including how we view and approach education,” said Cliff Young, president of Ipsos, in a statement. “Though Americans are optimistic about a return to in-person learning, there is angst among teachers, parents and America at large about how to keep our schools safe if the virus isn’t fully contained.”

Delaware Gov. John Carney (D) issued a cease and desist notice on Thursday threatening to arrest and fine a spa owner for planning to reopen the business in protest of the state’s stay-at-home order, issued to get a handle on the novel coronavirus outbreak. “Further failure to comply with the Governor’s order constitutes a criminal offense and may result in fines and imprisonment,” the Delaware Emergency Management Agency (DEMA), a component of the state’s Department of Safety and Homeland Security, declared in the May 28 cease and desist letter, first published by the Gateway Pundit (TGP). Although the state will begin phased reopening on June 1, the letter said the V Spa will not be allowed to open during Phase I because it is a “close contact personal services business,” adding: Your anticipated operation of a close contact persona services business prior to the termination of the State of Emergency is a direct violation of the Governor’s order and endangers public health. The Governor’s order has the force and effect of law. By the authority vested in the Delaware Emergency Management Agency (“DEAMA). DEMA formally mandates that you immediately Cease and Desist business at the V Spa …. Lauren Witzke, who is trying to unseat Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE), has been an ardent supporter of the V Spa owner. In a statement to Breitbart News, she lambasted the Delaware governor’s office for threatening to imprison and fine the business owner. “The COVID-19 shutdowns in the state of Delaware have gone on far too long. It’s no longer about public health and safety. It’s about political control and ensuring the Democrats’ proposed ‘Vote by Mail’ scheme to steal the 2020 election from President Donald Trump is implemented,” the America First Republican candidate proclaimed. COVID-19 is the disease produced by the Chinese coronavirus. “Governor John Carney and [Senate Minority Leader] Chuck Schumer [D-NY] lackey Chris Coons plan to allow Delawareans to starve while they attempt to rig the upcoming election,” Witzke added. Taking a page from the governor’s playbook, a local news outlet threatened to have Witzke arrested for trying to hold a press conference outside the television station after it refused to cover the cease and desist order issue. Witzke told TGP: As for WBOC, threatening to have a political candidate arrested for holding a press conference outside their news studio is flatly absurd, though I can’t say I’m surprised by the far-left media. They continue to act as PR [public relations] agents for the DNC [Democratic National Committee]. Maybe WBOC should try covering the news, instead of covering for Chris Coons. Witzke announced via Twitter that she is still planning to hold the press conference outside the station Friday evening. pic.twitter.com/CbgD56DRDM — Lauren Witzke for U.S. Senate (@WitzkeforDE) May 29, 2020  The Democrat-allied leftwing media has reportedly been attacking Witzke, who is running on policies similar to President Trump’s. All U.S. states have at least partially reopened, with the vast majority allowing their stay-at-home orders to expire.

There was no significant increase in Chinese coronavirus hospitalizations, fatalities, and the percentage rate of people testing positive for the disease in 21 states that eased lockdown restrictions on May 4 or earlier, including seven that did not implement a shutdown order at all, an ABC News investigation reportedly found this week. Health analysts consider the number of hospitalizations, fatalities, and the positivity test rate, particularly the seven-day average given the swings in the figures reported daily, to be good proxies for the severity of COVID-19, the new coronavirus disease. Eric Strauss from ABC News identified the 21 states as South Carolina, Montana, Georgia, Mississippi, South Dakota, Arkansas, Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Wyoming, Kansas, Florida, Indiana, Missouri, Ohio, and Nebraska. On Thursday, he wrote on Twitter: JUST IN: [ABC News] looked at 21 states that eased restrictions May 4 or earlier & found no major increase in hospitalizations, deaths or % of people testing positive in any of them. [SC, MT, GA, MS, SD, AR, CO, ID, IA, ND, OK, TN, TX, UT, WY, KS, FL, IN, MO, NE, OH] via [Arielle Mitropoulos]. About a handful of those states — Arkansas, Iowa, South Dakota, Utah, Oklahoma, Wyoming, Nebraska — did not implement a statewide stay-at-home order or any similar measure to stem the spread of the highly contagious and lethal COVID-19. All U.S. states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia are at least partially reopened, with the vast majority allowing their stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders to lapse. New Jersey is the only state that remains mostly shut down, except for limited re-openings for specific retail stores and construction industries, data compiled by the New York Times showed on Friday. The stay-at-home order in New Jersey, home the strictest statewide lockdown, is expected to expire June 5. Delaware’s lockdown measure will not expire until Sunday, but the state has allowed more limited re-openings than New Jersey. ABC News had yet to publish the results of its study as of Friday afternoon, but the alleged author, Mitropoulos, retweeted Strauss’s post about the investigation: JUST IN: @ABC looked at 21 states that eased restrictions May 4 or earlier & found no major increase in hospitalizations, deaths or % of people testing positive in any of them. [SC, MT, GA, MS, SD, AR, CO, ID, IA, ND, OK, TN, TX, UT, WY, KS, FL, IN, MO, NE, OH] via @AMitrops — Eric M. Strauss (@ericMstrauss) May 28, 2020  Breitbart News has determined that after a spike in cases reported each day soon after the state allowed non-essential businesses to reopen on May 1, Texas turned things around. Over the past weeks, the Lone Star state has seen a steady decline in the seven-day average of new coronavirus cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and positivity test rates reported daily. To justify decisions to allow non-essential businesses to reopen, U.S. state officials have been relying on a five or seven-day average number of cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and test positivity rates to account for daily swings in the raw figures. Like several other state leaders, “Gov. Greg Abbott is looking at two specific metrics to justify his decision to restart the Texas economy — the positive test rate and hospitalization levels,” the Texas Tribune noted. To make its determination that there was no COVID-19 spike in the 21 states that reopened early, ABC News likely relied on the seven or five-day average numbers given that the daily hospitalization and fatality figures, along with the rate of people testing positive, fluctuate day by day. The overall number of cases and deaths continue to increase in the United States. As of Friday afternoon, over 1.7 million U.S. residents had tested positive for COVID-19, and over 102,000 had succumbed to it, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker.

Friday on MSNBC, network anchor Chuck Todd said it “seemed” as if President Donald Trump was afraid to lead because he did not take questions from reporters following his White House announcement earlier in the day. After Trump left the podium without taking questions, Todd said, “All right, President Trump with a not taking questions at all. Deciding with his announcement on the various ways he’s going to attempt to punish China over their decision to essentially erase the treaty they originally agreed to with Hong Kong. Look, it’s not lost, I think, on a lot of people to see number one, Katy, he had nothing else to say. He went right to that, stuck to the teleprompter, and walked right out. I think that tells us how he’d like to engage in the Minnesota issue.” Co-host Katy Tur said, “I think you’re right there. There’s a city that is smoldering right now, there are people across this country, the black community is in pain, there is a pandemic, and the president tried to clear it all up, or at least clear his part in potentially inflaming those tensions with a tweet earlier today. Didn’t want to take any questions from reporters.” Todd said, “I got to ask, is the president afraid to lead right now? To not engage at all, I just— that seemed like he was afraid of this. He doesn’t know what to say.” He added, “We’re struggling as a country right now, and that’s — no matter what you think — the president of the United States can’t bring himself to say anything about a Midwestern city that’s smoldering.” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

President Donald Trump on Friday announced at the White House that the United States would terminate its relationship with the World Health Organization. The president said that Chinese officials failed to report details of the coronavirus properly to the World Health Organization (WHO) and pressured the organization to mislead the world about the its dangers. “Countless lives have been taken and profound economic hardship has been inflicted all around the globe,” he said. Trump said that the WHO failed to act on reforms that the United States had demanded, prompting his decision to end America’s role with the organization. “We have detailed the reforms that it must make and engage with them directly, but they have refused to act,” he said. Trump said that the United States would use the hundreds of millions previously sent to the WHO to other international aid programs. “The world needs answers from China on the virus,” Trump says. “We must have transparency.” He noted that Chinese officials shut off people from leaving Wuhan during the peak of the coronavirus pandemic to other parts of China but allowed them to travel the world and spread the virus. “The death and destruction caused by this are incalculable,” Trump said. “We must have answers, not just for us, but the rest of the world.”

No less than the New England Journal of Medicine has dealt a body blow to America’s growing army of mask fascists with the news that “wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection.” The reasons for this are both simple and logical: We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection. Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes). The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal. In many cases, the desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic. So there you go… The only real way to catch the China Flu is to hang out with someone infectious for a protracted period of time, so it’s unlikely you will catch it walking along somewhere, like a store or sidewalk. Obviously, as the Journal points out, if you are a healthcare worker, you are going to be dealing with someone infectious indoors, in a closed setting, and not just passing by. So the Journal warns that the “mask is a core component of the personal protective equipment (PPE) clinicians need when caring for symptomatic patients with respiratory viral infections, in conjunction with gown, gloves, and eye protection.” Even so, the Journal’s warning for healthcare workers points out that a mask is still not very helpful “since it does not provide protection from droplets that may enter the eyes or from fomites on the patient or in the environment that providers may pick up on their hands and carry to their mucous membranes.” “What is clear, however, is that universal masking alone is not a panacea. A mask will not protect providers caring for a patient with active Covid-19 if it’s not accompanied by meticulous hand hygiene, eye protection, gloves, and a gown,” the Journal adds. The World Health Organization (W.H.O.) goes even further: “Masks should only be used by health care workers, caretakers or by people who are sick with symptoms of fever and cough,” said Dr. April Baller, a public health specialist for the W.H.O. Baller adds that the danger to a healthy person wearing a mask is a “false feeling of protection” — which is something the CDC warned of early on during this pandemic, back when we were told not to wear masks. Of course, the CDC has flip-flopped completely on the mask issue, which means that what we are now being told by the New England Journal of Medicine and W.H.O. contradicts the latest CDC guidelines, which, after telling us for weeks that masks are useless against the virus, now “recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.” Since its flip-flop, I have never really bought into the idea that American health “experts” like the CDC and Drs. Fauci and Birx were genuine in their flip-flop on the mask issue. It always seemed to me that public and media pressure forced them into caving. Even today, Fauci can’t bring himself to offer a full-throated mask endorsement, only that the mask is a “symbol” of what “you should be doing” … they are a “valuable safeguard” and part of “respect for another person.” This is a far cry from what he said in March: “There’s no reason to be walking around with a mask,” infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci told 60 Minutes. While masks may block some droplets, Fauci said, they do not provide the level of protection people think they do. Wearing a mask may also have unintended consequences: People who wear masks tend to touch their face more often to adjust them, which can spread germs from their hands. It would seem to me that the need to wear a mask should be based on how the virus in question operates. If, as the New England Journal of Medicine points out, you need to be in close contact with an infected person for up to 30 minutes in order to get infected with the coronavirus, the mask is unnecessary unless you’re in that situation. Out of concern for my wife, I’ve worn a mask since day one, even when Fauci was telling me not to… And I will continue to, at least for the foreseeable future, even though I hate the damn thing. Sadly, though, this latest science against wearing masks will get no traction in our corrupt corporate media or with the corrupt Democrat politicians who have embraced mask fascism with the unbridled glee that all self-righteous bullies embrace such things, embrace any opportunity to join a pious mob and feels a false sense of superiority while shaming and terrorizing others. Like the fact that the coronavirus is no more lethal to those 50 and under than the seasonal flu, the media will cover up this important information. Like the fact Democrat Govs. Whitmer, Cuomo, and Murphy poured infection into nursing homes, the media well bury this information.

Some left-wing Democrat governors want to damage their states’ economies with extended coronavirus-related lockdowns, noted Rep. Greg Steube (R-FL), offering his remarks on Friday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow. Marlow described Florida’s response to the coronavirus outbreak as “a pretty big success story” largely ignored by news media. “I think that the death toll and economic toll [in Florida] have been significantly lower than comparably sized states like New York,” Marlow said. “[The] decision to cram infected patients back into nursing homes and not clean the subway system is so unbelievably heinous.” Americans will voluntarily be conscientious about their health in the context of the coronavirus outbreak without governmental decrees, assessed Steube. “It just goes to show that people will take their own personal responsibility to ensure that they’re being safe and they’re taking care of themselves and their families,” Steube said. Steube referenced a Thursday-published Tampa Bay Times article which declared that “Florida hasn’t seen a spike in coronavirus cases” following its economic reopening.  Coronavirus-related statistics from Florida as noteworthy given the Sunshine State’s large share of elderly residents, noted Steuebe. Steube stated, “I have the second-most elderly district in the entire country. Florida has some of the most elderly population, one of the most diverse populations, and we have actually more people than New York does.” Steuebe continued, “If you compare the [coronavirus] numbers in New York to the numbers in Florida, they’re staggeringly different.” According to an interactive map produced by the New York Times tracking coronavirus infections and deaths — citing “state and local health agencies and hospitals” as its data sources — Florida had 52,277 cases with 2,363 deaths. New York had 371,559 cases and 29,438 deaths. Steube remarked, “I believe we live in the country that provides freedoms, and we should not be telling people they can’t leave their houses to do the things that they need to do or to [shut down] a business owner.” Steuebe noted much of the news media’s alignment with left-wing and partisan Democrat politics regarding the coronavirus-related shutdowns. “It’s interesting to watch the mainstream media just completely criticize DeSantis when — if you look at the numbers — he’s probably had one of the biggest success stories in the entire country from a state that is very populous, very diverse and very old, yet they’re not going to talk about that,” Steube said. Steube determined, “I think that some of these left-wing Democratic governors want nothing more than to destroy their states’ economies. Look no further than Michigan. The things that are going on there are just atrocious, and they violate, in my opinion, our individual liberties and our constitutional rights.” Steube concluded, “Hopefully, these things will start to change significantly, and the DOJ will get involved in these overly abusive and overly burdensome orders.” Breitbart News Daily broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.

The president of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) told the USA Today editorial board she does not agree with President Donald Trump’s view that schools should reopen as soon as possible. In an interview published Thursday, Randi Weingarten accused Trump of creating a “false narrative that people either want to stay in place, locked down, or you open things up as if it was last June.” Weingarten said if there is a second wave of coronavirus infections during the summer, “all bets are off” for reopening schools. The union leader said the distance learning taking place since schools shut down “is something that we all know has not been good for kids.” She noted teachers have “worked really hard” to be flexible to do remote teaching but said online education “is not a substitute for the relationship building and the alchemy that happens in schools and in classrooms.” Weingarten added perhaps “a kid or two” will do well with virtual learning, but dismissed it as a potential ongoing education mode. However, she admitted she could envision some high schools opening one day a week since students of that age “may be able to do more in remote.” She responded to a question about when Americans would know if schools will open in time for the fall semester with the statement, “I think your question is, what’s going to happen in terms of school buildings.” Weingarten added: I think we’re going to know that based upon two facts. Will we get this (financial aid) package (from Congress)? Because if we don’t get that package, then school buildings are not going to reopen in the way that they need to. The second real issue, which is a big uncertainty, is whether there’s going to be a second wave. If a second wave crops up that you can’t contain, then schools won’t open in September. I want schools to open safely and responsibly, and as a union, we are doing everything in our power to prepare people to do that and to try to make it work. The union leader stressed again that schools will need more funding to open “safely and responsibly.” “It’s going to cost more money than we’re spending now,” she continued. Weingarten suggested some possible means of social distancing in schools. “You might have to halve the size of the school in terms of the number of kids that are there,” she said. “You might have to stagger morning and afternoon sessions. … You’d have to clean the school between sessions.” The AFT president acknowledged the possibility of “hybrid models” of school for some districts but emphasized that reopening will be a difficult, but necessary, feat. “[I]t’s not good for kids to be home like this,” she said. In response to her support to “road test” some possible innovations for schools during the summer months, Weingarten admitted some of her members have asked, “[W]hy are you pushing for this? And why are you pushing for summer school?” She said the fear and anxiety associated with the infection caused by the Chinese virus is “legitimate.” “This illness, excuse my language, it knocks the s–t out of you,” she said.

Consumer sentiment improved slightly in May boosted by a big improvement in views of current economic conditions. The University of Michigan’s index of consumer sentiment rose half a percentage point in May, according to the survey’s chief economist Richard Curtin. Consumer assessments of current conditions jumped 10 percent compared with April. The gauge of current conditions crashed in March and early April, falling by 40 points. But it appeared to stabilize in April, perhaps because of government payments to taxpayers, programs to stabilize employment, and enhanced unemployment benefits. Now it is on the rise again. “The CARES relief checks and higher unemployment payments have helped to stem economic hardship, but those programs have not acted to stimulate discretionary spending due to uncertainty about the future course of the pandemic,” Curtin said. Troublingly, consumer expectations continued to weaken in May as it became clear that the reopening of the economy would be slower than many expected when the lockdown orders were initially issued. Expectations began weakening in March but held up better than the current conditions metric, indicating that Americans were startled by the sudden crash in stocks and lockdown orders that brought much of the economy to a halt but expected a quick recovery. April saw a steeper plunge in expectations as the extent of the economic damage became clearer and lockdowns stretched on. In May, the expectations gauge fell another 6 percent to 65.9, the lowest level in six years, from 67.7 in the mid-month preliminary reading and 70.1 in the April reading. “It should not be surprising that a growing number of consumers expected the economy to improve from its recent standstill, or that the majority still thought conditions in the economy would remain unfavorable in the year ahead,” Curtin said. While the government’s aid programs have likely boosted consumer sentiment they are also likely the cause of rising inflation expectations. Recent data on prices, however, suggests that the economy is experiencing deflationary pressure from lower consumer spending. Bond yields and other market based indicators do not predict much inflation in the year ahead.

Liberal Democrat leader Sir Edward ‘Ed’ Davey is attempting to use the Chinese coronavirus pandemic as an excuse to delay Britain’s true Brexit from the European Union, arguing that a two-year delay is “just common sense”. “We are facing the deepest recession in 300 years [a]fter the most serious public health crisis in over 100 years,” he argued in a statement posted on social media. “With a climate emergency that demands action now Delaying Brexit by 2 years is just common sense,” he claimed — although the link between the pandemic and an alleged “climate emergency” was left unclear. The 54-year-old’s choice of words was revealing, as, formally Brexit has already happened, with the United Kingdom leaving the European Union in January 2020. However, it is now in a so-called “transition period” with the bloc in which it remains an EU member-state in all but name, still subject to its laws, its judges, its trade policy, and its migration regime, among other things — with the only real change being that Britain has lost its representation in EU institutions such as the European Commission and the supranational Court of Justice. We are facing the deepest recession in  300 years After the most serious public health crisis in over 100 years With a climate emergency that demands action now Delaying Brexit by 2 years is just common sense @LBC https://t.co/pp2K4lnbBf — Ed Davey MP 🔶🇺 #StayHomeSaveLives #ProtectNHS (@EdwardJDavey) May 28, 2020  Sir Ed’s proposal to extend the transition for two years — meaning that, the better part of a decade on from the British people’s vote to Leave the European Union, the country would still not be free of the bloc in a meaningful sense — is backed by a range of EU loyalist British opposition leaders, as well as the EU itself. Indeed, a plan to extend the transition was reportedly “all but agreed at official level” while Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his chief adviser Dominic Cummings were out of action with coronavirus infections — but this was “scuppered” when the later recovered and returned to work. Now that Cummings’ is under pressure to resign from his position over claims that a move from London to Durham during the lockdown to ensure his young son’s childcare needs could be met, however, the efforts of politicians to delay Brexit by the EU and British EU loyalists like Sir Ed have intensified, with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier writing an open letter to British opposition politicians to make it clear that a two-year extension is very much on offer. The official position of Boris Johnson’s government is that it will not agree to any extension — at least for now. Thank you @MichelBarnier for your letter today confirming the EU is open to a two-year extension to the Brexit transition period. Time is running out. @BorisJohnson must put his responsibilities to jobs and the economy first –  agree an extension to prevent another crisis. pic.twitter.com/b9NqjP1YwZ — Ian Blackford (@Ianblackford_MP) May 27, 2020 

Friday on Fox News, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow warned unemployment news was to get worse before it gets better due to the economic downturn resulting from the coronavirus pandemic. Kudlow, however, said there were other positive signs in the economy offering reasons for optimism. “You know, the things are looking better, OK?” he said. “Now, we are still in the pandemic contraction. We probably haven’t peaked in unemployment, and the numbers coming in the weeks ahead are going to be very poor here in the second quarter. It’s a lot of hardship, a lot of heartbreak, OK, a lot of anxiety, so it certainly isn’t over. But, but, but, but I will say this. The virus is flattening and coming downward. The openings are coming across the country. Businesses are opening. New business applications are opening. There’s kind of a list, Steve, of all the – you know, I call them glimmers of hope and growth. Cars are driving more. Gasoline prices are up. The Apple Mobility Index is up.” “We’re even seeing on the unemployment claims, which is a terrible number – close to 40 million – but it is slowing in its increase,” Kudlow continued. “So there’s some hopeful signs, and I think we’re going to move strong into the second half of the year with perhaps as much as 20 percent economic growth. We’ll talk about this with the business leaders and next steps on economic policy. You know, we’ve gone through the liquidity phase. Now we’re in the reopening phase. I think the next phase has to go back to old fashion Trumponomics — cutting taxes, deregulating, fair trade deals, things that grew the economy rapidly in the first three years plus and things that can grow the economy rapidly in the second half and onto next year. The president rebuilt the economy. He can do it a second time. We’ll have this whole conversation with the CEOs and the others.” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor

The world’s alarmists took another hit with the news Denmark was able to reopen its schools and daycare centers without an increase in coronavirus infections. Reuters reports that after a one-month lockdown, “Sending children back to schools and day care centres in Denmark, the first country in Europe to do so, did not lead to an increase in coronavirus infections[.]” In fact, the “number of infected children aged between one and up to 19 has declined steadily since late April[.]” It should be added the Denmark schoolchildren pictured in the Reuters piece are not wearing masks, nor are the adults. There was what is described as a “slight uptick” immediately after the schools reopened, but it came too soon to be blamed on the reopening and was probably due to the increase in testing. There’s more good news out of Denmark: a “steady drop in daily infections, hospital admissions and deaths since early April has led Denmark to continue its reopening, with shopping malls, bars, restaurants allowed to reopen in May.” And here’s more bad news for coronavirus alarmists, courtesy of no less than ABC News… “ABC looked at 21 states that eased restrictions May 4 or earlier & found no major increase in hospitalizations, deaths or % of people testing positive in any of them.” Well, how about that… Regardless of all this, even if the infection rate increased in Denmark, it still makes no sense to keep children out of school, especially now we know the coronavirus is no more lethal to those under the age of 50 than the seasonal flu. As far as teachers and staff over the age of 50, if they are concerned about infection, they can wear a mask or find a job that will allow them to work from home. There is just no valid scientific or moral reason to keep anyone under the age of 50 locked down, most especially children who have the least to worry about with the coronavirus. They are probably in as much danger of dying in a car accident as they are from the coronavirus. Regardless, if we are not closing schools to “save lives” during the seasonal flu, we should no longer be shuttering our schools for the coronavirus when the risks are exactly the same for students. And let’s not forget the risks that come from these lockdowns, the lack of socialization and structure, the damage that does to children. Over and over and over again, the science continues to prove that the “experts” we wrong about almost everything. What we appear to have here is a disease that ravages the elderly, but what did we do? We pulled kids out of school, locked up the young people who are in almost no danger, shattered 40 million of their lives by killing their jobs. And those who are truly at risk — those who live in nursing facilities? Well, Democrat governors like Andrew Cuomo of New York, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, and Phil Murphy of New Jersey had the plague poured directly into those nursing facilities.

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas will soon allow outdoor pro sports events to have spectators, but the numbers will be strictly limited, under a new order Thursday from Republican Gov. Greg Abbott. Abbott revised a decision to let pro sports leagues host events without fans starting in June as part of the state’s move to reopen amid the coronavirus pandemic. Abbott’s new order allows outdoor stadiums to host fans up to 25% of their normal capacity. Leagues will have to apply to state health officials to be allowed to have fans. Indoor events will still be without spectators. The change came the same day Texas reported a one-day high in new cases with 1,855 reported Thursday. Texas now has 59,776 confirmed cases through nearly 990,000 viral and coronavirus antibody tests. It has 1,601 deaths, a one-day increase of 39. The actual number of cases is likely far higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. IndyCar is set to open its season at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth on June 6, but track president Eddie Gossage said that even under the new rule, the Genesys 300 race will still not include fans. “Nobody wants to have the stands filled with fans more than me but we’re just not in a position to do that yet,” Gossage said in a written statement, noting the race will be broadcast live on NBC. “While the state will permit us to operate at 25 percent of capacity, there are still too many unanswered questions for an event that is just one week away.” PGA Tour has previously said it plans to restart its season at Colonial in Texas on June 11-14 without fans attending. Major League Baseball has proposed starting its season in early July at regular-season ballparks, if necessary without fans. Abbott’s order, however, may not impact the Texas Rangers and the Houston Astros because “stadiums with retractable roofs are not considered to be outdoors,” health department spokeswoman Lara Anton said. State health officials did not immediately respond to questions on whether any leagues or event organizer have asked to be allowed to have spectators. The state has set up several guidelines, including a recommendation that spectators and employees keep at least 6 feet (2 meters) apart from anyone not from their household. If that is not feasible, other measures such as face coverings and sanitation protocols should be followed. Athletes will not be required to wear masks, but the guidelines encourage them to be worn on the sidelines.
The order does not address college sports events. For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death. However, most patients recover.

Friday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” network anchor Joy Reid addressed the scene in Minneapolis as violent protests have ramped up. Reid pushed back against the situation being labeled as a “riot” despite the looting and burning of buildings, adding people in Minneapolis are “risking COVID” to say “stop killing us” and “acknowledge that we’re people.” “The lack of sense that these are people — as black people right now, we feel hunted,” Reid explained. “Everybody I know, white, black, every race that I know is angry. No one I know is sleeping. People are stressed. People are afraid. But everybody black I know feels hunted. And that is not the way we’re supposed to feel in our own country. And I disagree with only one thing that was said: the word ‘riot.’ What happened in 1921 in Tulsa, when black people were massacred just for having a nice neighborhood, that was a riot. That ain’t a riot what we’re seeing right now in Minneapolis.” “What we’re seeing right there is frustration and anger and rage and an uprising,” she continued. “It’s the same thing that we saw in Ferguson. It is the same thing that we saw in Baltimore. Because when people get good and sick of being killed for nothing in their own country and treated like sub-humans in their own country, people get mad, and people get sick of it. People are risking COVID to explain to this country that we’re fed up. Just stop killing us. This is not a — this is not a huge demand. Black Lives Matter was a minimal demand. Just acknowledge that we’re people. Now, we’re just saying, ‘Just stop killing us.’ Whether it is police or ex-police or civilians, please, just stop killing us.” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent

As the stock market rallied in April and May, there was a great deal of handwringing about the apparent disconnect between financial markets and the real economy. With soaring unemployment claims and mass business closures, the S&P’s upward march appeared preposterous. “Have the Record Number of Investors in the Stock Market Lost Their Minds?” asked John Cassidy at The New Yorker. Cassidy and others attributed the rally to a spike in retail volume. People bored at home injected a bunch of “dumb money” into the market, pushing up the prices of high-profile tech stocks like Tesla.  Seasoned market hands suggested the rally was driven by irrational exuberance. Legendary macro investor Stanley Druckenmiller said that “the risk-reward for equity is maybe as bad as I’ve seen it in my career,” and Warren Buffett sold stocks during the rally in April. One theory was the financial markets had become disconnected from the real economy entirely. Tech stock have led market returns for years, and a consumer at home is still a consumer. He still makes Amazon orders and goes on Facebook, and the congressional stimulus drove incomes up during the economic shutdowns, so socially distanced consumers still had money to spend. Meanwhile, the Fed’s massive bond-buying program shored up corporate balance sheets, even for some risky high-yield companies. These lending facilities precluded the mass bankruptcies that some market watchers had predicted. Loan programs also buoyed employment. As of May 30, banks had disbursed $510 billion in loans as part of the Paycheck Protection Program. Companies receiving PPP loans are required to spend 75 percent of the funds on payroll, and qualify for loan forgiveness if they retain 90 percent of their workers. The Fed’s corporate-lending facilities include similar provisions on workforce retention.   Which brings us to today’s Bureau of Labor Statistics employment report showing a 2.5 million increase in jobs. Given the unprecedented stimulus, it makes sense that employment did not continue to nosedive. But it wasn’t just the government bolstering the economy. As states reopened in May, temporarily furloughed leisure and hospitality workers went back to work. It remains to be seen whether the summer will bring more good news. The pandemic could very well alter consumption patterns, and loan forbearance has generated a short-term liability overhang that could put a drag on economic growth. But the past few months have shown that markets are smart.  

Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer violated her own executive order on social distancing while participating in a civil rights march with hundreds of demonstrators. Whitmer’s order, which she signed on Monday, states that participants in public gatherings should remain six feet apart at all times. “The governor took precautions for engaging in an outdoor activity, including wearing a mask even though it is not required outdoors under the order,” Whitmer spokeswoman Tiffany Brown told the Detroit News. Brown said Whitmer did not violate the order, which states “Nothing in this order shall be taken to abridge protections guaranteed by the state or federal constitution,” including the right to protest.  However, an FAQ page on the Michigan state government website states, “Persons may engage in expressive activities protected by the First Amendment within the State of Michigan, but must adhere to social distancing measures recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including remaining at least six feet from people from outside the person’s household.” Whitmer drew national scrutiny in March for imposing some of the strictest lockdown measures in the country, including prohibitions against the purchasing of certain consumer goods in big box stores. In April, Whitmer compared anti-lockdown protesters to Americans who refused to work in factories during the World War II production effort.  Whitmer also faced backlash from constituents after her husband, Marc Mallory, allegedly tried to use her position to coerce a marina worker into putting their boat in the water ahead of Memorial Day weekend, rather than waiting in the queue.  “I am the husband to the governor, will this make a difference?” Mallory asked when Dowker said it wouldn’t be possible to put out the boat by Memorial Day, according to a since-deleted Facebook post by dock owner Todd Dowker. Whitmer described her husband’s statement as a “failed attempt at humor.”  Send a tip to the news team at NR. 

Nearly all colleges sent students home back in March, and the big question they now face is whether to resume normal operations in August. Quite a few voices have argued that it’s just too risky to do so. College leaders who reopen will be responsible for a lot of illness and death. Do the safe thing — stay closed. Taking the opposite side in this argument is professor Rob Jenkins. In today’s Martin Center article, he argues in favor of reopening, with sensible precautions. Responding to the “Don’t Reopen!” crowd, Jenkins writes: Attempts to portray those of us who favor reopening as insensitive, uncaring, or mercenary are uncivil and unjust. We, too, are concerned about students and others on campus, not just in the short term but also over the long haul. We believe the health — nay, the very survival — of our campuses is vital to the long-term health and well-being of all concerned. Jenkins points out that COVID-19 poses minimal risk for most people in the age range we find on college campuses. Older faculty and staff can be protected against possible exposure. And what if colleges stay closed? Many won’t survive much longer. Continuing with online courses won’t do. Jenkins writes: Those who think we can simply hold all our classes online again this fall are deluding themselves. Students tolerated that in the spring because they had to. But study after study shows that a clear majority favor returning to campus; short of that, many do not intend to return at all. Can our campuses survive that intact? Can our higher education system? Can our students?  

The unemployment rate dropped over the past month as the economy added 2.5 million jobs, defying predictions of additional layoffs in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Unemployment now sits at 13.3 percent, falling from 14.7 percent in April. Many economists had expected the unemployment rate to reach 20 percent or higher.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics said that the unemployment rate fell partly because states have begun to reopen businesses that were shuttered to enforce social distancing measures. Businesses that saw job gains included restaurants, construction, healthcare and retail, while airline and hotel jobs continued to fall. The job numbers report the largest monthly increase in employment since 1939. It “suggests that the US economy is more resilient than expected,” Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, told CNBC. “Barring a second surge of Covid-19, the overall U.S. economy may have turned a corner, as evidenced by the surprise job gains today, even though it still remains to be seen exactly what the new normal will look like,” said Citizens Bank head of global markets Tony Bedikian.

A New York judge has ruled that looters and peaceful protesters who violate curfew may be detained by police for more than 24 hours even if they are not arraigned before a court, citing the coronavirus pandemic and current civil unrest in New York City. New York law typically requires that arrested suspects be released if they cannot be arraigned within 24 hours. Because of the pandemic, New York courts must hold arraignments via video conference. Holding facilities in New York City have seen a sharp increase in suspects arrested either for looting or peacefully protesting after an 8 p.m. curfew, and the legal system has been unable to speedily process their arraignments.  “I…find that there is a crisis within a crisis specifically a civil unrest crisis within the overarching COVID-19 crisis,” acting Manhattan Supreme Court Justice James Burke said at a hearing on Thursday. “To that end, the entire police department has been deployed and the entire Manhattan DA’s office is ‘all hands on deck’ and working to relieve the system.” Burke said that delays in processing arraignments were justified given the dual crises. “The NYPD has no excuses with its 38,000 police officers and the best technology in the world, with all the money they are being given, they have no excuse to not process them in a timely manner,” countered Marlen Bodden, an attorney for the group Legal Aid that had petitioned for the release of suspects in George Floyd demonstrations. Over the past week, looters have taken advantage of the demonstrations to pillage stores in various New York City neighborhoods, with some concentrating on the wealthy neighborhoods of Soho and Midtown Manhattan.

				ever trust a socialist. And never trust an idiot. But never, never, never trust a socialist who is such an idiot that he seems harmless. Nicolás Maduro is the paradigm: A guy who is allergic to big books and claims that Chávez talks to him through a little bird (as Maduro himself claimed) seemed too dumb to be dangerous. But years go by, and in the Helicoide prison in Caracas, opposition leaders are still tortured with electric shocks to the testicles.  In Spain, the social-Communist government of Sánchez-Iglesias has yet to send dissident citizens to prison, but it is treating them with (figuratively speaking, thank God) extended electroshock therapy to the balls. The coronavirus is of Communist origin. Perhaps that is why it immediately allied itself with the Spanish government. Under the pretext of national security, the government has kept Spain in an unnecessary and illegitimate state of alarm for months, an exceptional arrangement allowed by our Constitution that permits the extreme and arbitrary limitation of fundamental rights and freedoms. It cannot be denied that the government is working hard on this pandemic. In fact, it would be better if they would just stay put for at least five minutes. Every day new measures are taken: They have a problem for every solution! The recent approval of a guaranteed minimum income seems destined to discourage employment, encourage fraud, and feed the underground economy. As if that were not enough, they have announced the repeal of the labor reform with which former president Mariano Rajoy managed to save the Spanish economy. Pablo Iglesias, the second deputy prime minister, before he even dreamed of coming to power, when he was nothing but a loudspeaker for Chávez, used to say in his university that only by taking advantage of an exceptional situation will Communists rise to power in Spain. And that situation is the pandemic. Well, the pandemic, and Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez. When the first State of Alarm was declared, in March this year, Sánchez showed his true colors, taking advantage and modifying the National Intelligence Center (CNI) laws to allow Iglesias a seat on the supervisory body of the Spanish espionage service. It seems unlikely that the plan was to spy on a coronavirus. So we can conclude that Iglesias demanded that Sánchez let him into the CNI. (What self-respecting Communist doesn’t have secret services?) After all, Iglesias had previously requested control of the Spanish public television station, TVE, which has subsequently become such an immense propaganda machine that it makes Fidel Castro’s six-hour speeches on Cuban TV look like child’s play. Socialists think they are talented in the art of propaganda until they put a Communist in the cabinet and let him play with his junk for a while. In Spain, silent coup-makers don’t leave loose ends. They put the director of a socialist magazine in charge of the government’s Center of Sociological Investigation (CIS) and published a study claiming that eight out of ten Spaniards want the other parties to praise the current government for everything and avoid issuing any kind of criticism. And we should probably be grateful that our government is a modest one and that it was not actually 15 out of ten Spaniards wanting to dissolve all political opposition. They also use the CIS to advance their totalitarian obsession. A month ago, a CIS survey by the highest sociological authority of the Government of Spain included a question that was quite the Communist manifesto: Do you think that in these times, the dissemination of fake news, misleading and unsubstantiated information on social networks and media should be prohibited, with all information about the pandemic coming from official sources, or do you think that total freedom should be maintained for the dissemination of news and information? While Trump is trying to ensure social networks’ political neutrality, Sánchez and Iglesias are working hard to avoid social-network neutrality. Recently, in a controversial government press conference, the head of the Civil Guard said that the police were working on the Internet to “minimize the adverse climate toward the government’s management of the crisis.” One of Sánchez’s ministers said the same thing a few days later on Spanish public television: “We cannot accept negative messages.” That day also saw the launch of a campaign against the two main opposition parties, PP and VOX. The government is using the same tactic that Maduro used in Venezuela: They claim that the opposition, in this case VOX, is preparing a coup d’état. But what is it that bothers the Sánchez administration so much about criticism in general and social networks in particular? The gradual leaking of documents proving their incompetence and negligence in the face of the coronavirus crisis — the reason that relatives of some victims are trying to hold the government accountable in court. Let me pause briefly here to highlight three dates:  
 On February 10, the Centre for the Coordination of Health Alerts and Emergencies gave the government a report warning of the deadly spread of the coronavirus.   On March 8, the government encouraged massive feminist rallies throughout the country. On March 14, the Spanish government declared the State of Alarm. Might they have concealed the alert of February 10 because the upcoming feminist demonstrations on March 8 were central to their political agenda? They did not want to suspend them, even though chaos was already breaking out inside hospitals. Just 24 hours earlier, on February 9, the top government official in charge of health alerts had told reporters with a chuckle: “If my son asks me if he can go to the March 8 rally, I’ll tell him to do whatever he wants.” Meanwhile, Carmen Calvo, the first deputy prime minister, accidentally told the truth. Encouraging women to participate in the feminist marches, she exclaimed, “You must go to the march, it’s your life on the line!” And indeed, 239,000 infected with COVID-19 and more than 27,000 deaths give us reason to suspect that yes, their lives were “on the line.” The minister of equality, Irene Montero, is Pablo Iglesias’s wife, and I’m not suggesting that the two facts are related. In a TV appearance before the demonstration, Montero endorsed a strange March 8 slogan for female empowerment: “Alone and drunk, I want to get home.” But I suspect that if you’re out drinking, going home alone is the last thing on your mind. Anyway, after seeing that all the government ministers who participated in the March 8 rallies tested positive for the coronavirus, Twitter rehashed the slogan: “Alone, drunk, and with coronavirus, I want to get home.” By the way, “borracha” (drunk) and “casa” (home) rhymes in Spanish, although it is the sort of rhyme that Hunter Biden could write at dawn, floating through the front door on the fumes from his night on the town.   In the end, the problem with the Left is that they spend the day talking about conscience — environmental, class, race, gender — but they lack an individual conscience of their own, having bent it to fit their principles, which you can read, if you were so inclined, on any blank sheet of paper. This makes lying easy for them. It doesn’t weigh too heavily on their conscience, because, for leftists, the ends always justifies the means. We are seeing proof of this once again with the radical Left’s instigation of violence in protests and riots across the United States, and the moderate left’s justification of the violence. They are two sides of the same coin. They each need the other. Spain today is governed by a man who seems dangerously aroused by power — like a mixture of the Marquis de Sade and the World Cup winner Diego Armando Maradona. Sánchez’s first scandal was using a private ministerial Falcon jet to attend his favorite music festival. His only reasonable line of defense would have been to push the fact that the festival wasn’t bloody reggaeton, but for reasons I can’t quite grasp, it’s the only defense he didn’t use. When the opposition asked him for detailed information about this blatant waste of public funds, the government, without so much as blushing, declared that the trip was an “official secret.”  And that is the sum of Pedro Sánchez’s political credo. The rest is empty. This is someone who has probably never read a lengthy book in his life. So it is the Communist Iglesias who fills the gap, as I explained in another article in these pages — Spaniards are suffering a government that we did not vote for. Unlike Sánchez, Iglesias does have something in the space between his ears. The bad news is that that “something” is sinister. Sánchez, who plagiarized his doctoral thesis to obtain a cum laude, is known over here as Dr. Fraud or President “Cum Fraude.” To list his lies would take hundreds of pages. It is easier to talk about the one time he told the truth. It was when he returned to politics in 2015, after being kicked out of his own party for trying to rig the primaries: He told the newspaper El Mundo, “I’ve returned to politics to shake things up.” And indeed, he is causing more havoc than a monkey with a gun at a party for gas canisters.  As I write these lines, Sánchez is addressing the nation. He does it every weekend at news time. Here they already call it “Aló Presidente,” in reference to the propaganda program with which Chávez tortured Venezuelan viewers for hours every Sunday. Sánchez is announcing that he wants to extend the State of Alarm until June 21 — for our security, he says, trying once again to make his audience believe that the State of Alarm has something to do with health measures against the pandemic. On hearing this, I’m reminded of something H. L. Mencken said that, in light of what we’ve seen, seems to be a prophecy regarding the Spanish government: “The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed (and hence clamorous to be led to safety) by an endless series of hobgoblins, most of them imaginary.” Translated by Joel Dalmau

Amid all the momentous events that have defined the coronavirus pandemic, the decision by both the Trump administration and, in near-unanimous votes, both houses of Congress to institute a “stimulus” program — an element of which amounts to a de facto universal basic income (UBI) — is perhaps the least appreciated.  Paying individuals a flat check of $1,200, is, effectively, a one-time UBI. Legislators are already considering a second round. The long-term import of this is significant. At a time when the two parties can agree on almost nothing, they came together to support a policy that up until recently was restricted largely (but certainly not exclusively) to the Silicon Valley Left. Watching this go through brought to mind Rudyard Kipling’s 1919 poem “The Gods of the Copybook Headings.” Kipling contrasts the Gods of the Marketplace, meaning the socially acceptable wishful thinking, with the Gods of the Copybook Headings, who remind us of the eternal truths we routinely abandon for a more fashionable pantheon. He concludes with these lines: And that after this is accomplished, and the brave new world begins
When all men are paid for existing and no man must pay for his sins,
As surely as Water will wet us, as surely as Fire will burn,
The Gods of the Copybook Headings with terror and slaughter return! Sound familiar? In a few short months, we went from UBI (the idea of giving almost every adult citizen a check) being an idea favored only at the margins to its being the official policy of a Republican administration backed by a Republican-controlled Senate. The counterargument is clear. These are extreme times. This is not UBI but merely a temporary support measure for working families in exceptional circumstances. It is an argument that might have more force had not conservative political parties in the Western world found it so difficult to rein in an expanding welfare state that can no longer be afforded, something that became all too obvious in the battles over “austerity” after the European debt crisis.  
 Since America’s current “UBI” was promoted as an essential element in a stimulus program, it seems reasonable to assume that, whatever is being said to the contrary, it will be more difficult to end it until the economy gets strong enough to no longer need stimulus. The list of temporary spending programs instituted during a crisis but later discontinued is distressingly short.  Fearing the electoral consequences of challenging this regime, many conservative parties of the Western world seem to have given up on the task of decreasing the size of government. In the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party has made protecting the U.K.’s public health-care system one of the cornerstones of his government. The Trump administration has signed relief plans totaling over $2 trillion, in an environment where were already spending $4.45 trillion a year. The small-government that once defined conservative politics appears to have fallen out of fashion.  “UBI” programs such as the individual $1,200 checks are simply the next step in the evolution of the welfare state. The preexisting welfare systems (whatever their faults) are designed to act as safety nets, but the checks in this case are universal — they go to people who haven’t fallen into the safety net as well as to those who have. It isn’t an unemployment benefit, federal jobs guarantee, work-for-welfare regime, or any other welfare system. Those at least maintain the pretense of encouraging the recipient to be self-reliant.  An expansion of the welfare state of the type represented by these checks would have once kept conservatives awake at night. But we’d put our emphasis on the “used to,” as conservative parties have been on their current path for years; it just took an excuse, provided now by the pandemic and accompanying shutdowns, to push them off the cliff. We might look back on the societal consequences of the pandemic not as revolutionary but as acceleratory. Unfortunately, we have been doing the bidding of Kipling’s Gods of the Marketplace for quite some time now, by acting as though we can infinitely expand the federal government and suffer no consequences. Had the Western world not abused monetary and fiscal policy during our past crises and recoveries, we would have had more margin, more room for error in dealing with this one. But we treated peacetime like wartime, and now that a true war is here, we find our swords are dull.  The United States is straining against the limits of sound policy and relying on the credulity of bond investors after decades of growth of the federal government in a way and to a size that now threatens our fiscal stability. Even if this first draft of UBI does not last past the pandemic, the Trump administration has normalized the practice of giving every American a check solely for existing. Don’t be surprised if 2022 and 2024 feature politicians far more prominent than former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang running campaigns on Universal Basic Income.  If a Republican president can do it, why not a Democratic one?  A pandemic should prompt some introspection, if nothing else. While it is far from clear how things will turn out and how severe the consequences of our policies will be, the coronavirus and its repercussions have demonstrated once again that we are not invincible.

Ramesh alluded to an open letter signed by over 1,000 “public health professionals, infectious diseases professionals, and community stakeholders.” The letter argues that it’s okay if the current protests/riots spread COVID-19 because racism is itself a public-health issue that needs to be addressed. Let’s take that argument seriously for a moment and ask a follow-up question: Why, then, was there so much criticism of the anti-lockdown protests? The premise of those protests was that continuing lockdowns caused far more economic damage than was necessary. If anything is a public-health issue, surely record unemployment, social isolation, and bans on people going to hospitals for non-urgent care should count. Well, here is how the letter distinguishes between anti-racism protests and anti-lockdown protests: . . . [W]e do not condemn these [anti-racism] gatherings as risky for COVID-19 transmission. We support them as vital to the national public health and to the threatened health specifically of Black people in the United States . . . . This should not be confused with a permissive stance on all gatherings, particularly protests against stay-home orders. Those actions not only oppose public health interventions, but are also rooted in white nationalism and run contrary to respect for Black lives. It’s difficult to understand how any reasonable person could have committed those words to print. Even just, “Yeah, we’re hypocrites, so what?” would have been a more satisfying response. Ironically, the signatories do say they have “privately mourned the widening rift between leaders in science and a subset of the communities that they serve.” That rift is now a chasm. If these leaders do have any real expertise, how sad that it’s been lost within the all-consuming political correctness of our age.  

Religious leaders in Madison, Wis., have written to local officials, calling its reopening policy unconstitutional and a “discriminatory restriction.” The letter asks that the City of Madison and Dane County COVID-19 regulations be revised to apply to houses of worship the same way they apply to other organizations and businesses. In a letter on behalf of the Catholic Diocese of Madison, several attorneys outline how local authorities are applying reopening rules unequally in the wake of COVID-19 shutdowns, targeting places of worship with stricter policies than those applied to other public activities. This, they argue, “treats religious interests unequally and unfairly.” The letter notes that the local reopening plan subjects “the routine operations of houses of worship—and of no other category of organization—to a ‘Mass Gathering’ limit of 50 persons.” Meanwhile, retail stores, shopping malls, restaurants, bars, offices, factories, gyms, salons, tattoo parlors, spas, dog parks, contact sports, trampoline parks, movie theaters, museums, hotels, community centers, car washes—the list goes on—are all permitted to open and conduct “everyday operations” at 25 percent of their certified occupancy but without a generally applicable and blanket numerical cap. In an initial emergency order, city officials treated religious groups in the same way as other essential businesses, declaring that “faithbased services, religious entities, and places of worship (indoor)” would be permitted to operate at 25-percent capacity. But shortly thereafter, President Trump called on state and local governments to permit houses of worship to begin reopening. “Later that afternoon,” the letter continues, “in a seemingly targeted and hostile response to the Federal government’s calls for religious equality, [officials] abruptly reversed course and ‘revised’ the Forward Dane plan to cap all religious gatherings at 50 persons with future limits ‘to be determined.’” Despite the fact that the local Catholic diocese released detailed plans for conducting church services at 25 percent capacity — allowing for groups larger than 50 people in the diocese’s larger churches — and enforcing social-distancing measures, the city continues to impose unnecessary restrictions by designating every worship service a “mass gathering.” Officials have gone as far as calling church leaders directly, threatening to send officers to monitor compliance with the regulation and hand out citations for violations.  “Thousands of people may shop together at a mall; hundreds of employees may arrive at an office or factory every morning to conduct the business’s everyday operations; and hundreds of children may spend a few hours bouncing off each other at trampoline parks. But, because religious services have uniformly been deemed ‘Mass Gatherings,’ no more than 50 of the 1,225 seats in Saint Maria Goretti Church may be filled,” the letter states.  

New York City mayor Bill de Blasio has become a convenient punching bag for both the Right and the Left. But if nothing else, de Blasio deserves credit for candor in offering an explanation for a glaring contradiction in his enforcement of coronavirus pandemic restrictions. The mayor has been a zealous enforcer of lockdown regulations, with a particular emphasis on targeting ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities in Brooklyn. Though Jews were far from the only ones accused of violating social-distancing rules, in April de Blasio tweeted out a warning to “the Jewish community” in which he threatened to send the police to arrest all those who gathered in groups, a reference to instances of Jews attending weddings, funerals, and religious services.  After several days of mass protests against police brutality (with some simply supporting the abolition of police), followed by nights in which crowds of rioters rampaged through parts of the city looting iconic stores, such as the Macy’s in Herald Square, it was clear that stopping people from gathering “in large numbers” was no longer a priority. Yet even as the NYPD stood by as huge crowds marched against racism, the police were rousting Orthodox families out of Brooklyn parks and breaking up religious study sessions that were not in compliance with social-distancing regulations. On Tuesday, a reporter for Hamodia, an ultra-Orthodox Jewish publication, asked de Blasio about this discrepancy. His reply spoke volumes about liberal contempt for religious freedom.  The reporter asked how it was possible for the city to tolerate mass demonstrations over George Floyd’s murder when the police were still enforcing pandemic restrictions on small businesses as well as churches, synagogues, and mosques.  
 The mayor’s answer was that “the extraordinary crisis seated in 400 years of racism” was “not the same question as the understandably aggrieved store owner or the devout religious person who wants to go back to services.” In other words, because he approved of the motives of some protesters and of the content of their protest, their demonstrations are uniquely privileged in a way that those seeking to exercise their right to religious liberty were not. While de Blasio was more outspoken about this policy, his pronouncement appeared to reflect the way other states and cities were prepared to wink at protests against the police while insisting on pretending that the pandemic prevented other activities. Perhaps this is just a function of the identity politics that governs many on the left, or the plain fact that cities and states don’t have the ability to enforce the law, let alone pandemic restrictions, when so many people are determined to ignore them.   But coming as it did just a few days after the Supreme Court case of South Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Gavin Newsom, Governor of California, in which Chief Justice John Roberts joined with the court’s four liberal members to rule that California’s prohibition of religious services during the COVID-19 outbreak was not unconstitutional, it seems like a bad joke. There, the majority held that it was “indisputably clear” that the Constitution gives officials of the states the duty “to guard and protect” the “safety and the health of the people,” meaning California had the right to issue pandemic restrictions on houses of worship and other mass gatherings alike. Only a few days later, the same mainstream media and governmental-establishment consensus that viewed religious services and other public gatherings during a pandemic as irresponsible has disappeared. The brutal killing of George Floyd rightly outraged most Americans. But lost amid the debate is the question of whether selective enforcement of the law has fundamentally undermined religious liberty.  Mayor de Blasio’s blithe assertion that he has the right to pick and choose which kinds of constitutionally protected behavior to respect and which he may trample may have been unique in its candor. But it is indicative of the way states and cities are treating the issue. If some citizens can break pandemic rules with impunity because they are protesting racism while others can have their right to worship or to go to work taken away by the government because of fears about the spread of disease, that is more than merely a legal conundrum or hypocrisy. It is a sign that big-government liberals view respect for basic constitutional freedoms as dependent on whether they approve of the intent of those seeking to exercise their rights. It’s one thing if supermarkets are allowed to stay open while churches or synagogues are not. It’s quite another when the right to freely assemble to allege that America is a racist nation is considered more important than upholding the First Amendment rights of other Americans to practice their faith or to express opinions that are not favored by the editors of the New York Times.  There’s no real debate in this country about whether George Floyd’s murderer should be punished. But if coronavirus restrictions don’t apply to the right of one group to assemble — peacefully or not — how can they legally, logically, or morally be imposed on others who want to exercise the same right? They can’t. If states and municipalities are going to turn a blind eye to the way mass gatherings of people with fashionable opinions violate pandemic restrictions, then they must also drop their efforts to prohibit religious services and other constitutionally protected activities. This selective enforcement as well as the seeming inability of our leaders to defend the lives and property of citizens is the death of the rule of law and faith in our democratic institutions. 

If a vaccine is ever developed for COVID-19, it looks like we are going to have one hell of a fight in this country over whether the inoculation should be made mandatory. A New York State Bar Committee just issued a report recommending that the influential legal organization endorse passing laws forcing everyone in the country — unless medically inappropriate — to receive the vaccine regardless of their own desires. From the Law.com story: Citing a robust collection of federal and state case law, a New York State Bar Association task-force group on Thursday said it should be mandatory for all Americans to have a COVID-19 vaccination, when one is available, including those who won’t want it for “religious, philosophical or personal reasons.” . . . Making a legally backed argument on pages 60-63 of a newly released report on the “unique” legal and ethical issues brought forward by the global pandemic, the Health Law Section of the bar association writes that “some Americans may push back on the COVID-19 vaccination for religious, philosophical or personal reasons,” but “for the sake of public health, mandatory vaccinations for COVID-19 should be required in the United States as soon as it is available.” “Mandatory vaccinations are supported by the authority of the state police power when the vaccinations are necessary to protect the health of the community,” the group writes in the report, while citing the 1905 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Jacobson v. Massachusetts. I wish I could report that the committee’s opinion was a fringe idea. President Trump wants any vaccine to be voluntary. But mandating the vaccine seems to be gaining significant establishment traction.  Alan Dershowitz also supports such an authoritarian move, on the basis of Jacobson. (The case is not nearly as sweeping as some suggest, involving the city of Cambridge and smallpox — which had a 30 percent mortality rate for adults and 80 percent for children!)  Joe Biden’s chief health-care adviser — and potential secretary of health and human services — has not taken a position on this issue of which I am aware. But it is easy to predict his likely take. He has opined that all children should be required by law to receive a flu shot every year (also citing Jacobson) and that everyone should be forced now to wear a mask. Other notable bioethicists have similarly argued that we should be forced to use a contact-tracing phone app and receive a COVID jab. This idea seems unprecedented. There is no law requiring all adults to be vaccinated against any disease. And even a health emergency does not just allow the government to enact any law it wants. Laws have to be reasonable. I think that courts would be loath to force 330 million people to be vaccinated when we know that those at most risk are the frail elderly and those with comorbidities, people we can protect with proper distancing and hygiene practices, not to mention the vaccine if one is developed.  Moreover, is it reasonable to force everyone in Montana or South Dakota — where the damage from the illness has been low — to receive a vaccination because New York and New Jersey suffered a catastrophe (in part, because their governors forced nursing homes to accept infected patients)? I doubt the people in those states would think so. Technocrats sure do love their mandates. If the vaccine comes, I have little doubt that powerful forces will work very hard to make it mandatory, creating another issue perfectly positioned to tear us apart.  

Anonymous members of New Jersey’s Pandemic Response Team have sent a letter to state lawmakers to inform them that Governor Phil Murphy and Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli have ignored expert advice in dealing with coronavirus, especially in handling the state’s nursing homes. In the letter, which was leaked to NJ Advance Media, the whistleblowers allege that Murphy’s administration has refused to consult the science to make policy decisions, and is instead “making things up as they proceed, or making decisions and justifying them on the back end.” Murphy has decided “to open several aspects of the economy without the data to back it up,” the health officials state.  They also claim that Persichilli and “members of the Governor’s cabinet” ignored their warnings about protecting the state’s vulnerable population in nursing homes with widespread testing. “To completely ignore long-term care testing until late April, when at that point, tens of thousands of tests had been offered to only mildly symptomatic New Jersey residents (again, remember that one has to be well enough to drive or be in a car to get the test at these centers), is a clear failure,” they write. The letter slams the administration’s directive for nursing homes to allow Covid patients to return regardless of whether they were still infectious, saying the decision-making ultimately led to “preventable deaths.”  “Very few of these nursing homes were tangibly ready to take these residents back based on the Commissioner’s criteria because the state failed to allocate enough PPE and staffing resources to them to do so,” they explained.  Nearly 6,000 residents of New Jersey facilities died from the virus — nearly half of the state’s coronavirus deaths. The situation mirrors that of New York, where Governor Andrew Cuomo has been criticized for a similar policy. Murphy responded to news of the letter by saying he had “no time for that.” The New Jersey Ethics Commission has opened an investigation into leaks after documents were leaked to NJ Advance Media showing that nursing homes had shortages of personal protective equipment.

A boy in my neighborhood committed suicide a few weeks ago. It’s possible that the teen’s preexisting problems were exacerbated by the seclusion, tediousness, and helplessness of a national lockdown. Maybe not. I didn’t really know him. I do know that locals were forced to pay respects by sitting parked cars in the local Catholic church’s parking lot. Friends of the devastated family couldn’t hug the aggrieved parents. They couldn’t enter the church and pray together for their community. Scenes like this play out across the country.  At first, most Americans self-quarantined without being forced because, in large part, we’re a conscientious people and the argument for flattening the curve was a rational one. Soon, however, we were being told that wandering into the non-essential part of a local grocery store to buy vegetable seeds put every American life in mortal danger. Irrational and platitudinous arguments — “If we can save one life, we should!” — began making an appearance. Next we were being forced to comply with the diktats of mayors and governors. No legislatures. No votes. No questions. Those who spoke up were stifled by social media or smeared by normal media as a death cult — even as virtually every prediction offered by alleged experts and journalists about the consequences of reopening turned out to be wrong. I’ve yet to hear a coherent explanation as to why a governor can act like a dictator over 100,000 deaths, but not 60,000 or 30,000 or 5,000?  Last week, the media, politicians, and many experts decided that every argument they made for destroying the lives of millions of people in America could be deferred to advance a preferred political cause. It is worth remembering that the same people who now claim that clearing out Lafayette Park is tantamount to the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre were championing the closing down of churches across the entire country only a week ago. Not a single governor or mayor has tried to shut down protests themselves, even though BLM marchers are breaking the very edicts they signed. Nay, many of these officials march themselves, and invite others to participate. The despicable mayor of New York who threatened to sic the police on a dozen peaceful Yeshiva students only a couple of weeks ago now invites people to march by thousands.  Indeed, the same politicians who destroyed your business and livelihood — and the pundits and reporters who called you murderers for wanting to save it — are now making value judgments on when and where you should be allowed to practice your freedoms. By fiat, they decide who has rights based on skin color or ideology, and who is not worthy of them. It is a massive scandal.  

Willingly, most nations in the West entered into a kind of voluntary home imprisonment in March. The term for it was “lockdown.” Normally a lockdown is used to end a prison riot. But in this global pandemic, the Western world is going through the reverse process. Mass protests against American police brutality and racism have erupted in Dublin, London, and Paris. London and Paris have already seen riotous scenes. Downing Street is being trashed in daylight as I write. This is happening despite social-distancing guidelines and lockdown measures that are stricter and more punitively enforced than those in the United States. Boris Johnson’s government has reaffirmed the right to protest, while cautioning that protesters must still adhere to the pandemic-control guidelines, which limit public group gatherings to six people. In Ireland, such gatherings are legally limited to four people. Yet thousands-strong crowds persist in both cities.  The spectacle would be hard to put into a novel: Huge throngs of protesters chanting “I can’t breathe” during a global pandemic that targets the human respiratory system. It’s not enough to say that American politics have gone global. Just as an astonishing amount of entertainment media from America is pumped abroad, an astounding amount of foreign news media is little more than rewrites of American media. But that doesn’t explain the global protests and riots. The first thing to note is the mind-bending surreality of it all. After months of hysterical denunciations of beachgoers, parkgoers, churchgoers, and conservative protesters, suddenly governors and even epidemiologists are endorsing mass gatherings that go against the current strictures they imposed on the rest of us. The strictures, which prohibited not just normal business but also weddings and funerals, are dismissed as merely the denial of a hairdresser appointment. Want to hold an Orthodox Jewish prayer service in Brooklyn? Mayor Bill de Blasio will bring the police crashing down on you. But his own daughter is out there at the much larger George Floyd protests.   The second and perhaps more important thing to note is that it’s now abundantly clear the lockdowns created a giant social vacuum. Many people trapped in this vacuum are suffering. Anecdotally, my EMT friends in New York say they are responding to many more times the calls for suicide and overdoses now than for COVID-19. But our streets suffer from the social vacuum as well. 
 Left-wing writers belittled lockdown protesters in Marxoid terms: as tyrannical agents of capital demanding personal service from the working class. But in fact it is not so easy to distinguish what these writers take as vulgar commercial behavior from healthy social behavior. Meeting friends and family for dinners or cookouts is a social activity that has commercial implications. Ditto talking to shopkeepers, deli workers, or your hairdresser. Many schools are also commercial enterprises of a sort. Taking engagement photos on Fifth Avenue near Rockefeller Center is a form of commercialized personal service; it’s also a touchstone moment in the lives of the two principals. Our social behavior endows these spaces with a kind of grace.  And the absence of this grace turns out to be an absence of protection. Social behavior is a kind of prophylactic against anti-social behavior like rioting and arson. A closed business doesn’t just lose the security guards who protect it by day, but the shoppers, clerks, and passersby whose presences also protect our streets.  Social-distancing regimens have made our cities empty of the behavior that redeems their occasional ugliness and sometimes oppressive scale. Cities have been emptied of many of their most conscientious citizens — the folks who, just by going about their business, were a defense against anarchy.  As a matter of justice, the rioting must be ended. As a matter of fairness and equality before the law, the mass protests must also be ended in the name of public health — or else the lockdowns on our schools, camps, weddings, funerals, civic organizations, and businesses need to be lifted too. 

• At least the rioters are wearing masks. • One of the little hot-air speech balloons released during the George Floyd riots compares them to the Boston Tea Party. The United States began in riots, what’s the matter with these? As it happens, the Declaration of Independence addresses this question, briefly but thoroughly (Jefferson at his best was a poetical aphorist). Prudence dictates that revolutions should not happen for reasons that are light or passing, since people put up with a lot. But when government shows a design to crush them under absolute despotism, they should throw it off, forming a new one that will serve their happiness and security. Good manners also require them to tell the world why. If you think that is what is going on in smashing windows, cleaning out stores, burning cop cars and random buildings, and mugging passersby who disagree with you, you do not understand the patriots you claim to emulate, and are a good deal less serious.  • MISSING: Social Distancing. DESCRIPTION: Not much to see, especially in stadiums, theaters, restaurants, bars, shops, office buildings, and houses of worship. Small numbers of people sometimes visible, six feet apart and masked, in grocery stores and walking the occasional beach. LAST SEEN: May 25, the day of the death of George Floyd. Since then, Social Distancing has been replaced by protests and riots, in which crowds of people, masked and otherwise, march, kneel, sing, chant, set fire to police precincts, and loot stores, accompanied by smaller but still large crowds of police and National Guardsmen. If found, please return Social Distancing to Dr. Anthony Fauci.  • There were many victims of the lawlessness that consumed the nation following George Floyd’s death. Two of those victims were sacred landmarks of American Christianity. Both St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York and St. John’s Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C., were desecrated by rioters in the heat of ostensibly anti-racist protests. Vandals defaced the New York cathedral with profanity-ridden graffiti and nearly burned the parish house of the historic St. John’s — a church visited by every sitting president from Madison onward — to the ground. All ought to be outraged by Floyd’s death, but none ought to withhold their contempt from those, no matter their motives, who attack our sacred landmarks. • At the conclusion of a rally in support of the Second Amendment outside the Kentucky State Capitol in Frankfort, a man hung a crude dummy from a tree, with the face of Democratic governor Andy Beshear and the motto Sic semper tyrannis attached. Kentucky has seen worse: In 1900, Governor-elect William Goebel was assassinated, possibly with the connivance of his predecessor in office, William S. Taylor. Goebel himself had shot a political opponent in the head a few years earlier. This year’s story had a better ending. A rally-goer quickly cut the effigy down, saying, “This has no place at this rally. We’re trying to be peaceful.” We don’t mind political partisans “targeting” or “firing broadsides at” each other; “campaign” is itself originally a military term. We prefer dead metaphors to dead politicians, and effigies blur the two categories too much.   • Oregon Republicans chose Jo Rae Perkins as the GOP nominee for U.S. Senate. The state party says it will support her candidacy notwithstanding her associations with, and support for, the “QAnon” movement. That’s a mistake. QAnon is a conspiracy theory that posits the existence of a sinister cabal of cannibalistic pedophiles led by Democrats and elite business figures, which the Trump administration and possibly Robert Mueller are heroically trying to combat. It has attracted tens of thousands of adherents and crossed that fateful threshold past which absence of evidence for a claim becomes proof of a coverup. On the night of the GOP primary, Perkins uploaded a video to Twitter in which she held up a sticker bearing a QAnon slogan and said, “I stand with Q and the team. Thank you Anons, and thank you patriots. And together, we can save our republic.” Her campaign removed the video; now she says she regrets the removal. She is an unreconstructed exponent of a batty and corrosive conspiracy theory running a longshot campaign that does not deserve conservative support. • Conservatives for a long time gave Representative Steve King (R., Iowa) the benefit of the doubt as he made racially provocative comments, and especially discounted those critics who treated his opposition to immigration as per se racist. But the congressman kept chipping away at the doubt. He called Mexicans coming to the U.S. “dirt,” denied it, and then was shown to have said it on tape. He endorsed a mayoral candidate — in Toronto — who had recited the white supremacists’ 14-word motto on the radio. He hobnobbed with a budding Alt-Right Internationale in Europe. These antics got him censured by Congress, repudiated by his party, and — finally, in a June 2 primary — defeated for reelection. Randy Feenstra, the mainstream conservative who won, should not find it hard to do a better job of advancing the priorities of the fourth district of Iowa.  • Groping for adequate responses to the violence on the streets and the insurrectionists behind it, President Trump announced that he would “designate” Antifa, the loosely knit interstate anarchist group, as a terrorist organization. That this was either a misunderstanding of law or a confusing use of the word “designate” became clear when, simultaneously, Attorney General Barr announced that the Justice Department regards the tactics of Antifa and similar radical groups as domestic terrorism and will prosecute them accordingly. There is no legal-designation process for domestic terrorism. We have a process for designating foreign terrorists, a process created in the mid Nineties to enable the federal government to freeze assets, bar aliens who’ve attended jihadist training camps from entering the U.S., and so on. There is no such necessity where domestic terrorists are concerned because they operate within our jurisdiction, and a wide array of laws, federal and state, enable our agencies to investigate and prosecute them, seize their assets, and interrupt their operations. Still, to the extent “designation” is simply the administration’s rhetorical device for announcing its intention and resolve to treat criminal conspiracies as such, it is a welcome development, and needs to be followed up with action.   • Joe Biden says that he will not raise taxes on households making less than $400,000. Like similar pledges from previous Democratic presidential candidates, this one should be received skeptically. Bill Clinton raised gas taxes, Barack Obama imposed the individual mandate, and Biden himself has endorsed a carbon tax. But these pledges have nonetheless acted as constraints. Clinton and Obama didn’t try to raise income or payroll taxes except on the rich — and the definition of the rich has kept shrinking as the Democratic base has gotten more upscale. Congress has not raised taxes on wages since 1993. Biden’s pledge reflects a political reality with which Democratic legislators also have to contend, and that political reality is a major accomplishment of two generations of conservatives.  • Congress enacted the Paycheck Protection Program to help small businesses, especially, through the coronavirus pandemic by giving them forgivable loans. But some red tape added by Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin is constricting it. His rule says that 75 percent of the forgiven loan has to be spent on payroll. Never mind that many businesses have fixed costs, including rent and utilities, that they have to pay if they are going to stay alive to employ anyone. The House has voted 417–1 to relax this rule. But it would be quicker, and more economically productive, if Mnuchin simply complied with the law as written. • When Congress created this program, Planned Parenthood complained that it had been designed to make them ineligible. But then more than three dozen of its affiliates applied for the loans anyway. They received a total of $80 million. Once this news became public knowledge, Planned Parenthood argued that they had been eligible. Two dozen Republican senators are calling for a swift federal investigation of what seems by all accounts to have been loan fraud. We can’t expect an organization that confuses abortion and health care to be sticklers about “eligibility.”  • To listen to the media just a few weeks ago was to hear that Republican governors who sought to reopen their states were endangering the lives of their constituents to save Big Business. A headline in The Atlantic that spoke of “Georgia’s Experiment in Human Sacrifice” was as hysterical as the article it adorned. (“Georgians are now the largely unwilling canaries in an invisible coal mine, sent to find out just how many individuals need to lose their job or their life for a state to work through a plague.”) Never mind that such talk has abated just as dense crowds of hundreds of thousands of people protest in cities. Never mind, too, that nearly all states have been easing restrictions, not just the Republican-governed ones. In most states (including Georgia) the COVID-19 new-case count has plateaued, and in nearly all states (including Georgia) the ratio of positive cases to tests has steadily declined. We should not ignore the possibility of a second wave, but nobody is trying to bring one about, or succeeding. • Instead of simply saying, “I was wrong,” many of those who predicted that the State of Florida was destined to become ground zero for the American coronavirus outbreak have decided to invent absurd conspiracies to cover their tracks. It cannot possibly have been the case that Governor DeSantis got it right, or that he was not, in fact, eager to see his constituents die. Instead, he must be hiding something: bodies, data, nursing-home records, you name it. Thus far, Florida has been accused of having fired a data scientist because she objected to the suppression of data (she wasn’t a data scientist, nothing was suppressed, and she was fired for insubordination and sexual harassment); of having inflated its pneumonia numbers to hide the proximate cause of death (it didn’t, the critics misread the CDC’s numbers); and of flat-out lying about the numbers to make the state look better (in the six weeks since it was first suggested, no evidence of this has come to light). “Follow the science,” cried the most fervent advocates of the lockdowns. Unless, it seems, the science leads south. • Our friend and sometime contributor Kevin Hassett, now the special adviser to the president for economic issues, is quite capable of looking after himself, but we still feel obliged to defend him against one of the silliest charges he has ever had to endure. Hassett told CNN that with quarantine regulations being rolled back, “our human-capital stock is ready to get back to work,” and from the Left’s reaction, you would have thought he had called for a return to serfdom. One critic called the phrase “absurd and heartless”; another said it was “a racially charged, dehumanizing turn of phrase that conjured up images of livestock.” Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (who has referred to “human capital” herself at least once) said the phrase “had its roots in slavery.” For the record, “human capital” and “human-capital stock” are standard terms in economics, and in any case, there’s no reason either one should be more offensive than the ubiquitous and universally accepted “human resources” (which used to be “personnel,” until that was deemed unacceptable for some reason). The only conclusion we can draw from all this is that to a committed leftist, any phrase that includes the word “capital” is automatically offensive.  • The University of California has since 1996 been barred by popular referendum from discriminating among applicants on the basis of race. That prohibition has inhibited administrators from achieving the racial balance they desire. While standardized tests are good at predicting success in college, they do not further the racial goal. It is in this light that we view the university system’s decision to junk the tests. John Perez, the UC Board of Regents chair, described the decision as “an incredible step in the right direction toward aligning our admissions policy with the broad-based values of the University.” We suspect the value in question consists of racial preferences. • The Department of Education’s restoration of basic due process to the federal Title IX rules passed its first test in court. Three Third Circuit judges, a mix of Trump and Obama appointees, unanimously held that if a private university vows in its contract that students accused of sexual misconduct will receive “fair” and “equitable” treatment, it must at the very least hold a “real, live, and adversarial hearing” and provide “the opportunity for the accused student or his or her representative to cross-examine witnesses — including his or her accusers.” The court accepted that there are some questions that are “uniquely” the province of a university, but rejected the idea that the “investigation and fair adjudication of alleged criminal activity like sexual assault” is among them. Since DeVos announced the implementation of her changes, the Democratic Party has treated the move as a radical departure from American norms. As the Third Circuit showed, the truth is quite the opposite. • DeVos’s department also decided that the State of Connecticut’s athletic association violated Title IX in allowing male high-school athletes to participate in girls’ sports. The Office of Civil Rights wrote that allowing athletes to compete according to “gender identity” alone “denied female student-athletes benefits and opportunities, including advancing to the finals in events, higher level competitions, awards, medals, recognition, and the possibility of greater visibility to colleges and other benefits.” Connecticut must now bring its policy in compliance with the department’s findings. A related lawsuit, waged by three of the female athletes, is separate and ongoing — as women’s sports should also be. • China’s National People’s Congress has imposed a national-security law on Hong Kong banning “all seditious activity.” The security law effectively nullifies the Hong Kong Basic Law, according to which the territory is guaranteed autonomy from the mainland until 2047, and flatly violates Beijing’s obligations under the 1984 Sino–British Joint Declaration. In response, U.S. secretary of state Mike Pompeo decertified Hong Kong’s status as an independent region of China. Trump followed up Pompeo’s announcement by stating that he would “begin the process of eliminating policy exemptions that give Hong Kong different and special treatment” — including its preferential trade status, visa exemptions, and flexible foreign-exchange regime. While the move will harm Hong Kong’s economy, the millions of Hong Kongers who have taken to the streets in protest have demonstrated in no uncertain terms that they value freedom over GDP growth. The short-term harms from reduced trade and investment pale in comparison with the disaster of mainland dominance of Hong Kong. That being said, the White House neglected to specify the exact measures it would take, despite announcing the decertification a week after China proposed the new law. Too often, Trump’s bluster on China amounts to precious little in the policy realm. One hopes this time is different. • Trump also announced that Washington would sever ties to the World Health Organization. When the White House halted funding to the WHO in May, pending an investigation of Chinese influence on the agency, we considered it a salutary push for reform. Under the leadership of director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the organization misled the world about the coronavirus at Beijing’s behest. But a month after halting funding, the White House gave the WHO 30 days to commit to reforms. Predictably, it didn’t. While the withdrawal may be warranted, the White House risks unilateral disarmament against Beijing’s effort to expand its influence over multilateral institutions.  • President Trump has blown hot and cold about canceling his trade agreement with China. And after Trump condemned China’s repression of Hong Kong, Beijing suspended its state-owned firms’ promised purchases of U.S. agricultural products. Trump is left without good choices. Either he makes good on the threats of additional tariffs that he had made before the deal, hurting the stock market and the economy in the run-up to the election, or he accepts a deal that looks more and more like a sham. It is getting late to try a different path — coordinating an international campaign against Chinese mercantilism — but it is not too late. • The Chinese government has been mounting aggressive shows of strength to its neighbors, and it is now India’s turn to come under threat and make what it can of this. The two countries have a common border several thousand miles long. Territorial claims and counter-claims on either side have led to a so-called Line of Actual Control, which in plain language means no agreed demarcation and a permanent reason to go to battle. The People’s Liberation Army reinforced their presence with three heavily armed brigades and India then posted comparable forces. Army chief of staff General Manoj Mukund Naravane followed with a firm defensive statement. By accident or design, the rival soldiers met at several points and started fistfights and brawls. They used wooden clubs and rocks. The wounded were helicoptered away. The U.S. should help make it clear that if it comes to worse, China will have miscalculated badly. • Russia belonged to the G-8. In 2014, however, it invaded a sovereign country, Ukraine, and launched a war there, resulting in a G-7. The facts behind Russia’s suspension have not changed: Crimea remains a Russian possession; war grinds on in the Donbass, where approximately 11,000 people have been killed. President Trump has long pressed for Russia’s readmission to the group, with no changes on the ground. He has done it again, signaling that he will invite Vladimir Putin to a group meeting in the United States this coming September. He should be welcomed, so long as he leaves Ukraine first. • “Let’s light this candle,” said Doug Hurley. “The trampoline is working!” said Elon Musk. Hurley is one of the two astronauts who have just been launched to the International Space Station. (The other is Bob Behnken.) Hurley was echoing the words of Alan Shepard, the first American in space, in 1961. Musk is the founder and CEO of SpaceX, the company that cooperated with NASA to light and launch the latest “candle.” What did he mean by the trampoline remark? For a few years, Americans rode on Russian spacecraft to the ISS. In 2014, however, the United States sanctioned Russia over that country’s aggression against Ukraine. The deputy prime minister, Dmitry Rogozin — who is now the head of the Russian space agency — cracked that, henceforth, America could get its astronauts to the ISS by trampoline. And the “trampoline,” as Musk noted, worked. All in all, the launch on May 30 was thrilling: a shot in the arm for a country that needed one. • Major League Baseball remains on hold. Owners and players are locked in a salary dispute. MLB has proposed a shortened, 82-game season along with several measures to mitigate the risk of spreading the coronavirus. Each team would play half its games in its home ballpark but without spectators. The loss of revenue from concessions and ticket sales would be significant. Owners have offered player compensation in the form of half of revenue. The union is holding out for proration, so that players would be paid approximately half the salary stipulated in their contracts. The fans’ interest is in a compromise: While some of them take sides in the rivalry between billionaires and millionaires, most prefer the one between their home team and whichever MLB franchise figures as the Evil Empire in their local lore. • The ATP and the WTA — the men’s and women’s professional tennis tours, respectively — have been suspended since March because of the COVID-19 pandemic and are not scheduled to return until at least August. While tennis stars such as Novak Djokovic have taken the initiative in creating a relief fund for financially challenged players, not every top-ranked athlete shares the same willingness to contribute. Dominic Thiem, the male world No. 3 from Austria, came out early against the fund: “No tennis player is fighting to survive, even those who are much lower-ranked. No tennis player is going to starve. . . . I would rather give money to people or organizations that really need it.” Unsurprisingly, Mr. Thiem faced an almost immediate backlash, as tennis personalities ranging from Nick Kyrgios to Dustin Brown censured his “tone-deaf” remarks. As is often the case, “tone-deaf” in this instance means distressingly true.  • Troubled in life, Norma McCorvey is having an unsettled afterlife. The Jane Roe of Roe v. Wade famously became a pro-life Catholic in her last decades. A new documentary suggests that it was all an act: McCorvey said on camera that she had no problem with anyone’s decision to abort, that pro-lifers had used her and that she had used them for money. Pro-lifers who knew McCorvey said, however, that she expressed opposition to abortion right to the end. Our conclusions: We cannot treat McCorvey as a reliable narrator, even of her own views; and the pro-life movement is rooted in the sound conviction that unborn children have a right to life, regardless of what anyone thinks about them. • “Yeah, he is kind of a miserable guy,” Wally says to his little brother Beaver, who has just declared his hatred for Eddie Haskell. “You know, I wouldn’t like him at all if he wasn’t my best friend.” The scriptwriters wrote Wally’s oleaginous pal into an early episode of Leave It to Beaver and hired child actor Ken Osmond for the part. He clicked and was invited back. For seven golden years in the late 1950s and early ’60s, Eddie Haskell slinked across the TV screens of America, chewing gum, picking on Beaver, planning mischief, evading the consequences (while Wally landed in trouble), and then toadying to their parents, with a knowing smirk that the elders never quite caught on to, though you the viewer did: “That’s a lovely dress you’re wearing, Mrs. Cleaver.” Osmond portrayed the character too well not to be typecast after the show ended. His acting career narrowed. In 1970, newly married, he joined the Los Angeles Police Department. He did a little TV again in the 1980s, but it was never the same. “I’m not complaining,” he said in 2008. “Eddie’s been too good to me.” Dead at 76. R.I.P. • The ink on his diploma from Southern Methodist University was still moist when Sam Johnson flew to Korea. There he served as a U.S. Air Force pilot on 62 combat missions. In 1966, on his 25th mission in Vietnam, he was shot down and captured. His arm and back were broken. For more than six years he was repeatedly tortured as a prisoner of war at the Hanoi Hilton, where he shared a cell with John McCain. Johnson called the homecoming parade for him in Plano, Texas, “one of my most treasured memories, encapsulating all that I love about America.” He entered politics and was in his fourth term in the Texas legislature when he won a special election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1991. In his 28-year career in Congress, he fought for tax reform and against pork-barrel spending. He belonged to the Republican Study Committee and helped found its precursor, established to make House Republicans a force for conservatism. In 2015, he defended McCain against Donald Trump’s disparagement of the senator and war hero. “We seldom agreed on anything,” said Representative Lloyd Doggett, a liberal Democrat, remembering Johnson. “I had immense respect for him.” Sam Johnson, patriot, dead at 89. R.I.P. • Richard Gilder was a billionaire benefactor of conservative politics, New York City, and American history. He was a founder of the Club for Growth, which has backed pro-free-market candidates for decades, and of the Manhattan Institute, which inspired the reformist urbanism of Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg. His beloved hometown wears his largesse in the restored beauty of Central Park, the revitalization of the New-York Historical Society, and major-league donations to the Museum of Natural History. Most important for the country was his devotion to its past. The Gilder Lehrman Institute, founded with his friend Lewis Lehrman, has amassed a world-class collection of documents, and provides instruction in the form of seminars and teaching materials to tens of thousands of middle- and high-school teachers and students. Young people who know better than Howard Zinn probably know it thanks to Dick Gilder. Dead at 87. R.I.P. Doing evil in the service of a just cause does not change either side of the moral equation: Evil remains evil, and the just cause remains just — neither consideration cancels out the other or transmutes it. When riots and violence convulsed American cities after the horrifying death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police, that principle bore particular consideration. Protests are a normal and healthy part of democracy. Looting and arson are not. What is particularly vexing here is that the looting and arson have taken place while the gears of justice have been turning — the police officers in question were dismissed and the principal malefactor charged with third-degree murder. Things have not moved as quickly as many would have liked, but this has been a matter of days, not weeks or months, and it is good that matters of this gravity are not approached in a panic with excessive haste, which is more likely to lead to injustice than to swift justice. Also, quite often snippets of video can be misleading, which is why it’s important to carefully review all the facts, even in a case that seems as clear-cut as this one.  The riots have only layered another injustice on top of the one done to George Floyd. Police officers have been killed or assaulted, looters and protesters killed or injured, and much property destroyed — including the property of many black-owned businesses at the heart of the very communities whose interests the protesters purport to represent. The moment has called for calm and leadership, but President Trump, finding himself in possession of both rhetorical gasoline and a raging fire, apparently couldn’t help making things worse. Early on, he tweeted, “When the looting starts, the shooting starts,” a phrase associated with some of the worst figures of the 1960s, George Wallace prominent among them. Later, after brief remarks in the Rose Garden on the unrest, he walked across the street to historic St. John’s Church. He understandably wanted to show the flag after the church had been set on fire the night before. But protesters had to be cleared out of his way, in a petty and foolish use of government authority, and he didn’t make any remarks or meaningful gestures at the church, merely waving around a Bible. Trump has talked of “dominating” the streets, an inflammatory way to put a basic and important point: In such a situation, restoring order has to be the first priority. The dynamic of riots is always that if the police don’t show up, if they hold back, or worse, if they retreat, the disorder gets more intense and destructive. Violence must be met with overwhelming (and, obviously, lawful) force. Authorities in Minnesota finally figured this out after a couple of nights of letting things spin out of control and implausibly blaming outside agitators for the mayhem. As Minneapolis calmed down, parts of New York City were sacked by marauding bands, in a disgraceful failure of municipal governance.  It’s certainly true that Antifa extremists have taken a hand in the destruction around the country (and sometimes been rebuked by black protesters opposed to their tactics), but there are plenty of others who have been breaking things and looting who clearly are local residents and not members of any ideological splinter groups. Regardless of the argument over who is most responsible for the riots, state and municipal authorities must resolve to keep the peace, with the assistance of the National Guard as warranted. Trump has talked of invoking the Insurrection Act to call out federal troops, something that he has the authority to do in theory, but would be impractical without the cooperation of state and local officials that he’s unlikely to get. As for the matter underlying all the protest and chaos: Police work involves violence, and there is no getting around that. Americans have for a long time understood this and made allowances for it, which is why a questionable police shooting is investigated differently from a questionable shooting that doesn’t involve the police. But it is worth exploring the protections bad cops get from union rules, and the level of deference that prosecutors afford the police in questionable cases, among other things. It’s not true that the police are a racist, occupying force in American cities (last year, according to a Washington Post database, nine unarmed black people were shot and killed by the police and 19 unarmed white people), but we have to be cognizant of the fact that they have lost the confidence of many of the communities they serve. At the heart of the protests is the sense that the necessity of such reform is felt with an urgency in black America while white America thinks of it as a kind of desirable abstraction. But the burning and stealing will not only leave vulnerable communities worse off in material terms — they will leave these communities worse off in political terms, too, as well-intentioned Americans understandably recoil from the violence and disorder. Protests can be heard, but violence can only be suppressed. It is notable that the police action leading to the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis has not in itself produced a polarizing national disagreement: In fact, there has been broad agreement — broadly shared horror — across the political spectrum, because Americans are a generally decent and fair-minded people who are perfectly capable of understanding what they see with their own eyes, in this case a fellow American who died an unjust death at the hands of American police. We see the injustice in this just as we see the injustice of a small-business owner being ruined by directionless malice and opportunism, because we understand ourselves as a single people and a single national community, an understanding that strengthens the cause of justice. American political rhetoric can be pretty high-flown at times, but here we might dwell on the imperfectly realized principle that we are all in this together, and must act like it. Whether social media have been good or bad for society is an open question. Whether social media have been good or bad for President Trump isn’t as difficult to discern. For even the most sober-minded and introspective figures, Twitter can serve as a dangerous temptation. For a man as capricious and mercurial as our 45th president, it is an irresistible invitation to say things unworthy of his office. It is said that President Lincoln would place letters written in anger in a locked drawer so that he could decide the next morning whether the opprobrium he had meted out was deserved. President Trump, by unhappy contrast, does not so much as wait to spell-check his missives. This habit has now hit its nadir, with his ongoing series of disgraceful tweets insinuating that MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough murdered a young woman working in one of his Florida offices when he was a congressman two decades ago. As is often the case with this president, Trump’s follies have ignited a series of counter-follies that have made the situation even worse. In an attempt to mollify its critics without setting a precedent for expulsion that it may come eventually to regret, Twitter announced that it would begin to publicly “fact-check” statements that Trump has made on other topics, and thereby take on a role to which it is in no way suited. In response, Trump rolled out another of his “l’Internet, c’est moi” threats, promising to “strongly regulate” or “close down” any “Social Media Platforms” that “silence conservatives voices.” Which, in turn, prompted Senator Josh Hawley (R., Mo.) to ask why Twitter enjoys a “special subsidy from the federal government while it censors @realDonaldTrump and also Americans who are critical of #ChineseCommunistParty?” Not one of these courses of action is desirable. Twitter is a medium, not a message, and it should decline to inject itself into the middle of America’s political debates. President Trump cannot “close down” social media, and he should not idly threaten to do so. And, pace Senator Hawley, user-driven websites are not being “subsidized” by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects the “provider or user of an interactive computer service” from being treated as the “publisher” of opinions whether or not he has reviewed them. It is Section 230, by way of example, that prevents Joe Scarborough from being able to sue Twitter when one of its members engages in a libel. Section 230 has been maligned lately, but we have yet to see any proposal that would be likely to improve it. Trump’s hastily issued executive order attempting to reinterpret Section 230 is likely to prove toothless and may be unconstitutional. Time was when the obvious response to reprehensible behavior was admonition. The root cause of the mess we are witnessing today is not Twitter’s bias or legislative favoritism, and it is most certainly not that the president lacks the power to suspend the First Amendment. Rather, it is that the president lacks the power to control his own urges. What needs changing is the behavior of the man who sits at the heart of all of our national conversations, both good and ill.  If you enjoyed this article, we have a proposition for you: Join NRPLUS.

The COVID-19 pandemic is the single greatest global peacetime catastrophe that humanity has suffered since the end of the Second World War. Barely months into what promises to be a multiyear disaster, the pandemic has already cost America alone over 100,000 lives, tens of millions of jobs, and trillions of dollars in lost output, income, and wealth. The ultimate toll for the world as a whole from this pandemic — both the direct and the indirect consequences — may still lie beyond imagining.  How did such a terrible calamity befall humanity? This grave question is not only an epidemiological puzzle. It is also a political one. As is increasingly understood in the United States and abroad, the Chinese government and its agents bear a terrible and immediate responsibility for conduct that turned a localized contagion into a global pandemic. But the COVID-19 disaster could not have devastated America and the world as it is now doing if China were still an impoverished, isolated Maoist outpost, with scant global contact, involvement, or influence. The world is suffering a planetary plague because China today is deeply integrated into the world economy, and into the institutions of global governance as well — even though it is ruled by a dictatorship whose values, priorities, and objectives are fundamentally incompatible with those of the liberal international order. It was not by accident or happenstance that China became a major player in the world economy and, more broadly, in the liberal international order that the United States was instrumental in fashioning. That outcome, rather, is largely a result of concerted American policy.  For four decades, the United States has pursued a deliberate and explicit strategy, reaffirmed by innumerable public and private decisions under both Democratic and Republican administrations and Congresses, to “engage China” and enmesh that enormous country in “globalization,” the free world’s great webs of commerce, communications, travel, education, research, and culture.  For many long years, this strategy, though not without critics, was widely regarded as a triumph of American statecraft. For a generation and more, the policy of “engaging” China paid handsome and obvious dividends, both financial and geopolitical. Indeed, the engagement policy appeared to be a monumental win-win. Not only did China turn away from the revolutionary hostility that had characterized its international conduct in the Maoist era, but its outward-oriented economic policies and more pragmatic domestic practices unleashed an extraordinary domestic boom. China’s remarkable economic transformation not only dramatically reduced poverty at home. It also generated prosperity for trading partners around the world. While policymakers accurately assessed the upside for America from engaging China, they missed a whole dimension of downside in the righthand column of the ledger. They gave virtually no consideration to the unintended ramifications of promoting global “interdependence” with an increasingly powerful actor that does not share Western liberal values — that is, indeed, implacably hostile to them. An entire class of hazards inherent in our grand strategy for “managing China” were left, by America’s chief risk officers, priced effectively at zero — even as our “globalization” policies exposed our society, economy, and political system to huge new vulnerabilities at the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.  The coronavirus crisis constitutes a “strategic surprise.” It exposes a horrendous blind spot in our China policy and highlights its unintended consequences. The COVID-19 explosion was a “made in China” export: distinctive handiwork of the CCP. It is quite impossible to imagine such a disaster being authored by an open, accountable polity — for example, Taiwan.  Moreover, horrific as it is, there is no reason to regard this disaster as a once-only black swan. More likely it is a harbinger, a foretaste of perils yet in store. For the CCP is loose in our system, potent and unquarantined. And we have not even begun to assess the risks that America and the world consequently face, much less how to protect against them.  The carnage of the coronavirus crisis casts glaring light not only on CCP malfeasance but also on a long chain of U.S. policy errors and miscalculations. They now subject our own population, our allies, and the entire international community to pandemic devastation of indefinite duration. (More on that particular fiasco later.) But the worldwide COVID-19 plague also casts the past half century of Sino–American relations into a new and much sharper relief — and this makes for painful recounting. What lies plainly exposed today is Washington’s long-standing failure to come to terms with the true nature of its “engagement partner” in Beijing: the Chinese Communist Party. It is that partner — not the CCP’s subject population, not the CCP’s clerks and servants in the Chinese government’s administrative apparatus — that determines the regime’s objectives and priorities, sets its strategy, and commands its movements at home and abroad.  Superficially, both party and state in China are vastly different nowadays from when the monster Mao Zedong was at the helm. The regime no longer revels in upheaval; its conduct at home and abroad is no longer avowedly revolutionary. For nearly two decades the CCP has confuted its own founding precepts by extending party membership to entrepreneurs (known as “capitalists” elsewhere). Indeed, approximately 100 members of each recent annual CCP National People’s Congress were reportedly billionaires (in U.S. dollars, that is, not renminbi). And despite a major reversal of actual economic and other policy reforms, the Chinese government has officially embraced “reform and opening up” (market-based reform of the economy and opening China to trade and investment) for over four decades — ever since Deng Xiaoping issued his bold, world-turning declaration in late 1978.  Unfortunately, trapped in the confines of our own mentality and the limits of our self-referential imaginations, we children of the Enlightenment (or perhaps of postmodernism) have failed to take the proper measure of these admittedly immense Chinese political changes. China’s regime has evolved: It has modernized and ingeniously adapted to changing times. But that does not mean that the control system has liberalized. The maglev from “Cultural Revolution” to “Chinese Dream” does not make stops at Locke Junction or Tocqueville Town, and it has no connections to Planet Davos. China’s great civilization has a long and storied heritage. But it also has an extraordinarily long political tradition of despotic imperial rule, which is in the main a saga of exquisitely perfecting mass tyranny, even when antique premodern technologies were the only instruments available for enforcing such repression. (Though born over 2,000 years before Lenin, Qin Shi Huangdi, the first emperor of a unified Chinese state, might still have taught Vladimir Ilyich a thing or two about the administration of terror and the concentration of unchallenged absolutist state power.)  Thus, trashing Marxism, and the people’s communes, and much of the previous Soviet-style central-planning system as well — as the CCP has done in recent decades — does not in fact set Chinese autocracy adrift. Hardly. The CCP has deep historical muscle memory to draw on as it develops its own updated rendition of “autocracy with Chinese characteristics,” one that harnesses market mechanisms and highly sophisticated networks to strengthen the foundations of the regime — and extend its thrall. Some would argue that we should have known all along that the CCP had never abandoned its claim to totalitarian power, even in the heyday of the Deng Xiaoping–Jiang Zemin era of “reform and opening up.” Beijing’s economic experimentation in the 1980s and 1990s may have warmed the hearts of free-marketers around the globe, but the regime’s tilt toward more-competitive commercial and financial practices was accompanied by a horrific test drive into new uncharted realms of unfreedom: the gruesome one-child policy, history’s most ambitious adventure in population control, which insisted that the CCP, not parents, had the final say over the number of babies in China. The world marveled at China’s export boom and the rapidly growing urban engine that was powering it. What went largely unnoticed was that the peasants streaming to the cities for factory and construction work were in effect illegal aliens in their own land — thanks to the CCP’s heinous hukou system of identity-registration papers. Migrants found outside their designated locality were de facto lawbreakers who could be summarily deported at government whim. And, of course, Deng himself ordered the slaughter of those demanding more political freedoms in Tiananmen Square in 1989. It was then that the CCP started to view Washington as a potentially serious challenge to its rule. For years — some would say decades — warning lights have been flashing that “reform” as we understand the term is over in China and that the CCP policy is turning in a different and, from a Western standpoint, more ominous direction. The CCP is methodically transforming the existing Chinese police state into an even more intrusive and aggressive “surveillance superstate.” Beijing’s “Great Firewall” subjects the populace of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) to best-in-class high-tech censorship and spying. Less compliant ethnic minorities face mass internment, with a million or more historically Muslim Uighurs recently herded into “reeducation” camps. Meanwhile, persecution of the world’s fastest-growing Christian population has become commonplace. With the coming of the regime’s vaunted “social-credit system,” its Great Leap Forward in “techno-tyranny,” artificial intelligence and big data will be used to analyze and evaluate the population’s every detectable action, so that the CCP might envelop every Chinese citizen in a customized and finely tailored mesh of rewards and penalties to bring mass behavior into consonance with the regime’s will.  This great Chinese regression is not the only thing we missed: Washington’s globalists and the globalist archipelago in universities, think tanks, and the media also stubbornly and even willfully ignored what the CCP had to say about us. Beijing identifies us as its main rival and is working tenaciously to neutralize the frightening “American threat.” Xi Jinping didn’t begin this strategy, but he perfected it. His acuity at moving the levers of power in China by ferocious purges of his internal enemies and by rigid enforcement of loyalty to the Communist Party has given him a freer hand to pursue it. According to readily available documents and speeches, Xi has followed a “CCP first” strategy that he claims will lead to the “Chinese dream of national rejuvenation.” If the party is healthy, Xi has said, China has a pathway to rejuvenation — after years of national humiliation at the hands of the West and Japan, China in this “new era” will march to “center stage.” The CCP will lead the country back to a 21st-century version of “Middle Kingdom centrality,” the geopolitical order that the regime regards as the natural way the world is to be structured. Since his ascendance to supreme power in 2012, Xi has announced that he would reshape international institutions to align with the CCP agenda, promote “socialist culture” abroad (exporting to other dictators high-tech authoritarian-control capabilities and an economic model dominated by the state), replace alliances (i.e., the U.S. international system) with a network of strategic partnerships with China at the center (the main motivation behind the One Belt, One Road initiative — Beijing’s scheme for a new, Sino-centric Eurasian political-economic order), build a military that would outpace the U.S. armed forces, and achieve technological dominance. The CCP is far more powerful today than it was in Mao’s time (in no small part thanks to our own doing). Much as it may have mutated, it still hates and fears American power and remains implacably hostile to the ideals and precepts of the liberal Western order. We should have known there would be hell to pay when we let this creature loose in our own house — that is to say, into the edifice of international commercial and financial arrangements and multilateral international institutions that the U.S. and her allies built over the past three generations to ensure prosperity and security in the post-war world. But let it loose in our house we did — not in a fit of absentmindedness, but as a deliberate matter of long-term national strategy. Letting the CCP loose in our house is part and parcel of America’s grand strategy and has been for decades. Until recently, this decision has enjoyed bipartisan support among political leaders and opinion-shapers and in business circles — although proponents of this course of action would never describe it in such terms. Their preferred formulation has been “engagement”: They regard their approach as “opening the PRC,” or “globalizing China,” or helping make China into a “responsible stakeholder” within the international community. Drawing the PRC into the world economy and the post-war multilateral project for transnational governance has been a centerpiece of America’s China policy ever since Washington and Beijing normalized diplomatic relations in 1979. The United States’ modern China policy began with Nixon’s famous Cold War overture to Beijing. Originally, economic engagement was impossible because Mao was alive, and, in any case, setting China as a geopolitical counterweight against Moscow served our national purposes well enough. But with Mao’s death came the end of Beijing’s self-isolation. Beijing opened its economy and adopted a more responsible, supportive stance toward the U.S.-led global order. Thus arose the enticing prospect of economic and geopolitical benefits from a deeper relationship with China. In this calculus, America would not only be safer by bringing China into our fold. We would be richer and therefore more powerful as well. Such thinking still informs our China policy, by the way, even under President Trump, who has accused China of taking “advantage of us like nobody in history,” enacted tariffs, allowed the U.S. military a freer hand to challenge China, and confronted such menacing corporate actors as Huawei. Still, his main interest is in exacting more-favorable terms from our now well-established commercial relationship — no one is filing for economic divorce.  Through tumultuous and dramatically changing geopolitical times, the Washington consensus for economic engagement with China has remained more or less constant. Its rationale is twofold: First, a more globalized China would have incentives to behave more responsibly in a U.S.-led international order; and second, the very process of integration into the global economy would generate domestic pressures in China that would temper and ultimately liberalize Beijing’s authoritarian regime. With the Soviet collapse, the resulting end of the Cold War, and the “end of history” vogue, that second rationale came to enjoy additional emphasis. It was only natural that China would become more like us — or so it seemed to a great many of America’s deciders and explainers. Thus, President Clinton in 2000: By joining the WTO [World Trade Organization], China is not simply agreeing to import more of our products. It is agreeing to import one of democracy’s most cherished values, economic freedom. The more China liberalizes its economy, the more fully it will liberate the potential of its people. . . . And when individuals have the power, not just to dream, but to realize their dreams, they will demand a greater say. . . . The genie of freedom will not go back into the bottle. So too Hank Paulson, Treasury secretary to George W. Bush, in 2006 explaining why he welcomed “China’s growth and integration into the world economy”: Our economy is . . . a model that others strive to emulate. . . . Greater economic freedom and more widely shared prosperity within a nation can lead to greater freedom in the political system as well. . . Countries that implement market-driven policies which provide their citizens greater economic freedoms find that those citizens also naturally seek a greater stake in their political system. Such quotations, we must emphasize, are not in any sense selective or unrepresentative. Quite the contrary: They precisely capture the reasoning that informed America’s China policy and continues to animate it. This globalist vision, furthermore, was not limited to U.S. policymakers — rather it was broadly affirmed throughout universities, think tanks, and leading business circles, repeated in countless op-eds and studies in the prestige press and leading American intellectual and foreign-policy journals, and ratified abroad in the corridors of enlightened globalism, such as the World Economic Forum, where it was steadily and approvingly echoed and endorsed. To be sure, Washington recognized that Beijing was every bit a great power, animated by great-power ambitions. As Beijing’s economic and military potential surged, Washington, under Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama, shifted from Reagan-era alignment with China against Moscow to “engaging,” “hedging,” and “balancing” against China. But from Deng Xiaoping to Xi Jinping, China’s geostrategic disputes with America — over the South China Sea, Taiwan, Northeast Asia, and the rest — were regarded as manageable. Despite all the inevitable tensions and flashpoints, contentious security issues in the U.S.–Chinese relationship could seemingly be placed in a box. And with strategic competition compartmentalized, economic cooperation between the United States and China could extend out to an ever-expanding horizon, while also finding new avenues for possible international cooperation on “global commons” challenges — such as nuclear proliferation, terrorism, and climate change. (Indeed, great-power competition was thought by some to be anachronistic, given the cosmic nature of these other challenges.) This at least was the essence of the Washington consensus calculation. And so, for four decades, the United States not only acquiesced in but actively facilitated China’s integration into the world economy and the multilateral organizations that administer peace and prosperity in the American-designed global order. Almost immediately after the U.S. recognized China diplomatically in 1979, Washington’s “engagement” commenced. In 1980, Congress granted the PRC most-favored-nation status for trade on an annually renewable basis. That same year, with America’s assent, the PRC was granted membership in the “Bretton Woods” family: the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank group. The PRC joined the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 1986 and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) in 1991 (two years after Tiananmen), once again with American approval. Beijing completed its long march into the international market economy around the turn of the century. In 1999, China joined the new G-20 organization — as a founding member at express invitation from the U.S. Treasury Department. In 2000, Congress authorized permanent “normal trade relations” with China, and PRC membership in the WTO followed in 2001. A parallel “normalizing” of the PRC was taking place in other parts of the formal and informal multilateral apparatus for transnational governance, too: By one estimate, China had already joined 50 international governmental organizations and 1,275 international nongovernmental organizations by the year 2000; in the years since then, China’s reach and influence in this multilateral construct has only grown. Meanwhile, the logic of the Washington consensus on China was often taken to mean that merely getting Beijing to sign on to global treaties was a “win.”  Modern China’s astonishing race to development is unprecedented and unparalleled. It is the most breathtakingly rapid record of economic growth and transformation in history. In 1980, China’s economy was, by some reckonings, smaller than Mexico’s; its merchandise exports were smaller than Norway’s and East Germany’s; its foreign-exchange reserves (excluding gold) ranked behind those of the Philippines and Trinidad. Today, it is the world’s largest goods exporter, has larger foreign-reserve holdings than any other country (with or without gold), and, depending on how we do the calculations, is either the world’s top economy or its second-largest in terms of sheer output. Part of this success story is actually catch-up growth, progress postponed by two generations of war, civil war, and Maoist upheaval. Much of it can be credited to an official shift to decidedly more pragmatic policies and practices, including a variant of the “outward orientation” that spurred material advance throughout so much of the rest of Asia. But Americanpolicy was also absolutely indispensable to modern China’s amazing economic ascent. There is no doubt whatever that China today would be both poorer and weaker if America had withheld the economic sponsorship our “engagement” policy bestowed on Beijing for nearly two generations. America is an unusual, not to say exceptional, country — and our policy of “engaging” China looks to be an exceptional experiment in the annals of international relations. It is (to say the least) a historical aberration for the established hegemon to enable, much less welcome, the rise of a challenger. The norm in power politics is always to contain and weaken would-be claimants to primacy. In earlier great-power contests — Athens versus Sparta, the Western alliance versus the Soviet bloc, even Victorian and Edwardian Britain versus Prussia — such a sustained outreach by the front-runner for cooperation with, and elevation of, the rival would have been utterly unthinkable. From “Nixon to China” through de facto alignment against Moscow under Reagan and George H. W. Bush, U.S. China policy helped dig the grave of the Soviet empire and usher in our “unipolar moment,” which continues to this day. Since the end of the Cold War, Washington and Beijing have had tense standoffs (Tiananmen, the Taiwan Strait showdown of 1996, the Kosovo Chinese-embassy bombing of 1999, the 2001 downing of the U.S. EP-3E intelligence plane, and more). But none of these spun into a Cuban missile crisis. Beijing was no longer in the “wars of national liberation” business, and it did not take up a white-knuckle nuclear-arms race against America where Moscow had left off. World War III — a very real concern for U.S. policymakers in the Nixon-to-China era — had been put on hold, seemingly indefinitely. And Beijing is constrained by its own enmeshment in Washington’s liberal order, at least for now. As for the benefits from integrating into the world economy: Here the U.S. and the international community gained too (though obviously not nearly as much as Beijing, at least in relative terms). A growing China offered new markets for exports of U.S. goods and services. No less important, inexpensive imports from China were boosting our national wealth as well. China was an engine for deflation in a rapidly expanding world economy, and thus a printing press for international profits. Further, China served as a willing, even eager, purchaser of U.S. Treasury securities, helping to underwrite modern America’s perennial current-account imbalance and to finance our federal budget deficit. There were even some glimmers that Beijing might have been getting ready to act like a “responsible stakeholder” in the international community, at least in economic affairs — for example, its stimulus commitment during the world economic crisis of 2008–09, undertaken in coordination with other leading economies, a spending jolt that not only put China back on the growth track but also buffered other economies against the global slump. But this assessment of America’s China strategy is critically incomplete. Like the policy itself, it does not consider a terrible miscalculation — a complete oversight, actually — at the very center of Washington’s policy toward Beijing. While U.S. statesmen paid great attention to how they might constrain and deter Beijing through the economic and multilateral enmeshment they were devising, they apparently devoted almost no consideration to our own potential vulnerabilities from that very same interdependence at the hand of an unreformed and increasingly adversarial CCP. We did not think through what would happen if a powerful force in the world economy and in the global system should happen to be playing by a very different set of rules and with a very different set of objectives from those upheld by Washington, her global allies, and her international friends. But this is exactly where we find ourselves today.  In 1967, in “Asia after Vietnam,” Richard Nixon wrote of the “extraordinary set of opportunities for a U.S. policy which must begin to look beyond Viet Nam.” This riveting treatise is prescient, even prophetic: arguably in the same league as George Kennan’s “Mr. X” essay (though it remains today largely forgotten, given Nixon’s peculiar status as a prophet without honor in his own country). In it, Nixon presents America with a long-range vision for dealing with China, urging U.S. policymakers to guide their course in accordance with two objectives: “containment without isolation” and “dynamic detoxification.” Regardless of its other accomplishments, our China policy has, to our immense peril, stood Nixon on his head. The CCP is no longer isolated — but neither is it contained. Quite the contrary, its reach in the global system extends further than ever before. Even worse, we neglected to draw off the CCP’s poison before we integrated with China economically. The coronavirus pandemic is a case study of the damage that a toxic CCP can wreak in our global system — and this may be only a foretaste of further disasters we may have invited on ourselves. The particulars of the COVID-19 crisis shine a blinding light on the failures of America’s great China gamble. The CCP did not behave as if the coronavirus outbreak were primarily a threat to public health. From the outset it instead treated the contagion mainly as a threat to party legitimacy and power. Epidemiological considerations were secondary: The regime’s first and foremost campaign was political, an assault launched against domestic and international enemies. Enemies were states, organizations, or individuals who demanded transparency about the nature of the new disease and about what the regime knew about it, or who insisted that the regime conform to international public-health and medical best practices for containing and controlling the epidemic. The CCP’s own anti-epidemic tool kit involved lies, coverups, internal censorship, intimidation and persecution of domestic truth-tellers, a global disinformation initiative, and manipulation of an international institution it had succeeded in corrupting at the highest levels, the World Health Organization (WHO). The CCP repertoire also included strategic denial of key medical supplies to Western governments, and explicit threats to smaller states against which it believed it had gained leverage thanks to their dependence on trade with China. Through such actions the CCP bears inescapable responsibility for immeasurably worsening today’s raging global plague. While the timeline of CCP misconduct is by now all too familiar, some points are worth revisiting. The first case of COVID-19 may have come to the attention of Wuhan doctors on December 1, 2019 (although some accounts suggest an even earlier date). Soon thereafter, multiple cases of the strange new illness had presented, and a Wuhan hospital was sending out samples for testing to special laboratories. By the end of December, a Guangzhou-based genomics company informed PRC health officials and doctors in Wuhan that it had determined that the pathogen was a dangerous SARS-like virus. Chinese officials ordered the company to cease further research and to get rid of all specimens of the pathogen. They then shut down the Wuhan seafood market associated with some (but not all) of the new infections and disinfected the entire location, destroying possible evidence and collecting none. On the last day of 2019, PRC Internet police swung into action, suppressing discussion of “Wuhan unknown pneumonia” on Chinese social media and blocking terms such as “Wuhan seafood market” and “SARS variation” from search engines. A now famous Wuhan doctor, the late Li Wenliang, was alarmed enough about the spread of a new “SARS-like virus” to post his concerns on a WeChat group in late December. Chinese public security detained him for spreading “false rumors” — a criminal infraction under the CCP — roughly meaning “telling the truth.” On January 1, 2020, at least seven other Wuhan doctors were reportedly detained and threatened for speaking out. On January 3 the National Health Commission issued a gag order. From January 5 through January 16, the China CDC (Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention) registered no new cases of the rapidly spreading epidemic — even though hospitals in Wuhan and other parts of China were being swamped with patients afflicted with the disease. On January 10, PRC health expert Wang Guangfa declared on official CCTV that the “Wuhan pneumonia” was “under control” and mainly a “mild condition.” Meanwhile, the Wuhan Health Commission insisted that there were no new cases of COVID-19. By this time the first cases had been reported abroad. And the cover-up continued. Four days after Wang assured the world that the virus was under control, Ma Xiaowei, head of the National Health Commission, confidentially alerted health officials through a secure videoconference that the epidemic was “likely to develop into a major public-health event” and that “clustered cases” suggested “human-to-human transmission.” The next day the head of the China CDC emergency center declared on state television that “the risk of human-to-human transmission is low.” Only on January 20 did China finally confirm human transmission officially. The PRC lied about the prevalence of the epidemic in China from the outset and lies about it to this day. According to official PRC numbers, at this writing (June 2, 2020), China has suffered fewer than 85,000 COVID-19 infections and fewer than 5,000 deaths. These low claims — which would imply that China has sustained fewer infections than Peru, fewer deaths than the Netherlands — cannot pass the laugh-out-loud test. They are clearly off by orders of magnitude. It may be that the CCP is not bothering to collect accurate information on the toll of the epidemic at home — or is deliberately preventing its collection. But researchers outside China have come up with vastly higher guesstimates. In March, in the United Kingdom, scientific advisers to Prime Minister Boris Johnson reportedly informed him that the Chinese reports of infections were “downplayed by a factor of 15 to 40 times.” U.S. intelligence likewise reportedly concluded that the Chinese government had drastically understated the spread of the virus. In April, Derek Scissors of the American Enterprise Institute calculated that a plausible figure for COVID-19 infections in China at that juncture might have been around 2.9 million — over 30 times the level Beijing has since admitted to — and his calculations refer only to estimated cases outside Hubei Province. Speedy containment of the epidemic was plainly not a regime priority. Six days passed between Ma’s secret warning to officials about the novel coronavirus and Xi Jinping’s first public pronouncement, on January 20, that the “outbreak must be taken seriously.” In Wuhan, Lunar New Year celebrations continued. And throughout the rest of China, no immediate effort was made to reduce the tremendous upsurge in travel that the Spring Festival always occasions. By January 23, when Beijing imposed a lockdown on Wuhan and other parts of surrounding Hubei Province, millions had already left on holiday, circulating through the rest of China and the world. Apparently, the regime’s concern in imposing travel bans was only domestic contagion, not the spread of the epidemic overseas. The day after travel to and from Wuhan was forbidden within China, Beijing forbade all domestic group tourism within China. While Beijing subjected its own citizens to internal travel restrictions, it criticized President Trump’s January 31 travel restrictions on visitors from China, saying the measures only “create and spread fear.” Historian Niall Ferguson of Stanford University estimates that over 1,300 flights from China and over 380,000 passengers landed in the United States in January 2020: a fateful measure of our current enmeshment. Indifference to the international consequences of the coronavirus also informed a secret operation that Beijing planned in the days after it privately recognized the seriousness of the pandemic risks but before it acknowledged them publicly. Around January 14 or 15, according to a Canadian report, the regime issued urgent worldwide guidance to Chinese consulates and their United Front Work Departments (or UFWD, CCP organs that mobilize like-minded overseas allies to work on Beijing’s behalf) “to prepare for and respond to a pandemic” by securing, on a massive scale, international supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) and other medical equipment. (The broad outlines of this Canadian report were subsequently corroborated by a leaked U.S. Department of Homeland Security paper, according to the Associated Press.) In the six weeks following the alleged UFWD directive, China quietly managed to buy up much of the world’s available stockpiles of such gear as N95 masks. In all, as is now known from China Customs Statistics, the regime procured nearly 2.5 billion pieces of anti-epidemic equipment, including 2 billion masks, at a cost of over $1 billion. This covert scheme temporarily stripped the rest of the world of supplies needed to battle the pandemic and helps explain the otherwise inexplicable shortages other countries faced when their own outbreaks struck. China did later agree to sell back some of this equipment to the international community — but at extortionate prices. According to Jorge Guajardo, a former Mexican ambassador to China, the Chinese markups on resold surgical masks originally procured from Mexico’s own stockpiles ran about 2,000 to 3,000 percent. Beyond profiteering, the CCP’s approach to the pandemic internationally featured both political offensives and coercive diplomacy. America naturally was the target of a high-profile CCP disinformation campaign, with the spokesperson of the Chinese foreign ministry personally insinuating that the coronavirus had been brought to Wuhan by the U.S. military. China is also believed to have spread disinformation anonymously — for example, through text messages warning Americans that Trump was about to lock down the country, and through other memes intended to sow division or panic. But U.S. allies were also victims of official Chinese disinformation; regime mouthpieces implied that the coronavirus originated in Italy, a country hit especially hard by the pandemic. When Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia called for an impartial, transparent international inquiry into the origins of the pandemic, China countered with economic threats. Australia has become highly dependent on the Chinese market, which accounts for nearly a third of its merchandise exports. Beijing cut Australian beef imports, imposed 80 percent tariffs on Australian barley, and raised the specter of punishing tariffs on other products too. Chinese tourism and Chinese students are also important to Australia’s economy — and the Chinese ambassador to Canberra hinted that “ordinary people” in China might boycott Australian tours and schools if the inquiry went ahead. For the CCP, honest investigation of its conduct is taken to be a threat to national security. And then there is the World Health Organization, the international institution whose “primary role is to direct and coordinate international health within the United Nations system.” We can no longer count on the WHO for unbiased expert assessments, advice, and assistance in the COVID-19 crisis, for the CCP succeeded in perverting its leadership. In 2017, China successfully lobbied to promote its candidate, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus of Ethiopia, to director-general of WHO. Unlike all previous WHO chiefs, Tedros is not a medical doctor. He is, however, a thoroughly political creature. A veteran of the Tigray People’s Liberation Front, he rose through Ethiopia’s dictatorship despite a persistent cloud of scandals over him. Tedros’s gut instincts were revealed early in his Geneva posting when he nominated Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe’s president for life, to be a WHO goodwill ambassador. The offer was withdrawn under international outcry. With the eruption of the COVID-19 epidemic, Tedros proved his worth as a willing accomplice to his Chinese sponsors. In the early weeks of the crisis he parroted the CCP’s line and shielded the Chinese regime against international scrutiny, stiff-arming international requests for access to local Chinese evidence and data. Perhaps the most comic moment of his tenure was when, on January 28, in Beijing with Xi, he lavished praise on the regime for its “transparency” in confronting the pandemic. There was more. The assistant director in charge of the WHO–China Joint Mission on COVID-19, Dr. Bruce Aylward, sang the praises of Beijing’s coronavirus response: “If I had COVID-19,” he insisted, “I’d want to be treated in China.” His mission to China to assess the epidemic was packed with PRC personnel, and the report extolled Beijing’s “exceptional” commitment to “collective action in the face of this common threat.” In an internationally televised interview he also clumsily avoided questions about Taiwan’s genuinely exceptional achievements in combating COVID-19. (Beijing relentlessly strives to isolate and ostracize Taiwan, which was expelled from the WHO at its behest, and it is incensed by anything that lends Taiwan legitimacy.) Aylward, a Canadian physician, has repeatedly refused to appear before Canada’s parliament on the coronavirus crisis; eventually Ottawa took the unusual step of voting to summon him, but WHO legal counsel is fighting to keep him from having to testify before his own government. It is impossible to assign a precise figure to the damage the CCP is responsible for in the current crisis. Relying on information available at the time, in March 2020, a team of epidemiologists from the University of Southampton in Britain simulated that the incidence of COVID-19 would have been reduced by 95 percent in China if Beijing had adopted “non-pharmaceutical interventions” (quarantine etc.) three weeks earlier, when the National Health Commission was attempting to suppress any information on the virus. But such a reckoning is both imperfect and incomplete, and it necessarily excludes the enormous social and economic havoc the CCP’s actions — and inactions — set in motion. No cover-up is large enough to hide the truth about the CCP’s role in the global coronavirus disaster. Throughout the drama, the Chinese regime has acted in bad faith. It has treated its purported partners in the international community as hostile powers. In other words, it has behaved exactly as we should have expected from a totalitarian state embedded in a liberal international order, gaming the rules to its own advantage while also harming its enemies to the extent opportunities afford. Embedding the CCP in the global order without prefigurement of potential consequences was a terrible miscalculation in its own right. One of those many consequences, furthermore, was to empower the CCP enormously. Economically and militarily, China is far stronger today than a generation ago, or even a decade ago. We have integrated an unfriendly government run by an unreformed and apparently unreformable political party into our domestic system as well as our global order. There is no reason to think that the COVID-19 disaster will be a once-only result from this great mis-integration. We are exposed to a whole new realm of uncatalogued risks to our well-being and security, entirely outside the military sphere that strategists ordinarily examine. We urgently need to take inventory of these risks. Washington’s national-security policymakers have always focused primarily on external threats to the safety and well-being of the United States — and naturally so. Over the course of our history, most threats to our national security have come from “hard power” deployed against us by hostile states located overseas. The overseas focus of our national-security planning has been reinforced both by our geography — the providence of the two oceans that have long afforded a measure of distance from our adversaries and competitors — and by our national preference for “bringing the fight” to the other guy’s home turf if shots must be fired in anger. There were, of course, exceptions. The Soviet Union funded agents of influence, political parties, and media organs and used disinformation against us, all on our home turf. But the CCP today poses a new and “unconventional” threat to our national security — and one for which established U.S. security doctrine offers virtually no guidance. This is a threat from within, by a hostile regime wielding “soft power” against us, our allies, and the international community. We are as yet almost completely unprepared even to think about this sort of threat, which makes it all the more potentially devastating. Having purposely integrated the CCP into our global system without heed of the unintended problems that could beset us, we are now in the awful position of suddenly realizing we must retrace our every step in the past 40 years of “engagement” with the PRC, with an eye to identifying vulnerabilities that we may have inadvertently inflicted on ourselves — knowing that these risks we are just now recognizing are, for the Chinese regime, opportunities, and ones to which they have already devoted lengthy consideration. It would not be possible to offer a comprehensive survey in this space of these unappreciated vulnerabilities, but we can start by flagging a few of them. i) Vulnerabilities from supply-chain dependence. We already know that the CCP is willing in principle to exploit for political objectives the vulnerabilities that foreign governments suffer because of their dependence on Chinese supply chains. In 2010, to punish Tokyo over an unrelated territorial dispute, Beijing without warning summarily suspended exports to Japan of rare earths, which are essential ingredients in the manufacture of electronics (including cellphones and defense equipment). At that time, China was the dominant global supplier of rare earths. In the intervening years, as China’s role in world trade has increased, the PRC has been allowed to gain a stronger position in other commodities that foreign states depend on as well — and is poised, should the CCP so choose, to threaten the economic or even national security of selected trade partners by withholding a wide range of products. Supply-chain vulnerabilities are a distinct problem within the much larger family of risks attendant to weaponization of trade by the CCP. We focus here only on the threats that importing societies face from CCP-controlled chokepoints, but many other problems for China’s trading partners could and do come from Beijing’s manipulation of commercial relationships for strategic or political advantage (about which more below). As China’s role in the world economy has grown, so has the scope of these problems. In 2019 the U.S. imported about $450 billion in goods directly from China — about a fifth of all merchandise purchased abroad. China is America’s No. 1 source of overseas products — and because of the globalization of commerce, a great part of the merchandise Americans buy from other countries also includes components made in China. But from a chokepoint perspective, most of this trade turnover lacks strategic significance, in the sense that a Chinese embargo of (say) umbrellas would not greatly inconvenience America, and likewise a PRC clampdown on (say) certain auto parts would just leave Detroit calling alternative subcontractors. That would not be the case with information technology, including personal computers, laptops, cellphones, and the like. According to a 2018 study for the United States–China Economic and Security Review Commission, slightly over half the total supply of products for major federal information-technology providers from 2012 through 2017 came from China. Dependence on this scale speaks to the risks only of supply disruption. It does not even begin to account for the risks from the spyware, trapdoors, special chips, and so on that Chinese suppliers routinely place in their products destined for overseas markets. America faces even more-acute vulnerabilities in pharmaceutical and medical products because U.S. firms outsourced most of the manufacture of critical elements in their supply chains to mainland China over the past generation. Yanzhong Huang of the Council on Foreign Relations notes that China now supplies 97 percent of the antibiotics Americans use, 95 percent of ibuprofen, 91 percent of hydrocortisone, 70 percent of acetaminophen, and a very large but as yet indeterminate share of “active pharmaceutical ingredients” (APIs), the basic building blocks in modern medications. China is also our top supplier of medical devices and our second-largest supplier of biologics. Well played, Big Pharma. What could go wrong with any of that? A recent study by Britain’s Henry Jackson Society attempted to quantify the “strategic dependence” on PRC supply chains of the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Australia, and New Zealand (the so-called Five Eyes). The assessment is necessarily somewhat arbitrary but informative nonetheless. It identified eleven industries as “critical” today (such as communications and energy) and nine others as vital for the future (such as quantum technology and synthetic biology). It determined that the Five Eyes countries imported almost 6,000 categories of goods from China in these sectors. “Dependence” was defined as the state of being a net importer. The study flagged over 400 categories of goods for which America was said to be “strategically dependent” on China — over a quarter of all categories of strategically important imports in the U.S. For Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, the degree of strategic dependence was found to be even higher. In April, the government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe committed over $2 billion to support relocation of Japanese manufactures out of China, to protect Japan against both inadvertent and deliberate disruption of supply chains involving the PRC. But reducing reliance on Chinese supply chains is likely to be expensive and difficult — and therefore unattractive for corporate decision-makers. In many commercial areas, China already has ample pools of skilled labor and well-developed infrastructure. There is also a scale problem: Vietnam and other prospective venues for relocation cannot yet accommodate the demand that China can manage. Unless U.S. policy demands otherwise, even in areas where the U.S. could be strategically vulnerable, some businesses may decide that their comfort zone lies in maintaining reliance on Chinese supply chains.  ii) Further vulnerabilities from “trade with CCP characteristics.” Forgoing exhaustive itemization, we can highlight the general nature of other problems we face from our commercial enmeshment with the PRC by contrasting them with difficulties that America in an earlier generation experienced with Japan. Japan was a rising economic competitor in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, gaining market share and making significant inroads in industries where the U.S. had enjoyed dominance. Many Americans at the time criticized Japanese trade practices — sometimes heatedly and harshly. But Japan was and remains an open society, a constitutional democracy, and a U.S. ally, while China remains ruled by a party-state that controls much of the national economy. Large portions of the Japanese corporate sector had what we considered unfair and ultimately unhealthy relationships with the Japanese state. Large portions of the Chinese corporate sector are owned by the Chinese state, and the rest have no choice but to accept CCP dictates. One major difference between China’s “economic engagement” with the U.S. and that of Japan concerns intellectual-property theft. Japan was accused of violations on occasion, but wholesale pillaging is part and parcel of the CCP’s “business model.” In 2017 the Intellectual Property Commission, an independent think tank, estimated that IP theft by China cost the U.S. economy more than $255 billion annually and could run as high as $600 billion per year. (Such costs are intrinsically difficult to calculate, but even a much lower cost of, say, $60 billion annually would weigh heavily in any assessment of the net economic benefits of America’s engagement with the PRC.) While China was by no means the only bad international actor identified, the IP Commission concluded that the PRC alone was responsible for 50 to 80 percent of all global IP theft (e.g., counterfeited goods, pirated software, and theft of trade secrets). Directly related is the problem of espionage, both economic and noneconomic. High-profile examples of Chinese industrial espionage targeting U.S. businesses abound. According to a 2015 estimate by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, economic espionage through hacking alone may have cost the U.S. $400 billion per year in 2012–15, with China reportedly responsible for 90 percent of it. Though by definition it is impossible to know the true magnitude of China’s undetected espionage operations against the United States, Andrew E. Lelling, the U.S. attorney for the District of Massachusetts, estimates that there were thousands. Note that such indications of the scope of PRC commercial and other espionage do not include the built-in surveillance capabilities of Huawei’s 5G network, for example, or of Zoom, the virtual-meeting app that the COVID crisis made so famous, nearly a third of whose employees work in China. Last month Toronto Citizenlab detected Zoom routing encrypted data from international users back to servers in Beijing (by mistake, Zoom says). Perhaps most portentous, however, is the CCP’s approach to cultivating interest groups within the U.S., with an eye toward influencing American behavior and policy by pressure from within. This dates back to Mao Zedong’s use of “magic weapons” to influence foreign opinion in ways that might advance his struggle. Today Beijing has a large institutional apparatus to support such efforts, starting with but by no means limited to the United Front Work Department. With the allure of its large domestic market, and its thick network of economic relations in the U.S., the CCP is positioned to gain ever more from “magic weapons.” Making common cause is the essence of politicking in open societies, and identifying kindred interest groups in other countries is integral to international diplomacy and negotiations among democratic societies. What sets the CCP apart is its use of these tactics as war by other means against countries it regards as hostile. It may not have taken much strategic gardening for Beijing to exact groveling apologies last year from the National Basketball Association for a single tweet, by the general manager of the Houston Rockets, in vague support of Hong Kong democracy activists. Such is the economic leverage inherent in threatening to withhold TV revenue based on a potential viewership of 1.4 billion people. Perhaps the same holds for the paradox of the decision by Google, a U.S. giant, to decline collaboration in projects with the Pentagon even as it was operating in China’s police state. But now that a great many of America’s largest and most profitable businesses rely on China one way or another for their sales and profits, it is hard even for apolitical managers in corporate leadership to ignore the risk of displeasing the CCP. It is one thing to lobby on behalf of one’s business interests, quite another when corporate elites lobby a U.S. presidential administration to soften up on issues such as strong support for Taiwan or Hong Kong, or human-rights abuses in general — and that line is sometimes crossed. Beijing puts enormous pressure on foreign businesses to see their interests and those of the CCP as one and the same. So it is that the U.S. financial industry more or less consistently lobbies against efforts to bring Chinese firms into compliance with U.S. financial-disclosure requirements, for example. Many titans of Silicon Valley have also tried to co-opt the U.S. government on their behalf, with varying degrees of success. The big social-media companies have been mostly shut out of the market by their Chinese competitors. Chinese influence through censorship has also hit the heart of American entertainment in Hollywood. Americans have likely noticed the absence of Chinese villains in American movies. Since China agreed to open its market to foreign films in 2012, Hollywood has had to make concessions to Chinese censors. Producers and directors must coordinate with the Chinese government or lose access to the Chinese market. No less impressive, or no less worthy of greater understanding, is the sophisticated network of well-paid consultants and advisers, from Henry Kissinger on down, that has developed over the past 40 years to service a whole panoply of clients within China. It may suffice to observe that nothing like this coterie of consultants, fixers, and former high-level U.S. officials was ever a feature of the U.S.–Japanese bilateral relationship. iii) Vulnerabilities in U.S. higher education. “Government, military, society and schools — north, south, east and west — the party is leader of all”: This cornerstone of “Xi Jinping Thought” and tenet of the CCP’s revised constitution of 2017 must be borne in mind when evaluating Beijing’s “engagement” with schools, both at home and overseas. With Xi’s ascendancy, educational policy within China has been formally mobilized against “hostile foreign forces” — meaning Western ideas and those who abet their “infiltration.” Under this policy, “educational exchange” with the U.S. has been throttled — but only on Chinese soil. Fewer than 12,000 American students have been authorized to study there in recent years; both their studies and their access to Chinese society are highly restricted. Beijing has a different approach to accessing America’s educational system, even if Americans do not recognize the scope of the CCP’s objectives. China now has an enormous footprint in the U.S. educational system. In 2018–19, some 360,000 Chinese were enrolled in American universities. No other country sends more students. In 2019, students from South Korea, for example, totaled just one-seventh the number of those from China. Almost half of America’s Chinese university students are in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, and nearly a third of all U.S. doctorates in science and engineering for international students were awarded to PRC nationals in the years 2000–17. Tuition from PRC students is a major revenue item for America’s institutions of higher learning, as much as a fifth of total revenue for some of them (see, e.g., the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign). PRC students in the U.S. (and their families) spent an estimated $13 billion in academic year 2017–18. (And that does not include gifts from China that the universities “forget” to report. The Department of Education estimates that such unreported foreign monies from China and other countries has totaled many billions of dollars since 1990.) The broad benefits from this bilateral arrangement are clear enough. A large number of talented young men and women from China obtain a much better education abroad than they could at home, while America gets to hold on to most of this highly trained talent. Nearly 90 percent of U.S.-minted Ph.D.s from the PRC are still in America ten years after graduation. Overall this looks like the sort of “win-win” that globalization is meant to encourage, although one could argue about which side profits more from the arrangement. But at the hand of the CCP, risks to the U.S. from this large presence are wholly different from, say, the risks from the almost equally sizeable population of students from the Republic of India. To begin, there is the espionage. U.S. universities are both a target and, where possible, a platform for CCP operatives and helpers. From this platform the CCP can orchestrate placement of agents, theft of cutting-edge research, and spying on U.S. defense research at civilian laboratories and institutes. This is not a hypothetical risk. It is going on all the time, all across America. A few examples from just the past year, as cited by NBC News: A Chinese Harvard-affiliated cancer researcher was caught in December with 21 vials of cells stolen from a laboratory at a Boston hospital. A Chinese professor conducting sensitive research at the University of Kansas was indicted in August on charges he concealed his ties to a Chinese university. A Chinese scholar at the University of California, Los Angeles, was convicted in June of shipping banned missile technology to his homeland. A Chinese student at Chicago’s Illinois Institute of Technology was charged last year with helping to recruit spies for his country’s version of the CIA. We may also note the case of Charles Lieber, the chairman of Harvard’s department of chemistry and chemical biology. He was arrested in January for his alleged paid secret involvement in Beijing’s “Thousand Talents Plan,” whose goal, in the words of the U.S. National Intelligence Council, is the “legal and illicit transfer of U.S. technology, intellectual property and know-how.” These are only the known incidents of recent CCP espionage in the American academy. Given the nature of U.S. domestic counterintelligence — perennially underfunded, haphazard, and often inept — it might be a safer first approximation to assume that CCP academic espionage in America is now taking place always, and everywhere. The scale and scope of the CCP’s espionage efforts on U.S. campuses ought to make us think about other risks America may face from “academic engagement” with Beijing. Academic self-censorship and suppression of freedom of speech? We see this today in Australia, where a student critical of China at a highly Beijing-reliant college faces expulsion for speaking out. Chinese student activists shutting down critics of Beijing’s human-rights violations and bullying pro–Hong Kong demonstrators? Been there, done that. Just take a look at what has been happening on campus recently in South Korea. Why should we think “it can’t happen here”? Because Chinese authorities would never want to exert such sway in our country? Ironically, the coronavirus crisis may create new opportunities for the CCP to pressure the American academy. From a report of the Hoover Institution and the Asia Society (2018): “Some American faculty members report troubling conversations with university administrators who continue to view Chinese students as such a lucrative revenue stream that it should not be endangered by ‘needlessly irritating Chinese authorities.’” Today colleges and universities across the nation are panicking about the loss of prospective tuition revenue in the coming school year — and PRC students who are not coming back will surely blow a big hole in the budgets of many institutions of higher education. What sort of entreaties, concessions, and compromises, one wonders, will the American academy be willing to proffer to woo these full-fare PRC students back to their schools? iv) Vulnerabilities from penetration of international organizations and institutions. As a consequence of Washington’s design for integrating the PRC into global governance and of China’s rapid development, Beijing has become an increasingly significant player in multilateral organizations and international institutions. But the CCP does not intend to use its increasing influence in these places to promote “Western constitutional democracy,” “universal values,” “civil society,” or “the West’s idea of journalism.” Quite the contrary. The Xi Jinping regime regards all of these as direct threats to the CCP and its power, as is spelled out in the party’s now-famous “Document 9” of 2013. Xi has declared that the regime favors “reform of the global governance system” in order “to create a favorable environment” to promote “a great modern socialist country” — his own. With the WHO’s top-level pandering to the CCP’s wishes during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, we got just a sneak peak of what “reform of global governance” is going to look like. The case of the WHO, we should note, demonstrates that the CCP does not need PRC nationals in charge to get its bidding done in global organizations — subservient foreign minions can do almost as nicely. That said, Chinese citizens, as of April 2020, headed a number of multilateral institutions, including the International Civil Aviation Organization, the International Telecommunication Union, the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization, and the U.N. Industrial Development Organization. The international community also elected a PRC national as head of INTERPOL. Ironically, his tenure ended when Chinese authorities secretly arrested him for “corruption” and sentenced him to a lengthy prison term. And in a near-death experience for the international regimen for secure intellectual-property rights, the Chinese candidate for director general of the World Intellectual Property Office was beaten out by a competitor from Singapore this past March. Chinese nationals hold senior leadership positions in many other international organizations, including the U.N. Secretariat, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization, and the International Atomic Energy Agency. In light of the WHO debacle, Americans need to think carefully about the ways that Chinese civil servants in seemingly innocuous international slots could misuse their influence at Beijing’s behest. No one can seriously think that a Chinese international bureaucrat who resisted a directive from the CCP could ever return home without reprisal. America’s failed experiment with engaging China has come at a steep price. Our country has incontestably benefited in a number of respects from facilitating China’s globalization, as already noted. But even a summary glance at the conventional metrics of great-power politics is worrisome. China is far wealthier and more powerful than it was when the U.S. engagement policy began in the 1970s, and it seeks to undermine U.S. global leadership and geopolitical primacy. It has an increasingly formidable military and menaces U.S. allies around its periphery. With its increasing economic reach, growing diplomatic influence, and worldwide propaganda efforts, China is making the case that it is a rising global leader, in contrast to a faltering United States. And the classical great-power calculus overlooks a very special factor in America’s rivalry with a rising China. That is the entire domain of internal threats to our well-being and security from a hostile foreign power deeply enmeshed within our globalized order. This is a new and unfamiliar security risk that we caused for ourselves — welcomed, even — because we could not see, or would not see, the dangers a rising CCP might someday pose to our system from within. Thanks to our strategy of engagement, the PRC’s great-power challenge to the U.S. and the West is taking place in many more dimensions than did our struggle with the USSR — including dimensions we are only belatedly beginning to understand. By comparison, the Cold War may in retrospect look almost simple. Even the old Britain–Prussia analogy is of limited utility in illuminating our current straits. Our enmeshment with China is immeasurably deeper and more complex than that of the U.K. with Germany at the dawn of the 20th century — and the CCP is more skilled at cultivating its opponents’ potential vulnerabilities than the kaiser would have dreamed of. There is one important additional and devilish difficulty that our failed engagement policy poses for America. For the truth is that most of our economic connections with China benefit the U.S. side — and more than a few may benefit the U.S. more than the PRC. If the current arrangements were overwhelmingly disadvantageous for the U.S., it would be a straightforward matter (albeit painful and unpleasant) just to end them. But this is not the case. Instead we find ourselves in a tableau mainly painted in shades of gray. Careful discrimination and informed judgment will be required to determine whether each of the myriad cords that bind us to China today is actually in the American interest. For each of these cords, domestic U.S. constituencies will be at the ready to make the case that their particular relationship really is. And so today we must begin the task of quarantining ourselves against the CCP. If we are successful, that task promises to be laborious and vexatious and endlessly disagreeable. It will also be unceasing, with constant new questions about constant new opportunities always arising. It will entail close calls and near calls and bad calls, all of which will be debated publicly by critics and activists and would-be claimants. And it will require not just years of concerted effort and attention, but likely decades. Possibly the task will not be satisfactorily advanced in much less than a generation’s time. But we have just had a dress rehearsal to remind us of what failure in this task will look like. And we should entertain no illusions that the CCP will spare us from exploiting the vulnerabilities we have offered them through the hubris of an only half-thought-through China policy. — Mr. Blumenthal, author of the forthcoming book China Nightmare: The Grand Ambitions of a Decaying State, is the director of Asian studies at the American Enterprise Institute, where Mr. Eberstadt holds the Wendt Chair in Political Economy.

‘New York is the last place I would want to be right now,” said a young friend of mine on the phone, making me gulp a little: I live right here, in the city. He had a point, though. New York has been the hardest-hit city in America during this pandemic. So far, New York has had about 204,000 cases and about 21,000 deaths.  Yet millions of us live here — more than 8 million — and we go about our lives, in whatever fashion we can. New Yorkers have had a range of experiences. I will tell you a little about mine. In the first days of March, I had a gripe about a new inconvenience: a ban on plastic bags. I bought groceries at the Rite Aid, and I was coming home with two paper bags, stuffed. They broke, sending the groceries all over the sidewalk. Kind neighbors helped me pick them up. At the 7-Eleven, I was given a plastic bag, which already seemed kind of subversive and thrilling. How could I have such a wonderful thing? The clerk explained to me that they were allowed to use all the plastic bags they had on hand. After that, it was Paper City.  This seems quaint now, and trifling.  On April 8, about three weeks into the shutdown, a headline appeared in USA Today: “Plastic-Bag Bans Reversed: States, Cities, Stores Are Suddenly Banning Reusable Bags during Coronavirus.” That was not true in New York, however. Still, it was an interesting development, nationally. The last trip I had was March 12. I went to Washington, D.C., to give a talk at a club. The night before, I emailed my contact to ask whether we were still on: because things were getting canceled, left and right. Yes, he said. I left by train fairly early in the morning. Penn Station, which was usually like Calcutta, was almost a ghost town. That was a little unsettling. When I arrived in Washington, and was en route to the club (where I would stay, as well as talk), I got a message from my contact. Would I call him? Uh-oh. I called. “Have you left New York yet?” he said. Yes. “Okay, no problem. We were going to call it off if you hadn’t left, but now we will go through with it.” Before we hung up, I gave my host an assurance: If people wanted to stay away, I would certainly understand. No offense taken!   It was a merry evening — but it felt a little like the last supper. In fact, that was part of its merriness. The club was canceling all scheduled events until further notice. I returned to New York the next afternoon, on an almost-empty train. Penn Station was even more of a ghost town than the day before. I got on the subway, which was fairly crowded. People eyed one another warily, even accusatorily. Woe to you if you coughed. I wanted to tell everybody aboard that train what parents tell their children about certain animals: “Don’t forget, they’re as scared of you as you are of them.” That was March 13. I have not been down into the subway system since. I’m told, however, that the trains have become moving homeless shelters, more or less.  At the Metropolitan Opera, performances of Werther were canceled, and one of the stars, Joyce DiDonato, did something neat: She invited her co-star, Piotr Beczala, into her home for a livestream. They would perform excerpts from the opera, accompanied by a piano and a harp. Future performances at the Met — including of Werther — were still on. But livestreaming from home soon became the norm, all across the arts world, and now people are asking, “Will there be a 2020–21 season?” In New York, as elsewhere, people had to find “a new way of living.” (I’ve quoted a song from West Side Story.) Saying this, I am fully mindful that many were dying. A lot of us began to work by Zoom; go to church by Zoom; socialize by Zoom. The theme song of this period ought to be “Who’s Zoomin’ Who?” (the Aretha Franklin hit from 1985). Many people were out of work, out of luck. I was very lucky. In the magazine business, we can make our product at home. And our customers can consume the product at home. Contrast this with a clothing store, for example, or a sports club.  Of those who were working, many did not have the luxury of home confinement. They were “out there,” performing “essential services,” keeping the world afloat. Doctors and nurses, yes, but also grocery workers, policemen, et al. I felt surging gratitude for them.  The mail kept coming — I’m talking about the good ol’ U.S. Mail. “Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night . . .” My Internet provider, Spectrum, sent a man out on a Sunday evening to replace my defunct router-modem. I was kind of amazed. On another evening, at the end of March, a big, sustained cheer went up outside my windows. Lots of hootin’ and hollerin’. I had not heard anything like it since Election Night 2012 (a bad night for me). It became a ritual: a neighborhood cheer at 7 o’clock for everyone who was “out there,” working and helping. I happily joined in, often ringing a little bell that an old friend gave me, long ago. Some people think the 7 o’clock cheer is dorky. I find it a touching gesture, from people who are inside and wanting to express a little appreciation for those who are outside — and who maybe want to make a little noise as well.  Otherwise, it is quiet, eerily so. I hear a lot of birds. I am listening to them right this moment. In the 20-plus years I have lived in this building, I have become accustomed to a wall of sound: constant, urban sound, day and night. I think of an old joke, or story, about the family who lived next to the railroad tracks. At 6:23 every night, as the family was having dinner, a train came through and blew its whistle. This happened like clockwork. One night, the train did not come — and, at 6:23, the father jerked his head up and said, “What was that?” You wanted to check in on people, as the shutdown got entrenched. “Are you all right? Do you have enough food? Can I do anything for you?” I saw a woman in the hallway, going into her apartment, several doors down from me. I don’t know her name, she doesn’t know mine. (Very New York.) But she knows where I live, and I know where she lives. We both said: Knock if you need anything. The doormen in our building, as in others, never stopped coming to work: never stopped dealing with packages and people (not necessarily in that order). Doormen are a lubricant of New York life. A native midwesterner, I never knew anything about doormen until I came here, beyond Rhoda, the 1970s sitcom — in which a voice would come through the intercom, saying, “This is Carlton, your doorman.” Was it fair that they were “out there” — though masked and gloved — while many of the rest of us had the luxury of being “in”? Whatever the case, I was never more grateful for them. A few days ago, I read an article in the Times — not the New York Times, oddly enough, but the Los Angeles Times. Its heading was “While New York City Fights a Pandemic, Building Doormen Greet and Troubleshoot.” The article said that there is a higher death rate among New York doormen than among the New York police. Our building put in some pandemic rules, concerning guests, deliveries, etc. For instance, you could ride in the elevator only one at a time — one passenger or one family. We have two elevators, plus a freight. One of the elevators had a problem and was put out of service. Ordinarily, this would have meant long, long waits. Especially with one passenger or family allowed at a time! But an elevator — the elevator (plus a freight) — has never been more available in my 20-plus years. Why? First, people were simply not going out. I have a friend here who has not been out of her apartment since the middle of March. (We have been emailing.) Second, there were many fewer people in the building. They had decamped to second homes, or perhaps to their main homes, their apartments serving as pieds-à-terre. I detected a little class resentment among some of the remainers. In the early days, only a few people wore masks, out and about. Maybe 5 percent of the people you saw. They seemed extra-vigilant. Then it became 25 percent, 50 percent. Soon, I was one of the few without a mask, which made me self-conscious. Where were people getting these masks? I did not have the nerve to ask them. You approached people on the street, in the pandemic, even less than you did before. Naturally — I don’t blame them — they swerved from you as though you were a leper.  Masks were not available in stores, and Amazon told me it would be a month. (It turned out to be one month and two and a half weeks.) I wore a hankie. Then my sister dispatched me some masks, as did my mother. What am I, twelve years old? No, but it’s always nice to be cared for. By about May 15, friendly policemen were handing out masks in the parks — not merely to the unmasked but to the masked, in case they wanted extras. In March, there was a run on dry pasta in the various stores. One of the few items scarcer was hand sanitizer. Same with  toilet paper. Eventually, toilet paper returned, but it was kept behind the counter at Rite Aid, almost like contraband. A few weeks later, TP returned to the shelves, just like normal. (No sign of hand sanitizer yet.) My friend and colleague Elaina Plott tweeted out a picture of TP on the shelves at her store. Her caption was clever and sweet: “Nature is healing.” Trader Joe’s, like other stores, allows only a small number of people in at a time. There are long lines outside Trader Joe’s, made all the longer by social distancing: The standers are six feet apart. I thought of GUM, the old department store in the Soviet Union, outside of which people spent huge chunks of their lives, standing, waiting. I was in another store — Jubilee Market Place — in the checkout line. I was keeping my distance, I thought. But the elderly woman in front of me turned and said, with a shaky, urgent voice, “You’re too close.” I apologized and backed off (way, way off, so you could hardly tell I was in line). I try to cut people slack. There is a lot of fear in the air. And people, for the most part, have been patient and kind. “That’s when you have to worry,” said a friend of mine. “When New Yorkers are being patient and kind, there’s serious trouble afoot.” I have come to love the young cashiers at Rite Aid, Pinkberry, and other places. I see them almost every day. They are behind plastic partitions, working their tails off, scrubbing their hands, putting up with all manner of customer weirdness and nervousness. We have formed something like a bond. I feel quasi-parental toward them. In the beginning, the only restaurant open, within blocks of me, was a pizzeria. You could not dine in, but you could take out, or have the pizza delivered. The place was operating 24/7. As I watched them, the workers seemed well-nigh heroic. Were they foolhardy? Were we, who patronized them? Come to think of it, the McDonald’s next door to the pizza place never closed either. At least I don’t think it did. Maybe for a week or two, max. You can sooner take down the Statue of Liberty than you can the Golden Arches. After a while, more restaurants opened up for delivery and takeout (although not dine-in). A sign in one restaurant window — printed in the British World War II style — said, “Keep Calm and Carry Out.” Some restaurants, you could not enter. You waited on the sidewalk, and a worker reached through the door to hand you your food. My barbecue place, you could enter, to pick up. A sign said, “Please Stand Six Ribs Apart.” Street people were more present than ever, or at least they seemed so. They had the run of the sidewalks and squares. They begged with more intensity, I think, and my impression is they took in more, from passersby. What does “home confinement” mean to a street person? I met one man who seemed like a first-time beggar: someone whose back was against the wall, owing to the pandemic and unemployment. Was he scamming? Years in New York have taught me great wariness, not to say cynicism. But, no, I don’t think he was. Little platoons cropped up. Three young people started an organization called “Invisible Hands,” which runs errands for the shut in and vulnerable. The organization now has more than 10,000 volunteers. (That’s a big platoon.) And I like the touch of Adam Smith in their name.  A ship came in: the USNS Comfort, a hospital ship. Lots of New Yorkers came out to greet it. Was this wise? They did it, regardless. There was a field hospital in Central Park. It is startling to see a field hospital in a place you know well, or at least it was to me. It smacks of war. Field hospitals are for France, in 1916. I got some news from my hometown, Ann Arbor, Mich. An athletic facility I once worked in had been turned into a field hospital. The thought of it gave me a jolt. The field hospital in Central Park was set up by Samaritan’s Purse, a Christian relief organization. Some people protested the hospital, because the organization requires some contractors and volunteers to affirm an opposition to gay marriage. (The organization will treat anyone, however.) A pandemic can stop many things, but not politics. A sign at Mount Sinai Hospital said, “To the Health-Care Workers Fighting for Our Lives, Thank You.” I saw a headline, and a subheading, in the New York Times that was very hard to take. “Top E.R. Doctor Who Treated Virus Patients Dies by Suicide: ‘She tried to do her job, and it killed her,’ said the father of Dr. Lorna M. Breen, who worked at a Manhattan hospital hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak.” (That hospital is a branch of New York–Presbyterian.) In Riverside Park, a ball came rolling toward me. In ordinary days, I would have thrown it back, to the mother and her little son. This time, however, I called out, “Should I stop it?” The mother, after hesitating, said, “No, that’s all right.” In a touchy time, it can be hard to know what to touch, or have others touch. Normal human intercourse is called into question. A man jogged by me, wearing a mask. He was giving me what I thought was a thumbs-up — two thumbs up, in fact. A nice gesture of solidarity, I thought. I gave him a thumbs-up back. But then I realized: My mask was dangling around my neck — I was taking in a little fresh air — and he wanted me to put it back up. There was alarm and reproach in his eyes. Another time, I passed a woman, and probably got too close to her. Veering sharply off, she said, “Excuse me, moron.” I overheard a man in the park talking to his friend. “I have hay fever, and when I’m coughing, people look at me like I’m a serial killer.” Out on the Hudson River, three guys were on Jet Skis, slaloming like mad, making rooster tails. They had the river to themselves, and it looked like they were having a ball. Speaking of balls: I saw a man practice his tennis against a wall. It was the first “live sports event” I had seen in ages. Another man, in front of another wall, practiced his singing — day after day. I imagined that the others in his apartment did not want to hear him. He had found an outdoor studio. Often, the parks were crowded, while the streets were not. If you wanted social isolation, you were much better off in Times Square than in a park. In Times Square, there was practically tumbleweed. Not far from Times Square, I saw a father and a son playing catch in the middle of the street. (Baseball, I’m talking.) Just like it was 1937 or something. I had never seen this, in my years in New York. A friend of mine said he saw kids riding their bikes in the middle of the street, poppin’ wheelies — just like they were in suburbia. I noticed that the flower boxes outside the Javits Center — which was used for a while as a field hospital — were amazingly neat, pretty, and pristine. There was no one around to mess them up: to sit in them, for example, or throw litter in them. As for the air quality, we could almost compete with the Rockies. I  noticed something weird the other day: I waited for traffic, for like a minute. I had gotten used to tumbling into the streets, as though New York were Mayberry. Things are picking back up. There are more people about, with less obvious fear. Even the 7 o’clock cheer is petering out, much less robust and much less sustained than before.  On Memorial Day evening, people were gathered on the sidewalk outside two restaurants, one of them newly reopened (for takeout, between “3 and 8:30-ish”). The scene was almost a block party. Men were talking about the charity golf match shown on television the day before — a real, live, professional sports event: Tiger Woods and Peyton Manning versus Phil Mickelson and Tom Brady. On the sidewalk, there was something resembling normality. A few days later, however, trouble erupted in the city: riots, stemming from an awful case of police brutality in Minneapolis. There were riots in cities all across the country, in addition to righteous protests. One night, at 2:30, I was awakened by noise outside my windows: not birds, or cheering, but shouting. And police sirens. Was the commotion related to Minneapolis? I think so, but, this being New York, who knows? When the sun came up, all was peaceful, at least outwardly. Back to Memorial Day evening. I left the “block party” and returned to my building, where there was another party, of sorts. The super, two doormen, and I huddled for some music. We listened to a concert from New Orleans, featuring a jazz clarinetist, backed by a symphony orchestra. Picture us in our masks — a Honduran, an Albanian, an Ethiopian, and a Michigander, but all of us American, true-blue — groovin’ to some New Orleans jazz on Memorial Day. Pandemic or not, civil unrest or not, I have so much to be grateful for.  If you enjoyed this article, we have a proposition for you: Join NRPLUS.

Confession time: I’ve always been a bit of a prepper. I really shouldn’t be broadcasting this, I know. Prepping — the hobby of preparing for societal breakdown by stocking up on insane amounts of Chunky Soup and Band-Aids and waterproof matches and hand-cranked emergency radios that you actually have no idea how to use — was until very recently seen as a fringe activity for either bored weirdos who dwell in desert RVs or rich weirdos who live in Silicon Valley.  Moreover, telling people you are a prepper breaks the most important rule of prepping, which is akin to the first and second rules from Chuck Palahniuk’s Fight Club: You do not talk about prepping. If you share your prepping secrets with the world, after all, sooner or later the you-know-what will hit the fan and all sorts of unprepared friends and acquaintances and even frenemies who were making fun of you just the week before will sidle up with wide innocent Bambi eyes and ask to borrow “just a few of your Clorox wipes” or “just one segment of your last toilet-paper roll” or “just five or six of your guns.” But hey, it’s 2020. At this point, we’ve faced a mysterious mutant virus, government-sponsored lockdowns, an invading swarm of murder hornets, and violent unrest across America. Who knows what’s coming next? An alien invasion? Cats 2? I hate to break it to you, but if you’re here with us in 2020 and you’re paying attention and you’re not prepping, you’re the weird one now.  While this year has offered a steady dose of low-level torture for calendar-loving social-schedule planners — unfortunately for me, I’m one of those, too — for preppers, it’s been a bit of a vindication. “For years, one of the most smirked-at subspecies in the technology ecosystem was that of the Silicon Valley Prepper,” wrote Nellie Bowles in the April 24 New York Times. But now, she notes, “the coders and founders long snickered at for stockpiling flour and toilet paper were absolutely right.” Prepping, in other words, has gone mainstream.  But here we must face the gigantic elephant in the stockpile room that is delicately trying to squeeze behind the piles of bulging bugout bags and knocking down an entire stack of garbanzo beans in the process: If you rely on things you must buy from a store, you can never really be prepped enough. Those cans of freeze-dried beef stroganoff you ordered might have an impressive shelf life of 25 years, but eventually they’re going to run out. As our old friend Yeats might put it, things fall apart, the center cannot hold, and eventually you will eat all of your Spam.  To reach the true upper level of prepping — the luxury skybox of survival — one must learn to live off the land. One must know how to dress a deer and a turkey. One must know how to gut a fish. One must know which mushrooms, if consumed, will unceremoniously whisk you away from this earthly vale. One must know, like the magnificent Bear Grylls, how to extract hydration from camel poo. With this in mind, one must do what any reasonable aspiring hard-core survivalist would do in uncertain times: Sit back and turn on the TV. Don’t laugh. I’ve learned a lot! Say what you will about the boob tube, but these days it presents a cornucopia of wild and crazy survivalist fare. There’s Naked and Afraid, a terrifying visual offering featuring people stripped of their clothing and tossed into jungles where all sorts of nightmarish things can latch onto their skin. There’s Man vs. Wild, with the aforementioned international treasure Bear Grylls. And then there’s my family’s current favorite in the booming television-survivalist genre, featuring an impressive cast of some of the hardest-core live-off-the-land heroes you will ever encounter: Alone.   “ALONE,” as the History Channel declares on its website, “is the most intense survival series on television.” Indeed. From the start of the show’s first season — which plopped ten people into the wilderness on Vancouver Island, allowed them limited supplies, isolated them from one another, and granted the longest-lasting participant a prize of half a million dollars — the show has continually morphed and upped the ante. The first season’s winner, Alan Kay, emerged victorious after spending 56 days in the southern Canadian wilderness. Now, in season seven, the winner of Alone must last at least 100 days — in the Arctic.  Alone offers many lessons — among them, I have discovered that it is de rigueur for many survivalists to sincerely thank a captured fish for its life and service before bonking it on its head and scarfing it down for lunch. But one message resonates above all others: The winners of the show don’t share just certain physical skills. They share psychological traits as well.   Sure, they might be able to construct a cabin with a working fireplace and loft beds entirely out of stray pine needles in two days flat! They might be able to cure poisonous spider bites by whipping up a poultice made out of seaweed, good intentions, and fresh air! They can often build a full-sized fishing boat using nothing but a rusty hook, a dead snail, and an old washed-up buoy from the beach! But they also adjust their expectations beyond the temporary. The winners of Alone aren’t, in other words, sitting around feverishly counting the days. They develop a wilderness lifestyle with the assumption they will be in it for the long haul — and because of this, they pull through. Deep, is it not? “No,” you might be saying. “That is not deep at all. What are you suggesting, lady?” Okay, fine. Maybe I’m watching too much TV. But I’m right about the canned goods. You at least have to grant me that.  If you enjoyed this article, we have a proposition for you: Join NRPLUS.

The scene was a socially distanced checkout line at my local grocery store in March. “This man should be removed from the store. He’s not wearing a mask,” one woman said to whoever would listen, pointing behind her. “Mind your own business,” he replied. “It is my business,” she shouted back at him, and then, to the whole store: “This a**h***, like the one in the White House, is not following the rules and regulations.”  I wondered what rules she thought Trump was not following. But the maskless man had the final word, and it was chilling.  “Lady, if you don’t shut up, you’re gonna wish all I did was cough on you.” Mask-shaming is now a real phenomenon. Viral videos circulating among the smug shut-ins show clerks and retail greeters meeting demands for “freedom” with the requirements of store and company policy, which is also a form of freedom — stores have the right to set their terms of entry. It’s remarkable how much the world has changed in just a few months. In the Western world, we traditionally associate masks with danger. They are worn to protect against harmful fumes. They are worn to signal a threat to others, by bank robbers or terrorists. They are worn by people who want to commit street violence during a demonstration but not be subject to retaliation or criminal investigation when the mêlée is over. As protests bleed into riots across America, a mask is probably the first sign of trouble. Back in the last week of January, when a peculiar interest in the developing “Wuhan flu” story was seen as the mark of a paranoid, possibly racist rube, I decided I’d rather be safe than sorry. But when I went to look for masks at my local pharmacies, there were none. They were sold out seemingly everywhere. One clerk explained to me that “Chinese people” were buying them up, which I didn’t believe at first. And then I went home and discovered that masks were back-ordered on Amazon. That is the moment I became fearful of the disease. It was like discovering a massive hedge-fund bet against your own health and well-being.  In fact, it was Chinese shoppers, who had gone about this in an organized way. By the middle of February, Yahoo Finance reported that professional “daigou” shoppers had been sending masks back to China from all over the world. Daigou (roughly speaking, “surrogate shopping”) is a gig-economy and trade revolution in which members of the Chinese diaspora buy anything that can be resold at a profit in China, mostly luxury goods that would normally be subject to massive taxes. But household staples are just as good. Daigou shoppers have caused Australia, Singapore, and other nations to place strict limits on the sale of infant formula. These shoppers often advertise their finds on Chinese social networks. In April, Hexin Jiang, who goes by a name on Weibo that roughly translates as “fat American wife,” sparked viral outrage in America and China over videos in which she says, laughing, “They don’t know about the masks here [in Florida],” and brags to her potential buyers that she was not leaving any masks for the Americans. She even admits, with a guilty smile, “I feel like a thief.” Americans who came upon the story were angry that she bought up enough masks to fill the bed of her pickup truck and showed such callousness toward her neighbors. Chinese users thought she made their countrymen look evil. At that point in the pandemic, health authorities and clever-dick explainer journalists were telling the world that masks were not just useless but probably harmful for ordinary people, though desperately needed by frontline health-care workers. World Health Organization official Rabindra Abeyasinghe claimed that mask-wearers could be “at more risk” of catching the coronavirus. On March 2, Vox tweeted out, “Oh, and face masks? You can pass on them. Masks are only useful if you have a respiratory infection already and want to limit the risk of spreading, or if you’re working in a hospital in direct contact with people who have respiratory illnesses.” But, of course, if you can spread the disease while you’re asymptomatic, a mask is most useful precisely before you know it will be. Later, close readers noticed — and were outraged — when a Vox co-founder admitted he had ordered his masks in February. It turned out that the recommendations against mask-wearing were little more than a bit of folk wisdom. The theory was that medical masks used at hospitals are fitted to the wearer to give the maximum benefit, while ordinary people would wear masks improperly and then probably act recklessly, thinking they were protected. There’s no science to back up that assertion, just smug condescension toward the layman. It’s as if a union of chefs advised that home cooks don’t have perfect knife technique and therefore get no benefit from that utensil. A great deal depends on how one sees the masks. Are they a further imposition on daily life by a liberal expert class, a ready symbol of that set’s contempt for the masses, of their belief in the presumptive toxicity of unmanaged human life? Are they a useless piece of security theater, meant to keep us frightened? R. R. Reno, the editor of First Things, and Helen Andrews, a senior editor at The American Conservative, see it that way. Proving that liberty is a part of the Catholic vision of the common good, Reno expressed resentment of the mask as a symbol of subjection. Andrews compared mask-wearing to the duck-and-cover drills of the Cold War era, arguing that they were mostly futile against the threat, and that dignity required facing a danger with some equanimity.   In a blistering essay for the online magazine Damage, the left-wing writer Amber A’Lee Frost admitted that she hates the masks, hates the stupid consumerist fake enthusiasm for cute masks and the smug expert journalists chirping about virtuous mask-wearing. “I feel like I live in an open-air hospital,” she writes, “or a particularly cosmopolitan leper colony. I miss human faces very badly, and I hate the sensation of being trapped in a breathing swamp of my own self, as each damp exhale rolls back onto my face.”  This is a deeply human reaction, and one we’ve seen before. In the great influenza of 1918, San Francisco imposed mask-wearing on citizens when they were in public. Eventually people started letting their masks dangle below their chins in quiet defiance. An anti-mask league was formed just before the orders were lifted.  My own view is that masks are less an extension of a lockdown mentality of submission than the way out of it. In Austria, the conservative prime minister Sebastian Kurz imposed the wearing of masks at supermarkets as he was permitting the further reopening of the economy, even as he acknowledged, “I am fully aware that masks are alien to our culture.” In East Asian countries, which learned from successfully containing SARS in 2003, masks have again been part of the response to the wide-release sequel this year. The science on masks’ reducing the spread of droplets on which the virus can travel is compelling. Some have taken this to extremes and wear masks while they are driving alone in their cars, or even while exercising outside, miles away from anyone. But indoors, masks have been shown to be effective at containing the virus. When a sizeable portion of people are wearing them, it becomes very difficult for the sick to infect others. The symbolic gesture is not useless either, since the mask signals to strangers a kind of courtesy and care for their health. If masks can enable us to get back to business, we ought to be for it. But Kurz was on to something in observing that masks are alien to our culture. I believe that the resistance to public mask-wearing stems not just from its common association with criminality or from physical discomfort but that it goes to the theological roots of Western life, that it’s part of the same hard-to-articulate resistance we see in Europe to the intrusion of Islamic face-veiling into society. At the heart of the West is a conviction that the truth is “unveiled,” and that the face is where our personhood is incarnate. Our limbs merely gesture, but only a facial expression, and the uncovered mouth, can express, even betray, our deepest selves. That is why unveiling has featured so prominently in Christian liturgy, as a reminder that our destiny is to be transfigured when we see God face to face. This is so deeply a part of our culture that the resistance to and resentment of masks should not surprise us. They are a terrible imposition, and only a real danger could justify them. At the same time, we should have confidence that masks will not become a permanent feature of Western social life.  If you enjoyed this article, we have a proposition for you: Join NRPLUS.

Another 1.9 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week, bringing the total of jobless claims since the coronavirus pandemic began up to 42 million. The level of new claims outpaced the Dow Jones estimate of 1.775 million. However, last week’s new claims were still lower than the previous week’s total, which were revised upwards to 2.126 million.  Meanwhile, continuing jobless claims hit 21.5 million, an increase of 649,000 that rose higher than most economists  predicted. Continuing unemployment claims began to taper off in May, a sign that the economic destruction from the coronavirus is beginning to slow as some businesses are allowed to reopen and employees return to work. Since mid-March, the pandemic has forced businesses to shutter and furlough or lay off employees as states implemented lockdown and stay at home orders that have slowly been lifted, although social distancing restrictions remain in place in many areas. Of the 42 million unemployment claims that have been filed since the start of the pandemic, only  a fraction have been processed as agencies continued to be overwhelmed by the volume of claims. The unemployment rate for May is expected to hit 19 percent, up from 14.7 percent in April, and will be reported in the Labor Department’s monthly unemployment report Friday.

George Floyd was killed in Minneapolis last week when a police officer used brutally excessive force to arrest him. It was the latest in a string of high-profile cases nationwide in which citizens, most of them African Americans, died from reckless police force. Once again, protests over police brutality turned violent and rioting ensued.  The U.S. is torn apart over the national mass quarantine. Liberal blue states accused red opened-up states of recklessly endangering national health by allowing their populations to go back to work before the virus has left. Red states countered that blue states were hypocritical in wanting federal money to subsidize their locked-down residents while expecting other states to generate needed federal revenue. They also contended that there was no longer scientific evidence to justify the lockdown. The nationwide protests and rioting have inadvertently adjudicated the issue: States cannot jail the law-abiding barber who wears a mask at work but allow the arsonist without a mask to roam the streets, burning with impunity. There is mounting evidence that an array of federal officials had plotted to disrupt Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign and his presidential transition, leaving Trump supporters furious.   Meanwhile, likely Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is sequestered in his basement. He often appears confused. Yet Biden seems content that the more people do not see or hear him, the more they like the idea of him as president. Indeed, the more inert Biden has become, the higher his poll numbers have risen against Trump and his tweeting. 
 As the U.S. protested and bickered, China attempted to strangle what was left of Hong Kong’s enfeebled democracy. China’s theory seemed to be that if it’s going to be blamed for the spreading virus due to its deceit anyway, it might as well not let such a pandemic go to waste. The Chinese strategy in reaction to disclosures that it hid vital data about the virus and exposed the world to contagion while it quarantined its own cities has devolved from “So what?” to the current “What exactly are you going to do about it?” China also decided to ramp up its perennial border confrontations with India, as its forces encroached on Indian soil in the Himalayas. What better way to show the world that a defiant China is dangerous than to agitate the world’s largest democracy?   Beijing warned European nations that if their independent media continued to condemn China, there could be commercial retaliation. A few European journalists still exposed Chinese deceit, even as shaken EU leaders backtracked and tried to contextualize Chinese misbehavior. Japan and South Korea worried that China might move on Taiwan. They knew that if China did, only the United States — convulsed by quarantines, riots, and a contentious presidential race —could stand up to Beijing. For years, China has bullied and waged a virtual commercial war against Asian democracies such as Japan, South Korea, India, and Australia. It has subverted almost all international trading norms. The Chinese government assumed that Western elites would get rich by being complicit in China’s cheating and would thus help sell out their own countries. They were mostly right on both counts. As China Westernized its economy, it conned gullible Western officials that eventually it would become a useful member of the family of nations.  In truth, China strategically hoarded cash from its asymmetrical trade surpluses. It planted its functionaries throughout transnational organizations and subverted them. It beefed up its military and planted island bases in international waters. It compromised strategically important nations by investing in their infrastructure through its neocolonial and imperialist multitrillion-dollar Belt and Road initiative. China may have been forced by the global epidemic to give up its nice-guy façade. But it has insidiously pivoted from global friend to its new role as overt global villain. If the world had been anxious over the intentions of a suspiciously nice China, it will become downright terrified of an overtly hostile China. In other words, China is not wasting the disaster of the Wuhan outbreak. It once gained a lot by faking friendliness, but now it seems to think it has no choice but to gain even more by being authentically belligerent. As part of the about-face, China no longer flatters the West in passive-aggressive fashion but rather shows its disdain for a weak Europe and an increasingly divided U.S.  China’s real message to a fence-sitting world?  While America tears itself apart with endless internal quarreling and media psychodramas, while Europe appeases its enemies, and while the rest of Asia stays mute, waiting to see who wins, China is now on the move — without apologies. © 2020 Tribune Content Agency, LLC   

Cardenas Ortiz-Sandoval’s mother, Guadalupe, died last month. Cardenas, 22, helped to plan her funeral. She was told by mortuary officials that the state of California would not allow more than ten people to attend her mother’s graveside service. Some family members were forced to stay home. Lifelong friends could not bury a woman they had known for decades. “So many public spaces are open,” Ortiz-Sandoval told CNN, “but a cemetery, which is open-air, is limited to ten per funeral.”  The family of Guadalupe Ortiz-Sandoval did not burn Los Angeles to the ground. They did not start riots. They, and millions like them, did not attend their loved one’s funeral service because the public-health authorities told them not to. As I write this piece, a policeman is scouring the streets in my ruralish Connecticut suburb, patrolling the neighborhood for congregants and other insubordinates of the social-distancing regime. It is nice outside. Many are sick of sitting indoors, or pacing the streets in solitude. Most have dutifully followed the orders of the public-health officials, epidemiologists, and chart-makers whom the media have coronated as our de facto shepherds through this pandemic. You remember what they told us. People on the beach? Fools. Three people riding together on a boat in Michigan? Lethal. Tepidly reopening the economy? An experiment in human sacrifice. The virus doesn’t go away because you’re bored. It doesn’t care that you’re grieving, your livelihood is ruined, your business has collapsed, or your spouse is abusive. You can’t pray it away at your church. So stay home, stay safe, and flatten the curve.  And that’s an order.  
 Unless, of course, you’re protesting racial injustice. Those protesting George Floyd’s death in crowds large enough to fill a small stadium have evaded scrutiny from the same people who told us that Floridians lying distanced on a beach were Literally Killing People. Some elected officials say that these protests are different — that the demonstrators have a good reason to be congregating on the streets. As Bill de Blasio said, the protests are much different from the matter of the “aggrieved store owner or the devout religious person.” They don’t have good reasons to break quarantine. The looters do. Everyone you know has a “good reason” to break quarantine. Some wish to bury a relative, while others want to visit a lonely elder in a nursing home. Parents want to baptize their children to save their souls, and first-generation college students want to attend graduation. All of them were told to abstain from these things in the name of public health. Following those orders had human costs — rates of domestic violence increased during the lockdowns. Calls to suicide hotlines skyrocketed. Millions were thrown out of work. Businesses built over generations filed for bankruptcy, Some will never recover.  Those who protested the lockdown regime were ridiculed. Governor Gretchen Whitmer in Michigan said that anti-lockdown protests came “at a cost to people’s health.” Michigan nurses stood in front of protesters’ cars with folded arms, leering on in contempt. As hordes of looters and rioters turned to the streets, however, NPR informed us that “dozens of public health and disease experts have signed an open letter in support of the nationwide anti-racism protests.” Nurses in New York stood outside a hospital and cheered as protesters, some of whom were unmasked, packed together like sardines and marched through the streets to protest police brutality. The chair of the New York City Council’s health committee, Mark Levine, says that “if there is a spike in coronavirus cases in the next two weeks,” we ought not to “blame the protesters. Blame racism.” If we shouldn’t “blame” them, then we ought not “blame” the regular people who break quarantine to mourn their dead. If it’s true, as the experts told us, that the virus does not discriminate, and does not care how trying your personal circumstances are, then the virus certainly does not care about how unjust the Minneapolis police department may be. If no “open letter” of apology from the “medical community” is forthcoming to the bereaved who stared at their casketed relative on an iPad, the least that those officials can do is admit that they never really cared about the lockdowns at all.

First: It seems that several major studies, including one in The Lancet suggesting that the drug is actually harmful, were based on rather questionable data. The Guardian has the details: “The US-based company Surgisphere, whose handful of employees appear to include a science fiction writer and an adult-content model, has provided data for multiple studies on Covid-19 co-authored by its chief executive, but has so far failed to adequately explain its data or methodology.” The company has a minimal online presence, and the “get in touch” function on its website doesn’t even work, yet it provided data it claimed to get from “more than a thousand hospitals worldwide.” These revelations follow concerns aired elsewhere that the data seemed fishy. Second, though, a randomized trial found that the drug didn’t measurably help to prevent COVID-19 when given to individuals who’d been exposed to infected people. From the New York Times: Conducted in the United States and Canada, this trial was the first to test whether the drug could prevent illness in people who have been exposed to the coronavirus. This type of study, in which patients are picked at random to receive either an experimental treatment or a placebo, is considered the most reliable way to measure the safety and effectiveness of a drug. The participants were health care workers and people who had been exposed at home to ill spouses, partners or parents. “The take-home message for the general public is that if you’re exposed to someone with Covid-19, hydroxychloroquine is not an effective post-exposure, preventive therapy,” the lead author of the study, Dr. David R. Boulware, from the University of Minnesota, said in an interview. The drug could still be effective against COVID-19 in other situations, and there are other trials in the works. And there are some weaknesses to the study itself: Not all the participants could be tested for the virus, because when the study was being conducted, there was still a shortage of test kits. There was no meaningful difference between the placebo group and those who took the drug. Among those taking hydroxychloroquine, 49 of 414, or 11.8 percent, became ill. In the placebo group, 58 or 407, or 14.3 percent, became ill. Analyzed statistically, the difference between those rates was not significant. In other words, they couldn’t test everyone to make sure their illnesses were COVID-19, and people who got the drug were about 17 percent less likely to become “ill” — a difference that wasn’t statistically significant because the study was so small. But there’s no denying this is disappointing news.  

Remember that scary hydroxychloroquine study in The Lancet and New England Journal of Medicine that everyone in the media was writing about a few weeks ago? It turns out that the underlying data were likely fake: A Guardian investigation can reveal the US-based company Surgisphere, whose handful of employees appear to include a science fiction writer and an adult-content model, has provided data for multiple studies on Covid-19 co-authored by its chief executive, but has so far failed to adequately explain its data or methodology. A peer-reviewed Lancet study claimed that Surgisphere culled data from nearly 15,000 COVID-19 patients from 1,200 hospitals around the world. There is no evidence that it collected any data from anyone. Partisans been rooting against hydroxychloroquine for months now. There’s really no other way to describe the manic reaction to a drug that has been widely, though anecdotally, said to have therapeutic value against the coronavirus. Politicians have blocked attempts to study the drug. The number of shoddy pieces of journalism surrounding hydroxychloroquine is just remarkable. Apparently, it is also dangerous. A couple of weeks ago, Joe Biden compared taking hydroxychloroquine to drinking bleach, even though millions of Americans use the drug every day to survive. At the time, I linked to an NPR interview in which doctors at Columbia University and other research institutions complained that they couldn’t find people to conduct simple clinical trials on hydroxychloroquine’s effectiveness, even though the drug was, as one doctor put it, “very very safe.”  Two verys. Now we know that thousands of hospitals around the world relied on Surgisphere data to make determinations about treatment and studies. The WHO, the organization I am assured we must continue funding, halted clinical trials — followed by a number of countries — because of the alleged dangers borne from the imaginary data put together by an adult model. WHO has now reversed course and resumed studies. If we learn that hydroxychloroquine is helpful mitigating the harm coronavirus — and that’s still a big if; a new study today shows that it is not effective as a prophylactic — we can probably thank knee-jerk anti-Trumpism for delays. Scientists have trouble conducting studies, medical journals will take shortcuts in a rush to prove the president wrong (what else could explain it?), and the media will publish any scary story that reaffirms their preexisting prejudices. If you’re interested in further corroding public trust in experts, this is a perfect way to do it. It’s a scandal.  

How to square the circle of insisting on social distancing to fight the spread of COVID-19 while supporting large-scale protests? Public-health experts are here to help, as is Shannon Paulus of Slate. “Public Health Experts Say the Pandemic Is Exactly Why Protests Must Continue,” reads the headline to the story, which notably lacks anyone who is willing to say that the protests will reduce the death toll from the disease or even to deny that it will increase them.  The central claim, rather, is that racism is (quoting one of the experts) “one of the more dangerous infectious diseases” and that fighting it is therefore a blow for public health even if it comes at the price of spreading COVID-19. “In the long term, breaking down structural racism is an unequivocal public health good,” Paulus writes. But even if we grant that premise — something that the slipperiness of the phrase “breaking down structural racism” counsels against — the planted axiom is that these protests are likely to be an effective means of reducing racism. It is not at all obvious that they are, especially when the protests spill over into violence and looting. What should also comfort us about the protests’ role in spreading disease, Paulus writes, is that they are “happening as states are relaxing stay at home orders, as largely white crowds head to pool parties and brunch.” (Let’s pause to marvel at the rigorous empiricism, doubtless expert-approved, by which we can ascertain that it’s “largely white crowds” that are exercising newly recovered freedoms.) Because of this, another expert tells Paulus that if COVID-19 cases spike, “we’re not going to be able to pin this on the protests.”  It’s a point that is logically incompatible with Paulus’s next move, which is to try to pin any such increase in cases on the police. Note again, though, that Paulus and her expert aren’t denying that protests will spread a deadly disease. They’re just saying it won’t be possible to prove how much they do it. Which underscores that this is just politics. If racism can reasonably be likened to a dangerous infectious disease, so, surely, can stupidity.  

A study that cited worldwide hospital data to warn of higher risks of death and heart problems with taking the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine to treat coronavirus is now under scrutiny for faking data. The hydroxychloroquine study, published in two of the world’s leading medical journals — the Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine — used data from thousands of hospitals and tens of thousands of patients to conclude that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine treatments had no positive effects on Covid-19 patients and led to greater risks of health problems.  The findings caused the World Health Organization and other researchers to halt studies looking into the effectiveness of the antimalarial drugs as possible coronavirus treatments, and raised further criticism against the Trump administration, which has touted the drug as an effective treatment. Last month, President Trump said that he had completed a two-week course of hydroxychloroquine as a preventative measure against coronavirus. But the studies were based on data from Surgisphere, a little-known U.S. company, whose employees have little or no data or scientific background, according to The Guardian. The company’s chief executive, Sapan Desai, who is listed as a coauthor of the Lancet study, said that his company was “not responsible for the source data,” explaining that the records of the nearly 100,000 patients used in the study were compiled by the respective hospitals, not his team. But the claim contradicted that of QuartzClinical — the content management system Desai said Surgisphere employed — which stated on its website that it “successfully integrates your electronic health record, financial system, supply chain, and quality programs into one platform.”   Peter Ellis, the chief data scientist of Nous Group, an international management consultancy that does data integration projects for government departments, told The Guardian that Surgisphere’s database was “almost certainly a scam.” “It is not something that any hospital could realistically do,” he explained. “De-identifying is not just a matter of knocking off the patients’ names, it is a big and difficult process. I doubt hospitals even have capability to do it appropriately. It is the sort of thing national statistics agencies have whole teams working on, for years.” Following widespread scrutiny, both the Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine released statements saying they have acknowledged the serious concerns and are looking into the source of the data.

Racism should be blamed if George Floyd protests cause a spike in coronavirus cases, New York City council member Mark Levine said on Wednesday. “Let’s be clear about something: if there is a spike in coronavirus cases in the next two weeks, don’t blame the protesters. Blame racism,” Levine, who is the head of the city council’s health committee, wrote on Twitter. “And let’s remember that the police are increasing COVID risk by: using tear gas; herding demonstrators into tight spaces; putting people in crowded jails.”  Massive demonstrations erupted across the country following the killing of Floyd, who is African-American, at the hands of white police officers in Minneapolis. While the demonstrations have led to widespread looting and rioting in major U.S. cities, even peaceful protesters have not adhered to social distancing guidelines despite the continuing risk of coronavirus spread. A meta-analysis in the medical journal The Lancet published on Monday concluded that social distancing is the most effective method of coronavirus mitigation. “We just spent 93 days limiting behavior, closing down, no school, no business, thousands of small businesses destroyed,” New York governor Andrew Cuomo said on Monday, “And now? Mass gatherings, with thousands of people, in close proximity?…What sense does this make?” On Tuesday, New York City mayor Bill de Blasio defended his decision to keep religious institutions and small businesses closed until June 8 even as police struggled to contain nightly looting. “When you see . . . an entire nation, simultaneously grappling with an extraordinary crisis seated in 400 years of American racism, I’m sorry, that is not the same question as the understandably aggrieved store owner or the devout religious person who wants to go back to services,” de Blasio said at a press conference. “We’re not going to treat it like, ‘Why are people outside [at] the bars,’ and not notice that all of America is grappling simultaneously with a horrible crisis….Sorry guys, there’s a world outside New York City.”  Send a tip to the news team at NR. 

Since the beginning of this COVID-19 crisis, the Mercatus Center has published 45 policy briefs, 21 of them authored by scholars with non-Mercatus affiliations. These briefs were a result of a call for papers we launched at the beginning of the pandemic, and scholars from all over the country responded to our call with ideas and policy reforms. These briefs have helped shape a new vision for Mercatus scholars as to what the way forward may look like: As policymakers begin to “unpause” the economy, they will have to address immediate challenges in economic and fiscal policy, regulatory policy, health policy, and monetary policy. This brief addresses all four of these areas. For each, it identifies innovative and action-oriented ideas developed by the community of scholars at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University for a rapid, entrepreneur-led rebound. This summary brief covers 4 areas of policy: Economic and Fiscal Policy, Regulatory Policy, Health Policy, and Monetary Policy. In the regulatory section, for instance, you will find the suggestion from my colleagues Matt Mitchell, Adam Thierer, and Patrick McLaughlin to create a “Fresh Start Initiative,” modeled after the Department of Defense’s Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission. The commission would identify and study all the rules revised or suspended during the current crisis and then make recommendations for each rule to be terminated or reformed, thereby crafting “a plan and timetable for automatically sunsetting or comprehensively reforming those policies or programs as part of a single reform package.” If it works as well as BRAC did, many of these useless rules will be permanently terminated. Another favorite of mine comes from my colleagues Brent Skorup and Connor Haaland about easing federal restrictions to allow state and local authorities to facilitate drone delivery services: The use of drones for medical, parcel, and grocery deliveries would be enormously beneficial as part of America’s response to COVID-19. These benefits are not just theoretical; drones have been effectively deployed in China in the wake of its COVID-19 outbreak. The barriers that prevent drone delivery services from scaling up in the United States are not technological, but institutional. The Federal Aviation Administration and White House, perhaps through a statement of policy, could resolve some of the ambiguity in federal airspace law, which would allow state and local authorities to demarcate and lease the airspace above public roads. States could undertake reforms that allow for the creation of drone highways for medical and parcel deliveries. The federal government could also implement changes that will help facilitate the widespread use of drones for medical deliveries. The whole thing is here. Make sure you check the Mercatus page for our new call for papers and send your brilliant ideas. 

Wow, what a morning! Dr. Anthony Fauci has good news on a coronavirus vaccine; the nation’s cities were somewhat calmer and less violent last night — although the decision about deploying the National Guard has now become hopelessly politicized; and one of the country’s least-popular Republicans loses a primary. Dr. Fauci: We Should Have 100 Million Vaccine Doses by the End of the Year  All right, finally some good news: “The US should have 100 million doses of one candidate Covid-19 vaccine by the end of the year, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and a member of the White House coronavirus task force, said Tuesday. ‘Then, by the beginning of 2021, we hope to have a couple hundred million doses,’ Fauci said during a live question and answer session with the Journal of the American Medical Association.” But before we break out the party hats . . . “When you look at the history of coronaviruses, the common coronaviruses that cause the common cold, the reports in the literature are that the durability of immunity that’s protective ranges from three to six months to almost always less than a year,” he said. “That’s not a lot of durability and protection.” We might need annual coronavirus shots the way we’re supposed to get annual flu shots. Also note that Fauci changed his tune a bit late last month when he declared that a second wave in the fall was “not inevitable.” (So it’s “evitable,” then?)   Actions to Restore Public Order Require a Buy-In from Broad Swaths of the People President Trump is not interested in listening to state officials who disagree with him, and he has no ability to persuade them to come around to his position. Democratic officials have little or no interest in listening to the president and refuse to take actions that could be perceived as concurring or supporting the president. This has far-reaching, real-world consequences. On a call with the nation’s governors Monday, Trump seethed with frustration, telling them, “most of you are weak. You have to dominate. If you don’t dominate you’re wasting your time . . . Somebody throwing a rock, that’s like shooting a gun. You have to do retribution, in my opinion.” Trump’s preferred, or perhaps lone, form of persuasion is to berate and insult others until they change their minds. Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota — who has earned plenty of fair criticism for his response to riots in his state — urged the president “to make clear to the public that the National Guard wasn’t an occupying force and instead consists of people’s neighbors.” Trump responded, “It got so bad a few nights ago that the people wouldn’t have minded an occupying force. I wish we had an occupying force.”  When someone who President Trump doesn’t like says, “I am concerned that this could become X,” Trump’s first instinct is often to say, “This will absolutely be X.” Maine governor Janet Mills, a Democrat, told the president she was concerned about his upcoming trip to Puritan Medical Products, which manufactures swabs for test kits. Trump later said, “she tried to talk me out of it. Now, I think she probably talked me into it. She just doesn’t understand me very well.”  In this sense, Trump is correct. When other people warn him not to do something, he often reflexively does it to demonstrate he won’t be controlled, regardless of consequences. (“DO NOT CONGRATULATE.”)  Unsurprisingly, the governors who did not already agree with the president were not persuaded to change their actions. Some Democratic officials who had activated National Guard units before Monday’s call are now publicly insisting they will not deploy them. Trump’s tone Monday appears to have pushed some Democrats further away from his preferred position. Calling out National Guard could be step to restoring public order. Despite historically ignorant claims that this hasn’t been done in centuries, California governor Pete Wilson called out nearly 10,000 of his state’s Army National Guard to in Los Angeles after the riots in 1992. There is some debate as to whether the National Guard deployment was the decisive factor in ending the riots; the amount of violence in the city dropped after the third day, and the deployment was largely complete by the end of day four. As of Monday morning, National Guard units had been activated to prepare to assist law enforcement (but not necessarily deployed) in Arizona, Alaska, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin. (This is separate from the active and deployed National Guard units assisting with the coronavirus response in all fifty states.) It is worth noting that the National Guard can be used in ways to assist police — communications, directing traffic, simply having a deterrent presence in public squares and intersections, etc. — and not necessarily in a role that puts them in confrontation with protesters or rioters.  Washington, D.C. mayor Muriel Bowser also activated her local National Guard Sunday, but by Tuesday morning she declared, “I don’t think that the military should be used on the streets of American cities against Americans. And I definitely don’t think it should be used for a show.”  What happened in between Sunday and Tuesday? Trump’s conference call to the governors about “domination” and “retribution.” Fairly or not, the president altered the perception of what those troops were there to do with his rhetoric. For the deployment to run smoothly, the public in these cities needed to see the Guardsmen as a reinforcement for local police, ensuring stability and order. Local and state officials needed most of the public to buy-in to the value of the deployment, just as the president needed the state governors to buy into the proposal as well. And then Trump explicitly wished the Guardsmen could function as an occupying force.  Unsurprisingly, since Monday, several Democratic governors like J. B. Pritzker and Andrew Cuomo have publicly declared they not want the National Guard deployed in their states’ cities. Interestingly, Texas governor Greg Abbott also said he doesn’t see a need for National Guardsmen in his state’s cities, and Trump declared via Twitter he agreed with Abbott’s decision because of the border wall. (For those wondering how close the biggest Texas cities are to the U.S.–Mexican border, San Antonio is about 157 miles from Laredo, Austin is 235 miles away, Houston is about 315 miles, and Dallas is about 430 miles.) There are portions of the District of Columbia that are under the control of the federal government. This is why last night dozens of masked, camouflaged National Guardsmen lined up on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. The masks are presumably for coronavirus protection, and the Lincoln Memorial was among several national monuments and sites on the National Mall that were spray-painted with graffiti on previous nights. Nonetheless, it is easy to see why people are unnerved at the sight of masked troops lining up behind barricades at an iconic American structure, after the president yearned for domination, retribution, and an occupying force. Whether or not you think the people of these besieged states and cities should have elected these governors and mayors, they did. Those state and local officials were as freely elected as the president was; they took oaths of public service upon taking office just like he did. Any successful deployment of the National Guard will require cooperation from state and city officials, and state and local police. Posse Comitatus is on the books for a reason. Soldiers and police both carry guns, but their missions are distinct. Soldiers set out to neutralize and kill an enemy, usually foreign combatants. Police enforce laws against U.S. citizens. (Yes, military police units enforce laws as well.) There are rare situations where military forces can be deployed to assist civilian law enforcement agencies, but responsible leaders in the civilian and military worlds recognize the two realms ought to be mixed as little as possible. This is one of the reasons it is also disturbing to hear Defense Secretary Mark Esper say that when he walked with the president Monday evening across Lafayette Park, he believed he was following the president to “see some damage and to talk to the troops,” not to pose for photographs in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church. “I didn’t know where I was going,” Esper told NBC News. This is a moment where clear communication between civilian and military leaders is most necessary, and the president is not communicating to his own secretary of defense where he’s going and why. Esper requested the use of Virginia’s National Guardsmen earlier on Monday, in order to deploy them on the streets of Washington. Governor Ralph Northam denied Esper’s request, and his chief of staff declared in a statement, “we quickly learned it had not been made at Mayor Bowser’s request or coordinated with her, and we have heightened concern based on the president’s remarks that the administration is looking to use the Guard to escalate — not de-escalate — the situation.” Democratic governors are simply not going to deploy their state’s national guardsmen into cities where Democratic mayors do not want them. Trust is the fuel that moves the engine of any resolution to this violence. Without it, efforts are just going to sputter. Yesterday I described President Trump’s mentality as one of perpetual conflict “with himself and groups he likes on one side, and others he cannot abide on the other.” The opposition never has a point, there is no honorable concession, all compromises are forms of surrender, and the only objective is complete victory and forcing the opposition to accepting defeat. “No matter the problem, he always finds a path back to his favorite explanation: He is strong and others are weak; if other people were as strong as he was, the problem wouldn’t be happening.” Unsurprisingly, a lot of the president’s fans agree with him.  A lot of options get taken off the table when someone has this mentality. Every conflict can only be escalated. Tensions can only be ratcheted higher. Like a horned ram who likes to bash heads, the president can only charge into conflict and hope that the collision does more damage to his opponent than himself. This is a situation that requires building consensus, and Trump turned it into another one of his battles of wills. Perhaps the president’s foes were always going to accuse him of being an aspiring dictator or fascist. But he sure makes their job easier for them. A King Is Toppled Good riddance: Republican voters ousted U.S. Rep. Steve King on Tuesday, delivering an end to the two decades of controversy he brought to his heavily conservative district. The Associated Press has called the 4th Congressional District primary race for state Sen. Randy Feenstra of Hull, who had the backing of many state elected officials and national Republican groups. Feenstra won with 45.7% of the vote to King’s 36%, a margin of just under 8,000 votes, according to unofficial results from the Iowa Secretary of State’s office. ADDENDUM: A little while back, I had a chat with Oliver North, discussing the actions of the Chinese government and the coronavirus; that interview can be watched here.  

China foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian on Monday urged the U.S. to end racial discrimination following the death of George Floyd. “Black lives matter,” Zhao said at a press conference. “Their human rights need to be guaranteed. Racial discrimination against minorities is a chronic sickness in American society.” Zhao continued, “We hope the U.S. government can take substantial measures and fulfill its obligations to the international convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination, so as to safeguard and guarantee the legitimate rights of minority groups.”  China itself has seen an uptick of racism against Africans, especially in the city of Guangzhou which has a large population of African residents. After five Nigerian residents of the city tested positive for coronavirus in April, a McDonald’s branch posted a sign banning black people and many Africans were evicted from their homes or hotels. The U.S. State Department sent out an advisory on April 13 warning African-Americans to avoid the city, noting that police had instructed bars and restaurants not to serve customers of African origin. African-Americans in Guangzhou have since been refused service at businesses and some have been forced into mandatory quarantines despite testing negative for coronavirus, the New York Times reported on Tuesday.  China maintains extensive relations with African Union nations, where it has invested billions of dollars in infrastructure projects. Following the events in Guangzhou, a group of African ambassadors in China condemned the “stigmatization and discrimination” faced by residents of the city.  On Tuesday, Zhao said China supports African Union nations in the wake of the George Floyd protests. “China stands with the African [nations] in their just cause and will work with the African [nations] to firmly oppose all forms of racial discrimination, including inciting discrimination and hate speech,” Zhao told reporters.

President Trump on Tuesday announced that the Republican National Convention would not take place in Charlotte, N.C., after Governor Roy Cooper said the state could prevent the convention from proceeding at full capacity due to the pandemic. “Governor Cooper is still in Shelter-In-Place Mode, and not allowing us to occupy the arena as originally anticipated and promised,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Would have showcased beautiful North Carolina to the World, and brought in hundreds of millions of dollars, and jobs, for the State.”  Governor Cooper, a Democrat, responded, “We have been committed to a safe RNC convention in North Carolina and it’s unfortunate they never agreed to scale down and make changes to keep people safe. Protecting public health and safety during this pandemic is a priority.” A complete cancelation of the convention could cost the city of Charlotte tens of millions of dollars in damages, the Charlotte Observer reported last week. The contract between the city and the RNC does not include an “act of God” clause that could have exempted the city from liability because of the pandemic, although the Observer noted that many political events do not include such clauses in their contracts. “It is not going to be easy for anyone to say ‘We’re out,’” said City Council member Ed Driggs, a Republican. “This is a legal, commercial and political minefield.”   The convention would have seen up to 19,000 people gathering in Charlotte’s Spectrum Center, but Cooper said earlier on Tuesday that it was “very unlikely” the convention would occur at full capacity. However, some Republicans could still gather to conduct “official business” in Charlotte about a week before the convention itself. “Due to the directive from the governor that our convention cannot go on as planned as required by our rules, the celebration of the president’s acceptance of the Republican nomination will be held in another city,” the RNC said in a statement. “Should the governor allow more than 10 people in a room, we still hope to conduct the official business of the convention in Charlotte.”    Send a tip to the news team at NR. 

Sweden’s response to the coronavirus resulted in too many deaths and could have been improved, the country’s chief epidemiologist Anders Tegnell told Swedish radio on Wednesday. Tegnell designed a unique strategy by which the country allowed non-essential businesses to remain open, urging citizens to comply with social distancing regulations and to avoid unnecessary travel. Sweden’s death rate from coronavirus as of Wednesday sits at 443 per million of the country’s population, far higher than its Nordic neighbors Finland (58 per million) and Norway (44 per million), both of which imposed more far-reaching lockdowns of nonessential businesses.  When asked whether Sweden had seen too many deaths, Tegnell answered, “Yes, absolutely.” “If we were to encounter the same disease again knowing exactly what we know about it today, I think we would settle on doing something in between what Sweden did and what the rest of the world has done,” Tegnell said, in comments translated by the Guardian. Tegnell added that medical officials would need to learn “what else, besides what we did, you could do without imposing a total shutdown.” Coronavirus has been particularly lethal for the elderly in Sweden, with roughly half of the country’s 4,500 deaths occurring among residents of nursing homes.   “There was no strategy at all for the elderly, I now understand,” Annike Linde, former chief epidemiologist from 2005 to 2015, told the Swedish state broadcaster last week. “I do not understand how they can stand and say the level of preparedness was good, when in fact it was lousy.” Sweden’s relatively lax strategy was designed in part to avoid a complete shutdown of the economy. While the country’s GDP grew slightly in the first three months of the year, Swedish economists still predict an eventual economic contraction of 7 percent by the end of 2020, with 10 percent unemployment.

				he “Live Free or Die” state has been locked down for almost three months. Last week, 17 times as many Granite Staters filed for unemployment as did in the same period a year earlier. About 200,000 New Hampshire workers have filed for unemployment since Governor Chris Sununu declared a state of emergency March 13 and followed up with a stay-at-home order March 27. To put that in perspective, the U.S. Census reports that New Hampshire’s total 2017 employment was 603,923.  Last Friday, Sununu extended his stay-at-home order for a third time, guaranteeing more people will lose their jobs. He also threatened legal action against Riverside Speedway and Adventure Park in Groveton, N.H., forcing the track to remain closed. His stay-at-home order carries a potential $20,000 fine for businesses that defy him and possible arrest and criminal prosecution for anyone else failing to follow the various micromanaged edicts he has issued. (You can use equipment at the gym if you pay for a personal trainer to follow you around, but not on your own. Out-of-staters must quarantine for 14 days before staying in a hotel. Hair-cutting is OK, but dye jobs are not. Golf-course employees must wear masks at all times even when eating lunch alone in a break room. Etc.) Then on Saturday, he tweeted: “I called the organizers ahead of the #GeorgeFloyd March in Manchester to let them know the State of NH stands with them in their calls for justice.” His tweet contained a link to an article at the website of WMUR, the local ABC affiliate, with a headline stating that over a thousand people had attended the march. Yet gatherings of ten or more people are supposedly still prohibited by his own Emergency Order No. 16, issued April 6. When asked by NHJournal.com about the contradiction, Sununu replied: Those that want to compare social injustices and the issue surrounding the murder of George Floyd to the effectiveness of a stay-at-home order and social gatherings are completely missing the point. They are two completely separate issues and those that try to combine those two issues . . . they’re doing an absolute disservice to the importance of the message around those protests, the importance of the message around the injustices. On Monday, Sununu reaffirmed his support for the anti-police Black Lives Matter and Antifa protests that are burning their path of destruction through American cities, saying, “We have seen peaceful protests happen across America.” Tell that to Americans watching looters smash store windows, viciously beat people who get in their way, and set fire to St. John’s Episcopal church across from the White House. “As we speak, there is a protest taking place at Hampton Beach in memory of George Floyd. As I have previously said, the state stands with those calling for justice,” the governor continued.  
 The beaches in New Hampshire have been closed, by Sununu, since March. Monday, June 1, was the first day they were reopened. But only for swimming. “This is not a time to drop your blanket and sit around,” the governor said May 22.  I support everyone’s right to peacefully assemble, and I am grateful that the two Black Lives Matter rallies in New Hampshire this week were nonviolent, unlike in other states. But nonviolence should be the expectation, not the exception. In neighboring Massachusetts, police cars were burned in Boston, and 53 people were arrested for looting and rioting. Sununu is not the only governor who is keeping his state locked down while supporting Black Lives Matter and Antifa rallies that blatantly violate bans on large group gatherings. New Jersey governor Phil Murphy recently said, “It’s one thing to protest what day nail salons are opening, and it’s another to come out and peacefully protest about somebody who was murdered right before our eyes.” That’s a different tone from Murphy’s response in April when asked about how his lockdown order affected the First Amendment rights of New Jersey residents, specifically the arrest of 15 congregants at a synagogue. “That’s above my pay grade,” he told Fox News’s Tucker Carlson. “I wasn’t thinking of the Bill of Rights when we did this.”   If that’s all a little confusing to you, then I’m glad I’m not the only one bemused here. These governors seem to be saying that the virus is so dangerous that they must shut down our normal way of life, and suspend constitutional rights . . . except if you’re a member of a radical left-wing anti-cop group, or a domestic terror organization like Antifa. One wonders how the virus knows to infect the small-business owner wanting to reopen but not the black-clad anarchist burning down said small business. Sununu and other governors aren’t enforcing their stay-at-home orders equally. To the contrary: They’re willing to prevent you from going to church but not willing to prevent Antifa from burning down churches. 

I think Kyle Smith’s post below on the “Suicide of the Cities” is a really smart one, and a warning that urban leaders should heed carefully. The coronavirus and its related policies of quarantines and lockdowns was already tipping the scale against urban life in the eyes of some big city residents. A sense that the police or prosecutors either are unable or unwilling to keep order in the streets will spur another, even wider exodus.  The only mitigating factor in the portrait that Kyle paints is that urban progressives who move out to the suburbs or the country, driven by exasperation with the problems of urban life, don’t always change their voting habits. Ask longtime New Hampshire residents about the transplants from Massachusetts, longtime Virginia residents about the spillover in the northern suburbs of Washington, D.C., or longtime residents of any Western state about the new transplants from California. Many red state conservatives have fumed as newcomers complain about high taxes, soft-on-crime policies, and maddening bureaucracy and stupid rules where they used to live . . . and then vote for candidates who share the same worldview all over again. Kyle concludes, “the demonstrators and rioters are going to remake the cities in their own image. And it’s going to be disastrous for those cities.” Indeed, but those leaving the cities are likely to try to remake their new communities in the image of their old ones. These transplants won’t completely change the political currents in their new communities, at least not for a while. But one of the maddening aspects of modern public policy is that hard lessons need to be relearned every few decades as citizens forget which policies solved the problems and which ones created them.  

In a recent letter to the United Nations, John Barsa, acting director of the U.S. Agency for International Development, asked the U.N. to remove “reproductive health” and abortion from its humanitarian plan to address the COVID-19 global pandemic. “The U.N. should not use this crisis as an opportunity to advance access to abortion as an ‘essential service,’” Barsa wrote. “Unfortunately, the Global [Humanitarian Response Plan] does just this, by cynically placing the provision of ‘sexual and reproductive health services’ on the same level of importance as food-insecurity, essential health care, malnutrition, shelter, and sanitation.”  Rebuffing that letter, the U.N.’s Human Rights Council now has formally cited several U.S. states that attempted to limit abortion, among many elective procedures, in order to stem the coronavirus outbreak. “UN experts are concerned some U.S. states — such as Texas, Oklahoma, Alabama, Iowa, Ohio, Arkansas, Louisiana and Tennessee — appear to be manipulating #COVID19 crisis measures to restrict access to essential #abortion care,” a U.N. Twitter account wrote last week. In a statement, the U.N. Human Rights Council’s Office of the High Commissioner elaborated on this criticism, asserting that “some US states appear to be manipulating the COVID-19 crisis to curb access to essential abortion care.”  “We regret that the above-mentioned states, with a long history of restrictive practices against abortion, appear to be manipulating the crisis to severely restrict women’s reproductive rights,” said Elizabeth Broderick, vice chair of the U.N.’s working group on discrimination against women and girls.  “This situation is also the latest example illustrating a pattern of restrictions and retrogressions in access to legal abortion care across the country,” Broderick added. “We fear that, without clear political will to reverse such restrictive and regressive trends, states will continue pursuing this pattern.” The high commissioner’s office noted, too, that it was “extremely concerned” at the U.S. insistence on removing abortion from the U.N.’s COVID-19 response plan. “We reiterate that sexual and reproductive health services, including access to safe and legal abortion, are essential and must remain a key component of the UN’s priorities in its responses to the COVID-19 pandemic,” Broderick said. The U.S. and the U.N., then, are at an impasse. In the view of the U.N.’s Human Rights Council — rather inaptly named, considering its dogmatic insistence on promoting the killing of unborn human beings — health care, disaster response, disease mitigation, and human advancement all are impossible without unlimited access to abortion. The U.S. was right to condemn this position, and it ought to forcefully defend the states that drew criticism from the organization. Unfortunately, the Trump administration is handicapped in that effort because U.S. courts have, in most cases, already struck down the state policies in question as conflicting with our abortion jurisprudence.  

New York City mayor Bill de Blasio on Tuesday said that although mass protests had erupted in the city, religious institutions and small business owners would still be closed until Monday. “When you see . . . an entire nation, simultaneously grappling with an extraordinary crisis seated in 400 years of American racism, I’m sorry, that is not the same question as the understandably aggrieved store owner or the devout religious person who wants to go back to services,” de Blasio told a reporter for the ultra-Orthodox Jewish publication Hamodia.  “This is a powerful, painful historical moment. So no, I have eyes to see. We’re not going to treat it like it’s just any other day, we’re not going to treat it like, ‘Why are people outside [at] the bars,’ and not notice that all of America is grappling simultaneously with a horrible crisis,” the mayor continued. “Sorry guys, there’s a world outside New York City.” De Blasio said that while he did fear that demonstrations could result in another outbreak of coronavirus, New York institutions would continue to reopen according to the timetable set in conjunction with state health officials. New York has seen widespread looting in the upscale neighborhoods of Soho and Midtown Manhattan, as well as in parts of Brooklyn. De Blasio has clashed with ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities in the city during the course of the pandemic. In late April, after police dispersed a crowd at a funeral for a Brooklyn rabbi, the mayor wrote on Twitter, “My message to the Jewish community, and all communities, is this simple: the time for warnings has passed. I have instructed the NYPD to proceed immediately to summons or even arrest those who gather in large groups.”   While the tweet provoked criticism from the Satmar ultra-Orthodox sect, whose leaders had organized the funeral, some in the sect defended the mayor from other critics. “We strongly denounce the vicious attacks against the Mayor, particularly those accusing him of anti-Semitism,” wrote Mayer Rispler, head of a Satmar faction. “The close relationship between Mr. De Blasio and our community goes back close to two decades…We consider him a dear friend.” Since the incident, the NYPD has shut down several yeshivas operating in defiance of lockdown orders. Last week, however, demonstrations protesting the death of George Floyd, an African American man killed during arrest by white officers, spread across the city. Those demonstrations have devolved into looting and rioting. Rioters and even peaceful protesters have not adhered to social-distancing guidelines.  “You don’t get to pick and choose First Amendment freedoms. You don’t get to side with protesters and slough off churches and synagogues,” Senator Ben Sasse (R., Neb.) said in response to de Blasio’s decision to keep businesses and religious institutions closed. “Americans ought to hope that New York City is sued so that Bill de Blasio’s nonsense gets laughed out of court.”  Send a tip to the news team at NR. 

The Associated Press does an excellent deep dive into the World Health Organization’s interactions with the Chinese government in January, and finds WHO officials “complained in meetings the week of Jan. 6 that China was not sharing enough data to assess how effectively the virus spread between people or what risk it posed to the rest of the world, costing valuable time.”  The AP report concludes the “delay in the release of the genome stalled the recognition of its spread to other countries, along with the global development of tests, drugs and vaccines. The lack of detailed patient data also made it harder to determine how quickly the virus was spreading — a critical question in stopping it.” The only problem is that we’re learning about WHO’s internal frustration with China after a lot of investigative reporting at the beginning of June, instead of as it was happening. Officials at WHO felt obligated to lie to the world, repeatedly praising Beijing’s cooperation, response, and transparency and echoing the false Chinese conclusion that the virus could not be spread from one human to another. It is somewhat reassuring to learn that not everyone in the organization agreed with the strategy of doing whatever was necessary to stay on the good side of Xi Jinping. But how much reassurance can we take when the effect of that internal dissent was nil? Ending U.S. funding for the World Health Organization may or may not be a good idea during a pandemic. But even those who want to continue funding must recognize that the WHO failed in its primary responsibility to provide timely and accurate information about a serious public threat. [Insert every “you had one job” gif here.]  If the WHO is incapable of reforming itself to ensure that it prioritizes accuracy and timeliness, what is the point of the organization? Governments of the world that prioritize accurate information over the sensitive egos of autocratic regimes ought to form their own international organization, to do the job that WHO is unwilling or incapable of doing.

The Wall Street Journal has to publish a story like this one every couple of years. When William Mark decided to get back into investing after the 2008 financial crisis, he looked past stocks and bonds. Needing to play catch-up with his retirement portfolio, the piping engineer decided to bet on a complicated product he hoped would deliver double-digit annual returns. It worked so well—earning him 18% a year in dividends, on average—that he eventually poured $800,000 into the investments, called leveraged exchange-traded notes, or ETNs. When the coronavirus pandemic hit, he lost almost every penny. “I’m 67 years old and I’m basically bankrupt in just two weeks,” Mr. Mark said. The Journal should have a standing headline for these: “Hey, Stupid, Don’t Put Money You Can’t Afford To Lose into Complex, Volatile Investments You Don’t Understand.” If your broker or your brother-in-law promises you 20 percent on yen-denominated Baltic Exchange freight future — can’t lose! — run, run, run.  

From the beginning of California’s COVID-19 shutdown in March, religious institutions were excluded from the state’s definition of “essential businesses,” including the South Bay United Pentecostal Church in Chula Vista, Calif. The church spent most of May in court fighting Governor Gavin Newsom’s imposition of more stringent restrictions on religious gatherings than comparably risky secular activities.  As California shifted to a four-stage reopening plan, its discrimination against houses of worship grew as their reopening was pushed to “Stage 3,” behind manufacturing, warehousing, offices, schools, and shopping malls.  Californians were allowed to gather by the thousands ten hours a day, seven days a week, to visit America’s high altar to consumerism, but could not gather for an hour a week to worship God. When the Pentecostal church’s challenge reached the Ninth Circuit, a 2–1 panel affirmed the district court’s refusal to grant the church a temporary restraining order, over the blistering dissent of Trump appointee Daniel Collins. The church then made an emergency request to the Supreme Court via Justice Kagan, the circuit justice responsible for the Ninth Circuit. Last Monday, Newsom gave a bit by allowing houses of worship to gather at 25 percent of building capacity or 100 attendees, whichever is lower. That restriction does not apply to the favored businesses. The church did not ask the Court for any special privilege. It was willing to comply with the same social distancing and hygiene protocols as the favored entities. It simply asked not to be subjected to more onerous restrictions than they were. How is wearing a mask and keeping six feet apart riskier when done in a church auditorium vs. a school auditorium? Answer: It isn’t.  This should have been an easy call. But soon before midnight on the Friday before Pentecost Sunday, the Court denied injunctive relief by a 5–4 vote. Chief Justice Roberts joined the liberal bloc, opining in a concurrence that “The precise question of when restrictions on particular social activities should be lifted during the pandemic is a dynamic and fact-intensive matter subject to reasonable disagreement.” Justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh voted to protect the church.  As the chief justice saw it, “comparable secular gatherings” including concerts and theatrical performances faced similar (or greater) restrictions while “only dissimilar activities” where “people neither congregate in large groups nor remain in close proximity for extended periods” had fewer burdens. He argued that elected officials have “especially broad” latitude to “act in areas fraught with medical and scientific uncertainties.” Chief Justice Roberts blatantly mischaracterizes the issue. The test of discrimination isn’t whether any comparable secular activity is treated as badly as religious activity, it is whether any comparable secular activity is treated better than religious activity. In the race context, it is obviously wrong to say blacks cannot claim discrimination if Hispanics are treated just as badly, because the proper question is whether any race is treated better than African Americans. If Roberts thought this was a close call, he should have voted to grant the temporary relief to avoid irreparable harm in turning back so many Pentecostal churchgoers on Pentecost Sunday.  Justice Kavanaugh wrote a dissent, joined by Thomas and Gorsuch, pointing out that in fact “comparable secular businesses are not subject to a 25% occupancy cap, including factories, offices, supermarkets, restaurants, retail stores, pharmacies, shopping malls, pet grooming shops, bookstores, florists, hair salons, and cannabis dispensaries.” The fact that some secular activities like movie theaters are restricted as much or more than churches is entirely beside the point.  Of course, several of the favored categories can include large numbers of people and longer stays than a church service. The risks inherent in those settings were addressed by safety protocols, which suddenly cease to be sufficient when the context shifts to churches. “The State . . . has substantial room to draw lines, especially in an emergency,” Kavanaugh noted. “But as relevant here, the Constitution imposes one key restriction on that line-drawing: The State may not discriminate against religion.” California’s occupancy cap “indisputably” does that, in violation of the First Amendment.  For good measure, Kavanaugh’s incisive opinion quoted the Sixth Circuit’s recent observation in a similar case, improbably named Roberts v. Neace: “The State cannot ‘assume the worst when people go to worship but assume the best when people go to work or go about the rest of their daily lives in permitted social settings.’” Sadly, it would appear it can when the state is California. 

Back on April 15, White Coat Waste, an organization that opposes government funding for medical research that involves animal experimentation, filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the U.S. National Institutes of Health requesting all correspondence with State Department officials regarding the Wuhan Institute of Virology, as well as all emails, text messages, memos, and reports related to WIV.  Starting in 2014, NIH provided grants to EcoHealth Alliance; part of that group’s research included studies of viruses in bats in partnership with the Wuhan Institute of Virology. On April 19, Michael Lauer, NIH Deputy Director for Extramural Research, wrote to EcoHealth, “There are now allegations that the current crisis was precipitated by the release from Wuhan Institute of Virology of the coronavirus responsible for COVID-19. Given these concerns, we are pursuing suspension of Wuhan Institute of Virology from participation in federal programs.” Five days later, Lauer declared in a follow-up, “the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), an Institute with the National Institutes of Health (NIH), under the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has elected to terminate the project . . . NIH does not believe that the current project outcomes align with the program goals and agency priorities.” Gorka Garcia-Malene, the FOIA officer at NIH, responded to White Coat Waste’s request on May 22: The records you requested involve pending investigations. I have determined to withhold those records pursuant to Exemption 7(A), 5 U.S.C. § 552 and (b)(7)(a), and section 5.31 (g)(l) of the HHS FOIA Regulations, 45 CFR Part 5. Exemption 7(A) permits the withholding of investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes when disclosure could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings. In his original message, Lauer wrote, “it is in the public interest that NIH ensure that a sub-recipient has taken all appropriate precautions to prevent the release of pathogens that it is studying.” It is unclear if the NIH review is the “pending investigation” and “law enforcement proceedings” referred to in the FOIA response, or whether there is a separate U.S. criminal investigation of the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The National Institutes of Health has its own police force to secure its facilities, but the Department of Health and Human Services refers violations of civil or criminal law to the Department of Justice. 

On the menu today: a near-complete breakdown in American leadership, driven in large part by elected officials who cannot bear unpleasant truths that contradict their preexisting worldview; the role and limited culpability of foreign intelligence operations; the coming argument about just who counts as a member of Antifa; and oh yeah, remember that ongoing potentially lethal pandemic?  Our Leaders Fear the Evidence, Even When It’s on Fire, Right in Front of Them Let’s begin the week with words I wouldn’t have predicted writing a couple of years ago: I really liked a recent observation by Glenn Greenwald: “Until people start forming beliefs based on evidence rather than the narrative that’s most comforting, our discourse will continue to be toxic trash. (Also, as long as media outlets employ people with a documented history of fabrication & fabulism, the media will be unreliable).” Perhaps all of our problems boil down to an unwillingness to form or adjust our beliefs based upon evidence, and the habits of mono-focusing on evidence that supports our preexisting beliefs and ignoring, downplaying, or seeking ways to refute evidence that challenges our preexisting beliefs. Greenwald made his comment in response to Saint Paul mayor Melvin Carter declaring Saturday that every person arrested in riots in his city was from out of state, and then amending it to at least 80 percent. (When someone in authority makes a sweeping statement adamantly and emphatically, and then quickly qualifies it, our spidey-sense should start tingling. This is often an indicator that the speaker wants something to be true but realizes that what they said is not quite true.)   Minnesota governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey made similar comments Saturday morning. But data from arrest reports released later that day indicated that was not the case. “In Hennepin County, which includes Minneapolis, 47 of the 57 people arrested in protest incidents through Saturday morning had provided a Minnesota address to authorities, according to Jeremy Zoss, a spokesman for the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office.” Surely, there were some non-Minnesotans in the mix of those committing crimes in that area. But Minnesota’s government leaders simply didn’t want to acknowledge the possibility that members of their own communities could do something so destructive and callous. Confronting that problem was too daunting and intimidating to them, so they turned to a more morally convenient villain. It was not hard to find people, generally on the Left, arguing that the violent rioting, looting, arson, and other crimes were being committed by white nationalists who sought to exacerbate tensions between whites and blacks. Walz told reporters he suspected white supremacist groups and drug cartels were carrying out some of the violence in Minneapolis.  With such widespread urban violence across the country this weekend, it is certainly possible that some perpetrators fit that description. But the vast majority of those were young whites, in anarchist or Antifa regalia, and young blacks and other minorities. (Omar Kelly is correct: Count the number of skateboards you see in those videos. Separately, you can read how Antifa is preparing to hit the streets right on Reddit.) The young people you see in those videos are unlikely to be white nationalists or the pawns of white nationalists.  There was a much simpler and sadder explanation than a vast right-wing conspiracy. A lot of young people saw an opportunity to either steal things or indulge their most destructive impulses without significant consequence to themselves and embraced that opportunity. They may be driven by some sort of left-of-center ideology, but it is likely that many were driven by simpler human instincts: greed, selfishness, malevolence, and a desire to feel powerful, at least for a moment. Elected officials’ inability to accurately characterize the protesters and their actions was matched by an inability to accurately characterize the government responders and their actions. On Saturday, Walz said the Pentagon was providing “intelligence support of what they’re seeing, what they’re signal intercepting, they have obviously from NSA and others massive support to be able to see who these operators are.” This raised quite a few eyebrows, as the National Security Agency is not a domestic law-enforcement agency; it is focused on intercepting and collecting signals intelligence from foreign sources. Later, the governor’s office stated he had misspoken and there was no NSA involvement. Apparently, the governor just went before the cameras and winged it, saying things he thought were true, or hoped were true.  Every one of these people in elected office asked for their jobs and put considerable effort into telling the public they were prepared to handle the difficult duties that came with it. One of those duties is communicating accurate information to the public. That accurate information may be difficult and painful to hear. Mayors and governors across the country may be pained to declare something like, “Significant numbers of young people of all races are taking advantage of widespread outrage about the police role in the death of George Floyd to commit selfish and cruel crimes.” (If you doubt that these crimes are cruel, listen to Stephanie, a disabled Minneapolis woman.)  But that is a more accurate description of what is happening than the idea that the significant numbers of African-American youth looting the Nike store on Michigan Avenue in Chicago are somehow being manipulated by those losers who marched in Charlottesville. (Even if you contend that the worst of the situation is being driven by “outside agitators,” you are eliding the fact that your local population — the one you want to believe is good and decent and law-abiding and peaceful — is reacting just as the outside agitators desired.)  Not every crime leads back to the suspect you already disliked. Sometimes the trail leads back to the people you thought better of, who you thought were on the right path, the people who you thought weren’t capable of this. The combination of the coronavirus pandemic and widespread urban violence should be reinforcing to all Americans the hard lesson that elected office is not about being a celebrity. It is not about looking good on television, or an opportunity to manipulate and control the lives of human beings like moving pawns on a chess board. It is not about soaring rhetoric and pretty words. Leadership in elected office is often about telling people difficult truths that they don’t want to hear, making hard decisions that will fully satisfy no one, and accepting the responsibility for making those decisions. If you are not willing to accept that, don’t run for the job.  We Can Blame Foreign Disinformation Only So Much Speaking of “outside agitators . . .” National-security adviser Robert O’Brien, former national-security adviser Susan Rice, and senator Marco Rubio pointed to foreign intelligence operations seeking to exacerbate tensions through disinformation and propaganda on social media. (Great, more foreign competition for jobs Americans traditionally do.) Rice pointed the finger at Russia, Rubio said “at least three foreign adversaries” were at work, and O’Brien named Russia, China, and Iran. Hostile intelligence services make the decision to lay out the bait, but Americans make the decision to take the bait. Our problem is not that the secret efforts of Moscow, Beijing, and Tehran involve malicious and incendiary lies; they’ve always done that. Our problem is that some Americans want to believe their lies. Those Labels Come On and Off So Easily, They Must Use Velcro In the coming days, you’re going to see a lot of semantic arguments about just who can be accurately labeled “Antifa” — just as we saw in previous arguments about which perpetrators of crimes really qualify to be labeled a member of al-Qaeda, ISIS, militia members, white nationalists, incels, and any other violent ideological movement that is tenuously connected to an American community or either side of the aisle in U.S. politics. To a lot of folks on the Right, a masked young person who is dressed mostly in black, oftentimes wearing an anarchist symbol, and spray-painting a public building is de facto Antifa, whether or not they have a formal membership. To a lot of folks on the Left, that person is just some young punk, with no meaningful connection to the left-wing politics, and certainly not one of “their side” that warrants denunciation from allies. There is, admittedly, quite a contradiction between statism and anarchy. Quite a few hardline activists on the Left say they believe in bigger, stronger, and more far-reaching government, but act like anarchists. No doubt some progressives look at Trump voters and see a lot of people who say they’re motivated by liberty and fear of powerful government, but somehow they always end up calling for the cops to crack some skulls. I suppose it’s just a matter of time before Antifa is characterized as having a political wing and a militant wing. Back in 2014, I discussed that alleged division within Hamas: From over here, it looks like a public-relations wing and a convenient-scapegoat wing. “Oh, it wasn’t us that fired those rockets! It was our militant wing!” Militant wings are the evil twins of geopolitics. If your organization has a military wing — as opposed to an actual, declared, uniforms-and-everything-military — you’re probably a troublemaker. You notice the good guys in life rarely have a militant wing. “I’m with a hardline faction of the Red Cross.” “I’m with Mother Theresa’s paramilitary branch.” These groups really seem to think that the political wing can’t be blamed for what the militant wing does. Guys, you’re two halves of the same chicken. Colonel Sanders just sees one bird. Hey, Remember Coronavirus? Oh yes, there’s still a pandemic going on, even though apparently large swaths of the public decided to stop worrying about it. Most of the cities that burned this weekend still have various quarantine, stay-at-home, and other restrictions on large gatherings, restrictions that are now effectively suspended — and as Rich observes, barely even mentioned anymore. The good news is many protesters were wearing masks and were outdoors. The bad news is that lots of people were much closer to each other than six feet apart and shouting all day long. (Perhaps the fear of tear gas or being identified in photos can spur mask-wearing when the fear of the coronavirus cannot.)  New York City mayor Bill de Blasio declared Friday, “I want to just say anyone who wants to protest, we’re going to protect your right to protest.” This is the same man who declared in late April regarding Orthodox Jews attending funerals in Brooklyn, “My message to the Jewish community, and all communities, is this simple: the time for warnings has passed. I have instructed the NYPD to proceed immediately to summons or even arrest those who gather in large groups. This is about stopping this disease and saving lives. Period.” We can all see what’s going on. The mayor fears crossing those who are protesting the police, but he does not fear crossing the Jewish community in Brooklyn. Varad Mehta observed, “Remember, many local authorities have closed swimming pools, community centers, and other facilities because of the coronavirus. Take one release valve for the summer heat away and the pressure will just vent elsewhere. If this weekend is a preview, the summer won’t be pretty.” Jon Gabriel added, “Add to that the people furloughed, fired, and bored out of their skulls at home. With the only socially acceptable way to go outside is to riot.” Nearly three months of lockdowns and restrictions didn’t cause this weekend’s violence. But they probably exacerbated it. ADDENDUM: The editors are correct: “Restoring order should be the first priority. The dynamic of riots is always that if the police don’t show up, if they hold back, or worse, if they retreat, the disorder gets more intense and destructive. Violence must be met with overwhelming (and, obviously, lawful) force.” A few people with reading disabilities interpreted these tweets as “don’t enforce the law” or “looting is okay.” No. The point is if police are going to use deadly force, they must do so in circumstances to protect human life. My perspective is not some sort of bleeding-heart soft-on-crime idealism. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6–3 in Tennessee vs. Garner that a police officer may use deadly force to prevent the escape of a fleeing suspect only if the officer has a good-faith belief that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others. This means that if a cop sees that woman walking out of Cheesecake Factory with that whole cake, the cop cannot shoot the woman in the head. I’m such a squish.  

This isn’t anywhere close to the most important thing that been going on over the last week, but the hypocrisy on social distancing has been extraordinary. Just about a month ago, when protestors surrounded the Michigan state capitol from the safety of their cars, with about 75 or so people scattered outside on the capitol grounds, all we heard is that they weren’t social distancing, that it was extremely reckless, that Michigan would pay the price in a new outbreak of infections.  Now that we have enormous crowds gathering in cities all over the country to protest the death of George Floyd, the talk of the importance of social distancing has almost completely disappeared in the media, and Democratic officeholders don’t talk about it anymore, either. Just another example of how the rules they establish are usually in service of their political and ideological agenda, and as soon as the rules are no longer useful, they are changed or dropped.  

There have now been ten times as many COVID-19 deaths in Sweden than Norway on a per capita basis. According to the Worldometers website, 435 out of every one million Swedes have died from the virus, while the virus has killed 44 out of every million Norwegians. Norway imposed a lockdown to slow the spread of the coronavirus early on March 12, but the country reopened schools early in May. “Our goal is that by June 15 we will have reopened most of the things that were closed,” Norway’s prime minister said at a press conference earlier this month.  Its neighbor Sweden, by contrast, took a more lax approach: The government banned events with more than 50 people and shut down universities and secondary schools but imposed few other restrictions. Swedish government officials said lockdowns could do little to save lives over the long term and that their more lax approach would let their society reach herd immunity more quickly and lessen the economic pain the country would endure. “About 30 percent of people in Stockholm have reached a level of immunity,” Karin Ulrika Olofsdotter, the Swedish ambassador to the United States, told NPR on April 26. “We could reach herd immunity in the capital as early as next month.”  But a recent study found that just 7.3 percent of Stockholm residents tested positive for coronavirus antibodies at the end of April. “I think herd immunity is a long way off, if we ever reach it,” Bjorn Olsen, professor of infectious medicine at Uppsala University, told Reuters.  And it’s not clear Sweden’s economy will be better off than Norway’s this year. “Economists at Swedish bank SEB estimate Sweden’s GDP will drop 6.5 per cent this year, about the same as the US and Germany, but a little better than Norway and ahead of 9–10 per cent falls in Finland and Denmark, all of which have had lockdowns,” the Financial Times reported May 10. A Reuters poll from April found economists predicting the Scandinavian economies would all fare about the same in 2020.  

This week, our Tobias Hoonhout reported that the Justice Department is continuing its insider-trading investigation of Senator Richard Burr (R., N.C.), though the probe has been dropped with respect to other senators who — with such remarkably good fortune! — dumped stock just before the coronavirus tanked the market. That makes sense. As I’ll explain momentarily, Senator Burr’s public defense of his actions — along the lines of “I only relied on public information” — is unavailing as a legal defense. I hasten to add, though, that this does not mean he will be charged. Indeed, it would be a tough case . . . as are most cases that prosecutors try to bring against the folks who write the laws.  I don’t have a dog in this fight. I am not a fan of Richard Burr, the preeningly bipartisan chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee (in my estimation, among the most useless on Capitol Hill, which is saying something). If there’s been anything written with more delightful bite this year than my friend Kevin D. Williamson’s “History Called — and Senator Burr Called His Broker,” I haven’t seen it. Still, I’m not rooting for the senator to be prosecuted, particularly under this elastic theory of securities fraud. The insider-trading laws are not really traditional criminal statutes. More a cobbling together of SEC rules and judicial decisions, I’ve always thought they failed the main test of penal laws: to put a person of ordinary intelligence on clear notice of what conduct is prohibited. Hence the confusion over the years, and the “creative” prosecutorial envelope-pushing, over who qualifies as an “insider,” and how far the duty to refrain from trading on “material non-public information” extends — just the insider? Her husband? Their neighbor? The neighbor’s Uber driver? You get the point.  These laws are ignoble, moreover, in that they’re driven by envy. They are reminiscent of then-candidate Barack Obama’s response when it was pointed out that cutting taxes can increase revenues that underwrite the progressive wish-list. Even if that would be a better real-world outcome, the Cosmic One opined, raising taxes on the wealthy was still preferable because it accorded with his sense of “fairness.”  
 Similarly, the prohibition on insider trading is designed to combat the unfairness said to result when people with superior information (indeed, the best information, which is known to corporate insiders) engage in exchanges with people who lack access to that information — as if someone were holding a gun to the less-well informed person’s head, as if that person did not know the risks of trading securities, and as if the civil fraud laws were not in operation.  The problem, of course, is that the prohibition deprives the market of price signals generated by the purchases and sales made by the people who know the most about a company’s conditions, assets, liabilities, and prospects. It would be better for us to have that information, but that would enable the insiders — especially the already wealthy ones — to profit: They can buy up their company’s stock at bargain prices before the public announcement of good news certain to drive the price up; or they can dump stock at premium prices before, say, the onset of a pandemic they’ve been given a heads-up about. So, while it is not the choice I would make, we have prioritized handcuffing the privileged over gaining access to what they know — although proponents of this balance will tell you that the information-deficit problem is ameliorated by the voluminous disclosure requirements the SEC imposes on publicly traded companies (which, of course, are another fertile source of SEC enforcement actions and Justice Department securities-fraud prosecutions).   Alas, the remorseless fact: There is no such thing as an even playing field when it comes to information, though that is what the insider-trading laws strive to construct. Some people pay more attention than others, some are just more savvy than others, and sometimes that is as important, or even more important, than having access to privileged information. Hence the main drawback of insider-trading bans: They purport to restrict exchanges involving uneven access to nonpublic information, but not to hinder securities trading that is profitable because of study, ingenuity, the capacity to connect dots and spot trends, etc. Yet it is often not possible to tell the difference. Senator Burr’s case is a good example. Take what he’s been saying publicly, namely, that in making his questionable trades after receiving a classified briefing, he drew only on publicly available information. Generally speaking, trading on publicly available information is legal. But it is not legal for insiders. That is, once someone the law designates as an insider has access to material non-public information, it is no longer permissible for that insider to trade on the basis of public information. The rationale is that people cannot mentally compartmentalize what is public, distinct from what is non-public. Even if they could, it would not be possible for regulators to discern the difference – which, I’m sure you’ll be shocked to hear, is the thing that most matters to regulators.  In 2012, when Congress passed the STOCK Act (i.e., the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act), the stated purpose was to put lawmakers in a position analogous to that of corporate insiders. (And how interesting that Burr was one of only a handful of lawmakers to vote against the measure, which passed 96–3 in the Senate and 417–2 in the House.) The SEC and the federal courts have long held that, as long as an insider is in possession of privileged information, the insider will be deemed to buy and sell stock on the basis of that information.  This is why I say that Burr’s public defense won’t help him legally. If he had information based on classified briefings that was unavailable to the general public, his claim to have relied solely on public information is irrelevant.  But here is where it gets dicey for the Justice Department. As former federal prosecutor Paul A. Tuchmann explains in a useful National Law Review column, prosecutors must prove that the material non-public information was “about that security or issuer” involved in the purchase or sale in question. That is, there must be a tight nexus between the privileged information and the stock (or other security) that is the subject of the alleged insider trading. You can see the proof problems this could create. Sure, some cases could be easy. Let’s say Congressman X received a classified briefing in which he was told, “We see a pandemic emerging from China that could be disastrous for the market in air travel; in fact, United Airlines is already taking steps in mitigation.” If Representative X, on leaving the congressional SCIF, proceeds immediately to call his broker with instructions to unload his United holdings, that’s an open-and-shut case. Most cases, though, are not slam dunks, especially when sophisticated actors are involved. I am betting it is more likely that Burr, because of his privileged position, was given some alarming classified information about the pandemic, warning of dire economic consequences if aggressive steps were taken to suppress the spread of infectious disease. It would not surprise me if specific corporations whose securities he held were not mentioned by name, but that enough descriptive information was conveyed that any sensible person would realize that the fallout for the travel sector — airlines, rail, oil and gas, hotels, tourism, etc. — could be disastrous. Let’s assume I’m right about that. Let’s say Burr put two and two together and realized that his stock in a travel-sector company was about to take a major hit. Would his consequent trades in those holdings be so clearly “on the basis of material non-public information about that security or issuer” that he could be criminally liable? To be more concrete about it, Mr. Tuchmann notes that Burr reportedly sold holdings in Wyndham Hotels after receiving his classified briefing. But what if the briefing did not address Wyndham Hotels? Or what if it didn’t precisely address hotels at all, just a looming catastrophe for travel and tourism? Plainly, investigators must be scouring the exact substance of whatever briefing Burr received. Whether there was a tight enough nexus between the briefing and the senator’s trading activity depends on what was discussed — the words used, the names (if any) mentioned, the level of detail. The point of the STOCK Act was to discourage trading based on inside information. It was not to discourage all trading, full stop. Had Congress sought to do that, it could have expressed that objective clearly; but that would have dissuaded many worthy people from seeking public office, and spurred many worthy incumbents to leave. On the other hand, members of Congress often get briefings involving non-public information about sectors of the economy. Obviously, that gives them an informational leg up on most other investors. The STOCK Act was supposed to address that. I’m as doubtful that it does as I am skeptical that it should. Not every problem of fairness and ethics is fit for a criminal-law solution. And if recent history has taught us anything, it is that the less Justice Department involvement there is in politics, the better. I wouldn’t have minded seeing Burr, who is retiring, thrown out of office for cashing in on his public service. That doesn’t mean he should be thrown into jail, and I’d be surprised if he were. 

The battle over voting by mail flared up over the last week, thanks in part to some presidential tweets that, as they often do, have generated more heat than light. On May 20, President Trump tweeted: “Breaking: Michigan sends absentee ballots to 7.7 million people ahead of Primaries and the General Election. This was done illegally and without authorization by a rogue Secretary of State. I will ask to hold up funding to Michigan if they want to go down this Voter Fraud path.”  On May 26, he tweeted: “There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent. Mail boxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged & even illegally printed out & fraudulently signed.” There’s a lot to unpack here. First of all, Michigan hadn’t sent out 7.7 million ballots — it announced plans to send out 7.7 million absentee-ballot applications. Trump replaced the original tweet with one correcting the error, but it still included the claim that he would “ask to hold up funding” to Michigan for sending out absentee-ballot applications. Ask whom? It wasn’t clear, and he dropped the idea shortly thereafter. As for the tweet that mail-in ballots would be “substantially fraudulent”? That’s the claim that prompted Twitter to issue its first ever presidential fact-check. It may be unwise for any social-media platform to get into the business of fact-checking politicians, and it was especially odd to single out this tweet, rather than the deranged tweets suggesting MSNBC host Joe Scarborough is a murderer.   If you strained hard enough, you could come up with a somewhat plausible defense: The word “substantially” may mean largely or significantly. Maybe he meant the latter? And since elections are sometimes decided by a very small number of votes, any amount of voter fraud is significant. That reasonable defense was dashed Thursday night when the president tweeted Thursday evening that “MAIL-IN VOTING WILL LEAD TO MASSIVE FRAUD AND ABUSE. IT WILL ALSO LEAD TO THE END OF OUR GREAT REPUBLICAN PARTY.” 
 To cut past the confusion and misinformation, it’s important to keep in mind three things in the debate over mail-in voting. The first is that the November elections will very likely be a “mostly mail” election whether anyone likes it or not — even if no laws are changed. Twenty-nine states already have no-excuse absentee voting, including the states where control of the White House and the Senate will be decided: Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Florida, Arizona, North Carolina, Georgia, Iowa, Montana, and Maine. In April, when Wisconsin held its Democratic primary, only one-quarter of voters cast ballots in person on Election Day. If voters are concerned about the coronavirus, and there’s every reason to believe it will still be a threat in November, the overwhelming majority will choose early mail-in or curbside voting.  The second thing to keep in mind is that expanded mail-in and early-voting will not necessarily hurt Republicans in November. The GOP just won an all-mail special election in California. Colorado Republican Cory Gardner won his first term in the Senate in 2014 in an all-mail election. In 2018, 79 percent of ballots were cast in Arizona by mail. Republican governor Doug Ducey won re-election by 14.2 points even as Republican senator Martha McSally lost by 2.4 points.  So Republicans can win in mail or mostly-mail elections, and at any rate it’s unlikely that many states will transition to California-style all-mail states before November. The logistical hurdles are too high, but there will be an increase in absentee- and early-voting nationwide. If Republicans were solely interested in winning, they would be more concerned about a significant sliver of elderly voters — a Republican-leaning demographic — not voting because of concerns about catching the virus than about the possibility of a slight increase in the small number of illegitimate votes.  And that brings us to the third point, which is that there are real and legitimate concerns about voter fraud and the best way to safely and securely expand voting options in the fall. This year, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down Arizona’s ban on “ballot harvesting” — the practice of third-party collection of mail-in ballots. Critics of ballot harvesting are concerned that the practice opens the door to voter fraud and intimidation, not to mention the spread of the virus if ballot collectors are going door to door. Arizona’s attorney general is trying to get the Supreme Court to review the Ninth Circuit’s decision, which could affect more than 20 other states that have similar laws. In Congress, meanwhile, the fight is between Democrats who want to force states to adopt a uniform policy on how to conduct elections and Republicans who are adamantly opposed to a federal takeover over the elections process but are not opposed to providing more money for election assistance.  As much as the president’s Twitter feed and media coverage may make it difficult to see, that’s where the real debate over balloting stands.

Well, it was a good run. But after 124 consecutive years, the Boston Marathon will not be held in 2020. The Associated Press reported yesterday: Organizers canceled the Boston Marathon on Thursday for the first time in its history, bowing to the social distancing requirements of the coronavirus outbreak and ending a 124-year run that had persisted through two World Wars, a volcanic eruption and even another pandemic. Earlier this year, race organizers had delayed the race to September 14, joining many other springtime races that punted to the fall in the hope that something like normal life would resume by then. But for Boston, it was only that: a hope. And Boston mayor Marty Walsh concluded that “it became clear as this crisis developed that Sept. 14 was less and less plausible.” This is an understandable decision. Having raced Boston last year (somewhat fortuitously, in hindsight), I can attest that the whole experience depends on the kind of close contact and common usage not ideal for a pandemic: Thousands of runners in intense proximity, not only on the starting line and in the race itself — with plenty of sweating and expectorating throughout — but also in the buses on the way from downtown Boston to the Hopkinton starting line outside of the city. Not to mention people using the same portable restrooms. And of course, thousands of spectators. I get why all of this would be a dicey proposition in the biggest city of a state still dealing with one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks in America. None of this means Boston’s cancellation isn’t a sad occasion. It is, of course. For virtually its entire history, the race has been one of the most important parts of running culture, serving both as a showcase for the sport’s best talent and perhaps the most prestigious race that a hardworking but otherwise unheralded runner could reasonably hope to reach. I was not planning to race Boston this year, though I know many people who were. Now, the earliest anyone can hope to make that 26.2-mile journey is April 2021.  It’s also a reminder of how far we still have to go for normal life to return. Running is, in some senses, immune to the restrictions and closures that have affected other sports and activities; its simplicity allows it to be done just about anywhere, and it can be done alone. I have derived considerable solace — and sanity — in this strange time from running because of this. But Boston’s cancellation is a sober reminder that, in its more complex forms, running is subject to the same cautions and hesitations that are likely to complicate and prolong the return to normalcy for football, baseball, and other sports. The best one can hope for, at this point, is that 2020 ends up as the sole interruption in the storied history of this race.

If you have not been following him on Twitter, @PoliticalMath has been doing yeoman’s work debunking misinformation about coronavirus data. One big theme is the popular conspiracy theory, bandied about regularly by major media, that Florida is actually covering up significant numbers of deaths. But then you look at the evidence: [T]he author of [a CNN] piece references the fact that the CDC’s excess death data shows that COVID deaths are likely under-counted and says this is probably true of Florida. But that very specific thing is very specifically not true in Florida. In fact, Florida’s excess death data shows the opposite of New York’s. It shows that, excluding COVID deaths, excess deaths are lower than normal. . . . The author took a data point from one state, said that it was probably happening in Florida too so we can’t trust their data, and then never checked to see if his statement was correct. On the even-worse reporting on the firing of a woman working on the COVID-19 dashboard: This story has caused thousands of people to claim that Florida is faking their numbers. The Sun-Sentinel all but accuses Governor DeSantis personally of “rigging COVID-19 data” which is a flat-out lie and they know it. That narrative is now set for people and there is no going back from it. In pursuit of this narrative, the press (especially the Florida press) has repeatedly misinformed, fumbled basic data concepts, and omitted vital information. They have taken any small accident in reporting, any decision to protect patient privacy, any after-the-fact data correction and spun it into a grand conspiracy. None of this is true. In fact, the opposite is true. The Florida Department of Health has worked heroically to deliver the best data they can with the most transparency possible as quickly as they can. Read the whole thing. 

Personal incomes rose by 10.5 percent in April, far surpassing predictions of a 5.9 percent decline. The Senate’s economic-spending package put money in the hands of consumers just as they reduced their purchases by 13.6 percent due to the coronavirus shutdowns. The data released by the Commerce Department today raise the possibility that a combination of higher disposable incomes and lower production will spur inflation after the pandemic. With supply chains disrupted and businesses upended, the rapid growth of monetary aggregates could mean more money will be chasing fewer goods, especially if the economy reopens in short order.  Predicting inflation has become a treacherous enterprise of late, as protracted low interest rates have coincided with persistently low inflation. Recent history suggests that prices will remain stable no matter the magnitude of economic stimulus. That being said, whereas the post-2008 fiscal and monetary stimulus replaced an endogenous credit contraction, this time around the credit contraction is exogenous — the result of COVID-19. Should that exogenous shock quickly recede, the massive economic stimulus could prove excessive. In any event, it was warranted, and the risk of disinflation remains much higher than the risk of inflation. 

On the menu today: a return to the topic of the Wuhan labs and the origin of the coronavirus, as China’s top epidemiologist declares the Huanan Seafood Market was not the origin point of the coronavirus. China Stops Blaming the Huanan Seafood Market for Launching the Pandemic The fact that scientists backed by the Chinese government insist that SARS-CoV-2 didn’t come from the Wuhan Institute of Virology is not surprising. But the fact that an official Chinese source, on state-run television, is now changing the current official theory of the origin point of the virus is intriguing: The director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, at the center of allegations around a potential laboratory accident, Wang Yanyi, over the weekend told China Central Television that the coronavirus was significantly different from any live pathogen that has been studied at the institute and that there therefore was no chance it could have leaked from there. Note that there were two labs in Wuhan working on coronaviruses found in bats; the other was the Wuhan Center for Disease Control. For what it’s worth, some bright minds like Matt Ridley believe this other lab should be the focus of scrutiny, in part because it is a lower biosafety level and closer to the market that was believed to be the source of the outbreak. But now we must put greater emphasis on “was” believed to be the source of the outbreak: Separately, China’s top epidemiologist said Tuesday that testing of samples from a Wuhan food market, initially suspected as a path for the virus’s spread to humans, failed to show links between animals being sold there and the pathogen. Gao Fu, director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said in comments carried in Chinese state media, “It now turns out that the market is one of the victims.” If you don’t believe anything said by any official in China, that’s understandable. And anyone who believed or continues to believe the origin point was a wet market has good reasons to lean in that direction. Virologists warned about these markets for years, calling them the perfect spot for a new virus to jump into humans. Smithsonian magazine, back in 2017: China is uniquely positioned to create a novel flu virus that kills people. On Chinese farms, people, poultry and other livestock often live in close proximity. Pigs can be infected by both bird flu and human flu viruses, becoming potent ‘mixing vessels’ that allow genetic material from each to combine and possibly form new and deadly strains. The public’s taste for freshly killed meat, and the conditions at live markets, create ample opportunity for humans to come in contact with these new mutations. Could there be a third vector? Sure. Farmers all over Asia go into caves to collect bat guano to use as fertilizer, and a 2013 study looked at samples of guano sold in Thailand and found group C betacoronavirus. (You can learn more about the types of coronaviruses here and betacoroaviruses here; the upshot is that most group C betacoronavirses aren’t a serious danger, with the glaring exception of the one that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome.) That scenario would be a little strange; we haven’t heard about any cases among farmers preceding the known outbreak in Wuhan. But the first moments of this outbreak are still murky and unclear; more on this point further below. You probably recall that back on April 3, my lengthy examination of the evidence pointing to a lab release pointed out a few problems with the wet-market theory. No one had evidence that bats or pangolins were sold in that market. Chinese scientist Botao Xiao claimed he had spoken to “31 residents and 28 visitors,” and none could recall bats ever being sold in the market. Quite a few of the early cases in Wuhan hospitals could not be traced back to that market.  One last point: As I encounter pushback against the lab theory, I feel like certain people really want this to be a story of bad exotic animal poachers and bad animal smugglers. If these sorts of criminals are deemed ultimately responsible for worldwide pandemic that has nearly 6 million cases and more than 360,000 deaths, government authorities around the globe might finally cooperate and shut down this multi-billion-dollar illicit industry. I’d love to see that, too, but animal smugglers make a particularly convenient villain; just about everybody except their customers already hates them. If the trail leads back to a Chinese government lab . . . the ramifications are much more troubling and disruptive to an existing world order.  We Don’t Know the Virus’s Origin . . . and We May Never Know Earlier this week, National Institutes of Health director Francis Collins made a statement of fact that shouldn’t be seen as controversial: At this point, while we see no indication of engineering or other manipulation of the virus and thus it is naturally occurring, we just don’t know how this virus jumped from animals to humans, and no scenario can be ruled out at this point. “Whether [the coronavirus] could have been in some way isolated and studied in this laboratory in Wuhan, we have no way of knowing.” As I mentioned in a video chat with the National Review Institute’s 1955 Society earlier this week — sign up to support a noble cause and get perks like watching me in my home office! — I suspect we will never definitively know the origin of this virus. If it came from a lab, the Chinese government has probably long since destroyed any “smoking gun “evidence, and they will never admit it. The Beijing authorities have remarkable skills, tools, and resources for silencing whistleblowers and dissenters. Even if the virus really did come from the Huanan Seafood market, Wuhan authorities made decisions that destroyed necessary biological evidence: Local authorities in Wuhan collected extensive samples at the end of December from a market where the virus is believed to have first begun spreading widely, enlisting professional disinfection crews to help with the effort, The Wall Street Journal reported. Four months later, officials have yet to share any data from those samples with any labs outside of China. Some Chinese and foreign researchers told The Journal they had been informed by Chinese officials that animals taken from the market were destroyed. The Chinese argument that they acted responsibly hinges heavily on the point that they identified the genetic sequence of the virus quickly in late December and early January and released that information to the world about a week later. But on February 28, the Straits Times laid out an account that made it sound like it was much more of a coverup and strategic delay in releasing information: On Jan 1, after several batches of genome sequence results had been returned to hospitals and submitted to health authorities, an employee of one genomics company received a phone call from an official at the Hubei Provincial Health Commission, ordering the company to stop testing samples from Wuhan related to the new disease and destroy all existing samples. The employee spoke on condition of anonymity, saying the company was told to immediately cease releasing test results and information about the tests, and report any future results to authorities. Then on Jan 3, China’s National Health Commission (NHC), the nation’s top health authority, ordered institutions not to publish any information related to the unknown disease, and ordered labs to transfer any samples they had to designated testing institutions, or to destroy them. The order, which Caixin has seen, did not specify any designated testing institutions. In mid-May, an NHC official partially confirmed that account, saying the destruction of the samples was for safety reasons: NHC official Liu Dengfeng confirmed that the commission had issued these guidelines at that time “for pandemic prevention and control, which also played an important role in preventing biosafety risks.” “If the laboratory conditions cannot meet the requirements for the safe preservation of samples, the samples should be destroyed on the spot or transferred to a professional institution for safekeeping,” said Mr. Liu, supervisor of the commission’s Department of Health Science, Technology and Education. To summarize the Chinese government’s argument, the virus could not have accidentally been released from one of their labs, because their labs are too diligent and professional to ever make that kind of mistake, and once they had identified the virus, they had to destroy the samples because of the risk of an accidental release.  What Was Happening in Wuhan in November? Bit by bit, we continue to get anecdotes that don’t quite align with what we think we know about the early days of the virus. An unnamed source citing Chinese government data told the South China Morning Post that the first documented case was November 17; no other source has verified that. A study of early cases in the medical journal The Lancet declared, “The symptom onset date of the first patient identified was December 1, 2019.” Two weeks ago, there was a stir about athletes claiming they came home sick from Wuhan after the World Military Games in October. (Testing these athletes for antibodies should be simple. Have they been tested? Did they come back negative and no one found it newsworthy?) Now there’s a curious little anecdote from the San Francisco Bay area. Charlie and Margaret Getz, an American couple, had booked a seven-day cruise along the Yangtze River in early November, and their first day was supposed to be in Wuhan on November 1: Their relaxed overnight stay turned into a brief three-hour visit. Within minutes of getting off the plane, the two were rushed to a Wuhan history museum. “We were the only ones at the museum, no local folks around,” he said. “Then, they had a brief concert for us.” The itinerary suddenly changed and the Wuhan city tour was canceled. “We were told we immediately have to leave that night, not the next day,” said Getz. There was no warning and no explanation. “My wife Margaret said, ‘Wait a second, we’re supposed to look at these historic districts. What’s going on here?’ Getz said, pointing out the brochure they showed the tour guide. “They said, ‘No, no, no.’ Then, they said, ‘Oh there’s a lot of traffic on the river.'” But, Getz remembers seeing very little traffic. It’s China, it’s a tour company, and itineraries get changed all the time. Even the Getzs say it could well be coincidental. But it’s easy to start wondering: Did certain people in Wuhan, perhaps including people connected to that tour visit, know something was wrong or unsafe in the city?   ADDENDUM: “It’s just unrealistic to think that a lab accident could have set off a global pandemic like this!” Reuters, this morning: “A troop of monkeys in India attacked a medical official and snatched away blood samples of patients who had tested positive for the novel coronavirus, authorities said on Friday. The attack occurred this week when a laboratory technician was walking in the campus of a state-run medical college in Meerut, 460 km (285 miles) north of Lucknow, capital of Uttar Pradesh state.” You knew something like this would happen after we lost Charlton Heston.  

Of the many lessons of the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the most obvious is the need to reevaluate state-licensing laws that impede the free and rapid movement of health-care workers to places they are needed. Many governors suspended state-licensing requirements in early March so that doctors, nurses, and other health-care professionals licensed in other states could help with the public-health crisis in their own states. These governors should not resume the ways of the past when the crisis ends.  Individual state-licensing requirements for health-care professionals do not help patients or ensure quality. Rather, they serve as a mechanism to protect health-care provider interests. From its inception in 1847, the American Medical Association sought to reduce the number of practicing physicians by promoting state-licensing laws. It was largely unsuccessful in its campaign until after the Civil War. Then state chapters of the AMA persuaded legislatures to enact licensure boards, claiming they would protect the public from gross incompetence. Unfortunately, as many victims of medical malpractice will attest, the granting of a license offers no such protection. Licensing restrictions do, however, restrict the supply of health-care providers at a time when America’s aging population portends a physician shortage of crisis proportions. When states that were badly hit by the COVID-19 pandemic removed licensing barriers, allowing doctors from outside states to practice medicine and to help their residents, the obvious question became why state medical restrictions were necessary in the first place. Is there a legitimate difference between the quality and necessity of additional certifications for a physician in Alabama versus Arizona?  The medical-school requirement, national medical-licensing examination requirements, and residency-training requirements are nearly identical in all state-licensing processes. Yet in most cases, a medical license is not transferrable from state to state.  
 A physician in New York City cannot practice medicine in New Jersey or Connecticut without three separate medical licenses using the same national-board examination, medical degree, and specialty training. These same licensing regulations prevent patients from receiving telemedicine from out-of-state providers. It’s akin to a state prohibiting someone from driving on their highway with an out-of-state driver’s license. Furthermore, having a license does not ensure quality care. Private credentialing and certification organizations, such as the American Board of Surgery and the American Board of Neurological Surgery, do the vetting of practitioners’ training and competency that health-care consumers need when seeking medical advice. Health-care consumer-rating sites such as Healthgrades or Vitals rate health-care providers, while sites lsuch as Leapfrog or Consumer Reports rate health-care facilities. Licensing boards provide no such tangible function. Once they get a license, physicians in most states may practice any specialty they choose in their offices. Many hospitals or insurance companies, on the other hand, may require their panels of providers to be specialty-board certified. For example, a physician with no formal training or certification in psychiatry can post “psychiatrist” on the office door but would not be able to practice psychiatry in a hospital. Licensing doesn’t protect people. Credentialing protects people by carefully examining and verifying physicians’ depth of training and experience in the area in which they claim to have expertise.   State license boards’ websites may be cumbersome to navigate. Consumers might find it a challenge to view and fully understand any out-of-state complaints a physician might have had prior to relocating in their state. Nobel Prize–winning economist Milton Friedman understood this when he criticized medical-licensing laws. The governance of physicians is best done closest to the physician at the hospital, group, or specialty certification level. The licensure apparatus is also a money-making scheme. It costs $315 to get a license in Alabama. It costs $500 to get a license in Arizona. It costs $375 more to create the portfolio needed to help send the application through the Federation of State Medical Boards. On top of that are the general licensing-examination costs, which tally well over $1000. A cottage industry has developed to help physicians navigate the process. Over the past 100 or so years, “organized medicine” guilds have teamed up with legislatures to erect a hidden medical-licensing/industrial complex.  In 2019, Arizona became the first state to grant reciprocal recognition to all occupations holding out-of-state licenses in good standing that wish to set up operations within its borders. Shortly thereafter, Montana and Pennsylvania followed suit. Missouri became the latest state to do so this May. These are all steps in the right direction, but these states still require out-of-state licensees to maintain brick-and-mortar locations within their borders. A better reform would be to define the “locus of service” as the state in which the provider holds the license, not the state in which the consumer resides. The United States is a 50-state free-trade zone. Consumers can purchase goods and services across state lines without obstructions. Yet they are barred from services provided by people who must obtain a state license to practice their livelihood.   Artificial shortages develop wherever there are barriers to entry by new providers. Medical- licensing laws artificially reduce the availability of physicians and the availability of care. By their emergency suspension of state-licensing laws, governors of states that are COVID-19 “hot spots” tacitly admitted as much. Hopefully the lesson in this will not be lost on those governors and their legislatures once the crisis is over. The suspensions should be made permanent and form a basis for a comprehensive overhaul of medical-licensing laws. Jeffrey A.

It’s 2009 again, or feels like it. That was when spontaneous, grassroots protests against overweening government sprang up and were widely derided in the media as dangerous and wrong-headed. The protesters then were inveighing against Obamacare; the protesters now are striking out against the coronavirus lockdowns. The anti-lockdown agitation shows that, despite the revolution in Republican politics wrought by President Donald Trump, opposition to government impositions is deeply embedded in the DNA of the Right and likely will reemerge even more starkly if former vice president Joe Biden is elected president.  The Tea Party that was so powerful in the Obama years, roiling Republican Party politics and making stars out of the likes of Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, sputtered out and was subsumed by the Trump movement in 2016.  The emphasis on constitutionalism, opposition to deficit spending, and American exceptionalism gave way to an emphasis on American strength, opposition to immigration, and nationalism. 
 The differences shouldn’t be exaggerated — the Tea Party was opposed to amnesty for undocumented immigrants, and Trump has faithfully nominated constitutionalist judges. The Tea Party, like Trump, hated the mainstream media with a passion. But the shift from an overwhelming focus on fiscal issues to Trumpian cultural politics was very real. The change was exemplified by the House Freedom Caucus, founded in 2015 and defined by its hard line on government spending, reliably lining up behind Donald Trump, who has pursued a notably expansionary fiscal policy — with huge budget deficits — even before the coronavirus crisis.  The intellectual fashion among populists and religious traditionalists has been to attempt to establish a post-liberty or “post-liberal” agenda to forge a deeper foundation for the new Republican Party. Instead of obsessing over freedom and rights, conservatives would look to government to protect the common good. This project, though, has been rocked by its first real-life encounter with governments acting to protect, as they see it, the common good.  One of its architects, the editor of the religious journal First Things, R. R. Reno, has sounded during the crisis like one of the libertarians he so scorns. First, he complained that he might get shamed if he were to host a dinner party during the height of the pandemic, although delaying a party would seem a small price to pay for someone so intensely committed to the common good. More recently, he went on a tirade against wearing masks. Reno is apparently fine with a much stronger government, as long as it never issues public-health guidance not to his liking.  Reno has published vituperative attacks on the conservative writer (and my friend and former colleague) David French, supposedly for having a blinkered commitment to classical liberalism. But it is the hated French who has actually tried to thoughtfully balance liberty and the common good during the crisis, favoring the lockdowns at first and favoring reopening now that the lockdowns’ goals have been achieved. What’s happened during the lockdowns is that the natural distrust that populists have of experts has expressed itself in opposition to government rules. Being told what to do by epidemiologists and government officials wielding all-caps SCIENCE as their authority has been enough to bring Tea Party–era liberty back in vogue. We’ve also seen a return of the glue that has held moral traditionalists and libertarians together in the conservative coalition for so long — the belief that big government is a threat to traditional institutions. Hence, the focus on resuming church services. In retrospect, the Tea Party wasn’t as much a purely liberty movement as it seemed at the time. A populist anti-elitism was an enormously important factor, which is why it faded into the Trump movement so seamlessly. On the other hand, Trumpian populism has a big streak of liberty to it.  All it has taken to bring it to the fore is extraordinary government intrusion into our lives. If Biden is elected president, there’s more where that came from. © 2020 by King Features Syndicate 

City transit systems have been battered by the coronavirus pandemic. They’ve lost millions of riders, and still they are being lambasted for carrying too many people. But the long-term effects of the pandemic on mass transit are still unclear: Who will ride once things return to some semblance of normality? How will transit agencies provide for current riders and win back those staying away?  Circles painted on a Paris train-station floor to define social-distancing requirements may provide a hint. Looking more like a Twister game than a transit plan, the circles assume each person rides alone; there are no provisions for couples or adults with children. If each person stands in a circle, how long will trains need to dwell in the station to give those in the farthest circles time to enter? How will social distancing be maintained once everyone is on the trains? Who will count the number of people in each car, subtracting those exiting and adding those entering? Undaunted by these questions, New York City recently announced it is considering similar diagramming. On buses, some operators are allowing only ten or 15 riders. After that, the bus will stop to discharge passengers, picking up only enough riders to replace those who have exited. Most cities are using rear-door boarding to maintain contactless entry and protect drivers from scared, angry, and sometimes unmasked patrons.  Rear-door entry is free, raising the questions of when and how — or if — fares will be re-instituted. It also creates issues similar to those posed by Paris’s scheme: Who will be responsible for assuring that patrons are masked? Who will be responsible for passenger counts? Will those who begin their ride mid-route be assured of getting on a bus or will their trip depend on how many riders have entered or exited before their stop? *    *    * The bigger picture is no less cloudy. In “normal” times, New York City’s subway system serves an average of more than 5 million people each day. According to New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), as of mid-April, subway ridership was down 90 percent from the same time last year, bus ridership was down 80 percent, and commuter-line ridership was down 95 percent. Although also heavily affected, the agency’s bridges and tunnels reported the smallest loss, with crossings down about 60 percent. The transit systems serving Boston, Washington, D.C., Chicago, San Diego, Los Angeles, and the San Francisco Bay Area have reported similarly sharp declines in use.  
 Patrick J. Foye, the MTA’s chairman and CEO, said that as of mid-March the system had lost $4 billion as a result of the pandemic. Despite the system’s receiving about $3.8 billion from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, he indicated that without additional relief to cover operating losses estimated at more than $8 billion, the “present and future of the MTA are in serious jeopardy.”  But money may not be the only problem. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey received $450 million in CARES Act funds, much less than the requested $2 billion. It reported a 95 percent drop from the same time last year in ridership on trains travelling between New York and New Jersey, along with a 97 percent decline in patrons at its major airports (Newark, LaGuardia, and JFK), but only a 50 percent decline in bridge and tunnel traffic.  What do the MTA and Port Authority tell us about the future of mass transit? Do the lower losses on bridges and tunnels provide indications that as the New York metropolitan area wakes up from its pause, travelers will reject public transit in favor of their own cars, which make it easy to maintain social distance and don’t require the use of a mask?  In New York, the MTA recently floated the idea that in addition to all patrons wearing masks and being exposed to the previous night’s cleaning chemicals, they might be asked to reserve space on subways and buses similar to the way they do now for concerts and other ticketed events. Currently, only employees submit to having their temperatures taken, but if the technology improves, might this become required of patrons also? Transit systems rightly rejected the Transportation Security Administration’s airport-check-in procedures as inappropriate for mass transit, but they are now talking about far more invasive and time-consuming protocols. After the fear is gone, will riders self-regulate by wearing face covers and avoiding crowding? Will employers stagger office hours to eliminate rush-hour crush-loads, or will they rather institute work-from-home schemes that eliminate the need for workers to undertake daily, weekly, or monthly commutes? Pointing to the success of staggered hours during the 1918 flu pandemic seems a nostalgic indulgence, a look back at how many people worked a century ago, the type of work they did, and the lack of other travel options they had; it’s not necessarily a recipe for a successful reopening of 21st-century urban America. But it may well be tried, and if it is, transit-use patterns could change dramatically: The less workers need to visit the office, the less they’ll buy the weekly, ten-day, and monthly tickets that, in return for a slight discount, provide transit systems with a regular income stream paid in advance of the actual ride.   A number of cities, notably Oakland, San Francisco, Seattle, Boston, and Minneapolis, are experimenting with closing streets to private cars. New York City is also doing this, but it is less likely the closings will remain permanent there. Not all the cities have the same regulations; some allow only walking, others walking and biking, others the full range of activities that do not include a motorized vehicle.  All claim the changes are primarily to facilitate residents’ ability to exercise while maintaining social distance. But bicycle sales are booming; cities throughout the United States report that bikes are becoming as difficult to purchase as toilet paper and cleaning products were early in the pandemic. As people walk, bike, or even skateboard more frequently, these may become viable options for short-distance commutes. Will they increase sufficiently to make a dent in transit revenue, particularly if fares rise and service remains limited? In London, with similar concerns about crowded trains and buses, bikes are also in high demand. And although the transit system received a £1.6 billion bail-out after Mayor Sadiq Kahn threatened to cut service, towns are hinting at providing free parking to encourage people to use their cars. This is also an alternative in many U.S. cities where parking is plentiful even in downtown areas. *    *    * Few systems anywhere, with the exception of Metrolink, the commuter-rail line that serves Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, and Ventura counties in Southern California, have surveyed riders to determine what the future may hold. In an email survey to which 11,000 Metrolink riders responded between April 23–28, about 40 percent described themselves as transit-dependent, either because they were disabled or because they had no car. A far larger number — 81 percent — said they would ride Metrolink after stay-at-home orders were lifted. But fewer than a third of the latter group said that they’d feel safe riding as early as this summer, and an almost equal percentage said that they’d feel safe only after a virus vaccine existed or that they could not put a time-frame on their reply. Most transit agencies don’t depend primarily on fares to cover their expenses. But until now, the goal of every transit agency has always been to provide maximum service to the maximum number of people. The pandemic has changed that, forcing systems to limit their service to those who absolutely need it. If this new model endures after things return to normal, the expense of continuing to operate transit systems could cease to be worth it. So in the next round of decisions on transit, systems may have to choose between rebuilding ridership or accepting a far smaller role in moving the urban masses.

				s there an unimpeachable right to abortion somewhere in the Constitution? Should abortion policy be left up to each state’s discretion? Does the 14th Amendment give government the power to ban abortion? Is legal abortion incompatible with the principles of the Declaration of Independence? These arguments are endlessly complex and highly contentious. But if you spend any time observing our public debates over abortion, you’ll notice that these topics are rarely addressed.  Instead, political fights over abortion policy feature two arguments that seem not to respond to one another. There are those who recognize the humanity of the unborn child and argue that our political system should protect his right to life just as it does yours or mine. And there are those who rest their case for a right to abortion at the feet of Supreme Court precedent, implicitly arguing that Roe v. Wade has removed the need for them to justify abortion itself. To be sure, many thinkers indulge in philosophical discussions about the ethical questions at stake in abortion. But in policy fights, legal-abortion supporters almost never defend abortion qua abortion. They don’t admit that abortion is killing and justify its legality anyway; they don’t explain why we should privilege one person’s bodily autonomy over another’s autonomy and right to life. Instead, they cloak their views with euphemisms such as “women’s rights” and “reproductive freedom” and, when challenged, retreat to the comfortable ground of proclaiming Roe “the law of the land.” The legal battles over abortion during the COVID-19 outbreak illustrate the fundamental problem with this status quo, which ensures that the acrimonious debate will stretch on interminably absent major changes.   Since March, several states have included surgical abortion among the many elective procedures halted during the pandemic, aiming to limit the spread of disease and conserve medical resources. Abortion-advocacy groups have hauled these states to court, insisting that a health-care crisis is not sufficient reason to abridge a so-called constitutional right. In one of the most egregious examples, the American Civil Liberties Union sued Arkansas for requiring women to test negative for COVID-19 prior to having an abortion. 
 In short, abortion advocates and their allies argue, Roe and subsequent jurisprudence mean that states may not, for any reason, restrict a woman’s ability to obtain an elective abortion at any stage of pregnancy. By and large, federal judges have agreed with them, prohibiting states from limiting abortion as one of many nonessential procedures. This pandemic has underscored a problem that already existed, exposing not only the insatiable greed of the abortion lobby but also the way in which U.S. abortion jurisprudence has established an unworkable system for adjudicating these disputes. When the Supreme Court in Roe manufactured a right to abortion, it gave judges the power to impose a nakedly political decision on the entire nation, including states that correctly view the ruling as a hijacking of the Constitution. As a result, supporters of abortion can avoid defending their views before the public and instead demand that judges handicap their opponents.  The anti-constitutional decision in Roe, bolstered by subsequent rulings, has allowed proponents of unlimited abortion to hang their hat on precedent — or “super-precedent,” as they would have it — rather than on their preferred policy. But those who cry precedent on Roe are the same voices lobbying the Court to overturn less favorable rulings, such as Heller or Citizens United. It is not precedent they defend but the status quo that one particular precedent created.  Meanwhile, the American people are content to believe that Roe legalized abortion only in the first three months of pregnancy and that states may regulate the procedure thereafter. Such a status quo would comport with what a majority of Americans want, but it is not the landscape that Roe created. If it were, states would not be losing the battle to limit elective abortion during a global pandemic.  Relatively few know that Roe’s misinterpretation of the Constitution — combined with Doe v. Bolton’s loophole for maternal health — permits abortion on demand through all nine months of pregnancy. Even fewer realize that these flawed decisions enable judges to block pro-life policies that most Americans support. The moral and political question of abortion has starkly divided us for more than half a century, and it cries out for a just solution. To the extent that we have not achieved one, it is because flawed jurisprudence enables abortion advocates to dodge the debate while preventing abortion opponents from doing anything to alter the status quo. 

Think of Brian De Palma’s first novel — Are Snakes Necessary? — as his COVID-19 movie. Produced under duress, during a period when De Palma was blocked from green-lighted big-budget Hollywood filmmaking, rather like shelter-in-place restrictions, it is as full of movie references as any De Palma film. Are Snakes Necessary? is also politically charged, continuing the obsession with skullduggery and government suspicion that goes back to De Palma’s earliest films, the anti-draft satire Greetings, and the radical activist/media satire Hi, Mom! This time. modernist De Palma satirizes the very form he essays — the hard-boiled crime novel with its built-in plot twists and duplicitous femme fatales.  Lead character Elizabeth de Carlo follows such puckish De Palma heroines as Grace and Danielle in Sisters and Laure/Lilly in Femme Fatale, where identity folds, multiplies, contrasts, and mirrors. Elizabeth and a mother-daughter duo, Jenny and Fanny, are involved with untrustworthy males: a photographer, a politician, and his political consultant, who variously exploit the women sexually and politically. Elizabeth, de Palma writes, has “innate grace.” She goes by the rule that “knowing how to speak to the animal in the man is half the game.” (She’s like Rebecca De Mornay in Alex Cox’s The Winner, a sign of De Palma’s instinctive cinematic good taste). Tension and humor, De Palma’s two best tricks, propel the narrative, which deliberately references specific Kennedy and Clinton scandals (although De Palma indulges typical liberal petulance when labeling the offenders “Republicans”). But the villain of the piece, with his gruesome comeuppance, reveals the true political intent of Are Snakes Necessary? It is an apologia for De Palma the (supposedly) sexist pop artist.  This would be unnecessary in a fairer, more erudite era that was not held hostage to #MeToo coercion but, instead, appreciated that De Palma created more memorable and sympathetic female characters in Sisters, Phantom of the Paradise, Carrie, Dressed to Kill, Blow Out, and Femme Fatale than any female filmmaker. The sops to feminism in Are Snakes Necessary? might be the result of De Palma’s collaborating with his wife, Susan Lehman, a former New York Times editor.  
 In De Palma’s own field, where his virtuosity has no contemporary parallel, it isn’t likely that he would share the role of auteur with another byline. Lehman, credited as co-author, may be providing cover for De Palma’s usual misunderstood, bad-boy fantasies: “He never thought he could have everything — brains and beauty and sexy and sweet and light and hot — in one package.” Yet the novel’s strict adherence to female empowerment (“the one and only rescuer in Elizabeth’s story has been Elizabeth”) and revenge renders the novel trite. Its stock plotting lacks the larger, cosmic fate that ultimately made Carrie, Dressed to Kill, and Casualties of War so powerful and that lifted The Fury, Blow Out, and Femme Fatale into awe-inspiring, cosmic visions. De Palma’s decision to write a novel supports his brave, hold-out position as a cinéaste who resists television. Before television conquered cinema, especially for the “golden age of cable-TV” generation and today’s streaming culture, there was a concept called “la caméra-stylo” (camera-pen), formulated by critic and filmmaker Alexandre Astruc to describe filmmaking that was as fluent and expressive as writing. The museum cruising scene of Dressed to Kill fits Astruc’s theory, as does the carefully built final sunlit tableau of Femme Fatale: pure cinema.  Although De Palma finds no literary equivalent to his famous split-screen device in Sisters or even the binocular sequence in Richard Quine’s Pushover that influenced De Palma’s voyeur fetish (which culminated in the noir extravagance of the nighttime sound-recording sequence in Blow Out), he tries writing such effects. Most of it is narrative wind-up. It takes a while before we get to the first movie moment of visual contradiction: “Rogers can’t see the paper, which if he could would stop his heart (not to mention his campaign): in clear bold print, the paper says Paternity Test Results: POSITIVE.” It’s a naughty joke, like Angie Dickinson discovering the venereal-disease health notice in Dressed to Kill combined with Obsession’s incest revelation.  Some moments show De Palma’s media sophistication (“videotaping has the potential to change how we campaign”) and his yearning to make cinema (“I need to feel the rush and shoot it”), especially his reference to The Great Gatsby’s Doctor T. J. Eckleburg, whose bespectacled eyes, on an old, faded billboard, stare down at Gatsby — an ideal De Palma image. He is a Hitchcock buff here: “Nick, crushed by the ending he has orchestrated, drops his camera to his side and looks over the railing” like Jimmy Stewart in Vertigo. He pays secret homage to Fritz Lang’s Beyond a Reasonable Doubt. And he is his own best critic here: “It all happened in that funny slow-motion way events unfold in the heat of certain moments.” There’s also some plain good writing: Rogers has the same general regard for applause. He treats it the way porpoises regard the shiny red balls they balance on their noses, He chases it. He relishes it. He plays it for all it’s worth. Applause is his favorite toy. Best of all are the last 15 chapters, mostly short, one-page action-filled accounts that evoke De Palma’s suspenseful, contrapuntal crosscut editing style. The title Are Snakes Necessary? reveals a roué’s phallic embarrassment, which De Palma typically compounds with a film reference: Norman Taurog’s 1942 comedy Are Husbands Necessary? But this lockdown creation commands attention because it also evinces social and cultural change — the shift from De Palma’s counterculture Sixties origins to Millennial resignation. The liberal critique he delivered in his Iraq War movie Redacted was a shocking failure, so now, following the wonderfully perceptive but hardly seen Domino, De Palma is a cinema outsider, left spinning a handwritten tale about “the world of politics — of smoke and mirrors and endless spin . . . lies.” Are Snakes Necessary? is available from Hard Case Crime publishers.

In Bloomberg Opinion, I write about some red tape that is making it even harder for small businesses to survive this economy: Congress established the Paycheck Protection Program in late March to provide forgivable loans to businesses to help them through the Covid-19 crisis. The Small Business Administration is insisting that 75% of any amount forgiven has to be spent on payroll, as opposed to rent, utilities and other overhead costs. That requirement is not in the law, as the agency’s inspector general has pointed out in a report. The agency explained that it had consulted Mnuchin and determined this limit fit the law’s “overarching focus on keeping workers paid and employed.” But the rule subverts the purpose of the program . . . .  

The coronavirus pandemic has exacted a devastating toll on men, women, and children across the United States. But some Americans are weathering the COVID-19 financial storm better than others. Our research suggests that married men and women have proven to be much more resilient in the face of this storm than their single peers.  On the social and emotional front, we have already highlighted evidence that marriage is buffering many Americans from feelings of loneliness amid stay-at-home orders. We found, for instance, that singles were nearly twice as likely as married adults to say they felt lonely every day or nearly every day during the previous week. But marriage offers couples more than social and emotional security. It is also a critical source of financial stability during good times and bad times. Marriage puts families at a financial advantage by providing them with two potential sources of income. Moreover, research shows that marriage reduces the odds that a household will go through costly family transitions, encourages greater support from family networks, and builds habits of financial prudence, all of which shore up additional security against financial hardship when the tides of fortune turn. The economic value of marriage has only grown since COVID-19 hit. A new survey spearheaded by the Data Foundation and NORC at the University of Chicago shows how married adults are weathering the pandemic’s economic challenges better than singles. In analyzing the second wave of data from the COVID Impact Survey, we find that married men, women, and families are less likely to experience hunger, to be less dependent on public assistance, and to be better prepared to cover unexpected expenses during this pandemic, when compared with single adults and families headed by single parents. Married adults appear to have experienced fewer job losses than unmarried adults since the World Health Organization declared the COVID outbreak a pandemic just over two months ago. Single parents are almost twice as likely to say they became unemployed after March 1 of this year or that they have been temporarily laid off or furloughed when compared with married adults without kids.  One of the greatest areas of concern during these challenging times is hunger. Proper nutrition is essential for childhood development and adult health. We find that single parents are more than twice as likely as married parents to say that their household ran out of food before they had enough money to buy more during the previous month. Nearly half (49 percent) of single parents said this happened in the previous 30 days, while 21 percent of married parents said the same. Even for adults without children, married couples fared better than singles on food-insecurity measures.  Unsurprisingly, marrieds have been less likely to turn to the government for public assistance during the pandemic. Take food stamps. Single parents were more than twice as likely as married adults to say they received or applied for benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in the past week (figure 3).  Married men and women, and their families, are also much more likely to have a financial buffer built up. The COVID Impact Survey asked people about their ability to cover unexpected expenses based on their current financial situation: “Suppose that you have an unexpected expense that costs $400. Based on your current financial situation, how would you pay for this expense? If you would use more than one method to cover this expense, please select all that apply.” Respondents were given eight options to select from, including “use money currently in my checking or savings account or with cash,” “put it on my credit card and pay it off over time,” “use money from a bank loan or line of credit,” and more. Given all of these options, about a quarter of single parents still said, “I would not be able to pay for it right now,” compared with only 13 percent of married parents. Many singles, then, seem to be struggling with not only a thin savings account but also a limited ability to borrow, which could compound their hardship in this time.  The coronavirus pandemic has hit everyone hard, but it appears that married Americans — both those with and without children — are weathering turbulent economic conditions more successfully than their single peers. In particular, we find that single-parent families are almost twice as likely to be suffering from food insecurity, relying on food stamps, and unable to cover emergency expenses, compared with families headed by married parents. What’s more, even when we control for factors, such as race and education, that might seem to better explain why some Americans are more financially resilient than others, we still find that marriage is a significant predictor of who is getting by during the pandemic. In the midst of increasingly difficult and uncertain times, marriage is helping Americans steer clear of hunger, government assistance, and financial destitution.     The financial advantages of marriage are especially striking because cultural and political elites in the U.S. are so reluctant to discuss them in public. Those who control the commanding heights of popular culture, the media, and both political parties typically shy away from acknowledging a simple truth: When it comes to money, two is greater than one. But in the rest of America, where the devastation of this pandemic is real and present, this truth could not be clearer.

The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board takes a look at the way that the EU is trying to combine tackling the effects of the pandemic with a broader agenda: Whatever else you might say about them, European Union mandarins aren’t short of ambition. They have long wanted to knit the EU into a true federal union, and they’re seizing the coronavirus as a €1.9 trillion opening. That’s the combined size of the €750 billion one-time virus recovery package European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen proposed Wednesday, and the €1.1 trillion seven-year budget the Commission also is proposing that includes a heavy dose of virus relief. This is on top of €540 billion in Covid-19 relief the Commission unveiled last month, and however many trillions the European Central Bank deploys in the crisis. Brussels wants Europeans to focus on how the mandarins will spend the money. Much of it will go in grants to states, apportioned on such factors as youth unemployment . . . Far more consequential is how Brussels would pay for this. The money from the seven-year budget would be provided in the normal way, as block grants from the EU’s 27 member states to the Commission. But Brussels also wants to borrow a large portion of the €750 billion emergency program — and then impose new, EU-wide taxes on everything from plastic waste to digital commerce to repay the bonds. This new borrow-and-tax authority is the main point. The alleged inspiration is Alexander Hamilton, America’s first Treasury Secretary. His plan for the new federal government to assume Revolutionary War debt from the states, and then repay that debt from the federal government’s revenues, put the U.S. on track to become what it is today. Some European leaders have hoped for decades that issuing eurobonds mutually backed by all members would knit the bloc together, or that new digital taxes might do the trick. Now they think the only way to keep the EU from splintering is to forge a new borrowing capacity that can transfer resources from richer nations to poorer. This misunderstands American history. Before Hamilton wrote his First Report on Public Credit, he coauthored the Federalist Papers to persuade his fellow New Yorkers to ratify a new Constitution. He understood that a political union providing democratic accountability for the federal government was a precondition for fiscal union . . . And there’s the rub. There is still no evidence that voters in the EU’s member states want to enter into a political union on anything approaching the American model. For fairly obvious historical reasons, the nascent American Republic was a nation, or proto-nation, in a way that the EU’s ungainly confederation is not. This is understood very well, if not widely admitted, in Brussels, but those steering the European project have always appreciated the value of, to use that entertainingly cynical phrase, a ‘beneficial crisis.’ The euro was built on a foundation of sand. To launch a currency union without the backing of at least a partial fiscal union was asking for trouble, but the necessary political support within the member states for a fiscal union simply was not there. No matter: The single currency was launched anyway. The thinking of at least some of those responsible was that, if trouble came, it would set off a crisis that would create the conditions in which some sort of fiscal union would become politically palatable, if only because the alternative was an economic catastrophe.  Trouble duly came calling, but, in the end, it turned out that the first euro-zone crisis was not enough (quite) to do the trick. The question now is whether the impact of COVID-19, particularly on the already weakened economies of the euro-zone’s south, will scare the currency union’s members into a fiscal union. Probably not (or not exactly) but the greater the taxing power that the EU assumes, the louder will be the demands for greater democratic accountability — no taxation without representation and all that. And logically, ‘representation’ would have to be at the EU, rather than the national, level, and it would be achieved by giving more power to the EU parliament at the expense of national parliaments.   The poorly designed currency will thus have led to an economic crisis that forced the pace of fiscal integration, and the crisis of legitimacy that could well ensue from forced fiscal integration will force the pace of political integration. See how this works? The Wall Street Journal: Perhaps the EU needs closer fiscal and political integration to survive this crisis. But then someone should tell voters, and persuade them to assent. They’re entitled to change their minds after 2005 [when a proposed EU constitution was rejected], especially if a new political organization for the EU gave voters more direct control over Brussels. The problem with that is that the EU Parliament cannot, as things currently stand, in any true sense of the word, be democratic, for the simple reason that there is still no EU ‘demos’. One day there might be, but it doesn’t exist now, and it’s not going to be created overnight by transferring more powers to a parliament that represents everybody, but nobody. ‘Control’ will not in any real sense lie with the voters, but with a technocracy that will use the illusion of increased democracy to produce exactly the opposite result. And there are a good many reasons to think that, in the end, the technocrats will get away with it.  

Last week I was searching the Internet for some COVID-19 statistic or other, and I came across a new CDC website. The site featured some numbers the federal government is using to model the spread of the epidemic. One in particular caught my eye: 0.4 percent, the “current best estimate” of the disease’s “case fatality rate.” The document also said that 35 percent of infections are asymptomatic, which suggests the infection fatality rate is just 0.26 percent.  These numbers struck me as low for several reasons. For one thing, the virus has already killed 0.2 percent of all New Yorkers, and obviously a much higher percentage of those who’ve actually been infected in the city. For another, if we’ve had 100,000 deaths nationwide and a CFR of 0.4 percent, that means we’ve had 25 million symptomatic cases; including cases without symptoms, more than 10 percent of the entire country has been infected, which seems out of sync with what we’re hearing from serology tests. Individual studies and reviews of the evidence tend to put the infection fatality rate somewhere around 0.5 to 1 percent, though there’s at least one dissenting review that puts it lower (while managing not to include any studies finding a fatality rate above 0.5 percent, of which there are plenty). I put out a tweet expressing my confusion, and things spiraled quickly, as they often do on social media. A follower alerted the prominent biologist Carl Bergstrom, who wrote a thread criticizing the CDC’s numbers. The next morning he was featured in a CNN story about the issue. There have been many media reports since, with the narrative predictably varying from “Heroic Scientific Experts Hammer Corrupt CDC for Fake Low Fatality Rate” to “CDC Finally Admits COVID Is Basically Harmless.” (I exaggerate, but only a little.)  I don’t have a scorching hot take on the number. But I do want to know where it comes from, which is not clear from the site itself. It says the information is based on data about a month old and names the source “Preliminary COVID-19 estimates, CDC,” which I have not been able to locate (if indeed it refers to a specific document at all). I have contacted the CDC several times in the past week to no avail. Both the Center for Public Integrity and BuzzFeed similarly report that they sought comment and received no reply.  If the fatality rate of this thing is 0.26 percent, that is fantastic news. If the CDC has evidence this is the case, it should share it with the rest of us.  

I periodically write that if the growing national debt manifested in the form of Godzilla or some other giant monster, Americans would mobilize in droves, and make great sacrifices, to stop it, reverse it, and overcome it. We move pretty quick, and are pretty cooperative, when we can see a threat. We’re visual creatures; some studies indicate that 90 percent of the information processed by the brain is visual.  When something visibly threatens us, like terrorists crashing airliners into skyscrapers, everyone instantly grasps the danger and swings into action. After 9/11, Americans were hungrily looking for ways to help and do something and feel useful: blood donations, charitable donations, volunteering, memorial services, enlisting in the military. (“Not Knowing What Else To Do, Woman Bakes American-Flag Cake” is one of my all-time favorite Onion stories, a perfect expression of how so many wanted to help in some way and couldn’t quite figure out how.) But we can’t see the coronavirus, except through a microscope. If this virus manifested as a visible green gas, people would see it and run from it. There would be little or no dispute about wearing masks. Crowds would instantly disperse at the sight of a forming green cloud. No one would enter a building or room with any discernable green haze.  Americans mobilized — or in many cases, de-mobilized — on a massive scale to respond to the threat of SARS-CoV-2. (In the first week of April, U.S. residents spent 93 percent of their time at home.) They donated to charities and food banks. They canceled events, they put on masks and gloves, they socially distanced. Industries reorganized their assembly lines to make masks and protective gear and ventilators. At the Braskem petrochemical plant in Delaware, 43 men worked 12-hour shifts all day and night for a month straight, “producing tens of millions of pounds of the raw materials that will end up in face masks and surgical gowns worn on the front lines of the pandemic.” All of this for a threat that cannot be seen, and whose effects are not immediately or easily visible. I suspect that many people expected 100,000 Americans dying from a virus in less than three months to look like something out of apocalyptic fiction — bodies in the streets, soldiers in bio-chem suits, giant scary biohazard signs everywhere.   But the coronavirus deaths are almost entirely occurring far away from cameras. This is not a request or a demand that Americans witness their countrymen breathing their last breath and succumb to the virus, just an observation that for most human beings, seeing is believing. A significant portion of America’s coronavirus victims are dying in nursing homes and long-term care facilities — locations that felt shut away from the rest of society and easily forgotten before the pandemic hit our shores. Cities with empty streets looked eerie, but a vocal contingent on the right concluded, with some accuracy, that the emptiness of the streets was driven by the lockdown, not from the virus. It is easy to see politicians, such as the president, or Bill de Blasio, or Andrew Cuomo, or Gretchen Whitmer, or Ralph Northam bumbling through, shutting things down too late or maintaining the shutdowns too long, ignoring rules and recommendations they expect others to follow. They are all visible targets for frustration, disappointment, and ire. The virus SARS-CoV-2 is the root of all of our problems, but there’s no point in holding a rally or protest against a microscopic entity with no mind. As for those who doubt the danger of the virus, no number of skeptics dying will convince other skeptics; the not-so-subtle glee at the irony in the ranks of the media just makes the other skeptics dig in deeper.  We are forced to muddle through as the real fight against the virus occurs behind closed doors — in hospitals, in medical-research facilities, with only brief, fleeting glimpses.  

On the menu today, we’re taking stock of where we are as a country in this fight: Almost every part of the country is in some early stage of reopening; the discernable indicators in our fight against the virus are better, but not great; a surprising amount of economic optimism . . . and meanwhile, the president seeks to make Big Tech liable for what’s posted on their platforms; and Minneapolis burns.  America’s Gradual but Grand Reopening American society is reopening, bit by bit, at different paces in different places. Even the District of Columbia is ending its stay-at-home order that has been in effect for two months; the Maryland suburb of Montgomery County now feels the need to acknowledge that they may be able to start phase one next week. Almost all of the New York City suburbs are now in their first phase of reopening, although not the city itself. Across the country in Wyoming, the state is allowing gatherings of up to 250 people in outdoor settings and 25 people in indoor settings, although six of the state’s largest rodeos are now canceled. For the past few months, Americans debated, increasingly contentiously, about whether the economy and society could reopen and how fast. As noted yesterday, Americans’ behavior changed faster than the debate did. Over in USA Today, Mitch Albom chooses to frame the debate in the least useful and most demagogic way, a battle of caring and suffering good people who understand the threat on one side, up against ignorant, selfish, and entitled whiners on the other: Let’s face it. It’s easy to whine about not getting your hair cut when you haven’t lost a child to the coronavirus. It’s easy to insist on getting back to your favorite bar when you haven’t watched your father die alone in a hospital bed on a cellphone held up by a nurse. And since 100,000 deaths represents only three ten-thousandths of the country, the odds are overwhelming that most people won’t have experienced a COVID-19 loss of their own. When nearly 41 million people have signed up for unemployment since the outbreak began, and you’re still characterizing the desire to reopen the economy and society as “whining about not getting your hair cut” or going to the bar, you’ve demonstrated that you’re not interested in a good-faith discussion or accurately illuminating the problems we face. A few days ago on the NRPlus Facebook page, I elaborated that my general outlook was pro-lockdown-for-several-weeks, while being anti-one-size-fits-all. It doesn’t make sense for Hamilton County in New York — which has five cases — to have the same lockdown rules as New York City, which has 204,000. And it seems almost every government official and public-health expert has been deliberately blind to the fact that the public’s acceptance of the rules is going to be different in Week One than now as we wrap up Week Ten. Lockdowns were never going to be a long-term answer, and state and local lawmakers needed to be beating the drums to get people ready for post-lockdown, manageable risk, “life with the virus.” Perhaps a few did, but I think a lot of governors got locked in — no pun intended — to a “lockdowns are good, opening back up is risky and bad” mentality. They are much more afraid of the consequences of opening up too early than opening up too late.  You May Be Tired of Living with the Virus, But the Virus Isn’t Tired of Living with You   How is the country doing in the fight against the coronavirus? Better, but not great. Daily new cases remain in the 20,000 range, which isn’t necessarily bad; more testing means more positive cases. After a holiday weekend dip, we may be returning to a daily death rate of about 1,500. The rate of testing dropped in the past few days; one wonders if this is related to the holiday weekend. Surely everyone is tired of hearing about models. Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute and professor of health policy at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told NPR that the consensus of the models is “we’re probably going to see 70,000 to 100,000 deaths between now and the end of the summer.” At first glance, these may seem like unimaginably pessimistic numbers, but we’ve got from 644 on March 28 to more than 100,000 today, and most parts of the county were self-quarantining and social distancing by late March. Yes, warm weather should help somewhat, and more Americans spending more time outside should be beneficial. (If the study in China that concluded that only one of 318 outbreaks occurred outdoors is accurate and is supported by other studies elsewhere, we would have an extremely useful clue for protection and mitigation: Spend as much time outdoors as possible until winter.)   But with the reopening, more Americans will be interacting with more Americans, and most of the workforce labors indoors. We’ve seen from grocery stories, meatpacking plants, and warehouses — such as the ones used by Amazon — that as Americans go to work, they will inadvertently spread the virus to each other. There are roughly 90 days in summer; if we average 1,000 deaths per day, that gets us to 90,000. With all of that said, Robert VerBruggen wrote yesterday about just how concentrated our coronavirus outbreak is: “One-third of U.S. COVID deaths are in counties that hold just 4 percent of the population, and another third are in counties holding 11 percent.” Avik Roy separately noted nursing homes and assisted-living facilities “hold just 0.6 percent of the population but have produced 43 percent of COVID deaths” in the country. One part of the country that appears particularly concerning right now is Minnesota*: Between Sunday and Monday, Minnesota saw an unprecedented jump in COVID-19 cases in intensive care, with 41 new patients. MDH has heard of some hospitals nearing or reaching capacity as of the end of last week and expects some to begin setting up surge capacity. A few have staffing concerns, said Infectious Disease Director Kris Ehresmann, while other parts of the state are less full. As of May 25, 87 percent of ICU beds in the Twin Cities metro area were in use — a level not unexpected, Ehresmann said, adding that during flu season, it’s not uncommon for 95 percent of ICU beds to be full. Still, she said, the department is watching numbers closely and remains in close contact with hospitals. As of this morning, Minnesota is using 1,010 of its 1,257 ICU beds, although another 585 could be ready in 24 hours if needed, and another 541 could be ready in three days if needed.  *Minnesota is particularly worrying for reasons entirely separate from the recent on-camera police brutality and rioting in Minneapolis. It’s enough to make one yearn for the days when anti-lockdown protests were considered the scariest threat on the streets. The Economy No one can or should understate just how bad a beating the U.S. economy took in the past three months. Even if things break our way, this is still going to be a long climb back to the heights of pre-coronavirus life. But already we can see some encouraging indicators. Restaurant bookings hit bottom and are starting to creep back up. New unemployment claims are down slightly, and nearly 4 million stopped collecting unemployment claims. Two-thirds of corporate executives think the economy will recover within a year. Bank of America sees consumer spending climbing back closer to the previous “normal” levels. Jamie Dimon, the head of J. P. Morgan Chase says there’s a good chance of a “fairly rapid recovery.” If your business has managed to survive this nearly three-month economic coma, you can probably survive anything. Meanwhile, in the White House . . .  The president intends to escalate his battle with Twitter today by signing an executive order that would encourage federal regulators to allow tech companies to be held liable for the comments, videos, and other content posted by users on their platforms. His move is spurred by Twitter choosing to post a “fact check” underneath a president’s tweet about widespread fraud in voting-by-mail. The president probably wouldn’t be in this mess if he hadn’t chosen to attack Joe Scarborough on the grounds of an allegation that the MSNBC host murdered an intern years ago and hadn’t chosen to keep doubling down on the accusation even after the intern’s widower wrote a public letter to Twitter asking the company to take down Trump’s tweets. (I think a company policy of removing Trump’s most egregious tweets would actually help Trump in a way his critics do not intend, and I think the objections to Twitter enacting a likely arbitrary and imbalanced “fact-check” policy are compelling ones.) You notice the president is quite engaged and enraged about what Twitter is doing to him, and less outspoken and furious about, say, what’s going on in America’s nursing homes.  ADDENDUM: Yesterday, I had the chance to chat with Henry Olsen about campaigning in the era of the coronavirus and the pandemic’s longer-term impact on how conservatives see the world.  

An additional 2.1 million Americans filed unemployment claims last week, the Department of Labor announced Thursday, bringing the total number of unemployed Americans to over 40 million. Continuing unemployment claims dropped last week for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic began, a sign that the economic destruction from the coronavirus is beginning to slow as some businesses are allowed to reopen and employees return to work.  A total of 2.1 million Americans claimed jobless benefits during the week ending May 16, down from a peak of 25 million the previous week. Another 2.12 million Americans filed initial claims for unemployment benefits over the week that ended May 23, even as social distancing restrictions put in place to combat the coronavirus began to be lifted. The previous week saw 2.45 million people file initial benefits claims. More than 40 million workers have filed for jobless benefits over the past nine weeks as the coronavirus forced businesses to shutter and furlough or lay off employees.

‘The novel coronavirus seems to be more deadly for men,” CNN tweeted. “But in many other ways, women are bearing the brunt of this pandemic.” More men are dying from the coronavirus, but women, we are told, have been saddled with a disproportionate share of household chores. Who has it worse?  Apparently a bit more laundry is a fate worse than death. The notion that women are “bearing the brunt” of this pandemic virus is smattered on scores of feminist think-pieces across the Internet. To pick three: The Guardian says that “UK women bear emotional brunt of Covid-19 turmoil;” NPR laments that “Women Bear The Brunt Of Coronavirus Job Losses”; and the Miami Herald reports that “Women are bearing the brunt of the social and economic crisis caused by COVID-19.” The story of women’s COVID oppression is told half by anecdote and half by data. We are enjoined to pity the women who, confined to their homes by statewide stay-at-home orders, are engaged in more housework than their husbands. NBC News speaks with a think-tank official who presents a five-step plan “to reset the unfair division of labor at home during COVID-19;” NPR goes further than “unfair,” quoting a source who says that the pandemic has laid bare the “grotesque” gender inequalities in America’s division of household labor.  
 There is an entire genre of articles devoted to the supposedly benighted women of COVID-19, whose disproportionate attendance to childcare during the pandemic could, in Vox’s words, “harm women’s long-term career prospects.” The fact that the unemployment rate among women is about three percentage points higher than among men has been presented as evidence that between housework and economic misfortune, women are “bearing” the proverbial “brunt” of the pandemic — even as men are shown to be far more likely to die from the coronavirus.  These unemployment disparities and unequal divisions of household labor have been a subject of myopia among the nation’s most unpleasant media guild — “gender reporters” and “equity correspondents.” The very existence of their jobs, of course, is premised on there being sexism to fight, rampant discrimination to overturn, and looming forces of reaction eager to reinstall — if it was ever uninstalled — the patriarchy. When reality doesn’t provide the requisite oppression needed justify their salaries, they have recourse to the theoretical. CNN’s Ivana Kottasová, for instance, quivered that the pandemic has “presented some world leaders with an opportunity to grab more power, sparking fears among women’s rights activists and researchers.” The mere fact that “fears” are being “sparked” among “women’s rights activists” can itself become a pretext for a story, without requiring the reporter to pause and consider whether her underlying premise — that the Western world’s sun rises and sets around the subjugation of women — has any basis in fact.   Kottasová informs readers that any deviation from the official narrative of American female oppression is “dangerous”: “A CNN analysis earlier this year found that in the countries for which data was available, men were 50% more likely than women to die after being diagnosed with Covid-19. But experts say focusing purely on health data is dangerous.” Dangerous?  The “experts” that Kottasová cites insinuate that focusing on male COVID deaths distracts from the “existing structural inequalities in society,” and ignores the “secondary impacts” of the pandemic, “where women are being disproportionately affected.” The reasoning here is a bit like the Anti-Defamation League’s “Pyramid of Hate,” which purports to sketch the path from “biased attitudes” — “microaggressions,” “non-inclusive language,” “insensitive remarks,” and so forth — through “acts of bias,” overt discrimination, “bias-motivated violence,” and, ultimately, genocide. Since every fascistic regime begins with “biased attitudes,” shaming and ostracizing those who make “insensitive remarks” in casual conversation essentially kills Hitler in the crib. (“Tax the rich,” however, is never viewed as the first step on the road to the gulags.) A similar logic explains the aversion to discussing male COVID deaths: To the “expert,” such discussion could set off a similar series of dominos — perhaps bringing attention to those disparities inspires a strain of male grievance, which might foster a mobilized political movement based on male resentment, which might then get weaponized against women and minorities, and — voila! — your discussion of male COVID deaths has enabled the Third Reich.  It is, in any case, remarkable to me that the most miserable people in our society — many of whom are childless and publicly extoll the virtues of childlessness — are the same ones writing pieces telling you how to run and structure your home life. “Some gender scholars are arguing that this pandemic may create an opportunity for men and women in heterosexual families to both gain more awareness of how much is involved in managing a household and raising children,” the sociologist Sinikka Elliott told Vox, as if “gender scholars” who spend their time calling fetuses parasites know more about what is “involved” in “managing a household and raising children” than you do.  It is also remarkable that this same three-headed hydra of activist reporters, academics, and professional feminists is of one voice in lamenting the “gendered” effects of the pandemic, even as they go around telling us that gender is a social construct, that there is no such thing as “male” or “female,” and that men and women as such are fabrications of the patriarchy with no basis in chromosomal fact. Women don’t exist, but they still “bear the brunt” of this pandemic. 

More than 100,000 people have died of the coronavirus in the U.S. as of Wednesday, with almost 1,700,000 infections confirmed throughout the country. As of May 22, 43 percent of coronavirus victims were residents of nursing homes or assisted-living facilities, according to an analysis conducted for the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity. In the state of New Jersey alone, one-tenth of all long-term care residents in nursing homes have died during the pandemic.  The state of New York, which has seen over 5,000 coronavirus deaths in nursing homes, along with New Jersey and Michigan, have compelled nursing homes to readmit coronavirus patients discharged from the hospital. That policy stood in contrast to Florida, where state health officials worked to keep coronavirus patients out of nursing homes. At least 650 Florida nursing home residents have died of coronavirus. In addition to nursing homes, prisons account for a large share of coronavirus outbreaks. Eight out of ten of the country’s biggest coronavirus hotspots are in jails, with the New York Times reporting over 47,000 infections and 485 deaths among inmates and staff in both federal and local prisons. U.S. states are in the process of reopening certain regions following mass closures of businesses meant to mitigate the spread of coronavirus. President Trump has repeatedly urged states to lift restrictions on local economic activity. However, social-distancing recommendations remain in place across much of the country, effectively limiting the amount of customers businesses can admit on their premises.  “Social distancing will be with us through the summer to really ensure that we protect one another,” Dr. Deborah Birx said in an interview last month on NBC’s Meet the Press.

It looks like the National Hockey League will be the first professional sports league to officially return to action — with 24 teams, rather than the usual 16 — competing for the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs by early July. As I understand it, the players will undergo coronavirus testing, and then gradually enter training camps. The teams who were on the cusp of playoff spots when the season was cut short will then play in small round-robin tournaments to see who qualifies for the official post-season. This will be followed by traditional playoff series, played in two hubs, one in the east and one in the west.  As a New York Rangers fan, a team that found itself out of a playoff spot when the season was suspended, I should see little downside to NHL’s plan. My beloved team will be given the chance to compete in the postseason. Even if they lose, they’ll be rewarded in the upcoming draft (the formula for the lottery makes Chaos Theory look like simple addition), with the possibility of nabbing a highly promising young player. Yet, as much as I crave sports, and hockey in particular, I’m also somewhat torn over the idea. One of allures of professional sports is the continuum — the ability for fans to measure statistics and championships from year to the next. It’s not just about watching players, it’s about watching them play the same number of games, under the same set of rules and conditions. It’s true that the NHL doesn’t attach the same significance to statistical purity as baseball, but it is not irrelevant to fans. Is it fair for the NHL to add points earned by players in the round-robins to the season totals — where neither top playoff teams nor lottery teams are competing? It is fair for the NHL to disregard the stats of those who help their teams qualify?   I realize the NHL is concerned with generating revenue. I am sympathetic. I want them to play. But how can the league or fans consider the 2019–2020 season unbroken after such a long interval? The NHL broke up on March 12, two-and-a-half months ago. If the league starts up in July, players will have had a longer layoff than they do for a normal offseason. Some will find the notion trivial, but the league has a responsibility to preserve the integrity of the Stanley Cup. So perhaps the best answer is to put an asterisk next to the winner of the tournament, or better yet, call it the “2020 NHL tournament” rather than the Stanley Cup playoffs.  

The BBC — which receives public funding, so is bound by standards of impartiality — admitted today that it had “breached” its own guidelines in its coverage of the Dominic Cummings controversy. Last night, during the program Newsnight, host Emily Maitlis began by saying that “the country can see” that Cummings, chief adviser to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, had “broken the [lockdown] rules,” after the government insisted that he had not. After the program, the BBC released the following statement: The BBC must uphold the highest standards of due impartiality in its news output. We’ve reviewed the entirety of last night’s Newsnight, including the opening section, and while we believe the programme contained fair, reasonable and rigorous journalism, we feel that we should have done more to make clear the introduction was a summary of the questions we would examine, with all the accompanying evidence, in the rest of the programme. As it was, we believe the introduction we broadcast did not meet our standards of due impartiality. Our staff have been reminded of the guidelines. In addition, Emily Maitlis will be replaced on tonight’s program by Katie Razzall.  

On Wednesday, New York governor Andrew Cuomo accused columnists at the New York Post of wanting to “kill all Democrats,” while pushing back on accusations that he was attempting to blame President Trump for the outbreaks of coronavirus in New York nursing homes. Cuomo has come under fire for a March 25 executive order in which he compelled nursing homes to accept coronavirus patients discharged from hospitals. Since then, over 5,000 coronavirus deaths have been recorded among nursing-home residents in his state. The governor told the Post earlier this month that “the state followed President Trump’s CDC guidance” in implementing the policy.  “There are columnists who made this point at the Post who are 100 percent supportive of Donald Trump and that’s fine — but then believe, you know, we have to kill all Democrats,” Cuomo said on Wednesday. “I get it, I understand it. They’re open in their support of the Trump administration, and I guess their attitude is to be pro-Donald Trump, you have to be anti-Democrat, which I don’t really understand.” Despite signing the executive order requiring nursing homes to accept coronavirus patients, Cuomo said on Wednesday that nursing homes were “obligated” to transfer patients to other facilities if they could not provide “adequate care.” “The obligation is on the nursing home to say, I can’t take a COVID-positive person,” Cuomo said. “The regulation is common sense: if you can’t provide adequate care, you can’t have the patient in your facility and that’s your basic fiduciary obligation — I would say, ethical obligation — and it’s also your legal obligation.”  Send a tip to the news team at NR. 

Andrew Ross Sorkin’s frustration over having missed so much of the post-COVID realities in markets and economic life boiled over this morning in one of the more outrageous outbursts I have ever witnessed on financial media. Perhaps this outburst was rivaled only by his behavior during the March COVID market swoon, in which he — on a daily basis — worked hard to terrify viewers, making the most outlandish predictions one can imagine — when he wasn’t defending billionaire hedge funders who had gone on the network to say “hell is coming” with a massive short bet on the market.  One of the things that made CNBC so good coming out of the dotcom bust was the unleashing of their on-air personalities to express market and even political viewpoints. Larry Kudlow and others frequently voiced a center-right, pro-markets view, while David Faber and others held a center-left, market-skeptical view. The interactions for years were mostly mature, professional, and well-reasoned, even as they exposed different approaches and economic worldviews. What Sorkin did on CNBC throughout the COVID pandemic was not merely ideological — it was sensationalism taken to a level I never thought I would see on business media. And it proved to be divorced from reality.  But here is where I will extend the courtesy to Sorkin that he did not extend to Joe Kernen during this morning’s outburst: I will start by assuming that perhaps he actually believed his predictions, and that his motives were neither crass nor driven by politics. And that is a courtesy: To be frank, a big part of me does believe that Sorkin is too smart actually to have believed the gloom he was peddling throughout March and April. But his daily talking down of the market’s failure to behave in the way his apocalyptic forecasts might suggest, and his daily refusal to accept the systemically improving health picture in our country does lead me to believe that he is frustrated by the way that investors have not followed his script. (And his outburst did look to me as if frustration was at play — but judge for yourself). Could it be maybe, just maybe, Sorkin’s accusation of Kernen (that he has been covering for the president) might just be a little projection, in reverse?  So, take your pick — either Sorkin is sincere (if, in my view, self-deceived), or, on this topic, he is too ideological to come to an objective assessment. Or maybe the explanation lies with some combination of the above. But to accuse Kernen of shilling for Trump after the markets have moved in a way so differently than Sorkin had expected was unfair, unprofessional, and more than anything else, telling.  

Michigan senate Republicans are accusing Governor Gretchen Whitmer of trying to cover up the initial news of her husband’s attempt at leveraging her position to get their boat in the water in time for Memorial Day weekend. Whitmer’s husband, Marc Mallory, called NorthShore Dock in northern Michigan last week to see if his boat could be put in the water “before the weekend,” dock owner Tad Dowker wrote in a now-deleted Facebook post. When Mallory was told it was not possible, according to Dowker he said, “I am the husband to the governor, will this make a difference?”  After initially dismissing reports of her husband’s name-dropping as an internet conspiracy, Whitmer explained that the statement was a “failed attempt at humor” during a Tuesday press conference. Last week, Whitmer — who owns a home with Mallory in the Elk Rapids area — announced that northern Michigan could begin to reopen bars and restaurants in time for Memorial Day weekend, while the southern part of the state remains under stricter lockdown orders. “Keep your wits about you,” Whitmer warned. “Let’s not all go rushing out and force a closure eventually. What we want to do is keep moving forward.” One of Whitmer’s earlier lockdown provisions explicitly prohibited Michiganders from traveling between their primary residences and their vacation homes in the northern part of the state.   News of Dowker’s post, which was later deleted, was shared by state Republican Senator Tom Barrett on Friday. In an interview, Barrett told National Review that he posted the story after validating it through local contacts to highlight how Whitmer was “being hypocritical with the people, by telling us not to travel up to Traverse City when it appeared that she herself and her family were planning to do that.” But Barrett later took down the story after he was contacted by Whitmer’s office through Michigan Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, who relayed the governor’s claim that the story was “100 percent false.” “Just as I was about to go to bed on Friday night, I was contacted by my chief of staff, who said the Governor’s office had reached out to the Senate Majority Leader’s office to get ahold of me to deny this story,” Barrett told National Review. “They were claiming it was 100 percent false, a total fabrication, it wasn’t true. And they were requesting that I take the post down because it was spreading misinformation.” Barrett said he complied with the request “out of an abundance of caution,” but the next morning traced the story back to Dowker and was able to “verify the information and hear that he was standing by the claim.” On Saturday night, NorthShore Dock confirmed Dowker’s account in a follow-up on Facebook.   Whitmer’s office originally refused to comment on the post, saying Monday that it was “not going to make it a practice of addressing every rumor that is spread online.” In a statement, Whitmer’s spokeswoman Tiffany Brown warned that “there’s been a lot of wild misinformation spreading online attacking the governor and her family.” On Tuesday, after the story had widely circulated, Whitmer admitted her husband had mentioned the encounter to her. “He thought it might get a laugh. It didn’t,” Whitmer said at a press conference, “and to be honest I wasn’t laughing either when it was relayed to me because I knew how it would be perceived.” The governor also said her family has been staying home “these last couple of months,” before admitting moments later that Mallory had been to their vacation home. “My husband did go up to our place in Antrim County and rake some leaves and came home,” Whitmer said. “He was there. We did not pile all into the car to go and enjoy our second home, although that would have been permitted.”  Barrett said he’s not convinced by the admission. “Why did she deny it so hard to my office to pull the post down, saying it was false and fabricated, if in fact it was true the whole time?” he pointed out. “It was only after . . . me insisting on getting to the bottom of it that eventually the governor had to crack and admit that it was true.” Shirkey backed up Barrett’s account in a statement on Michigan senate floor on Wednesday, saying that Whitmer’s staff had been “emphatic” that Barrett’s original post “was false and that it should be removed.” “The governor lied. Not only did she lie, but she directed her staff to lie on her behalf in order to cover up her own lies,” he stated. “Yesterday, the governor went in front of cameras and admitted to the lie. She referenced the exchange as a ‘failed joke’ — it would be nice if this governor was as quick to identify failed leadership. How can we trust the governor? How can the citizens of Michigan trust the governor? What else is she willing to lie about, if she lied about putting a boat into water?”  In a statement to National Review, Brown admitted that Whitmer’s office attempted to silence Barrett, but said it was “taken on staff’s own initiative” and “the staff member called, explained, and apologized” after the story was reported elsewhere.  “The governor was surprised by the senate majority leader’s comments made on the floor today. His comments were incorrect and unfair, and frankly, he owes the governor an apology,” Brown said of Shirkey’s statement. “She has been completely honest about the situation and she never directed her staff to mislead anyone or to contact his office.” Barrett said Whitmer should apologize over the whole affair. “I think the governor owes an apology to the people in the state of Michigan on this, an apology to the boat dock owner, and owes an apology to me and my staff about how they duped us into covering up their story,” he stated.

New York governor Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday said that nursing homes are obligated to transfer coronavirus patients if they cannot provide “adequate care.” “The obligation is on the nursing home to say, I can’t take a COVID-positive person,” Cuomo said at a press conference. “The regulation is common sense: if you can’t provide adequate care, you can’t have the patient in your facility and that’s your basic fiduciary obligation — I would say, ethical obligation — and it’s also your legal obligation.”  Cuomo’s March 25 executive order forbid nursing homes from rejecting Covid-positive patients or even testing prospective patients for Covid after they were released from the hospital. “No resident shall be denied re-admission or admission to the [nursing home] solely based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19. [Nursing homes] are prohibited from requiring a hospitalized resident who is determined medically stable to be tested for COVID-19 prior to admission or readmission,” the order states. New York health commissioner Howard Zucker said at the Wednesday press briefing that he was not aware if the state’s Health Department had received any requests from nursing homes to transfer coronavirus patients to other facilities.  Cuomo aide Melissa DeRosa said on Saturday that Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines recommend that nursing homes admit coronavirus patients. Those guidlelines state, “nursing homes should admit any individuals that they would normally admit to their facility, including individuals from hospitals where a case of COVID-19 was/is present.”  “Not could. Should,” DeRosa said. “That is President Trump’s CMS and CDC…There are over a dozen states that did the exact same thing.” The state has seen over 5,000 coronavirus deaths among nursing home residents. About 43 percent of all U.S. coronavirus deaths, or roughly 43,000 deaths as of Wednesday, have been recorded among residents of nursing homes and assisted-living facilities. On Tuesday New York’s Health Department appeared to delete Governor Cuomo’s March executive order from its website. Cuomo also signed legislation in April granting immunity to nursing home executives from coronavirus-related lawsuits. In 2018, the New York State Democratic Committee, which was involved in Cuomo’s primary race at the time, received a $1 million donation from health care lobbying group the Greater New York Hospital Association. The GNYHA represents several hospitals which own nursing homes.  Send a tip to the news team at NR. 

A few items that caught my eye these past few days: First, just before the long weekend, this analysis of the virus’s genetic changes dropped. The results imply that just 1 to 10 percent of carriers cause 80 percent of secondary infections. (You can find a lot more research in a similar vein here.) This means we should think a lot more about “superspreading,” in terms both of superspreading events and of superspreading people.  Superspreading events tend to be situations where lots of adults come into close contact with each other for prolonged periods indoors, often talking or singing loudly. In such a situation, one infected person can pass the virus to many others at once. If superspreading is a big part of how this virus spreads in general, we need to be very careful about these situations. On the flip side, we might be a little less uptight about other interactions, where contacts are brief or outdoors, though masks and safe distances are still good when convenient. Another possible contributor to the study’s result is superspreading individuals. Maybe there’s some reason these folks expel the virus more, or maybe — owing to their jobs or what have you — they are just more likely to find themselves in the dangerous situations outlined above. The latter types of superspreaders could actually be good news: People with lots of close contacts were probably more likely to get the virus early and gain some immunity, meaning that the most prolific spreaders might be taken out of commission for future waves, and that “herd immunity” could come at a lower threshold than we previously expected.  Second: We already knew that the elderly were far more vulnerable to COVID-19 than the young, and of course that viruses spread more easily in close quarters. Add those together and it’s clear nursing homes are at serious risk. But Avik Roy has managed to put some numbers on the problem: Nursing homes and assisted-living facilities hold just 0.6 percent of the population but have produced 43 percent of COVID deaths in the U.S.   It is very difficult to completely isolate these places, because care workers need to go home for the night and family members want to visit. But as we reopen, nursing homes must be a high priority for testing, temperature checks, and the like. Most important, any nursing-home resident, worker, or visitor found to have COVID-19 must be removed or securely isolated immediately.  Third: Pew got some flak for this dumbly worded tweet, but I think the chart is important. Blue (largely urban) areas were hit harder than red (more rural) areas, but the epidemic seems to be fading more slowly in the latter. These dynamics have both political and epidemiological ramifications we should want to sort out. COVID-19 deaths have declined in Democratic congressional districts since mid-April, but remained relatively steady in districts controlled by Republicans. https://t.co/NnUcKYt67w pic.twitter.com/R3mdZ1l8c4 — Pew Research Center (@pewresearch) May 27, 2020  Mark Perry made a similar point this week about the severe damage to several dense urban areas, and the lighter toll elsewhere in the country (so far). One-third of U.S. COVID deaths are in counties that hold just 4 percent of the population, and another third are in counties holding 11 percent. As I’ve urged before, we obviously need to have different policies in different places.  

This week on The Editors, Rich, Charlie, and Jim discuss Trump’s tweets aimed at Joe Scarborough, Biden’s awkward exchange on The Breakfast Club, and how reopening is happening whether the experts think it should or not. ﻿

The plan the president proposed for venturing back out so soon after the worst of the epidemic worried his advisers. If he followed such a course, they warned, he would go against the instructions of doctors and, worse, give fellow citizens license to do the same. Nevertheless, into the city the next day rode George Washington.  In search of parallels to the coronavirus, much has been written about the yellow-fever epidemic that chased the fledgling federal government from its then-capital of Philadelphia in the summer and fall of 1793. But the courage and independence that President Washington showed by returning to the city have gone largely overlooked — perhaps because the story does not conform to the mantra that medical expertise should always override political judgment during crises. With the death toll mounting — eventually about 10 percent of the city’s population would perish — Washington had reluctantly joined the exodus from Philadelphia on September 10. Sensitive to symbolism, he would have delayed his departure, which he knew would demoralize the city. But he realized that his wife would insist on staying for as long as he did. “I could not think of hazarding her . . . any longer by my remaining in the city,” he wrote. As Washington set off for his Mount Vernon estate in Virginia, he expected to be away for no more than 18 days, a period short enough that he carried with him, as he explained, “no public papers of any sort.” But he had underestimated the crisis facing Philadelphia. Two months would pass before he again saw the residence that served as the president’s house in the city.  At Mount Vernon, Washington struggled not only to keep the government operational but also to obtain accurate information about what was happening in Philadelphia. In truth, even doctors there did not understand what caused yellow fever, and they allowed party politics to infect their theories. One group blamed environmental factors; another faulted foreigners. Washington’s own advisers were also divided. They could not agree, for example, whether the Constitution empowered the president to convene Congress at a site outside the limits of Philadelphia.  
 There was no doubt Washington could convene his own cabinet elsewhere, as he finally did, in a town just outside Philadelphia at the start of November. Yellow-fever cases in the city had dropped with the temperature. People had begun to return. Hopes rose that Congress could, too. Washington made plans to ride into Philadelphia on November 11 to see for himself what was possible. But Attorney General Edmund Randolph begged the president to postpone his visit.  “The mayor and the physicians dissuade people from returning yet, and especially in great numbers,” Randolph wrote Washington the evening before. “You will hardly be at your door before your arrival will be rumored abroad, and multitudes, who will not distinguish between a momentary stay and absolute residence, will be induced by your example to crowd back and carry fresh . . . more vulnerable subjects into the bosom of infection.”  Randolph did not end his argument there. “Nor can I conceal a fear, which I have often heard expressed by the friends of yourself and the government, that your indifference about danger might push you perhaps too early into Philadelphia,” he added. But Washington would not wait. He did not need to stay in Philadelphia long — not even overnight — for word of his visit to spread widely. Just as his departure from Philadelphia in September had not gone unnoticed, his brief return also made news. In the Philadelphia Federal Gazette appeared this item: “The editor with infinite pleasure mentions the arrival of the President of the United States in town this day.” The next month, Washington would welcome Congress back to the city with his annual message. Philadelphia would remain the country’s capital until 1800. Yellow fever would return in the years ahead. But the American people had seen that their government could endure.  Concerning his own health, Washington would later say he was not “under any apprehension of the desolating fever.” But more than one man’s life was at stake on the day of Washington’s ride. The attorney general had been right that whatever Washington did would send a message but had been wrong about who should decide its content. The medical experts had an important role. But when to risk venturing back out into the streets was not exclusively a medical decision. It was also a political decision and, in this case, properly made by a president. 

States are reopening, some more speedily than others. For the time being, COVID-19 appears to be on the wane — and we can be cautiously optimistic that it won’t spread as quickly this summer as it did back in March. In the densest parts of the country, people are keeping their distance, taking things outdoors when possible, wearing masks, and quarantining themselves when they get sick. Temperatures are up, which could help. And in the hardest-hit areas, particularly New York City, a decent share of the population is likely immune to reinfection — not a big enough share to create “herd immunity,” but enough to help control the spread a little, especially if the folks who’ve already caught the disease are the ones with the most social contacts.  All this brings us to a multi-trillion-dollar question: How quickly can we get this economy moving again? The answer depends on how many people are willing to go out and spend money; how many businesses will survive, reopen, and rehire workers; and how the government handles the next round of stimulus funding. In terms of getting people out of the house, we have a ways to go, but it’s happening. Google’s cell-phone-tracking data for the U.S. indicate that Americans have made it about a quarter of the way back to their baseline degree of mobility. “Retail and recreation” visits were down more than 40 percent at the beginning of April relative to their level at the beginning of the year, but only 30 percent as of May 16. “Workplace” visits also improved, from a drop of about 40 percent to one of 24 percent. As the weather warms up and more and more states give the official go-ahead to (carefully) resume normal activities, these numbers should slowly climb closer to their previous level. What about businesses? Unfortunately, bankruptcy data are spotty and delayed, so it’s not entirely clear how many enterprises we have lost to date. Given that many businesses have less than a month’s worth of cash on hand, however, there are good reasons for concern. There are already stories of theaters, airlines, rental-car companies, and retail outlets seeking protection, though sometimes the Chapter 11 protection that allows businesses to reorganize rather than disappear entirely.   Meanwhile, April’s unemployment rate was a shocking 14.7 percent, so it’s clear that plenty of people aren’t working, even if their former employers haven’t gone fully out of business. At minimum, those businesses have a lot of hiring to do before things will be normal again. 
 Perhaps the biggest unknown here is how the federal government will act. It needs to strike a balance among the goals of helping companies stay afloat through this (hopefully) final stretch, allowing businesses to safely reopen without risking lawsuits, encouraging workers to get back to their jobs, continuing to help the unemployed at a time when jobs are scarce, and preventing a resurgence of COVID-19. The political parties are starkly divided on how best to strike that balance, but they need to act soon, because the mix of policies we have in place now is coming to an end. A $600 boost to unemployment benefits, which often makes being laid off more remunerative than work, expires at the end of July. The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which basically gives businesses money to keep their employees on the payroll, is tapering off, and participating companies have until June 30 to get their staffing levels back to where they were pre-COVID if they want their loans forgiven.  In a recent House bill, Democrats proposed throwing money at pretty much everyone. The $600 unemployment boost would continue until January. Essential workers would receive hazard pay. PPP would continue through the end of the year. Another round of stimulus checks would go out.  Some Republicans, by contrast, are leery of continued government involvement as businesses reopen — which is understandable because different states are taking different routes here, and a one-size-fits-all federal policy of subsidizing shutdowns is no longer appropriate. Other Republicans, though, support a counterweight to the $600 unemployment boost until it expires in two months, such as continuing to give people $450 a week of their unemployment after they return to work. On the PPP side, there are proposals to give businesses more time to return to their original staffing levels and more flexibility to use the money for non-payroll expenses. The White House is pushing a cut to payroll taxes, too. Big legislation in the Senate is not expected for about a month, though a targeted PPP fix could come sooner. Much is uncertain, but the big Senate bill is expected to include liability protections for businesses and to have a far lower price tag than the $3 trillion House bill. After that, both houses of Congress and the White House will have to figure out a compromise they can agree on.   How are all these factors going to add up? That’s up to Congress, the American people, and COVID-19. But this virus and the shutdowns we undertook to control it could cost us dearly for quite some time. Kiplinger expects 2020’s GDP to be down nearly 6 percent, and a full recovery to take until the beginning of 2022. Similarly, the Congressional Budget Office expects economic output in the fourth quarter of 2021 to be slightly less than the output from late 2019, which, should it come to pass, would mean that the pandemic destroyed more than two years’ worth of economic growth. It sees an average unemployment rate of over 9 percent next year. On the more optimistic side, former Obama adviser Jason Furman has made the case that we could recover quickly, but even he sees double-digit unemployment lasting through election time. We faced a situation where there was no good option, and we chose a strategy of temporarily pausing the economy, working to get ahead of the virus, and then restarting in a careful manner. I am hopeful that we can pull it off, holding the body count and the unemployment rate down at the same time. Whether that hope is warranted, we could know by the middle of summer — with the caveat that the fall, when our guard is down and temperatures have once again started to work against us, still looms. 

“Spike in South Korea virus cases shows perils of reopening,” declares the ominous Associated Press headline. You have to go to another article to find the number of cases and deaths in the country: “The Asian nation reported 40 new cases for Tuesday, the biggest one-day increase since April 8, according to data from Korea Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, or KCDC, with most of the cases connected to a distribution center of an e-commerce firm. This takes the total tally to 11,265 cases while the virus-linked deaths were unchanged at 269.”  By South Korean standards, with a population of about 51 million and having done an excellent job of controlling the spread, 40 new cases in a day looks pretty bad. By the standards of the United States right now, a day like that looks delightful. Reopening is perilous, but after ten and a half weeks of self-quarantines, lockdowns, closed businesses, and other restrictions, people are “voting with their feet” by going out more. The Atlantic magazine wonders why Americans can’t live almost entirely online the way the Estonians do. Syndicated columnist Ruben Navarrette laments that Americans can’t handle the freedom to leave quarantine. The weather is getting warmer and nicer. Demonizing people who go to the beach or the park is no longer a useful contribution to our search for a solution. “Keep everyone inside their houses for three months or more” was never a realistic response to this virus. Our society does not operate on the same principles and philosophies of the Chinese state. We’re not going to weld doors shut to keep people inside.  As Charlie and Rich observed on this week’s The Editors, the debate about reopening society proceeding at a slower pace than the actual reopening of society. Whether or not a person thinks Americans should be leaving their homes more frequently, they’re doing it. The question now is finding a way to live with the virus, to reach some level of economic and social activity necessary for other human needs while minimizing the risk of catching and spreading the coronavirus. Masks, partial-capacity of businesses, standing six feet apart while talking — Americans can take those steps. An order to shut down so-called nonessential businesses — every business is essential to the people who earn their paychecks there — and to go back into homes for another month is just not going to fly anymore, and the chattering class needs to come to terms with that fact.  

Ever the technocrat, bioethicist Ezekiel Emanuel — Joe Biden’s chief health-care adviser — now has coauthored a piece in the New York Times discussing how to force us all to wear masks. First, he supports laws requiring mask-wearing. From “Mask Wearing Needs to be Easy, Understood, and Expected”: The most obvious path to universal masking is to pass laws and punish infractions. But enforcing legal edicts to wear masks in public can be difficult and costly, and amid widespread ambivalence can lead to backlash and even violence. So edicts are not a complete solution. As experts in public health and human behavior, we propose a complementary approach: Make wearing a mask easy, understood and expected. Notice how the writers soft-pedal their call for a legal mandate, but that is precisely what they advocate. They write that “edicts are not a complete solution,” meaning they are part of what should be done. And they write that other “complementary” approaches should also be engaged — in other words, in addition to legal compulsion. The rest of the column focuses on technocratic efforts to manufacture social “norms” that would seek to shame us all — at the risk of social excommunication — to accept universal mask-wearing. I think that would be unwise. I am all for wearing masks where appropriate and have no objection to “leadership by example” efforts by admired people. But constructing a “norm” through social manipulation could unleash a form of unreasonable fear of the kind we saw the other day in a Staten Island grocery, where people howled and screamed in panic at an unmasked shopper, driving her out of the store. That behavior was far more alarming and socially unhealthy than the presence of woman who thoughtlessly didn’t wear a mask. Also, while the issue is mentioned, the authors skip over the science that mask- wearing outside is unnecessary if proper social distancing is followed. This is a problem with technocrats. They tend to approach issues with cudgels instead of scalpels. Give Americans accurate information, and most of us will do the right thing voluntarily. But as an individualistic culture, we get our backs up when “the experts” attempt to dictate individual behavior, whether through social or legal compulsion. Deploying legal and/or social coercion to induce universal mask-wearing is likely to cause more popular resistance, not less.  

On the menu today: some people need to get rid of their superiority complex; Dan McLaughlin writing on Gregg Jeffries; a new paper saying the virus didn’t spread from a patient in Washington State; and two astronauts are set to blast off today. Our Worldwide Need for Empathy  I can get as annoyed as the next guy by those allegedly encouraging video of celebrities declaring, “We’re all in this together,” allowing us glimpses of their just-opulent-enough Hollywood homes behind them.  But compared to almost every other problem in our society, the coronavirus really is universal. We may not all be at equal risk of succumbing to the virus, but we all have some risk of catching it. Some of us will get through infection with minimal effects, some will endure great pain and difficulty fighting it off. This virus attacks the body in variety of ways, and doctors still don’t completely understand how it assaults our systems. Even if you manage to completely elude the virus, the sweeping economic effects of the quarantines and shutdowns are likely to touch your life in some fashion. Some of our current arguments revolve around whether some segments of the population are scared. Fear is a way of knowing you care about something and don’t want to lose it. We don’t want to lose our lives, we don’t want to lose our loved ones, we don’t want to lose our jobs, and we don’t want to lose our businesses or life’s savings. Fear is rational — which is not to say we should allow fear to be paralyzing. This should be a unifying moment. No matter whom you can’t abide in American society, they’re feeling the same fear, anxiety, and uncertainty that you do. We can be angry at criminals for their crimes and simultaneously feel the need to save them from unintended and preventable deaths in their prisons. Members of the opposing political party have elderly parents and grandparents in nursing homes, too. People who voted for the other guy can get laid off or lose their businesses, too. Urbanites can feel like they’re going stir-crazy in tiny apartments, and that the streets of their cities are awash in danger. Rural citizens might feel safer — or maybe not, if they’re working in a meat-packing plant. People who have never needed to use a food bank before are waiting in line for hours for a couple bags of groceries.   Communities you might not hear about or think about often are getting hit hard. The Navajo Nation’s per-capita rate of infection was, at one point, higher than 48 of the 50 states. The Hasidic Jewish community in the New York area was hit hard and early. The River Park Towers in the Bronx are getting nicknamed “the death towers” with a reported 100 cases. Filipino-Americans make up a little over one percent of the overall population but are 4 percent of the nurses in the U.S., with the resultant high risk of infection in hospitals. In Rhode Island, Latinos, mostly working-class, are 16 percent of the population but make up 45 percent of the confirmed cases. In Michigan, blacks make up 15 percent of the overall population but 40 percent of the cases. There’s arguably never been a greater need for empathy in America, or the world.  And yet some Americans, largely magnified by the ubiquitous cameras of social media and the national media’s endless hunger for stories about conflict, are embracing this moment as the greatest opportunity to judge others and whip up and direct public scorn. As I fumed a bit on the recent taping of The Editors podcast, one of the ways people are seeking reassurance in this extraordinary stressful time is to seek out evidence that they are one of the good people — practicing the right steps to protect themselves and their loved ones — and that anyone who is doing something different is one of the bad people. If we cannot feel good, then we can at least feel superior. Staten Island grocery store shoppers swarm and berate a woman for not wearing a mask. (Graeme Wood observes, “If you are conducting your shaming in the frozen-food aisle, you’re already too late.”) Some of us have never heard of the Lake of the Ozarks before, but plenty of people enjoyed deriding the people who gathered there in large numbers in swimming pools. That failed political candidate wants to hand out body bags to people on the beach in Florida. California hairstylists, operating in the professional haircutting underground, insist they’re doing what they do because they need to make a living.  You probably heard about that woman in Central Park, who after arguing with a black bird watcher about keeping her dog on a leash, called the police and made it sound as if he was attacking her. Robert A. George observes that New York City mayor Bill de Blasio “encouraged residents to narc on their neighbors over social distancing violations. Given the larger health crisis (and its disproportionate impact on New York), that’s somewhat understandable. Unfortunately, it emboldens people to take the wise 9/11-era advisement of ‘If you see something, say something’ and weaponize it into ‘if you see anything, report anything.’”   This virus has no human face. We cannot punch it, kick it, or shoot it. The closest thing to a human perpetrator of this pandemic, the Chinese government, is probably the second-most powerful institution on earth and is not easily confronted. Hence some of us seek out a more convenient target, and also a more meaningful comparison to our virtue. If I tell you that you are wiser, more careful, more responsible, and more caring than Xi Jinping and the rest of the authoritarians in Beijing, you’re probably going to give an unenthusiastic, “Uh . . . thanks.” Being a better person than a Chinese autocrat is not a high bar to clear. All you have to do to qualify is not put a million people or so in concentration camps. No, we want to feel better about ourselves compared to other Americans, and probably in particular compared to our other peers. If someone who has nothing in common with us makes a wrong choice — say, the native tribes in the Amazon don’t consistently practice social distancing — we can’t feel that superior. But if Dick and Jane down the street are having houseguests over and everyone is within six feet of each other, then we can feel superior. Back when I wrote Voting to Kill, pollster David Winston mentioned an anecdote about a focus group of suburban moms discussing 9/11 that always stuck with me: One woman described that she had just dropped her child off [at school] and was driving away when the radio is describing what is happening. And at first she’s wondering whether she should turn around, but the message on the radio seems to be that everything’s okay, and she decides not to pick up her child from school [early]. Well, another mother sitting near her [in the focus group] turns around with this intense velocity and said, “I picked my kids up.” It was an icy exchange, almost as if saying, “I was a good parent.” They’re discussing this three years later and the emotion is as if it was yesterday. What that told me was that level of emotion and recall was still very much there. We judge others in part to reassure ourselves that our choices were and are the right ones. Psychologists are pretty unified on this: Public shaming rarely works in these circumstances. Those who are engaged in the allegedly shameful behavior don’t have enough faith in the judgment of strangers. If a friend or relative says, “You shouldn’t do that,” they might give it a little more consideration; there is a preestablished relationship and sense of trust. They are somewhat less likely to believe that this isn’t smug virtue-shaming, and that the recommendation to wear a mask or stay further apart is coming from a place of genuine care. No one should be surprised that “arguments” such as, “Is it okay to say that there is a special place in hell for rule breakers that prolong the effects of this virus, thereby depriving all of us a more expeditious return to normalcy?” are unpersuasive.  I wonder if in other circumstances, that speaker would ordinarily denounce the judgmental Christian Right and lament the ways America is turning into a theocracy. ADDENDA: Dan McLaughlin, a.k.a. Baseball Crank, writes about former New York Met Gregg Jeffries. Man, there was a summer where finding his rookie card in a pack of baseball cards was like discovering a lost treasure chest. A new research paper contends that the first reported coronavirus infection case in Washington was not the primary cause of the spread of the virus in the United States, or even in the state of Washington. “It suggests the person who ignited the first chain of sustained transmission in the United States probably returned to the country in mid-February, a month later.” NASA astronauts are now into ride-sharing; around 4:33 p.m. Eastern time, two astronauts are scheduled to blast off from the SpaceX craft Falcon 9 from Launch Complex 39A — the same place Saturn V launched humanity to the moon and from where the first and final Space Shuttle missions lifted off. The world could certainly use some hope and wonder right about now.  

At the end of March, when the U.S. began to shut down as the severity of the coronavirus pandemic increased, New York Times op-ed columnist and NR movie critic Ross Douthat put his finger on an uncanny psychological side effect of what was happening. “The strangest thing about this crisis,” he tweeted, “is what you might call the not-yet/but-already experience — where things that haven’t yet happened (symptoms, hospitalizations) are nonetheless settled facts, and we measure the way telescopes catch light from the past, from a dead star.”  When the news broke last week that mainland China’s rubberstamp congress planned to force a draconian national-security law onto Hong Kong, the former British colony that has been a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China for the last 23 years, I thought of Douthat’s observation applied to a different context. No one knows what it’s like to live the not-yet/but-already experience better than the people of Hong Kong. From the day the Sino-British Joint Declaration, which stipulated the terms of the handover, was signed in 1984, Hong Kong’s fate as a future Chinese territory was already a settled fact, even if July 1, 1997, was over a decade away. When the handover did happen, and the Union Jack was lowered in the territory for the last time, the city knew its SAR status, which guaranteed freedoms of speech, assembly, the press, an independent judiciary, and other rights that didn’t exist for citizens on the mainland, also came with an expiration date — this time in 2047, when Hong Kong’s autonomous status was set to end.  Of course, far fewer than 50 years would elapse before Beijing and its loyalists in control of the local government began attempts to chip away at these rights and the autonomy supposedly protected under Hong Kong’s Basic Law, the portion of Chinese law that functions as the city’s de facto constitution. Although the details of the new national-security law have yet to be revealed, most analysts believe it to be a variation on the national-security bill the Hong Kong government introduced in 2003. That legislation was intended to fulfill the controversial Article 23, the so-called National Security Provision of the Hong Kong Basic Law, which stated that the city would, of its own accord, pass legislation to “prohibit any act of treason, secession, sedition, [or] subversion against the Central People’s Government.” The bill introduced into Hong Kong’s Legislative Council would have criminalized all the above acts and allowed warrantless police searches of those suspected of them. With fears that the law would be used to punish legitimate political dissent, the proposed legislation triggered massive protests, was quickly withdrawn, and until now, neither the Hong Kong nor mainland government had ever attempted to introduce it again. That Beijing has now done so is the culmination of a troubling acceleration over the past two years of the erosion of Hong Kong’s freedoms and autonomy, to the point where the situation on the ground seems to change day by day. For Western readers looking to get caught up on the political struggle for Hong Kong’s future, a good place to start is Jeffrey Wasserstrom’s Vigil: Hong Kong on the Brink, a short book published in February. In fewer than 100 pages, Wasserstrom, a professor of History at UC Irvine, deftly takes the reader through a concise history of the territory, beginning with the British acquisition of Hong Kong Island in 1841 and continuing with the subsequent additions of surrounding territory to the colony, all the way through to Hong Kong’s post–World War II boom as a center of international finance and its status as a SAR of China today. His focus, however, is on the protests of 2019, and to a lesser extent on the Umbrella Movement protests of 2014. Core to both was the question of the nature of the city’s relationship to Beijing.   The current arrangement between Hong Kong and the mainland is known as “One Country, Two Systems.” Yet as Wasserstrom and others have made clear, the problem is that the two sides of the political divide have incompatible interpretations of what that means. For Chinese president Xi Jinping and the pro-Beijing faction of the Hong Kong government, it’s only the first half of the phrase that really matters. For Hong Kong’s democracy movement, the second half is what legitimates the first. Every major political protest since the handover has related to this question in one way or another. 
 The 2014 Umbrella Movement arose from one of the most contentious issues of Hong Kong’s politics: universal suffrage. Hong Kong’s Basic Law stated that universal suffrage was the “ultimate aim” in electing the city’s chief executive post-handover. (As with the colonial-era governor, the chief executive was not a democratically elected position post-handover.) Yet a decade and a half after 1997, any progress toward universal suffrage was non-existent, with the chief executive still chosen by an election committee of just a few thousand, which all but ensured a candidate acceptable to Beijing would win. In response to a renewed push for democratic reform, the government proposed a process in which the chief executive would be elected by the populace, but only from a small pool of candidates pre-approved by a nominating committee. This constraint essentially guaranteed that anyone standing for election would be limited to those acceptable to Beijing, and it triggered an Occupy-style sit-in at the city’s center. It would come to be known as the Umbrella Movement because of protesters’ use of umbrellas to combat tear gas shot by police.   The period between the end of the Umbrella Movement and the start of the 2019 protests saw several ominous developments. Five booksellers from Causeway Bay Books, a Hong Kong bookstore that sold works banned on the mainland, were mysteriously disappeared in 2015, with several suddenly appearing on television in the mainland months later making obviously forced confessions to falsified crimes. When a new high-speed rail link to the mainland opened in 2018, the security at the Hong Kong end of the terminal was handled by mainland security agents, a first in the city’s history. And in circumstances eerily reminiscent of Beijing’s treatment of foreign journalists it does not care for, Financial Times editor Victor Mallet returned to Hong Kong from a trip only to find his visa revoked and his entry into the city barred. Although no official explanation was given, the likely cause of Mallet’s trouble was his hosting a luncheon featuring remarks by a member of the Hong Kong National Party, a pro-independence party that was on the cusp of being officially banned (and would be just a few weeks after the luncheon).   The integrity of One Country, Two Systems was also at the heart of the 2019 protests, which began in response to a proposed bill introduced by Chief Executive Carrie Lam that would have allowed Hong Kongers wanted on charges in mainland China to be extradited there and face prosecution under a draconian mainland justice system known for its subservience to the agenda of the Chinese Communist Party. A demand for the bill’s withdrawal led to the biggest demonstrations in the city’s history, with over a million of the city’s 7.4 million residents marching in June. These demonstrations continued throughout the summer and into the fall, after Lam had formally withdrawn the bill. (Protesters still had other demands the government had not met, including an independent inquiry into police brutality.)  Wasserstrom’s telling of the events leading up to and taking place throughout 2019 is strong on its own, but what adds appeal to the book is the personal dimension he weaves into his account of the city’s crisis. He has clearly long been an admirer of Hong Kong, usually traveling there twice a year or so. Each time he arrives, he notes with dismay the increasing signs of absorption into the mainland — more propagandistic language from the Xi era featured on billboards, fewer signs of a city distinct from its mainland counterparts — while taking heart in those elements of differentiation that have endured in city life and culture. Vigil is not without flaws. Abrupt shifts from expository narrative to personal anecdote leave the flow of the book choppy in a few spots. And whatever utility a historical comparison between Hong Kong in 2019 and Shanghai in 1919 made near the book’s end may have is fatally undermined by excessive hedging about the inexactitude of such comparisons and repeated admonishments that history does not repeat itself. But these are small quibbles with a strong, economical account of what the city has gone through — and where it may be headed. In a conversation with Sir Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, who presided over the handover in 1997, Wasserstrom relays his puzzlement over why, after so long a period of more or less leaving the One Country, Two Systems arrangement intact, Beijing’s erosion of that system has accelerated in the last few years. Patten’s response: “When the snow starts melting, it melts quickly.” At its best, Antony Dapiran’s magnificent City on Fire: The Fight for Hong Kong (already available as an e-book but out in hardcopy on June 23) shows precisely how quickly that melting can occur. A gripping account of last year’s protests, the book relates how Hong Kong changed month by month, day by day, sometimes hour by hour in the course of 2019. Dapiran is an Australian lawyer who has lived in Hong Kong for the past 20 years. He is also a gifted writer who tells a compelling story of what the protesters have been up against, what they are fighting for, and how their tactics and goals have evolved over time.  Dapiran’s book begins with a chapter on tear gas — its chemical composition, the history of its creation, the early instances of its use, and ultimately its deployment in the 2019 protests. It’s a particularly effective way to start a book about the demonstrations because the use of tear gas is a troubling example of how the formerly unthinkable has become the quotidian in the Hong Kong of today. When police deployed tear gas against Umbrella Movement protesters six years ago, it elicited shock and outrage. By the peak of the 2019 protests, its use was an accepted fact of daily life, with protesters donning gas masks and finding other ways to quickly neutralize the compound. The creative and efficient ways protesters have adapted to coercive police tactics and brutality feature prominently in City on Fire. By 2019, they had come a long way from responding to tear gas with umbrellas. Small teams now existed to quickly approach a deployed canister, cover it with an orange construction cone, and douse the inside with water. When police got wise to the coordination of demonstrations that was happening on the Telegram app and began cracking down on moderators of pro-democracy groups, protesters began to use the air-drop feature on their iPhones to quickly spread information person-to-person about where the next march would occur, where police had been spotted, what kinds of weapons they were equipped with, etc. With Dapiran on the ground to witness almost all the book’s key moments in person, City on Fire relays the events of 2019 in harrowing detail. As the tensions between the demonstrators and police rose throughout the summer and into autumn, the spectacle became increasingly surreal. The November siege by police of protesters barricaded in Hong Kong’s confined urban Polytechnic University campus featured protesters “operating an improvised catapult to launch petrol bombs and rocks at the police lines.” Police in turn fired tear-gas canisters, rubber bullets, and sponge grenades, which could occasionally be heard ricocheting off makeshift shields. “This was no longer a protest, or even a riot,” Dapiran writes. “It was medieval siege warfare.” In addition to his strong descriptive powers, the author shows a keen understanding of human psychology and sociology, which adds another layer of depth to the reader’s understanding of the urgency of the demonstrations. Unlike previous generations, most of the youth composing the main body of demonstrators had grown up at a time when Hong Kong was in relative decline. Previous generations of the city’s residents defined their identity in largely material terms. Hong Kong in the ’80s and ’90s was far wealthier than the mainland, and punched above its weight not only in finance but in pop culture as well. The Cantopop music genre dominated the region, and figures of Hong Kong cinema such as John Woo, Wong Kar-Wai, Tsui Hark, and Jackie Chan became beloved throughout the world. (Indeed, the title of Dapiran’s book is a reference to a cult 1987 Hong Kong action film that, among other things, inspired Quentin Tarantino’s Reservoir Dogs.) The Asian Financial Crisis that followed the handover dealt a blow to Hong Kong’s economic and pop-cultural power. In recent years, Shanghai has begun to overtake Hong Kong as the financial hub of the Asia Pacific, and Hong Kong cinema has largely melded into the mainland’s. As Dapiran makes clear, the erosion of these previous pillars of identity has led Hong Kong’s youth to form their own based on what still differentiates the city from the mainland: namely, its political freedoms and liberal values. At one or two points in the book, Dapiran goes overboard on cultural-studies jargon. I found his discussion of the protests as a means for people to “participate in the production of urban space” more an exercise in abstraction for its own sake than a useful way to provide insight into what was animating the movement. And many readers will roll their eyes at his channeling of his inner Derrida when he describes 21st-century cities as “porous texts open to being rewritten.” But these blemishes are few and far between. This is the definitive account of China’s biggest political crisis since Tiananmen, and I look forward to a second edition that looks at all that has transpired since it went to print. Dapiran ends his book by acknowledging that Hong Kong’s future is inexorably tied to Beijing’s, and he makes the case that it is in China’s interest to maintain the integrity of One Country, Two Systems in order to provide a space for open and free communication between itself and the world. The example he cites to prove the utility of the arrangement is all too relevant to 2020, and leaves the reader cringing in despair: In 2003, it was Hong Kong that helped to gather and disseminate information about the SARS outbreak. This saved China — and, most likely, the world — from the devastating epidemic that might have ensued if the mainland’s instincts for suppression of information had not been undermined. Hong Kong keeps the entire ecosystem in balance. Well. Both authors finished their books before the COVID-19 pandemic overtook China and then the world. And when it comes to Hong Kong, coronavirus is a crisis China has not let go to waste. The timing of Beijing’s encroachment is no accident. Not only is the West preoccupied with fighting the coronavirus, but the social-distancing rules in place in Hong Kong mean it will be particularly difficult for demonstrators to respond to the move in the way they did last year. Despite the city’s having one of the best records of managing the disease in the world, with only four confirmed deaths to date, the government has extended bans on large-scale gatherings to the point where Hong Kong’s traditional June 4 vigil for the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, the only such commemoration to take place within Chinese territory, will not be allowed to happen. Wasserstrom made a point to attend the vigil in 2019, wondering if it would soon “be added to the ever-growing list of things that used to be a part of the Hong Kong landscape but [have] subsequently disappeared.” He now has his answer. Washington will not sit idly by as Beijing deals the death blow to Hong Kong’s freedoms. Legislation passed in response to the protests last year requires the State Department to annually review Hong Kong’s autonomous status when it comes to trade. If Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s early comments are any indicator, that status will almost certainly not be renewed. Mainland officials involved in the law’s passing, meanwhile, will probably face harsh U.S. sanctions. But the United States cannot and should not lead the free world’s response alone. As the other signatory of the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the former colonial ruler of the city, the United Kingdom has both a political and moral obligation to condemn what Beijing is about to do. Both Wasserstrom and Dapiran argue that Hong Kong never stopped being a colony after the handover. The ruling power merely shifted from London to Beijing. Indeed, the legacy of colonialism has empowered the government to take actions it might otherwise not have been able to by invoking harsh (if rarely used) laws inherited from British rule. Reports have emerged of a quiet plan to allow political refugees from Hong Kong some form of asylum in the U.K., but Prime Minister Boris Johnson needs to be vocal in denouncing what is happening. Even with these steps, however, the outlook for the city is grim for the foreseeable future. Like Kurt Vonnegut’s Billy Pilgrim, Hong Kong has come unstuck in time—2047 has arrived 27 years early, and the colonial rule that allegedly ended in 1997 never went away, but merely changed hands. As Hong Kong enters the next chapter of its existence, all most of those concerned for its future can do is look on in horror and honor the example of a miracle city that continued to live free in the shadow of the world’s most powerful authoritarian government, hoping against all odds for a better tomorrow. 

If we have learned anything about COVID-19, it is that we are surprised every day by new advice on how the coronavirus spreads, its impact on our bodies, preventions, and treatments. The incredibly fluid development of knowledge about the pandemic elevates the risk that decisions we make concerning our own behavior will turn out to be wrong — and, in some cases, dangerous to us and to others.  Last month, former senator Blanche Lincoln and I wrote about the need to protect doctors and nurses from lawsuits related to very difficult decisions they make in treating COVID-19 patients. Trial lawyers are already soliciting plaintiffs so they can profit from these challenging and vulnerable times, and those on the front lines should not be made to pay the price. So we called on Congress to enact targeted liability protections for those fighting the battle in hospitals, nursing homes, and doctors’ offices. Congress has previously granted similar liability protections. Passed in 1997, the Volunteer Protection Act shields Americans who help their neighbors in a crisis from legal liability. The 2005 Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act also grants tort immunity to manufacturers, distributors, and others providing medical treatment to the victims of epidemics and acts of terror.  Now that our nation is emerging from COVID-19 lockdowns, Congress must also limit the legal exposure of employers and organizations who follow guidelines to protect workers and customers. It’s inevitable that some people will become infected, but firms should not be sued out of existence for good-faith efforts that are not 100 percent effective against a virus that is 100 percent unpredictable. As we try to return to some aspects of normal life, we can’t allow ambulance-chasers to bring lawsuits that will crush our struggling businesses. Every business is struggling to adopt procedures to protect its customers from harm and itself from liability. And in a world saturated with social media, that struggle extends to our nation’s online-communications platforms. Twitter, Facebook, and Google have made changes to their content-moderation standards out of fear that they could be blamed — and sued — if people get sick based on user posts or videos that encourage potentially harmful behavior.  
 Recently, Facebook removed several user posts encouraging violations of certain states’ lockdown rules. While Facebook’s community standards have always prohibited misinformation that contributes to the risk of physical harm, the social-media giant has now announced that it is “consulting with WHO, CDC, and other health authorities to assess claims that may be false and likely to cause physical harm, such as increasing the likelihood that they contract or spread COVID-19.” YouTube has removed several user-created videos and ads that promoted ingesting bleach and other quack COVID cures that could be dangerous or even deadly. And well-known conservatives have run afoul of Twitter’s COVID-misinformation policy.  Despite the best intentions to prevent people from harm, social-media moderation of COVID-related content has become a flash point for conservatives who believe these companies moderate conservative content more harshly than progressive posts. Conservatives are outraged that social-media platforms would remove a user post inviting people to assemble and protest against COVID lockdown policies. I support the major social-media platforms’ commitment to free expression within responsible standards that are applied equally, but they are playing with fire if they appear to pick sides in the raging controversy over our nation’s COVID response and economic lockdowns. They do not have the expertise or the credibility to make these decisions. It is better for them to allow Americans the freedom to air our COVID disagreements on social media. But they are much less likely to do that if they face serious liability risks. If some user posts advice or a video advocating risky behavior, we can’t then turn around and blame the social-media platform for failing to block the post. And we especially can’t let trial attorneys exploit the actions of social-media companies’ users to create a lawsuit jamboree.  So that makes three kinds of COVID-liability protection this Congress and administration need to quickly enact: protection for medical professionals, protection for employers and businesses, and protection for the communications platforms where we debate how Americans should live and work amid this deadly pandemic. At such a time of widespread uncertainty and risk, our nation deserves nothing less. 

One of the reasons the coronavirus pandemic got out of hand in this country is the testing fiasco orchestrated by the Centers for Disease Control and the Food and Drug Administration. There’s a lesson here for those of us in higher education. When innovation is needed — and needed quickly — we shouldn’t put all our eggs in one basket.  In early January, Chinese scientists published the genetic sequence of the new coronavirus, which allowed laboratories to start designing tests. By late January, around 20 organizations in the U.S. were developing tests. The CDC was able to design a test for the virus quickly, which the FDA approved on February 4. Thus, in a remarkable display of government competence and bureaucratic flexibility, two federal agencies were able to create a test for a never-before-seen virus and approve it for nationwide distribution in less than a month. But they had also sown the seeds for a testing fiasco. While the declaration of a public-health emergency gave the FDA the ability to speed up testing approvals, it placed stringent burdens on non-CDC organizations. Those organizations that had been working on designing tests in January spent February trying to navigate a bureaucratic labyrinth, with one exasperated scientist being told that his emailed submission was not acceptable because the FDA needed a hard copy by mail as well. The FDA did not approve another test until February 29. The FDA’s foot dragging meant that for most of February, the CDC test was the only game in town. But the CDC test turned out to be broken — needing another three weeks to find a workaround. Thus, between February 4 and February 26, during which the virus was spreading exponentially, the country effectively lacked large-scale testing capability. And we lacked this capability because the FDA insisted on putting all the nation’s testing eggs in one basket: the CDC test, which the CDC botched.  Higher education should avoid repeating this mistake. The key lesson from the FDA and CDC testing fiasco is that we shouldn’t rely solely on existing institutions to get it right in the face of a new and rapidly evolving crisis. But unless changes are made, higher education will likely repeat the mistakes of the CDC and FDA, with colleges playing the role of the CDC and accreditors playing the role of the FDA.  
 It is possible that higher education can return to the status quo if the crisis is short-lived. But if we need to discover and implement a new normal, we shouldn’t rely solely on existing colleges. While on paper they are a natural choice since they already have many of the necessary components (a large pool of skilled teaching faculty, existing registration and grading systems, financial-aid offices, etc.), history suggests that many will be slow to react. Part of this is simply inertia by the previously successful (e.g., Blockbuster vs. Netflix). Another part is the difficulty any organization has when trying to change their business model, with unique handicaps in higher education because so many stakeholders have veto power over any change.  So while colleges should be encouraged to help discover and implement a new normal for higher education, we must open up higher education to new providers that may be more innovative and flexible. But just as the FDA hindered virus testing, accreditation can hinder educational alternatives because educational institutions need accreditor approval to participate in the federal financial-aid programs. Entrepreneurs can start a new college, but their students can’t use Pell grants or student loans to pay for it without an accreditor’s approval. In a new study, The Case for Escape Hatches from Higher Education Accreditation, we document some of the issues with accreditation, including the failure to assure quality and contributing to higher college costs. But during the current virus crisis, the most important problem is the recipe approach of accreditation, where accreditors insist on a set of inputs and processes that colleges must use.   Accreditation’s recipe approach presents a huge barrier to innovation. But we should not get rid of accreditation either because without accreditors, there is little to protect against fly-by-night schools that do not educate their students. We would also likely witness a dramatic increase in federal and state government interference in higher education as they seek to fill the accountability void if accreditors are removed. A partial solution to this dilemma is to introduce escape hatches from the accreditation system.  While accreditation focuses on inputs, and is largely agnostic regarding outcomes, escape hatches would reverse this, focusing on outcomes while being agnostic about inputs. Under the escape hatch plan, Congress and the Department of Education would set benchmarks for learning and/or labor market outcomes, and any students attending an educational institution that met these benchmarks would have access to federal financial-aid programs without their program needing to be accredited as well. For fields with outside certification exams, benchmarks for learning outcomes could be introduced. Consider accounting, a field in which many graduates take the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) exam. An accounting program could be given access to the federal financial aid programs if a set percentage of its graduates pass the CPA exam, or if the value-added contribution to their students’ CPA passage rate exceeds a set level. Similarly, labor-market outcomes could focus on reducing unemployment or increasing the earnings of students by set amounts.  This escape-hatch plan is a good idea even in normal times. But it is crucial during this pandemic because if the crisis is severe, prolonged, or recurring, we very well may need to move to a new normal in higher education. But just as the CDC and FDA’s testing fiasco hobbled the country’s response to the virus, the accreditation system may hobble the search for and discovery of a new normal in higher education. Escape hatches from accreditation can help mitigate this danger. 

One wonders if it will be recorded in the history books that from March 30th to June 20th Hungary lived as the shortest dictatorship in European history, before voluntarily extinguishing itself. An odd act for a dictatorship. Prime Minister Viktor Orbán of Hungary had used the coronavirus to make himself dictator for life, it was said. But I guess he only had it in him to be dictator for life for less than three months.  Our most important experts on democracy and Eastern Europe knew that Viktor Orbán had really done it this time. Yasmeen Serhan, writing in The Atlantic this April, declared: “There is a line between using emergency powers and outright authoritarianism—one that Hungary has undoubtedly crossed.” “The brazenness of Orbán’s power grab is without any parallel in recent European history,” wrote Dalibor Rohac in the Washington Post, predicting confidently that absent a “strong pushback from Brussels and Washington — which are both understandably preoccupied by more urgent matters — Hungary is bound to emerge from the current crisis as a full-fledged dictatorship.” It was on March 30th that the Hungarian Parliament approved a state-of-emergency law to deal with coronavirus that gave power to Viktor Orbán’s government to pass laws by decree, and instituted severe-looking restrictions on the dissemination of fake news. Several European countries had already passed enabling acts of this sort — France has seemed to go in and out of such states of emergency regularly in the last decade. That the emergency powers were a feature of Hungary’s existing constitution, limited by that constitution not to touch fundamental rights and subject to a parliamentary check, troubled none of these analysts.  At the time of this great panic for Hungarian democracy, Hungarian opponents of Orbán spread ludicrous and easily-checkable claims about the legislation, saying that the parliament itself had been suspended and elections cancelled, a claim spread by people as eminent as Anne Applebaum. Other experts told us confidently that these powers were gathered by Orbán for the purpose of suppressing the inevitably disastrous performance of his nation’s health-care institutions. American political strategists predicted extravagant things, such as: “He’s going to wind up putting Gypsies in permanent detention…”  
 I predicted that Orbán would return the emergency powers back to Parliament roughly around the same time as France. This week, Hungary began the process, and all powers will be restored by June 20th. Currently, France’s emergency powers last until July 10th, but could be extended.  How did the predictions pan out? Hungary has seen just under 500 deaths out of slightly less than 3,500 cases, which, while serious, is nothing like the horrors visited upon Italy or Spain in recent months. Its hospital system, though far behind richer nations, did not break down. There was no great showdown with Brussels and Washington, D.C., needed to end the emergency. During the crisis, Orbán’s opponents often repeated a statement from the European Commission expressing “concern” about the emergency legislation and a determination to monitor it. What they often did not mention was that the statement came along with a preliminary ruling of EU legal experts that there were no concrete violations of fundamental democratic rights, and therefore Brussels had no basis for acting against Hungary.  Orbán is not immune from criticism for his use of the powers. He used the power to rule by fiat to pass a planned redevelopment of City Park, which his party desired to do but which has been blocked by the opposition in Parliament and by the mayor of Budapest. This is an abuse of emergency powers, and a bit of political hardball, though not one that touches on the fundaments of democracy. End runs like this are commonly done in the Western world. New York governor Andrew Cuomo used sweeping emergency powers to amend or rewrite hundreds of New York laws, including many unrelated to the response to COVID-19 that he couldn’t pass through the legislature. Among these was suspending the requirement that cities and towns publish certain legal notices, a serious source of income for local media that could lead to newspaper closures and will make it harder for citizens to know how their tax monies are being spent. This too is an abuse, but nobody outside of the letters to the editor section of newspapers seems to notice it.  It was widely reported that two persons were arrested under the new emergency law powers for criticizing government. Both were questioned and released, One of them, identified only as “Andras” in media reports, was told by police that he had not committed a crime. He gave an interview about his interrogation to one of the most-read news sites in Hungary.   In my book, the police were too zealous and the law too broad. Neither of those two men should have been questioned even if they weren’t charged. But overzealous and lunkheaded investigations are launched by the police frequently in free countries. And Hungarian speech restrictions, even in the emergency, are put into relief when contrasted with European peers with great liberal reputations. Hundreds of people in the U.K. face lengthy and expensive trials or even prison sentences for charges under the Communications Act, and police there regularly threaten the public to watch what they say on social media. Germany’s Network Enforcement Act defines dangerous speech so broadly it would give supporters of opposition parties a second thought about expressing themselves on the Internet. Non-liberal states such as Russia, the Philippines, and Singapore have all cited it as an example to be emulated. German politicians have demanded that the law be made more repressive and loopholes in it be closed. As for the predictions of indefinite detention, Hungary has not created its own version of America’s Guantanamo Bay, thank God. It’s remarkable that the same experts who were so sure Iraq would become a liberal democracy once a little force was applied are now so sure that Hungary will be a dictatorship by having elections and taking constitutional measures.  They will not be troubled by the failure of their certain predictions. Their opposition will just be repackaged in in some new theory. Well of course, Orbán can return the powers, they’ll say, he has a rubber stamp in Parliament. And besides, he’ll want those subsidies from Brussels. But then why did they believe it was the advent of dictatorship when they mistakenly thought Parliament was suspended? The same game is played with Hungary’s constitution. A rumor of a forthcoming transgression of that constitution is evidence of illiberal democracy run amok, but the evidence of following it interpreted as an empty gesture. Heads, tails. Etc. One suspects it’s just simple hatred of Christian conservatism, a fanatical projection of culture war antipathies to the near abroad. Liberal keyboard warriors such as Cas Mudde even suggested allying with the fascist Jobbick Party to unseat Orbán in 2018, even as that party was led by a man who had founded an ultra-nationalist paramilitary. Or sometimes it is mere class interest, as the worry about illiberal democracy almost always expresses itself in terms about the status of journalists and academics in Hungary. Most of this worry is done in pure ignorance about the leading online media outlets, such as Index and !!44!!!, which tend to be critical of the government. And perhaps it has blinded them to the real dangers lurking in this part of the world. Illiberal democracy has mostly been a chimera. But the ongoing tit-for-tat between Hungary and Romania should trouble anyone who knows something about history in this region. The Hungarian government is increasingly engaging with the diaspora of Hungarian speakers in Romania. This is overwhelmingly popular in Hungary and addresses some of Orbán’s often-stated fears of demographic collapse. But it is a serious agitation to a neighbor. The Prime Minister of Romania has recently called attempts to guarantee more rights to the sizable Hungarian speaking minority in his country “treasonous.” Most of Hungary’s Western detractors hail from the school of thought born from the title (if not the text) of Francis Fukuyama’s The End of History. But there are rages, resentments, and humiliations lurking around the 1920 Treaty of Trianon that radically shrunk Hungary. And we should not believe that in a world of collapsing native populations, these border disputes can remain submerged. If our foreign-policy experts could manage to read something longer than a hysterical tweet, they might be able to tell us something about it. In the meantime, they’ll have to put up with former dictator Viktor Orbán clowning on them and demanding apologies. 

After it was alleged that he broke the government’s lockdown rules, Dominic Cummings, chief adviser to prime minister Boris Johnson, has been charged with hypocrisy. His (many) critics and detractors have demanded (thus far, unsuccessfully) that he be fired. But do they really believe that any other person acting similarly, and for the same reason, would have been punished? I can’t imagine that they do.  Cummings’s troubles began shortly after the prime minister had tested positive from the virus and he and his wife began to develop coronavirus symptoms. As the parents of a four-year-old, they were concerned that, should they both become incapacitated, their child’s safety and wellbeing would be in jeopardy. Since March 23, the U.K. has been under a strict government-mandated lockdown, restricting all but essential movements. However, a caveat was also included: “If you have children, keep following this advice to the best of your ability, however, we are aware that not all these measures will be possible.” On March 24, England’s deputy chief medical officer, Dr. Jenny Harris, further clarified that there was leeway for parents of young children. “Clearly if you have adults who are unable to look after a small child. That is an exceptional circumstance,” she said. Clearly. “If the individuals do not have access to care support, formal care support or access to family, they will be able to work through their local authority hubs.” In the Cummings’s case, they did have access to family. In order to secure contingency childcare for his four-year-old, Cummings drove his family 260 miles from their London home to Durham where his parents live. There, his nieces (aged 17 and 20) had volunteered to care for his child, should this become necessary (which, in the end, it didn’t). Neither Cummings nor his wife had any physical contact with his parents, or any other person, during their trip. They stayed in a separate cottage on their property. After the 14-day quarantine was up, Cummings was cleared by medical experts to be able to go back to work. At the suggestion of his wife, Cummings drove his family 60 miles (round trip) to Barnard Castle to check that he was fit enough to drive back to London. This remains one of the most controversial aspects of his trip — though again, the family did not come into contact with any other people.  The facts of this case have been obscured by sensationalist, confusing, and inaccurate reporting. Take, for example, this “report” from CNN, which claims that Johnson’s refusal to sack Cummings “threatens to wreck Britain’s lockdown.” Or this flat-out false report from the Express that Cummings made more than one trip to Durham. Or this speculative piece from the New Statesman suggesting the reason for his trip was actually his maternal uncle’s death. Perhaps there would have been less outrage if the government had set the record straight sooner with Cummings’s press conference. Nevertheless, now that Cummings has explained himself to the press, the continued media circus (who swarm outside his home with no regard for social-distancing rules) is increasingly absurd.   “I believe I made the right judgment, but I can understand that others may disagree with that,” Cummings said at yesterday’s press conference. For now, his job is safe. Johnson has given his full support, stating that he merely acted as “any father would have.” Cabinet minister Michael Gove has said “caring for your wife and child is not a crime.” Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has advised those condemning Cummings to “take a long hard look in the mirror.” What they are effectively saying, then, is that any person would be legally and morally justified to act in this way for this reason. But this isn’t a new standard. It’s the same standard that the law provided for to begin with. 
 Again, the real measure of whether or not Dominic Cummings acted hypocritically (and so ought to be fired) is whether any other person acting similarly would have, under the rules, been treated more harshly. As yet, the media have presented no such example of someone who has. It’s absolutely right to suggest that there should not be one standard for everyone and another for senior advisers. And by that logic, Dominic Cummings does not deserve to be punished. 

The New York Department of Health has apparently deleted a March order issued by Governor Andrew Cuomo that forced nursing homes to admit Covid-positive residents. The order, which was implemented on March 25, stated that “no resident shall be denied re-admission or admission to a nursing home solely based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19,” and also prohibited nursing homes from requiring testing prior to admission or readmission. But the order is no longer visible on the state’s website.  Other outdated guidelines, including a February order stating “there is no need to cancel school or social events, and there is no need for students or school staff to wear surgical masks at school,” remain active on the site. The New York Department of Health and Cuomo’s office did not respond to requests for comment as to why the order was deleted. New York leads the country with over 5,000 nursing home deaths due to coronavirus, and earlier this month admitted to quietly changing its criteria to count only those cases in which the individual died at the nursing home, rather than at the hospital. News of the policy has resulted in calls for an investigation from conservative lawmakers. Today I joined my @NewYorkGOP colleagues in the House to call for a federal investigation of Cuomo's failed nursing home policies. NOW they admit they unethically changed the way they report nursing home deaths. An INEXCUSABLE tragedy for NY – NEED ANSWERShttps://t.co/pHY98zlTN2 — Elise Stefanik (@EliseStefanik) May 15, 2020  Cuomo, who said in April that he was not aware of his state’s own policy, reversed it earlier this month. “We’re just not going to send a person who is positive to a nursing home after hospital visit. Period. If there’s any issue, the resident must be referred to the department of health which will find alternative care,” he announced on May 10.   After coming under fire for the initial directive, Cuomo defended his actions by deflecting criticism to the Trump administration.  “New York followed the president’s agencies’ guidance,” Cuomo said Saturday at his press conference. “What New York did was follow what the Republican Administration said to do. That’s not my attempt to politicize it. It’s my attempt to depoliticize it. So don’t criticize the state for following the president’s policy.” The governor’s office pointed to a March 13 directive to the states from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and Centers from Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): “Nursing homes should admit any individuals that they would normally admit to their facility, including individuals from hospitals where a case of COVID-19 was/is present,” it states. But the document also explains that a nursing home should only accept a Covid-positive patient “as long as the facility can follow CDC guidance for Transmission-Based Precautions.” Florida, which adopted a stance opposite to New York’s by keeping coronavirus patients out of nursing homes, has suffered only a fraction of the deaths.  “It was clear to me that there were much higher standards related to infection control being outlined by the federal CDC that well exceeded what our nursing homes traditionally have been expected to adhere to,” Mary Mayhew, secretary of Florida’s Agency for Healthcare Administration, told National Review. “So we never had false expectations.”  Send a tip to the news team at NR.

London — In 793, a raid on the Holy Island of Lindisfarne marked the start of the Viking age and a terror that would pervade England for centuries. Successful attacks from Denmark washed ashore year after year, villages were ransacked, towns brutalized; few who stood in their path survived. Hopeless against these unrelenting assaults, King Æthelred in 991 paid the Danes in silver so they would leave his kingdom in peace. Delighted by the offer of payment, the Vikings returned every year to claim the “Danegeld” from the English coffers, a practice that did not end until Scandinavian prince Cnut won the crown in 1016.  Rudyard Kipling’s poem “Dane-geld” rightly points out that “if once you have paid him the Dane-geld, you never get rid of the Dane.” A millennium later, the British Right is finally learning the lessons of its medieval forebears. Dominic Cummings is Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s chief adviser, a role he has held since Johnson took office in July 2019. Cummings is credited with being the mastermind behind the Vote Leave campaign and the Conservatives’ strategy that led to their winning December’s general election with a stonking majority. Naturally, this makes him the ultimate bogeyman for the Left. And since the start of the weekend, he has been at the center of their attacks. Cummings has been charged with one of the most heinous crimes in British society: hypocrisy. Cummings was a key figure in devising the government’s lockdown strategy, so the front pages of every broadsheet and tabloid splashed the news that he had traveled some 250 miles north of London — his primary residence — to his family’s home in Durham for child-care reasons.   This episode is difficult for Cummings, who has moved the Conservatives away from being the party of pensioners, the private sector, and the middle classes into a political outfit most popular with the working class. It is an extraordinary transformation, and much of it has relied on painting the opposition as elite and out of touch with ordinary people. American readers will no doubt find some similarities with this approach and their own Republican administration. 
 But the portrayal of Cummings as an elitist who believes that the rules don’t exist for him is dangerous political territory for him and risks damaging the credibility of that platform. Fortunately, however, Cummings is smarter than most of his opponents, and in an unprecedented move in British political history, on Monday he gave a defensive statement from Downing Street’s Rose Garden and took questions from lobby journalists about the furor.  He outlined his case calmly and with humility. He acted within the rules, he did what any parent would have done — care for their children above all else — and he took necessary precautions to prevent anyone else from being needlessly involved or put at risk. To every claim of law-breaking, he had a response. To every lie that he had traveled up North multiple times, he cited newspaper falsehoods.  The view that Cummings’s lockdown drive has ruined his image as an anti-elitist has been diminished by those attacking him. Opinion pieces throughout the legacy media have called for his dismissal, followed by attacks from bishops in the Church of England, celebrities, a flurry of major activists, and even the most recent president of the European Council, Donald Tusk. To them, he is a virus threatening to diminish the rules and norms in their carefully curated political system. He must be spared no quarter. Cummings was an adviser to then–education secretary Michael Gove in the early years of the last decade, when Gove took on the alliance of teachers, civil servants, and unions who resisted conservative reform. They called this group “The Blob,” a reference to a Steve McQueen science-fiction film from 1958 about an amoeba consuming the world. The Blob has followed Cummings since his stint in education, as the revolutionary actions of his masterminded Brexit referendum success have been met with extraordinary resistance from a cabal of lawyers, politicians, journalists, and activists through the U.K. Now they have formed again to attempt to strike him down over his drive to look after his sick family.  There have also been some useful idiots on the Conservative side who align themselves with the Blob, such as MPs William Wragg and Caroline Nokes, who have been quick to join in with leftist campaigns in the past. Just last week Mr. Wragg called the government “immoral” for its health-care surcharge fee for migrant health-care and social-care workers, which earned him a gushing news story in the Guardian. Many commentators have argued that giving an unelected senior adviser a government platform to defend himself is the biggest break from the unwritten political norms that quietly govern us. They are wrong; the fact that Cummings is even putting up a defense in the face of round-the-clock establishment-wide assault is the true highlight here.   Conservatives in the U.K. have rarely given any resistance to media mobs and instead quickly pay the Danegeld. In the last year or so, there have been a number of high-profile cases where left-wing campaigning journalists have tried, often successfully, to ruin a conservative’s life. The first major recent case was that of Sir Roger Scruton, who was crudely misrepresented by journalist George Eaton in April 2019. Scruton was portrayed as believing that all Chinese people are the same, which some digging from Douglas Murray — who unearthed the tapes of the interview — revealed to be a scandalous misrepresentation. Nevertheless, before Scruton had a chance to put up a fight against the media onslaught, the Conservative government sacked him from his unpaid position as an adviser to an architectural commission, with Tory MP (and now minister) Johnny Mercer describing removing Sir Roger as a “no-brainer.”  The Danegeld was paid, but the raids kept coming. Daniel Kawczynski, a Conservative MP, faced calls to resign after a media campaign chased his scalp for the crime of attending a conference on conservatism where people whom Buzzfeed and the BBC found distasteful were also present. And most recently, a huge campaign was launched against a young government aide named Andrew Sabisky, who was slandered and misrepresented as a racist eugenicist on some of the country’s best-selling front pages. But now the Blob are faced with a target who has said that he hasn’t even considered resigning. Faced with the opportunity to cough up the geld, offer his resignation, and give the vampiric quarters that dominate the fourth estate the vial of blood they crave, Cummings has instead opted to stand firm and reject the Salem-style trial that has all too often scuppered figures on his side. Last month, the head of the Metropolitan Police, Cressida Dick, was filmed standing on Westminster Bridge surrounded by policing colleagues as they took part in the weekly national clapping for carers (this exercise really is as ridiculous as it sounds). A few journalists pointed out that she was breaking social-distancing rules, but there was no great media campaign, despite her lofty status in British society. The completely different reactions to these two “offenses” reveals the nature of Cummings’s complainants: They are politically driven by those who deeply regret his tsunami of victories over them. Resisting media pressure is only the start. If the conservatives want to kick on and reduce their fragility in future attacks of this kind, they must challenge the cultural power that pervades the publicly funded ivory towers of the universities — many of which are basically pointless — the Church of England, a vast range of dubiously funded NGOs and charities, pressure groups, and many other sources of anti-Tory hate. If we fail to fight back against the Blob, it will continue to threaten to consume us. 

North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper on Monday declined to say whether he will allow the Republican National Convention to move forward in August at full capacity after President Trump threatened to move it out of the state barring an immediate answer from the Democratic governor. “State health officials are working with the RNC and will review its plans as they make decisions about how to hold the convention in Charlotte,” said Dory MacMillan, a spokesperson for the governor, on Monday. “North Carolina is relying on data and science to protect our state’s public health and safety.”  Trump wrote in a Monday tweet that he may move to relocate the convention, scheduled to take place in Charlotte, N.C. from August 24 to 27, if Cooper refused to guarantee that it would be allowed to occur at full capacity. The convention is expected to draw at least 50,000 people. Cooper “is still in Shutdown mood & unable to guarantee that by August we will be allowed full attendance in the Arena,” Trump wrote. “In other words, we would be spending millions of dollars building the Arena to a very high standard without even knowing if the Democrat Governor would allow the Republican Party to fully occupy the space.” Attendees “must be immediately given an answer by the Governor as to whether or not the space will be allowed to be fully occupied,” the president continued. “If not, we will be reluctantly forced to find, with all of the jobs and economic development it brings, another Republican National Convention site. This is not something I want to do.”   North Carolina entered phase two of its reopening on Friday, when Cooper allowed more businesses including hair salons and restaurants to reopen. On Saturday, the state reported its largest one-day increase of positive cases. Trump added in a later tweet that he has “zero interest” in moving the convention to the Trump National Doral Miami in Florida, saying he “would like to stay in N.C., whose gov. doesn’t even know if he can let people in?”  Send a tip to the news team at NR. 

I’m not sure the political world has fully grasped how odd and different this upcoming presidential campaign is going to be, barring some sort of miraculous and rapid solution to the coronavirus pandemic. Joe Biden has probably shaken his last hand in 2020, worked his last rope line, and held his last rally. President Trump is no doubt itching to hold one of his traditional boisterous rallies, but that will depend upon whether it’s safe for people to get together in groups.  Modern campaigns are almost entirely focused upon getting the candidate in front of large groups of people, which is what we’re supposed to be avoiding in the era of “social distancing.” Candidates will be traveling significantly less; what’s the point of being in a particular state for a “virtual” rally? Will the Biden campaign even have a press plane? Will reporters want to spend a lot of time on planes, hopping from swing-state city to the next? Press conferences were already growing rarer in recent cycles. Will any reporter ask Joe Biden a question in person for the next five months or so? There probably won’t be any campaign rally/concerts featuring Jay-Z and Katy Perry for the Democratic nominee this year. Biden is unlikely to sit on the couches on the set of Jimmy Fallon or Jimmy Kimmel or Stephen Colbert; all his late-night joke-filled appearances will be by remote. The candidates will still hold photo opportunities, but the menu will be smaller. School classrooms are unlikely. Candidates may still “drop in” on iconic bars, restaurants and small businesses — if they’re still open — but presumably those establishments will have a reduced number of patrons at any given time. No more hanging out with the bikers, with a woman on Biden’s lap. There is likely to be a 9/11 ceremony in New York in September, but it may not be such a big gathering. Visiting a hospital will carry its own risks, and reminders of the candidates’ ages.  Getting-out-the-vote will involve fewer knocking on doors — or perhaps standing a safe distance away from the door. There will be fewer big gatherings such as festivals, sporting events, or concerts for voter-registration drives. Some college students will be back on campus, but some won’t, and they probably won’t be hosting big events. As noted in today’s Jolt, the party conventions will probably be nothing like what they have been in recent cycles. The next couple months of the campaign are probably going to look a lot like the previous few months of the campaign.  

The pathogen has had a serious outbreak in state and federal prisons — jails have proven to be the leading COVID-19 hotspots — and this side of the curve-bending seems to be a slow affair. The toll has been significant. The Marshall Project/Associated Press tabulates (through May 22nd) that nearly 30,000 prisoners have contracted the virus, with 415 deaths. As for prison staff, there are 33 reported deaths (only 16 states are releasing information about the virus’s toll on personnel).  What to do? One partial solution — which has caused some conservative angst — is the early release or pardoning of chunks of the population (typically those with non-violent records or on the verge of parole) to relieve pressure on the contamination spread, exacerbated by jailhouse density. An alternative to prisoner-release — and a sensible strategy for implementing general safety to contain viral spread — might be the aggressive use of masks and other safety devices. Which is exactly what is the intent of a joint effort by the National Sheriffs’ Association (sheriffs oversee the vast majority of U.S. jails) and the hip-hop-influenced REFORM Alliance. The two (unusually paired) organizations announced today the launch of a $10 million private-funded partnership to send millions of PPE masks to America’s prisons to protect the incarcerated and law-enforcement staff. The purpose is not only to provide protection, but to crush the contagion’s spread. Here’s hoping it works. 

This story in Politico will add fuel to the fire to the GOP argument that Democrats are rooting against signs of an economic recovery before November. Jason Furman, a top economist in the Obama administration and now a professor at Harvard, contends that “we are about to see the best economic data we’ve seen in the history of this country.” As the country gradually figures out how to function with the coronavirus, the sudden steep drop in economic activity will climb back up again. In fact, it may be happening already, although it may not show up in economic statistics for a while. The Wall Street Journal reports: “Truck loads are growing again. Air travel and hotel bookings are up slightly. Mortgage applications are rising. And more people are applying to open new businesses . . . . For the first time since the pandemic forced widespread U.S. business closures in March, it appears conditions in some corners of the economy aren’t getting worse, and might even be improving.” Furman believes “the months preceding the November election could offer Trump the chance to brag — truthfully — about the most explosive monthly employment numbers and GDP growth ever.” And Politico offers this eye-popping quote: Furman’s counterintuitive pitch has caused some Democrats, especially Obama alumni, around Washington to panic. “This is my big worry,” said a former Obama White House official who is still close to the former president. Asked about the level of concern among top party officials, he said, “It’s high — high, high, high, high.” If the opposition party’s argument against an incumbent president is strong and compelling and aligned with the values of the electorate, the economic conditions in the fall shouldn’t matter that much. Democrats believed they had a virtual encyclopedia of arguments against the president before the coronavirus hit. An economic rebound shouldn’t derail their argument against the president; if it does, maybe those arguments weren’t as strong as Democrats thought. Public approval of Trump’s response to the virus is falling along the lines of his overall approval rating. No matter what happens from here on out, Joe Biden and the Democrats will be arguing that President Trump fumbled the initial response to the coronavirus and will likely argue that Trump and Republican governors reopened parts of the country too fast, increasing the risk of more casualties from the virus. And Democrats will still argue that Trump is xenophobic, racist, ignorant, filled with rage, reckless, selfish, unhinged, etc.   Democrats might want to spend some time examining if the Biden economic agenda that was largely put together in a 2019 boom will look as appealing if the economy isn’t rebounding in autumn. Back during one of the debates, Tim Alberta of Politico asked Biden, “As president, would you be willing to sacrifice some of that growth, even knowing potentially that it could displace thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of blue-collar workers in the interest of transitioning to that greener economy?” Biden responded, “The answer is yes. The answer is yes, because the opportunity — the opportunity for those workers to transition to high-paying jobs, as Tom said, is real.”  Biden pledged “no new fracking” during a debate, then walked it back; he wants to set a price on carbon to be used for either a carbon tax or cap-and-trade; Biden endorsed California’s AB5, the anti-“gig” law; he would raise the corporate tax rate from 21 percent to 28 percent, and he insists he can raise taxes by $4 trillion over the next decade, without raising taxes on anyone making $400,000 per year or less. If the Democrats’ argument against Trump can’t work if there’s a partial economic rebound before November, they truly deserve to lose.  

Welcome to week eleven of life with the coronavirus pandemic. If someone is asking “Why aren’t people staying inside like they did before?” it means they are in denial of the fact that this is week eleven of life with the coronavirus pandemic. On the menu today: wondering just how either party can safely hold a convention under these circumstances; former senator and ambassador Max Baucus trashes the administration for Chinese state television; and Gretchen Whitmer’s husband appears to tank her chances of being Joe Biden’s running mate.  What Is the Purpose of a Political Convention during a Pandemic? How soon do you envision yourself indoors in a crowd of people, standing or sitting less than six feet apart? The president wants the 2020 Republican National Convention, scheduled for August 24 through 27 in Charlotte, to look like a traditional one. In a series of tweets Monday, the president fumed that Democratic governor Roy Cooper “is still in shutdown mood” and “unable to guarantee that by August we will still be allowed full attendance in the arena . . . Plans are being made by many thousands of enthusiastic Republicans, and others, to head to beautiful North Carolina in August. They must be immediately given an answer by the Governor as to whether or not the space will be allowed to be fully occupied. If not, we will be reluctantly forced to find, with all of the jobs and economic development it brings, another Republican National Convention site.” Yesterday, Trump added in another tweet that he has no interest in bringing the convention to his Doral property near Miami, Fla.  The lone response from the North Carolina governor’s office so far is a brief statement from Cooper’s press secretary, Dory MacMillan: “State health officials are working with the RNC and will review its plans as they make decisions about how to hold the convention in Charlotte. North Carolina is relying on data and science to protect our state’s public health and safety.”  Saturday evening, Jonathan Swan of Axios reported, “watch for a visual contrast between the two party conventions in August. Two sources close to the president said they hope to have a boisterous, live crowd. They want to have more people there physically than at the Democratic convention the week earlier, which will likely involve significant virtual elements.” The Democratic convention in Milwaukee is going to be on such a smaller scale: The city is hoping it wins the opportunity to host the 2024 Democratic convention.  Without the ability to bring lots of people together in the same place, it’s fair to wonder what the point of a party’s national convention is. Otherwise, it’s just a series of speeches. Since at least the 1990s, news institutions wondered how much actual news there was in conventions where the nominee is already known, the nominating process was a formality, and the prime-time speeches turned into a four-night informercial for the party. For local businesses, conventions are a bonanza, from the huge influx of delegates, alternate delegates, just about every major elected official in the party (in normal cycles; 2016 was a little different for the GOP), and tens of thousands of members of the media.  Increasingly, host cities welcome a lot of out-of-town cops, helping the locals keep everything secure. For donors and party officials, it’s four days of networking and four nights of partying. For political junkies, it’s Disneyland with every local university, think tank, activist group, and faction hosting open events. For protesters, it’s a moment to rally, beat their drums, and march around with their giant paper-mache heads. But few of those activities can be easily done while social distancing. (I suppose many of the protesters are used to wearing masks.)  Would Barack Obama’s address at the Democratic National Convention in 2004 have been as well received if there was no crowd in front of him? Would Ted Cruz’s “vote your conscience” closing line at the 2016 GOP convention in Cleveland have mattered without the booing from the delegates and the scowling reaction from the Trump family? Is there a point to dropping lots of red, white, and blue balloons and confetti if there’s no one beneath them? The good news is that late August should be one of the lowest-risk times of year. Research indicates summer heat will mitigate the spread of the virus, although it will be a secondary factor compared to people’s behaviors. Because being outdoors is considered safer than indoors, if there must be a gathering of lots of people, would it make more sense to hold events in an open-air football or baseball stadium? Maybe Obama was ahead of the curve with his columns in Denver in 2008. Charlotte’s basketball arena, the Spectrum Center — formerly known as Time Warner Cable Arena — has a seating capacity of roughly 20,000. Most football stadiums have capacity of at least 50,000; Bryant-Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa, Ala., has more than 100,000. You could have a large crowd and spread everyone out several feet.   You could envision more creative ways of taking the event out of one location and making supporters across the country feel like they have a role, no matter where they live. What if you asked every party supporter in America to go out onto their front porch or apartment balcony, put out their yard signs or homemade signs or paraphernalia, and listen or stream the speeches, so that the audience is coast-to-coast? And what if the conclusion of the nominee’s speech, instead of the balloon drop, people set off small fireworks or some other celebratory noise? If the GOP does go ahead with holding the convention in the Spectrum Center, many health experts will argue that large a gathering under one roof with ventilated air — with a decent number of senior citizens in attendance! — is unsafe. But to raise the question I’m asking more frequently lately . . . how much less safe is gathering in an arena than taking the New York City subway system right now? Or New York City Transit Port Authority buses? People are still getting on airplanes and standing on long lines in airports. One last thought: How many Americans will have had the coronavirus and have recovered by late August? Not every state is collecting data on those who beat the virus, but as of this writing, the count is 464,727.  Corrupt to the Max Our Zach Evans notes that the former senator and former U.S. ambassador to China Max Baucus is regularly denouncing President Trump on Chinese state television. Evans observes, “the former senator sits on the Board of Advisers to Alibaba Group. He also runs a consulting firm, Baucus Group LLC, which connects American and Chinese businesses.” Every now and then I marvel that former German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder is now pretty much a lobbyist for the Russian oil industry, and everyone in the West has more or less accepted it. Our media — and the U.K. media, and other western countries — is justifiably anti-Putin . . . but when a former head of state of a NATO country signs on to become a Putin stooge, they generate a mild “tsk-tsk” and move on. Considering all the ire at Trump for his swooning for Putin, you would think we could spare some more anger for a former head of state who’s signed an actual contract with Putin allies. Amazon is allegedly the bad guys in the eyes of many on the Left, but former Obama press secretary Jay Carney is making a good living as one of their senior vice presidents. David Plouffe went to Uber and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, EPA head Lisa Jackson went to Apple, and Eric Holder went to Airbnb. Corporate America is evil and greedy and the driving force behind worsening inequality . . . but if some former Democratic official wants to cash in, it’s all cool. Governors in Michigan, Illinois, and Virginia Prefer to Ignore the Inconvenient Rules I didn’t think Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer was a likely or good choice to be Joe Biden’s running mate. She appears even less likely to be the choice this morning: The owner of a Northern Michigan dock company says Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s husband wanted his boat placed in the water before the Memorial Day weekend as Whitmer urged residents not to rush to the region. “This morning, I was out working when the office called me, there was a gentleman on hold who wanted his boat in the water before the weekend,” Dowker posted. “Being Memorial weekend and the fact that we started working three weeks late means there is no chance this is going to happen.” “Well our office personnel had explained this to the man and he replied, ‘I am the husband to the governor, will this make a difference?'”… In a statement, Whitmer spokeswoman Brown didn’t specifically confirm or deny the company’s assertion. “Our practice is not to discuss the governor’s or her family’s personal calendar/schedules. And we’re not going to make it a practice of addressing every rumor that is spread online,” Brown said. When a governor’s office doesn’t deny a story like this, that’s pretty much a confirmation. This goes well with Illinois governor J. B. Pritzker’s family going to Wisconsin and Florida during lockdown and Virginia governor Ralph Northam out taking selfies without social distancing or wearing a mask. Apparently, very few governors think the restrictions they announced apply to themselves or their own families. Or maybe Governor Whitmer’s husband just ranks among the many, many spouses who choose to tune out their partner’s requests and recommendations. ADDENDUM: Our Robert VerBruggen offers readers all the studies they could ever want, whether they want to argue that lockdowns work to stop the spread of the coronavirus or they don’t.  

How much economic upheaval will COVID-19 cause? Nobody knows at this point. What the labor market will look like in a year or more is subject to enormous conjecture. And that being the case, the way most young Americans used to treat going to college — as the only conceivable option — should change. In today’s Martin Center article, Chloe Anagnos argues that it makes sense for them, whether they’ve already graduated, were in college when COVID-19 hit, or are still in high school, to look for work and training options that will give them immediate benefits. Laying out lots of money for college courses that might never pay off is a bad idea. Anagnos points to numerous alternatives to enrolling in a college or university now: LinkedIn, Google, and Hubspot, for example, have a mix of paid and free courses you can take that will make you more employable. From software development to basic digital tool training, those online classes offer students and recent grads a golden opportunity to stay relevant. By earning valuable marketing certificates and a variety of important skills such as video and social media marketing, SEO, public relations, branding, Google and Facebook advertising, proficiency in Google Analytics, and content drafting, you will be much more competitive when the labor market warms up again. At this time, it makes sense to put actual work experience on your resume rather than biding your time (and spending your money) for college, Anagnos argues. The best approach to our uncertain future is to adopt a “craftsman mindset.” She concludes: At the end of the day, employers will feel much more compelled to hire people who have put their time to good use during the lockdown by working instead of simply waiting or getting deeper in the red for a degree that might not make a huge difference.  

Dominic Cummings, the top adviser to British prime minister Boris Johnson and a key player in Brexit, argued that he “behaved reasonably” in driving 260 miles to his parents’ home, despite being exposed to his wife’s coronavirus-like symptoms. “I’m not surprised many people are very angry,” Cummings said in a Monday press conference. “I don’t regret what I did; I think what I did was reasonable in these circumstances.” Cummings, who himself contracted the virus after travelling, said he made the decision to be near family over worries he and his wife would not be able to care for their 4-year-old son.  “I think the people like me who make the rules should be held accountable for their actions,” Cummings explained, but refused to accept British media criticism that he had broken the lockdown by travelling, pointing to a clause in the guidelines that allows for exceptional childcare circumstances. Johnson dismissed calls for Cummings’s resignation, saying his adviser “followed the instincts of every father and every parent, and I do not mark him down for that.” “I believe that in every respect, he has acted responsibly, and legally, and with integrity,” Johnson, who himself contracted the virus, said Sunday.  The opposition Labour Party slammed the decision, saying Cummings “breached the lockdown rules.”  “It is an insult to sacrifices made by the British people that Boris Johnson has chosen to take no action against Dominic Cummings,” Labour leader Keir Starmer said in a statement. “The public will be forgiven for thinking there is one rule for the prime minister’s closest adviser and another for the British people.”  Send a tip to the news team at NR. 

The men stood by themselves on Omaha Beach in the early hours of Saturday, dressed in vintage battle fatigues — with 6 feet between them. They looked out across the water where hundreds of thousands of soldiers — Americans, Brits and Canadians — came ashore on June 6, 1944, to launch the battle that changed the course of World War II. The gathering to mark the anniversary of the invasion, which came to be known simply as D-Day, was extraordinarily small, a few dozen — driven down by fear of the coronavirus, The Associated Press reported. Every other year has brought out throngs to mark the liberation from Nazi oppression. Last year, on the 75th anniversary, tens of thousands from around the globe streamed onto France’s beaches of Normandy to cheer the dwindling number of D-Day veterans. Charles Shay was one of those troops who stormed Omaha Beach, a 19-year-old Army medic who found himself dodging machine gun fire and exploding shells. “I am very sad now,” Shay, now 95, told the AP. “Because of the virus, nobody can be here. I would like to see more of us here.” After the war, Shay settled down near the beaches that came to define his life. His home is why he was virtually the only American survivor who stood on the sand Saturday — his fellow veterans could not fly in because of the pandemic. In better times, the French rolled out vintage jeep and trucks — their rumble heard for miles. On Saturday, the roads were deserted around Saint-Laurent-Sur-Mer, a town near Omaha Beach. “It’s a June 6 unlike any other,” said Mayor Philippe Laillier, who staged a small remembrance at the Omaha Beach monument. “But still we had to do something. We had to mark it.” The pandemic has wreaked havoc worldwide since late last year, killing nearly 400,000 — a quarter of the deaths in the US — and devastating economies, numbers show. The elderly, like the surviving D-Day veterans, are particularly at risk of becoming infected with the coronavirus. Even the young generations who turn out every year were barred from traveling to Normandy. Ivan Thierry is a local who makes his living by catching sea bass around the wrecks that still litter the waters. Thierry attends the observance every year — and this year was no different. He was holding Old Glory in tribute. “There is not nobody here,” Thierry, 62, told the AP. “Even if we are only a dozen, we are here to commemorate.” In Washington, President Trump remembered the day with a tweet saluting those who served so valiantly. “Today, we pause to remember and honor all the brave soldiers, sailors and airmen whose selfless sacrifice catalyzed the deliverance of oppressed people and secured freedom for decades to come. May we always be true to the virtues and principles for which this D-Day generation — the Greatest Generation — paid so dearly.”

A 77-year-old Michigan barber won a legal battle with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer over her coronavirus shutdown orders — in a stinging unanimous decision of the state Supreme Court. “It is incumbent on the courts to ensure decisions are made according to the rule of law, not hysteria,” Justice David F. Viviano wrote Friday, MLive.com reported. The court’s 7-0 decision vacated a lower court’s order upholding the state’s attempt to shutter the barbershop owned and operated by Karl Manke in Owosso, Mich. Manke reopened his shop May 4 in defiance of Whitmer’s orders keeping salons closed to prevent the spread of coronavirus. “Either Jesus comes, they cut my hands off or she resigns, one or the other,” he said Wednesday. Manke has argued that he has a right to work — and kept cutting customers’ hair as the legal fight raged. He has racked up thousands of dollars in fines, and the state has rescinded his licenses. The ruling returns the case to the appeals court for a full hearing scheduled for Thursday. But the case will soon be moot: under Whitmer’s orders, barbershops will be permitted to reopen fully on June 15.

A Maine factory said they will discard COVID-19 nasal swabs made during a visit by President Trump on Friday. “The running of the factory machines is very limited today and will only occur when the president is touring the facility floor,” Company marketing manager Virginia Templet told USA Today. “Swabs produced during that time will be discarded.” It was unclear why the swabs made during the visit will have to go. During his tour of Puritan Medical Products in Guilford, Maine, Trump touted the swabs, saying it was proof positive that American could handle its own medical supply needs. “Made in the USA. I’ve been saying it for a long time,” Trump said during the visit in which he toured the factory. He did not wear a face mask, in-keeping with his usual custom.

Coronavirus-stricken Broadway star Nick Cordero has undergone stem cell treatment to help improve his lung health, his wife Amanda Kloots revealed. “We have started stem cell treatment for Nick and that just finished. We decided on this a couple of days ago,” Kloots said in her latest Instagram update on Cordero’s health. Cordero, 41, has been hospitalized since April at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in LA with COVID-19 symptoms. His leg was amputated due to complications of the virus, and he has struggled with a lingering lung infection. Kloots, a 38-year-old fitness trainer, said Thursday there are “no guarantees” the treatment works, but they hope it will “help repair, help strengthen Nick’s lungs and get him better. So finger’s crossed. That’s the news.” She also asked her followers for advice on medical treatments that could aid “the release of carbon dioxide from the lungs. “If you think you know of a doctor or trial to help ONLY THAT please reach out to me. Real medically based information from credited sources please!”

While Prince William himself has been keeping it quiet, the royal family confirmed Friday that the heir to the throne has been lending his time to a crisis text line as the world continues to cope with the effects of COVID-19. Alongside wife Kate Middleton, the prince marked Volunteers’ Week by speaking to volunteers across the UK via video chat. Posted to the Kensington Royal Instagram page, the clip’s caption reveals that William himself has also been doing his part. “The Duke has been volunteering for #Shout85258, the UK’s first 24/7 crisis text line, launched in 2019 by The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and The Duke and Duchess of Sussex — as one of more than 2,000 Crisis Volunteers trained to support anyone, anytime, whatever their crisis may be.” “It’s National Volunteering Week and I want to say a big thank you from both of us,” Prince William said during the call. “Thank you for all the volunteering you’re doing, thank you for all the time and effort you’re putting in. It’s been hugely rewarding and important that you guys are doing that and you have been a lifeline to all the people who you’ve helped in the area.” Middleton added, “One of the things that would be amazing is if everyone in their communities was to carry on and still celebrate volunteering in a way that they have been during the pandemic. Everyone’s got something to give back.”

The World Health Organization is now advising everyone to wear face masks in public when they can’t practice social distancing — an about-face from its earlier guidance on stopping the spread of the coronavirus. WHO director-general Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced the shift Friday, citing new evidence that showed face masks worn by healthy people could be “a barrier for potentially infectious droplets,” the BBC reported. WHO had always advised that sick people and their caretakers should wear medical face masks. The new guidance advises healthy people to wear non-medical face masks. WHO officials for months have stood firm that a healthy person would get a false sense of security from wearing a mask and would use up supplies needed by medical professionals. New York already has a mandate for everyone to wear a face mask if they can’t stay at least 6 feet apart. New studies, however, show people can be highly infectious in the few days before they show symptoms or can catch the virus and never show symptoms. EPA REUTERS View Slideshow Governments should encourage the general public to wear masks where there is widespread transmission and physical distancing is difficult, such as on public transport, in shops or in other confined or crowded environments,” the director-general said. The guidance comes as transmission rates are accelerating in South America, the Middle East and Africa, CNN reported. The number of confirmed cases is climbing at a rate of more than 100,000 a day over a seven-day period, the outlet reported. The number of new cases topped 100,000 for nine of the past 10 days. In April, new cases never topped 100,000 in one day.

At the peak of the COVID-19 crisis in Manhattan, ambulance sirens wailed all day long outside the two-bedroom apartment where Stefanie Trilling lives with her husband, two children, aged 5 ½ and 2, and their dog. “It was really upsetting. Because my daughter is old enough to understand what was going on, she’d ask, ‘Do the people in the ambulance have coronavirus? Are they going to die?’ ” says Trilling. “I didn’t have the answers. The best I could do was say, ‘I don’t know, but we’re going to do the best we can to stay safe as a family, and that’s why we’re staying inside.’ So then I went to the distraction technique.” She found it in art: Specifically, in reworking children’s book covers. “One day I took out the paint,” says Trilling, who had never previously painted much. “I see one of the Elephant and Piggie books [the children’s series by Mo Willems]. I started painting the characters, and I started painting in a cartoonified coronavirus and I changed ‘Piggie’ to ‘COVID-19.’ ” She posted it on Instagram to share with her friends, who loved it and demanded that she do another cover. So she did “Pete the Cat and the Bad Corona.” Then her ideas started snowballing, one cover after another. “Green Eggs and Wash Your Hands,” “The Berenstain Bears and Too Much Time Home,” “Llama Llama Hasn’t Changed Pajamas.”  And that’s how Children’s Books for Pandemics, now a wildly popular social media phenomenon, was born. (“Multimedia parodist finding the best in a collectively bad situation,” reads Trilling’s Instagram bio.) While painting helped the time go by, the colorful covers provided Trilling with a non-threatening way to discuss the situation with her daughter. “We talked about what viruses are and why we were staying in. It gave her the context in which she could ask questions.” She hopes to sell prints and use a portion of the proceeds to help children in hard-hit neighborhoods. And as for whether this has made her see the city differently? “I see a lot of friends who are leaving, just packing up their apartments,” says Trilling. “But this is my home. This is where I’ve built my family. This is where I live, and this is where I love. It’s in a state of transition, but I know we’re going to come out on the other side, and I want to be a part of it.”

Infamous art dealer Mary Boone is a free woman, according to ArtNet’s gossip column, Wet Paint. It reports that Boone — who was sentenced in 2018 to 30 months in jail for tax evasion — has been released after serving just 13 months in prison in Danbury, Connecticut, because of the pandemic. Apparently Boone, a once almighty dealer who worked with Jean Michel Basquiat, Julian Schnabel and Roy Lichtenstein, among others, is now in a Brooklyn halfway house, awaiting final release. The outlet figured out that Boone’s on the outside again because she downloaded Citizen, an app that alerts users to police activity in their area. “The app pings you with a notification when someone in your contacts has joined,” which allowed them to see that Boone was back in possession of a smart phone. Wet Paint says it confirmed her release with the Department of Corrections. “The move appears to be a response to the threat Boone and fellow older inmates faced after several prisoners tested positive for COVID-19,” it reported.

Just when it felt like the country was completely falling apart comes great news: surprising, unprecedented job growth along with clear signs that the national pandemic has ebbed far from its peak. This doesn’t resolve the convulsions following the killing of George Floyd, but at least America is finally starting to put the previous crisis behind. Even as much of the nation has begun to reopen, economists predicted that the May jobs numbers would continue to depress. Many predicted US unemployment to reach Depression-era levels of around 20 percent. Instead, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported May’s unemployment rate was 13.3 percent, dropping from 14.7 percent in April (the highest since the Second World War). The 2.5 million jobs added last month made for the biggest jump in US history. That’s quite the rebound after the quickest drop ever, thanks to the three-month lockdown that, out of the blue, put tens of millions out of work. Plus, these are last month’s numbers: June, when even hard-hit New York City will start to reopen, should be better still. All of which raises real hope the entire national recovery will be a rapid bounce-back — instead of a slow, years-long plod to reach the heights America knew in February. More grounds for hope: All indications are that the virus is losing. The city says there were zero coronavirus deaths one day this week, the first time since March 11. At its peak, COVID-19 was killing 500 residents a day. Statewide, deaths have been dropping since early April, and total hospitalizations are also plummeting. The national infection numbers are trending down, too. The country’s still recording around 20,000 new cases a day — but that’s largely because testing has finally scaled up to where it needs to be. Most important: The percentage of tests coming back positive is falling — even in states like Florida that led the way in reopening. Anthony Fauci, the White House infectious disease expert, is now optimistic, too, announcing that it’s “a bit of a reach” to say schools need to be shuttered through fall. Masks and social distancing won’t go away soon; attending indoor concerts and the like is still far off. But hotels, entertainment and even the airlines — some of the hardest-hit industries — are all coming back. Americans are putting the pieces of their economy and their society back together. What a relief.

Fox and The CW have proactively shaken up their fall schedules — compromised by the industry-wide shutdown in place since mid-March. Both networks have been importing series that weren’t originally on their fall slates to fill the gaps until their regularly scheduled programming can return. (The CW has pushed the official launch of its “fall” season to early 2021.) Fox has snatched up “LA’s Finest,” which previously aired to a more limited audience on Spectrum in 2019. A spinoff of the “Bad Boys” movie franchise, the crime drama (currently two seasons) stars Gabrielle Union and Jessica Alba as LA-based cops. “It has a diverse cast, two great stars … and we felt like it checked a lot of boxes of a show that could be connect with our viewers,” Dan Harrison, Fox’s executive vice president of program planning and content strategy, tells The Post. “So that was a conversation we engaged in early, recognizing the pandemic was not going to be a one-week or two-month situation and would impact life for some time and therefore production for some time. We thought we ought to be smart and aggressive about filling those [scheduling] holes.” In addition to “LA’s Finest,” Fox has tweaked its schedule in other ways. It will air repeats from Season 3 of National Geographic’s “Cosmos: Possible Worlds,” hosted by Neal deGrasse Tyson, and has moved new entries “Filthy Rich” and “NeXt” from their spring/summer rollouts to the fall. “Filthy Rich” stars Kim Cattrall (“Sex and the City”) and Gerald McRaney (“House of Cards”). It’s based on a New Zealand format and follows a wealthy Southern family who made their fortune through a Christian TV network. After the network’s founder is killed in a plane crash, complications arise when three unknown family members emerge from the woodwork. “NeXt,” starring John Slattery (“Mad Men”) is a sci-fi thriller akin to “Mr. Robot” and “Westworld” that follows a Homeland Security team trying to fight and track a rogue AI (artificial intelligence) entity. “Both of those shows we had scheduled to premiere in the late spring and play into the summer,” says Harrison. “We made the strategic decision early on in the pandemic to pivot, and we had the luxury of being able to be nimble there.” With the bulk of The CW’s new shows now premiering next year, “Supernatural” — in its 15th season — won’t end anytime soon. Its finale, which was originally slated to air this spring, has been pushed to an unannounced date. The network has added the eerie anthology series “Tell Me a Story” — which streamed on CBS All Access from 2018-2020 — to its fall schedule, along with “Swamp Thing,” which was canceled by DC Universe after one troubled season. The CW is also importing the British series “Devils,” starring Patrick Demsey (“Grey’s Anatomy”) as a ruthless London bank CEO who ends up in an international battle of wits and financial intrigue when his protege (Alessandro Borghi) is accused of murder. “We’re having discussions on how to responsibly resume production as quickly and as reasonably and safely as possible,” says Fox’s Harrison. “Speed is not the key factor, it’s about doing this in the right way. “We want to be sensitive to everything that is going on.”

At City Journal, Rafael A. Mangual sees irony in gripes that attention paid to “the relative handful” of violent agitators distorts the image of an otherwise peaceful movement — even as the violence by cops that sparked the protests similarly doesn’t fairly “characterize” law enforcement. Police are “not perfect,” he admits, but to bridge the gap between protesters and cops, “destructive hyperbole” about police violence “needs to be recognized for what it is.” Data on police use of force “predominantly reveal professionalism and restraint,” suggesting, for instance, that in 2018, police in America “applied deadly force with a firearm in just 0.003 percent of arrests.” To prevent more “destruction and anarchy,” the debate needs to be grounded in “data rather than hyperbole.” While President Trump rails against mail-in voting, many Republican election officials are “expanding it anyway” — as well they should, argues RealClearPolitics’ A.B. Stoddard. For one thing, Trump’s claim that “vote-by-mail is rife with fraud” is false: The conservative Heritage Foundation found “only 204 cases of the fraudulent use of absentee ballots” out of the “250 million ballots cast in the last 20 years.” And mail-in voting can benefit Republicans in places like Florida, whose many senior citizens are “a critical bloc of Trump’s support” and the most susceptible age group to COVID-19. Even though many Republicans back the change, though, “any effort to scale up mail-in voting will be difficult” — especially without pressure from Trump and the Republican National Committee. Reason’s Matt Welch rolls his eyes at the The New York Times, supposedly “the serious journalistic institution in the United States,” which published an article claiming “its own employees were scared” that a Times op-ed by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) would “threaten their very lives.” Such a claim just shows how many in the media “are noisily abandoning liberalism”: Even outlets that “once waved the flag of provocative viewpoint-diversity” have “long since become barely distinguishable enforcers of a joyless orthodoxy.” If an editor dares to commit “the sin of expressing a Wrongthink or publishing a Deplorable,” he or she now has to make a “full public confession or a cowed explanation.” If that “cramped cowardice is the future of journalism,” warns Welch, “journalism has no future.” Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms has been “telling protesters things they don’t want to hear,” applauds National Review’s Jim Geraghty: They’re “risking their lives by gathering in large numbers” during the pandemic, and their “violence and looting” are tainting the “cause they claim to stand for.” Many elected leaders who “keep insisting they stand with the protesters and support them” are “playing along with the fantasy” that the protests are “somehow less dangerous” than other gatherings, even when we have direct evidence to the contrary. Geraghty wonders: Do our leaders really “love” the protesters, as they claim? If you love someone, after all, you do as Bottoms is doing: “Tell him the truth” — especially when “he doesn’t want to hear it.” “Mars is within reach,” cheers Kevin Mooney at the Washington Examiner, and it’s “thanks in no small part to the public-private partnership between NASA and SpaceX.” The successful launch of the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule and docking at the International Space Station mark a “turning point.” As aerospace engineer Robert Zubrin, who founded the Mars Society, explains in his book “The Case for Space,” breakthroughs in rocketry are opening “new avenues for the commercialization of space” and manned missions leading to the colonization of the Red Planet. Zubrin believes “we can establish our first small outpost on Mars within a decade.” That’s “optimistic,” concedes Mooney. But over the past days, the “case for space” has “suddenly become more compelling, exciting and believable” than since the Apollo program — which was “a while ago.” — Compiled by Karl Salzmann & Adam Brodsky

LONDON – The GAVI vaccines alliance said on Thursday it had raised $8.8 billion from international donor governments, companies and philanthropic foundations to fund its immunization programs through to 2025. At a funding summit in London, GAVI said the pledges had exceeded its target of $7.4 billion, and would “help immunize 300 million more children in the world’s poorest countries against diseases like measles, polio and diphtheria”. The vaccines alliance also said it had raised $567 million towards an initial goal of $2 billion from international donors for an Advanced Market Commitment to buy future COVID-19 vaccines for poor countries. The deal would help secure enough COVID-19 vaccine doses – when the shots have been developed – for poor countries to immunise healthcare workers and those at high risk, it said, as well as creating a “buffer of doses” for use when needed. GAVI, the World Health Organization and the United Nations children’s fund UNICEF have warned that 80 million children under the age of one are at risk of disease due to disruptions to vital immunization programs because of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the new coronavirus.  Britain, which hosted the summit, was among the largest donor to GAVI’s core $8.8 billion funding, pledging the equivalent of $416 million per year over the next five years, GAVI said. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said GAVI could count on the UK’s full contribution to help “the triumph of humanity over disease, now and for the generations that follow”. Other top donors included the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which gave $1.6 billion for the period up to 2025, and the governments of Norway, Germany and the United States. “To beat the COVID-19 pandemic, the world needs more than breakthrough science. It needs breakthrough generosity. And that’s what we’re seeing today as leaders across the public and private sectors are stepping up to support GAVI,” Bill Gates, co-chair of the philanthropic Gates Foundation, told the summit. He added that when COVID-19 vaccines are ready, the AMC funding would ensure people all over the world can access them. GAVI said eight of the government donors were countries making their first ever pledge to the vaccines alliance: These were Bhutan, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Finland, Greece, New Zealand, Portugal and Uganda. GAVI is a public-private partnership backed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the WHO, the World Bank, UNICEF and others, which arranges bulk buys to reduce vaccine costs for poor countries.

At the beginning of the pandemic, Mykaela Browne took her last bit of cash and splurged on some roller skates. “I’d go to roller rinks as a kid, but I never had my own pair,” says the 20-year-old Crown Heights resident. “I had $100 in my account, and thought, ‘You know what? Why not?'” The Rite Aid employee was inspired by Ana Coto, a 29-year old actress from Southern California who has gone viral on TikTok for infectiously fun videos of herself skating (often backward) while basking in sunshine. “She just made me want to do it,” says Browne. “Quarantine started, and I was looking for a new hobby, because we can’t go anywhere or do anything.”  What? Like it’s hard?  ♬ nursery – bbno$    Along empty streets, inside vacant parking lots and even through the ghost town that is Times Square, roller skaters rule again. Google search interest for the retro footwear started picking up in March and rocketed to a five-year high in early May — about the time lockdown doldrums also started peaking. A pastime that dates to the Great Depression and was revived again in the disco-loving ’70s, roller-skating means gliding with each foot balanced atop two sets of wheels, like a car. That’s in contrast to inline skates, or blades, whose wheels are set in a straight line. Coto tells The Post that she’s been trying to get friends to take up roller-skating for years. When COVID-19 hit, they finally listened. “Lots of those people are coming out of the woodwork like, ‘OK, you convinced me,’ ” says Coto, a former dancer who now lives in Los Angeles. “You can do it alone and have fun, and it’s exercise.” It’s no coincidence roller-skating, blading and skateboarding — all solo sports that also double as transportation alternatives — have taken off during the coronavirus pandemic. Biking has seen a similar renaissance, with long lines spilling out of shops in New York City. Akin to the run on bikes, snatched up by city dwellers eager to get outside safely, throwback “quad” skates are in high demand. One TikTok video shows a teen taping her sneakers to a skateboard and attempting to groove like Coto, with a caption that laments “roller skates sold out everywhere, so we had to improvise.” Browne originally opted for a pair of $94.95 skates from 2-year-old Australian brand Impala, but recently upgraded to wheels from Moxi, a company Coto and other pros love. Moxi’s site, along with that of other roller-skate retailers Riedell Skates, Planet Roller Skate and Roller Skate Nation, were among the e-commerce websites that experienced the most traffic growth in May. The Big Apple’s veteran hobbyists are happy to share the asphalt with newcomers. Longtime practitioner Lola Starr says lately she’s seen “a big comeback” in the “quad skating” that she’s been doing since she was 11. “The retro quality, and the fashion sense of it, attracts a younger generation discovering skating for the first time,” says Starr, a Ditmas Park resident who runs Dreamland Roller Disco, which hosts themed skating parties at the rink in Prospect Park. “The popularity has increased tremendously. So many people have been asking me where to get skates because they want to skate outside. It’s exercise, but it’s also therapeutic and healing.” A new generation is discovering a lively leisure sport elders have long waxed nostalgic for. “Your grandparents, parents, they all have history with [skating],” Coto tells The Post. “Lots of young people are seeing that it’s a connective thing now . . . Especially in quarantine, everyone’s feeling a little more aware of how important human connection is.” A pro tip from Starr: Invest in the proper wheels. Popular Brooklyn shop Five Stride is reopening Tuesday and taking orders for curbside pickup. “Skates with hard wheels that are marketed for both indoor and outdoor skating will make your ride bumpy,” Starr says. “Soft outdoor wheels will make skating much more fun.” If you can get your hands on a pair of skates, there are plenty of open roads to practice on, even though indoor rinks are off-limits for now. Browne, for instance has kept close to her neighborhood, practicing in her apartment building’s basement garage, her hallway and in a nearby park. “Skating is really calming,” says Browne, adding that the quieter-than-normal streets allow her to take in the cityscape sans pedestrians, traffic and general hubbub. Posting mood-boosting videos of her new tricks — on her new Instagram account, @urskatebae, to chart her progress — help “lift her spirits.” “I’m mainly focusing on jam-skating, which combines skating and dancing,” says Browne. “I like to focus on transition and footwork tricks, and when you add it all together it looks like a dance, and you can add in your own flavor.” Browne adds that she also laced up in the hopes of losing some weight, and says constant rolling “stretches out my limbs.” However, the newbie balks about commuting to work at the Rite Aid by roller skate until she has honed her skills a bit more. Says Browne, “It’s uphill, and I don’t want to hurt myself.”

The NYPD has lost its sixth detective to the coronavirus pandemic, The Post has learned. Christopher McDonnell, a 54-year-old first-grade detective in the Intelligence Division, was confirmed Friday as the 44th member of the department, and the sixth detective, to succumb to COVID-19, according to the president of the Detectives’ Endowment Association. McDonnell left behind a wife and 14-year-old son Trevor — both of whom his friend and former partner said the detective adored. “Not only [was he] one of the finest detectives I’ve ever worked with, but one of the kindest human beings I’ve ever met,” Detective Jeffery Ward told The Post. McDonnell joined the NYPD in 1991 and worked in Staten Island, lower Manhattan and the Narcotic Division, according to the union. Ward, who worked with McDonnell in the late 1990s through the early 2000s, said McDonnell “definitely earned the distinction of a first-grade detective. “We call ourselves the greatest detaches in the world, and Christopher truly exemplified that,” he said. The detective died May 6, but his positive-test result for the virus didn’t come back till  Friday. DEA President Paul DiGiacomo described McDonnell as a “constant professional” and the union will help his family as if he died on the job. “This COVID virus is the invisible bullet, and we will treat [it] no different than if he was shot in the line of duty,” DiGiacomo said. Seven uniformed members of the force, as well as 37 civilian employees of the department, have died from COVID-19, according to the NYPD.

Fans may still get a chance to let the Astros have it this season for the 2017 sign-stealing scandal. They just may have to go to Texas to do it. According to a report in the Dallas Morning News on Thursday, Major League Baseball is “inclined to allow local and municipal governance to take precedence when it comes to allowing fan attendance at games.” Since Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said Wednesday Texas-based teams could permit attendance up to 50 percent of a stadium’s capacity, the two teams in the state — the Rangers and Astros — would be able to play in front of half-filled stands. The Rangers are set to move into their new stadium, Globe Life Field, but the more interesting scene would undoubtedly be Minute Maid Park in Houston, where the Astros have yet to play since MLB’s investigation found the team took part in a sign-stealing scheme on their way to the 2017 World Series title. The investigation led to the firings of Houston manager AJ Hinch and general manager Jeff Luhnow. Alex Cora was also let go from his job as manager of the Red Sox, while Carlos Beltran never even got to step in the dugout as Mets manager after being singled out in MLB’s report. Of course, for either team to play in front of fans at all in 2020, MLB and the players association have to reach an agreement on a shortened season and so far have been unable to do so. In a statement released by the Rangers following the governor’s announcement on Wednesday, the team said is “in the process of operational planning for if and when we have a spring training and regular season games at Globe Life Field. The health and safety of our players, staff, and fans are a top priority and we will await further information and guidance from Major League Baseball and the appropriate health authorities in the coming days and weeks.”

STOCKHOLM – Scientists in Sweden are hoping an alpaca named Tyson can help deliver a knockout blow in the fight to develop a treatment or vaccine against the novel coronavirus that has killed nearly 400,000 people worldwide. After immunizing Tyson, a 12 year-old alpaca in Germany, with virus proteins, the team at the Karolinska Institute have isolated tiny antibodies – known as nanobodies – from his blood that bind to the same part of the virus as human antibodies and could block the infection. They hope this can form the basis of a treatment for COVID 19 or eventually a vaccine against it, though the work is at an early stage. “We know that it is the antibodies that are directed to the same very, very precise part of the virus that are important and that is what we have engineered with this antibody from Tyson,” Gerald McInerney, head of the team at Karolinska said. “In principle, all the evidence would suggest it will work very well in humans, but it is a very complex system.” Llamas and other members of camel family – as well as sharks – are known to produce nanobodies, which are far smaller than the full-size antibodies produced by humans, and therefore potentially easier for scientists to work with. A vaccine may still be some way off. “We will now move forward to going into in-vivo studies, maybe with mice or hamsters or other animals that can be used as a model for COVID 19 disease, but the next step after that we really can’t say,” McInerney said. As for Tyson, he has done his job. “Tyson is 12 years old, I believe, and he may be looking at retirement soon,” McInerney said. “So he’ll live out his life on his farm back in Germany.”

Returning safely back to work after lockdown will be a challenge for Sarah Stephenson-Hunter, who started losing her sight aged seven, and is now completely blind after more than 50 eye operations. The half-marathon runner says friends received verbal abuse for not social distancing, despite their white cane or guide dog. This is her story. I have lived with a visual impairment all of my life and lost all my remaining vision in 2011. Being visually impaired had a major impact on my childhood, including disrupting my education and making it more difficult to do the things after school that my sighted friends would. The pandemic has highlighted to me just how little awareness there is in society of what it is really like to live with a visual impairment and I’m more committed than ever to try to change this. I find the daily task of traveling to and from work stressful and often emotionally exhausting. But over the years I have successfully used public transport to commute between Nottingham and Birmingham, and more recently around Oxford. I can tell you that getting around Oxford as a totally blind person using a white cane is no mean feat. It may well be a beautiful historic city but it is a nightmare to get around with its often-narrow cobbled streets, randomly abandoned bicycles and swarms of tourists. More often than not I would arrive at work feeling emotionally drained, and in need of a lie down. Life under lockdown has been tough for everyone, but I think the specific needs of blind and partially-sighted people have been ignored. Working from home for the past few months has most certainly had its upside, and I’m in no hurry to return to the old “normal.” The switch to permanent working from home was therefore quite an easy one. I have a laptop fitted with a screen reader, which lets me access all of the things I need to do, and aside from having had my ergonomic chair and keyboard at home, I have not really needed any other specific equipment or adaptations. The switch to video meetings has also proved relatively straightforward. Platforms such as Microsoft Teams and Zoom have good levels of accessibility, so I’ve been able to use these in much the same way as my sighted colleagues. Although I do have to check on occasions that I’m looking into the camera and not facing the opposite wall! I have very mixed feelings about returning to the workplace. I have been shielding since the start of the outbreak, with other health conditions, so I have missed face-to-face contact altogether. But as much as I miss impromptu chats with colleagues in the kitchen, the thought of using public transport to return to the office doesn’t fill me with desire to change my current work situation anytime soon. I have already heard from many of my visually impaired friends that they have found getting out and about during the lockdown incredibly difficult. It is great that some of the restrictions are being lifted but I still have serious concerns around how I’ll be able to get out and about. It has been particularly hard knowing that others have been able to go out and exercise when I’ve not been able to, especially as I’m a keen runner and can’t see myself running outdoors with a guide for a long time yet. Even with some vision, sticking to social-distancing rules is incredibly difficult. As many of the tools used to keep us apart are visual cues such as markings on the floor, many colleagues don’t go out at all or find themselves incredibly stressed, and are sometimes humiliated on a simple trip out for daily fresh air. Where members of the public were once so happy to help and take you by the arm and guide you, they are understandably much less willing to do so in the current context. Some friends have even reported getting verbal abuse from people for not keeping their distance, even when they have a white cane or guide dog. If I do manage to make it safely to work, the thought of trying to adhere to possible one-way systems on staircases, not coming too close to other people, waiting to use the shared kitchen, and so on, all seems like a layer of stress and anxiety that I don’t want to have to deal with anytime soon. So, it is with a great deal of relief and acknowledgment of my privileged position that the signal I’m getting from my employer is that there is absolutely no sense that I will be forced to return to the office anytime soon. When the time does come, I will only return when I feel it is safe and realistically doable, given my specific situation. This pandemic has shown the benefits of working from home, and I will be interested to see the long-term impact on employers’ attitudes to working from home as a reasonable adjustment for people with disabilities. It may not be right for everyone, but I could certainly see myself adopting working from home as a more regular practice going forward. I hope that, going forward, people are more willing to try to put themselves in the shoes of others and not take for granted the freedoms and opportunities they have even in a lockdown.

The outbreak of the coronavirus has dealt a shock to the global economy with unprecedented speed. Following are developments Friday related to the national and global response, the workplace and the spread of the virus.
  JOB CONCERNS: Bombardier said most of the cuts will impact its manufacturing operations in Canada and will occur throughout the year. It has almost 60,000 total employees. The company anticipates an approximately $40 million charge related to the job cuts. The company, which is part of Germany’s Volkswagen Group, said it is looking to make the initial job cuts under a voluntary scheme but that future job cuts may be on a compulsory basis. Bentley said it has informed its 4,200 workers of a program to significantly reduce the size of the business. TRAVEL: Willie Walsh, the chief executive of International Airlines Group, which runs the British flag carrier, told Sky News he is reviewing the situation with lawyers. He said the “irrational” quarantine rules would “torpedo” the airline’s chances of flying in July. Slovak Prime Minister Igor Matovic says the move becomes effective on Friday. It also enables citizens of Austria and Hungary to travel to Slovakia without any restrictions. On Thursday, Slovakia reopened for travelers its common border with another neighbor, the Czech Republic. CENTRAL GOVERNMENTS & BANKS: The state continued to loosen its virus-related restrictions Friday. The changes allow retailers, restaurants, salons and churches to serve more customers at a time and let other shuttered businesses reopen with limitations. The easing of restrictions won’t take effect in New Orleans. Officials in the state’s original virus hot spot want more time to determine when they’ll allow a wider reopening of businesses. Labor Minister Jana Malacova says unemployment reached 3.6% in May, 0.2% more than the previous month. A total of 266,144 Czechs were unemployed in May, 12,104 more than in April. Analysts have predicted that the unemployment level might reach up to 10% later in the year. MARKETS: Stocks are rushing higher Friday after a much better-than-expected report on the US job market gave Wall Street’s recent rally another shot of adrenaline.

President Trump is expected to sign an executive order that will bypass environmental reviews to spur economic growth after the coronavirus pandemic through infrastructure projects. By declaring an economic emergency, the president will issue the order to expedite construction project permits of highways, mines, pipelines and other projects, The Associated Press reported. The order would direct federal agencies to seek workarounds from environmental laws, such as the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act, the report said. It would also expedite civil works projects run by the Army Corps of Engineers and instruct the departments of Interior, Agriculture and Defense to use emergency and other authorities to accelerate projects on federal lands. “Unnecessary delays in timely agency actions will deny our citizens opportunities for jobs and economic security and will hinder our economic recovery from the national emergency, keeping millions of Americans out of work,” the order states, according to a draft obtained by The Associated Press. Democrats denounced the order before it was even signed. “The President’s Executive Order waiving critical environmental protections is a direct threat to the environment and to countless vulnerable communities who are disproportionately impacted by the climate crisis,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. “Without these important safeguards, American taxpayers could spend billions of dollars on projects that destroy endangered ecosystems, are unable to withstand the effects of climate change and threaten the safety of American families.” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump’s order made clear his “total disregard for those speaking out and fighting for racial justice and a sustainable environment.” “Environmental reviews are critical to the protection of public health and one of the last lines of defense to give communities of color, indigenous people and the poor a voice in major infrastructure projects that happen in their backyards,” Schumer said. In May the president signed an executive order aimed at making hundreds of deregulations in the age of coronavirus permanent. Fox News was told the executive order tells regulatory agencies to look at more than 600 regulatory actions — mostly deregulations, but also regulations and guidance — taken during the coronavirus pandemic and tell the White House which ones should be made permanent. “We had cases where it would take 20 years to build a highway, you had to go through various agencies to get the same permit,” the president said while signing.

“Jeopardy!” will soon be in all-encore mode. TVLine has learned that the iconic Alex Trebek-hosted game show — which halted production roughly three months ago due to the coronavirus pandemic — will air its last original episode on Friday, June 12. Reruns begin airing on Monday, June 15, and will continue until the show deems it safe to resume production. The syndicated phenom was able to delay running out of new episodes by rebroadcasting the primetime “Greatest of All Time” tournament during the first two weeks of May (bookended by reruns of champ Ken Jennings’ first and last episodes from his legendary 74-game winning streak). “Jeopardy!”‘s two-week “Teachers Tournament,” production of which was completed just prior to the shutdown, concludes tonight. A decision on when to restart production on “Jeopardy!” is further complicated by Trebek’s immunocompromised condition; the multi-Emmy winner is battling Stage 4 pancreatic cancer. In January, Trebek told reporters at the Television Critics Association winter press tour that he has no plans to sign off the long-running quiz show “in the near future.” Two months later, he announced that he had beaten the one-year survival rate for the disease. “The one-year survival rate for Stage 4 pancreatic cancer patients is 18 percent,” he said. “I’m very happy to report that I have just reached that marker.” Meanwhile, fellow Sony-produced game show “Wheel of Fortune” — which airs immediately following “Jeopardy!” in many US markets — will continue to mix new episodes with reruns throughout the summer, according to a studio insider.

BOGOTA, Colombia — Television. Sewing machine. Motorcycle. These are the things Edda Marchan’s children sold to keep their mother breathing. In the far stretch of northern Peru where the family lives, medicinal oxygen to treat the coronavirus has become a scarce commodity. Eventually, they could not find any. “It’s the greatest desperation in the world,” said her daughter, 39-year-old Fiorella Sorroza. “We are praying to God not to abandon us.” In the South American nation wracked by COVID-19, one of the world’s most abundant elements is now in short supply. Exasperated relatives are racing to fill overpriced tanks. Long neglected hospitals are running empty. And President Martín Vizcarra has issued an emergency decree ordering industrial plants to ramp up production or purchase oxygen from other countries. “Peru, with the Amazon, has the lungs of the planet,” said Iván Hidalgo, academic director of the Institute of Government and Public Management in Peru’s capital of Lima. “And we’re dying because of lack of oxygen.” Regional health directors say the shortage has already cost lives and is so severe that even by turning industrial plants that typically produce oxygen for mining into medicinal production, Peru will fall short of what it needs. Defense Minister Walter Martos said Thursday the country needs 173 tons of oxygen per day. The dean of the Medical College of Peru estimates the nation is producing about 20% of that. The problem is a consequence of decades of underinvestment in hospitals, corruption and poor management, several medical leaders said. The hospital in Tumbes, near the border with Ecuador, where Marchan’s family resides, has a plant that has been inoperative for years because someone stole an electronic card needed to operate it. Officials are hoping to get it back up Saturday. In the meantime, Tumbes health workers have imported oxygen from Ecuador and trucked in tanks from the nearest Peruvian plant, five hours away. The biggest public hospital usually utilizes 30 tanks a week but now needs about 200. Many also blame Peru’s governments for failing to prepare earlier. “This exposes failings throughout the country,” said Dr. Harold Burgos, regional health director for Tumbes. “It was coming and no one took it seriously.” Other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean are facing – or soon likely to encounter – oxygen shortages. In Colombia’s Amazon, doctors have had to airlift patients to Bogota because the only oxygen plant in the region is barely functioning. Haiti is heavily reliant on one oxygen plant for a population of over 11 million. About 15% of all COVID-19 patients experience severe illness that requires oxygen therapy, while another 5% need ventilation, according to the World Health Organization. By the time many patients are critical enough to seek hospital attention, they often have low blood oxygen levels that require immediate attention. That was the case for Armando Ancajima’s uncle, who was taken Sunday to a hospital in Talara, an oil producing city near Peru’s northern coast. Struggling to breathe, his nails purple, he had just 35% oxygen saturation on arrival. The family was told the hospital had no oxygen, suggesting that they rapidly find a way to buy it themselves. Ancajima said he saw 10 people die during the night he spent with his uncle. “This is the inheritance of 30 years of inattention,” he said. Peru was one of the earliest nations in Latin America to institute a strict lockdown, but that failed to stop infections from skyrocketing. With nearly 185,000 cases, the country has the second-highest number in the region. Peru’s large informal sector — about 70% of the economy — means many have to break quarantines to earn money and buy food. But the oxygen shortages are also symptomatic of the overall difficulties Latin America encountered in ramping up medical supplies during the pandemic. By the time the first cases were diagnosed in late February and early March, global supplies were drying up. Unable to buy from the U.S. or Europe, many turned to China for ventilators, which have been slow to arrive. “The opportunity to buy goods had already passed when the first cases were diagnosed,” said Dr. Ciro Ugarte, director of the Pan American Health Organization’s health emergencies department. Aid groups have tried to fill some of the gaps. The U.K.-based Hope Health Action will soon opena COVID-19 ward with 10 oxygen concentrators in the port city of Cap-Haitien in Haiti. The concentrators produce medicinal oxygen using electricity and ambient air. Nonetheless, they have limitations. The machines typically supply up to 10 liters per minute and severe COVID-19 cases can require more, said Rob Dalton, an emergency nurse with the organization. Each concentrator can serve just one patient. “We need even more,” Dalton said. “We need as many as we can get.” In Peru, Vizcarra on Thursday announced nearly $25 million to purchase oxygen and $3.2 million to develop plants and generators. “If we can meet the demand nationally, we will,” he said. “If plants and generators cannot be secured that way, we’ll go wherever necessary.” Perhaps the most severe shortages have been in Peru’s Amazon, where doctors in Iquitos were tending to 500 patients in a hospital meant for 225. With no oxygen plant, health workers were depending on outside shipments until recently. The government promised 60 tanks a day by air, though only 24 were arriving. With the help of the church and local communities, two plants have since been purchased and overall need and shortages have gone down. But the oxygen scarcity is increasingly being felt outside the Amazon as well. In recent days, lines of people waiting to fill oxygen tanks for loved ones with COVID-19 have been seen even in better-equipped Lima. And in northern Peru, where Marchan’s family lives, many say price gougers are taking advantage. The family was spending about $150 a day on oxygen until recently, hoping to avoid taking her to the hospital, which doctors warned was on the verge of collapse. But as she grew worse and no oxygen could be found, they decided to seek help. A day after admitting her to the hospital, Sorroza said a doctor called, saying they didn’t have oxygen and asking the family to bring some. Later that night, she said, one doctor called a cousin offering to sell them a tank for around $120. Three days later, she was dead. The family was alerted at 6 a.m. on a Saturday that she’d passed and was told she’d be buried four hours later at a newly created cemetery. They rushed to say a hasty goodbye, enlisting a carpenter cousin to construct a simple white cross out of wood. “I didn’t get to see her,” Sorroza said. “Nothing.”

A Florida man is accused of pointing a gun at a nurse and security guard last Friday after he was denied entry into a hospital to see his wife due to COVID-19 visitor restrictions, according to a report. Eric Reitz, 57, was arrested that afternoon and remains in custody. He originally got in an altercation with the guard due to the visitation policy at Santa Rosa Medical Center in Milton — where his spouse was a patient, according to the Pensacola News Journal. When asked to leave twice by the guard, Reitz repeated “you will see,” before he returned from his vehicle with a shotgun, the arrest report stated. A nurse, who was standing next to the guard, told police he “racked” the weapon as if he was loading it and pointed it at them, the paper reported. Around that time, a security guard told a nearby patient to get behind cover. After hearing police sirens in the distance, Reitz allegedly put the firearm back in his truck. Police said they found a 12-gauge shotgun and a .22 caliber rifle in Reitz’s vehicle, according to the Pensacola News Journal. The arrest report said a bullet was in the chamber of the rifle, but the shotgun wasn’t loaded. Reitz was charged with aggravated assault and booked into the Santa Rosa County Jail at 3:27 pm, according to jail records. His bond was set at $20,000. It’s unclear if he has an attorney.

BANGKOK/DHAKA – Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh with symptoms of the novel coronavirus are not coming forward to get tested because they fear being separated from their families and held in isolation, community leaders and aid workers say. Only one death from the coronavirus has been recorded in the crowded camps in southeast Bangladesh, where some 730,000 Muslim Rohingya fled in 2017 to escape a military crackdown in Buddhist-majority Myanmar. But aid workers fear the coronavirus may be spreading faster through the world’s largest refugee settlement than the 29 cases confirmed since mid-May would indicate. Only 339 tests have been carried out in the camps, officials said, partly because people were simply not going to health facilities to get checked. “Camp hospitals are empty and illegal doctors’ shops are full,” said 23-year-old refugee Mujef Khan, a community organizer, referring to pharmacies in the camps run by refugees where people buy pills to treat themselves. “Many people are getting sick day by day – in every shelter,” he said. Three Rohingya leaders interviewed by Reuters said coronavirus symptoms were prevalent in the camps that sprawl out over hills near the border with Myanmar. The camps are more densely populated than the most crowded cities and sanitation is poor and social distancing impossible. While new testing facilities and treatment centers are being built, a surge in cases could overwhelm the camps, aid workers said. “How long?” Like the majority of refugees, Khan fled from Myanmar in 2017 after his home in Rakhine State was burned to the ground during a military crackdown that the United Nations has said was executed with genocidal intent. Myanmar denies genocide, saying its forces were responding to a legitimate security threat from Rohingya militants who attacked security posts. While some refugees put the increase in illness in the camps – fever, dry cough, colds – down to the onset of the rainy season, many suspect it is the coronavirus. “They don’t want to get tested,” said refugee Nurul Amin. “We’re very scared. By the grace of Allah, we’re fine so far but how long can we hold out?” Two research teams said they had found evidence to show refugees with coronavirus symptoms were reluctant to go to doctors. Yale University researchers spoke to hundreds of refugees in April and found about a quarter reported at least one symptom of the coronavirus, while symptoms were twice as common in the camps compared with the surrounding Bangladeshi community. Because testing is so limited and refugees fear going to the doctor, it was difficult to know the true spread of the disease, report author Ahmed Mushfiq Mobarak, professor of Economics at Yale, told Reuters. “All the other complementary indications in our data is that disease prevalence is likely much higher,” he said in an email. Rumors
Researchers from the International Organization for Migration found that visits to clinics dropped by 50 percent in March, while some coronavirus patients tried to hide from health workers. “People don’t bother to get tested for the coronavirus. They are afraid of being isolated and quarantined,” said a Bangladesh government official who declined to be identified. Mahbub Alam Talukder, Bangladesh’s refugee relief and repatriation commissioner, said authorities were working around the clock to expand testing, isolation and treatment facilities and improve communication with the community. A lab handling 200 tests a day should soon be able to process 500 a day, said Louise Donovan, a spokeswoman with the UN refugee agency, while 12 treatment centers with 1,900 beds are planned. Two have been built. But in the event of a major outbreak, patients may have to be treated in their homes or other places in the community rather than at medical facilities, said Muriel Boursier, head of mission for the Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) aid agency in Bangladesh. “The health capacity might be challenged and there might be a need for a community-based type of approach.” Another problem was that Bangladeshi restrictions on internet and mobile phone access in the camps has contributed to a climate of fear, refugees said. Some people even believed rumors that coronavirus patients were being killed to stop the epidemic. Furquan Mirza, a refugee helping to show a video door-to-door to educate people about the coronavirus, said it was as if people in the camps were blind and deaf. “They can’t see what’s happening around the world,” Mirza said, as he prepared for another day showing the film titled “A Scared Community.”

SINGAPORE – Singapore plans to give a wearable device that will identify people who had interacted with carriers of coronavirus to each of its 5.7 million residents, in what could become one of the most comprehensive contact-tracing efforts globally. Testing of the small devices, which can be worn on the end of a lanyard or carried in a handbag, follows limited take-up of an earlier smartphone-based system and has further fuelled privacy concerns about contact tracing technology. The tiny city-state, with one of the highest COVID-19 caseloads in Asia, is one of many countries trying to use technology to allow them to safely reopen their economies. Singapore will soon roll out the device, which does not depend on a smartphone and “may then distribute it to everyone in Singapore,” Vivian Balakrishnan, the minister in charge of the city-state’s smart nation initiative, said on Friday. The government did not specify whether carrying the device would be mandatory. The government’s earlier TraceTogether app encountered problems, especially on Apple devices where its operating system suspends Bluetooth scanning when the app runs in the background. Balakrishnan said repeated discussions with Apple failed to resolve the problem. The pivot to wearables is a signal that Singapore has no immediate plans to adopt contact-tracing technology from Apple and Google rolled out last month, which has several restrictions designed to protect users’ privacy. Michael Veale, a lecturer in the law on digital rights and regulation at University College London who has been involved in developing contact-tracing apps, said Singapore’s move into wearables presented “accountability and privacy concerns.” “Users will likely find it hard to scrutinize what the device is actually doing, or what information the back-end server uses or links,” Veale said. Singapore has said data collected through its earlier app is encrypted and stored locally in the user’s phone and will only be transferred to authorities if the individual is confirmed to be infected with COVID-19. Some businesses have already adopted wearables for contact tracing in locations where smartphone usage is restricted, while governments like Bahrain and Hong Kong have used them for monitoring people under quarantine. Vendors pitching wearables include Accent Advanced Systems, Kerlink, Microshare Inc and TRACEsafe Technologies Inc, though the companies have declined to comment on potential customers. David Su, CEO of wireless chips firm Atmosic, said he expected “multiple governments, if not all governments in Asia” to adopt wearables because they are an affordable and reliable way to ensure widespread automated contact tracing. A simple wristband with a Bluetooth chip, battery and some memory could cost about $10, or possibly less, according to vendors.

Apple is reportedly offering coronavirus tests to employees at its Bay Area campus as they begin to return to the office after months of working from home. In addition to having their temperature taken and being required to wear a mask at One Infinite Loop, Apple workers will have the option to get a nasal swab test as well, according to Bloomberg. Apple was one of the earliest companies to send its employees home, doing so on March 8. But unlike other Silicon Valley giants like Facebook and Twitter — which have publicly spoken about allowing employees to work remotely permanently — Apple needs people in the office to work on its hardware products. In March it was reported that the launch of the next iPhones may be delayed by “practical hurdles” caused by the coronavirus. Apple traditionally needs to send engineers back and forth from its offices to its factories in China to finalize designs in the lead-up to the product’s release. But the coronavirus has led Apple to restrict employee travel to hotbeds of the disease, including China. The Cupertino, Calif., company recently announced that it would be reopening more than 100 of its US retail locations after a months-long closure due to the pandemic. Shares of Apple closed up 2.9 percent Friday morning, trading at $331.50.

At the height of the coronavirus pandemic in mid-April, used-car dealer Alex Tovstanovsky had vehicles jammed six rows deep on his lot in the western Chicago suburb of Naperville. But the seeming oversupply was not a mistake. Despite plummeting sales at his store, Prestige Motor Works, Tovstanovsky was betting on a recovery, buying dozens of cars in early April as auction prices for used vehicles dropped. That bet is now paying off. Tovstanovsky can offer cars cheaper than local competitors and his sales jumped 38 percent in May from the year-ago period. “This is an election year and I felt the Trump administration and the Republicans in Congress would do whatever it took to keep the economy strong,” Tovstanovsky said. Rising demand has now pushed used-vehicle prices about 20 percent higher than when Tovstanovsky made his bet. “I just wish I’d bought more cars when prices were low,” Tovstanovsky said. As America shut down in March to combat the spread of COVID-19 and its economy tanked, US new-vehicle sales plummeted. Sales were down around 30 percent in May, an improvement from a 47 percent drop in April. But used-vehicle sales have rebounded faster. Dealers are now competing to buy vehicles, even as the US economic outlook remains uncertain. “We actually have an issue now, which is that we don’t have enough inventory,” said George Arison, co-CEO of online used-car seller Shift. Shift’s sales rebounded to pre-COVID-19 levels by late April. Americans typically become more frugal and favor used cars in uncertain times. Cars remain a vital commodity in a country where getting to work without a vehicle is impossible in all but a few large cities Rising used-car sales increase competition for automakers who must sell new cars to offset cash burned during a two-month shutdown for the North American auto industry. According to Cox Automotive, new-vehicle sales for the week ending May 28 were down 28 percent, but sales of used vehicles were up 6 percent. According to Cox unit Manheim, wholesale used-vehicle prices rose 5.74 percent in the first half of May from the previous month. Carmax, the No. 1 used-car dealer, has already called back about two-thirds of the 15,500 employees it furloughed in April. “We expect to come out of this in a position to take advantage of the resiliency of the used-car industry,” said chief marketing officer Jim Lyski. While dealers say access to financing is plentiful, Wells Fargo said this week it will stop offering loans to most independent dealers due to economic uncertainty. Used-car dealers say recent customers have ranged from deep subprime borrowers using their $1,200 federal pandemic relief checks for a down payment, to prime borrowers with pristine credit who saved money working from home since March. “I’ve seen a lot of down payments this month of exactly $1,200,” said Scott Allen, owner of Auto Land in Fort Worth, Texas, which sells older used vehicles. After being closed for nearly a month from March 23, Allen’s sales in May were up 55 percent over his average for that month. The US used-vehicle market has distinct layers. At the top, in terms of price, are vehicles returned after short-term leases that look nearly new. Those are a concern for the industry. More than 4 million off-lease vehicles are due to return to the market this year, at a rate of around 340,000 per month. Automakers and their finance arms are trying to slow the pace at which those vehicles hit auctions to avoid flooding the market. KAR Auction Services has bought 200 acres of land and is seeking another 100 acres to store cars for major customers. Tom Kontos, chief economist at KAR, which alongside Manheim dominates the US used-car auction market, calls these vehicles “melting ice cubes.” They lose value every day, and cannot be held back for long. Franchise new-car dealers are driving demand for used cars to fill lots short of inventory because the coronavirus shut down assembly plants. Ten of the top 15 models sold at US franchise dealers were used rather than new from May 22 to May 28, according to automotive marketing platform PureCars.

As casinos in Las Vegas reopened Thursday for the first time since March amid the coronavirus pandemic, many customers gambled with their health — rolling the dice by not wearing masks or maintaining social distancing, according to reports. “Wash your hands while saying, ‘Vegas Baby!’ 20 times,” a video marquee displayed along the famed Las Vegas Strip as hotel-casinos opened right after midnight Thursday. Dozens of people eager to let the chips fall where they may waited impatiently at The D Casino and Hotel on Fremont Street to have their temperatures checked at the door. The casino quickly filled with happy high rollers while a bartender danced, wearing lingerie and a surgical mask as Nevada continued its second stage of reopening. To reopen, casinos must submit a plan to the Nevada Gaming Control Board explaining how they plan on keeping proper hygiene and social distancing, according to Business Insider. MGM Resorts-owned Bellagio, New York-New York and other casinos planned to increase cleaning and require social distancing — but when the doors were flung open, some proved better than others at enforcing safety protocols. A swarm of customers rushed onto the gaming floor of The D, where a video posted by Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter Mick Akers shows packed crowds, though dealers and dancers are wearing masks, Business Insider reported. REUTERS/Steve Marcus RONDA CHURCHILL/AFP via Getty Images Ethan Miller/Getty Images Ethan Miller/Getty Images View Slideshow Many customers also ignored spacing at slot machines, but surfaces appeared to be cleaned regularly. Hotel guests at The D — whose owner, Derek Stevens, offered free one-way flights to jump-start the tourism recovery — were treated to free champagne at check-in and a ribbon-cutting on the casino floor, USA Today reported. Bobbi Carlisle, a truck driver from Phoenix who hoped to snag a souvenir piece, was recognized by an employee as the first guest to check in that morning. The staffer pulled a memento out of his suit jacket pocket and presented it to her as a belated 60th birthday present. “It’s just been months of us trying to get here,” Carlisle told the news outlet. “Now we’re here, and we’re so excited. We’re hoping to get a keno machine, and we’ll play there for days.” Stevens said the visitors arriving this week tend to be younger Vegas fans who may be more comfortable traveling, since older people are in a group at higher risk for severe illness related to the deadly bug. “This will be a very fun, gregarious group,” Stevens told USA Today. “These are people that want to get out of their hometown and come visit Vegas.” Jeff Hwang, a gambling enthusiast and blogger, planned to visit every casino in town that was scheduled to reopen. He said he was given face masks, including one with a Golden Gate logo at the city’s oldest existing downtown casino. “Walking around, not many people were using them,” he noted. “Just employees.” Ethan Miller/Getty Images David Becker/Getty Images RONDA CHURCHILL/AFP via Getty Images Ethan Miller/Getty Images Ethan Miller/Getty Images View Slideshow Johnny Lujan, 29, flew in from Los Angeles on Wednesday so he could gamble on the first night casinos reopened. “I love gambling,” he said before rushing, without a mask, to a $15 roulette table the second The D Casino reopened.

New York City’s first step to reopening its economy after the coronavirus pandemic will allow 32,000 city construction sites to reopen and put hardhats back on the job, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Friday. “That means a lot of New Yorkers will come back to work but it has to be safe, it has to be healthy,” Hizzoner told reporters during his Friday press briefing. The reopened construction sites will be required to shake up their worksites to better protect employees from potential exposure to COVID-19, including making hand sanitizer available and requiring workers to wear face coverings. However, de Blasio added that the Buildings Department would hold off on issuing fines for noncompliance for a month to allow the worksites to voluntarily come into compliance. “I don’t want to give a single fine,” he said. “I don’t want to take money from anyone.” Gov. Andrew Cuomo shut down construction sites for projects that were deemed non-essential in March as officials struggled to slow the spread of the coronavirus across the state. His decision came after The Post revealed that construction workers were still showing up to work sick, even as the pandemic grew worse.

COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — The tourists came to see the magical waterfalls and mountain views of the lowland jungle and rainforest. But then the pandemic hit, and they were stranded in Sri Lanka. When flights were canceled and the airports shut down, Darshana Ratnayake came to the rescue. Ratnayake, a cafe owner in Ella, a former colonial hill station in Sri Lankan tea country, organized free food and shelter for dozens of stranded tourists. “We were totally blown away,” said Alex Degmetich, a 31-year-old American cruise line entertainment director. “It’s pretty remarkable,” he said. “Coming from Western society, where nothing is really given to us and we have to pay for everything which is fine. But here, locals providing us — tourists — free food and accommodation, is really humbling.” The Sri Lankan government imposed a nationwide curfew on March 20 to curb the spread of the virus, sealing off entire regions of the Indian Ocean island nation. Degmetich was among 40 tourists from 11 countries stranded in Ella, 200 kilometers (120 miles) east of the capital, Colombo. Ella’s famous treks tend to draw a young backpacker crowd and Darshana knew they’d soon be out of money and the small bed-and-breakfast lodges out of food. He was right: Many of the tourists had just enough money to pay for the trip and broken supply chains meant the lodges were running low on provisions. Darshana established his Chill Cafe as a juice bar with two tables 13 years ago. The business has grown to a full restaurant and boutique hotel with 72 employees. Just after the curfew was imposed, Darshana prepared a list of those staying in lodges and began boxed dinner deliveries. And he convinced lodge owners to let their guests stay on for free. “Our livelihood depends on tourism. We must help tourists when they are in trouble. Money isn’t everything. We must help and share at difficult times like this,” he said. He said he also donated $27,000 to tour guides who lost their income when tourism came to a standstill. Darshana said Sri Lanka’s bloody, decades-long civil war had a huge impact on tourism in Ella. Any time a bomb went off in the country, he said, tourist arrivals fell sharply. For 25 years, separatists from the minority Tamil community fought for a separate state. By the time government forces crushed the rebellion in 2009, UN estimates say some 100,000 people had been killed. With the war’s end, Ella’s visitor numbers rose sharply, averaging a thousand people a day, he said. Darshana has expanded his support to both lunch and dinner each day — without, he insists, sacrificing on quality or customer service. Rebecca Curwood-Moss, a tourist from England, felt hopeless when Sri Lanka’s curfew was imposed. She said Darshana’s meals have done more than fill empty stomachs. “In the box, we didn’t just find the delicious homemade rice and curry, but we found hope,” she said.

The coronavirus pandemic in the US has had the inadvertent effect of shining a light on something that’s fascinated me for some time now. It’s the second act of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, who at 64-years-old has transformed himself from the wonky, acerbic, PC-loving foil to Apple’s Steve Jobs and into one of the leading philanthropists in the world. That’s included committing billions of dollars from his personal fortune, through his family foundation, to advocating for specific issues like enhancing health care around the world. As part of that work, he’s also been a vocal advocate for the last several years about countries needing to take more steps to prepare themselves to fight coming pandemics — and, now that the deadly COVID-19 pandemic is upon us, he’s pumping tens of millions of dollars into the race to find a successful vaccine for the virus. In addition to doing what he can to augment the government’s fight against COVID-19. Which is why Gates says he kind of can’t understand how he’s become the target of outlandish and moronic conspiracy theories, telling reporters on Thursday that the misinformation that’s out there about him is “so stupid” that it’s hard to know how to address it. Gates was on a call with reporters ahead of an announcement by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation that it’s pledging another $1.6 billion to the Gavi vaccine alliance — “to deliver lifesaving vaccines to the world’s poorest countries,” according to the foundation. That’s in addition to $100 million set aside specifically for COVID-19 vaccines. “If the current pandemic has reminded us of anything,” Gates’ wife Melinda said, “it’s the importance of vaccinating against deadly diseases. The pledges that leaders are making today will help Gavi save even more lives.” Meantime, Gates did take a moment Thursday to address some of the bizarre myths about him that have been circulating and finding new audiences since the outbreak of the coronavirus: A must see 4 part documentary about Bill Gates globalist agenda. Extremely well researched and sourced. Anyone writing this off as a "conspiracy theory" after watching it is in serious denial #EXPOSEBILLGATES https://t.co/Lq905uvPGF — Christopher M (@Christo39321718) June 4, 2020  I have a very good friend who told me she thinks Biden is senile and will not vote for him. She said she will write some name in. She also said Bill Gates is working with big pharma and vaccines are going to be mandatory. How do I get through to her? 😳I am so sad……. — SandeeDee (@Dharma53) June 4, 2020  Q is promoting a conspiracy that Bill Gates, working with the new world order and Illuminati, will implant chips in COVID vaccines.  These chips will have the ability to track thoughts and control people. Look it up. It's quite insane #ID2020 😂😂😂 — 🦇 The Batman 🦇 (@thebatman_2020) June 4, 2020  The same kind of thing also circulates on Facebook, especially with Facebook groups like this one. During the call with reporters, Gates was asked about a recent Yahoo News/YouGov poll that purported to find 44 percent of Republicans polled saying they believed the Microsoft co-founder is, according to Yahoo News, “plotting to use a mass COVID-19 vaccination campaign as a pretext to implant microchips in billions of people and monitor their movements.” Responded Gates on Thursday: “In a way, it’s so bizarre, you almost want to view it as something humorous, but I guess it’s really not a humorous thing. I’ve never been involved in any sort of microchip-type thing. “It’s almost hard to deny this stuff because it’s so stupid or strange that to even repeat it almost seems to give it credibility.” Related to this, Gates did allow that while he thought that kind of thing is mostly silly and absurd, he thinks there could be a small chance it actively harms efforts to get a coronavirus ultimately out to everyone who needs it. “If you don’t get a broad uptake, then you wouldn’t have the dramatic effect you want to have, meaning that the risk of reintroduction is so low that you can go back to having things like big sports events,” Gates said. “The misinformation could hold us back at some point, but I wouldn’t say that that’s hurting us at this stage.”

Chinese smartphone giant Huawei this week announced a new phone with built-in sensors that can take a person’s temperature. The Honor Play 4 Pro has a sensor built into the phone’s rear camera array, and can take the temperature of humans and objects alike. The infrared tech can measure temperatures ranging up to 212 degrees Fahrenheit all the way down to -4 degrees. In a video posted to its Weibo social media page, Huawei demonstrated how the phone works on a person, pointing the sensor at their forehead for several seconds until it delivered a reading. The heat-seeking phone will only be available in China, and will retail for $420.

President Trump said Friday that “we’re opening with a bang” after surprising economic news that the US added 2.5 million jobs in May as states reopened from coronavirus lockdowns. “It’s an affirmation of all the work we’ve been doing really for three and a half years, this isn’t just over the last few months,” Trump said in the White House Rose Garden, later adding: “Our body was so powerful that we could actually close our country, save millions of lives.” The rebound reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the unemployment rate fell from 14.7 percent in April to 13.3 percent in May. Experts had expected the jobless rate to be near Great Depression levels around 20 percent as new unemployment insurance claims grew due to widespread government-ordered business closures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The Labor Department admitted Friday that it counted 4.9 million furloughed workers as employed, meaning the real unemployment rate would have been 16.1 percent in May. The department, however, used the same counting practice in April, and the rate then would have been more than 19 percent, indicating many people are indeed returning to work. Some states began allowing a phased return to normal in late April, but companies that furloughed or laid off workers in most places still face strict limitations. The rebound follows an aggressive federal effort to keep businesses afloat. In two tranches, Congress authorized $670 billion in forgivable small business loans that can cover labor and overhead. A separate $500 billion fund managed by the Treasury Department was used for larger businesses, including airlines. Since March, 42.6 million people — or a quarter of the workforce — filed new unemployment insurance claims, including another 1.87 million people last week. COVID-19 has sickened nearly 2 million Americans and killed almost 110,000. Those left jobless have benefited from a $600-per-week federal boost in unemployment pay, intended to keep stable the income of most people impacted by the pandemic. Trump spoke after a bleak week with the White House besieged by anti-police brutality demonstrators protesting the killing of George Floyd by Minnesota officers. On Saturday and Sunday, protests gave way to arson and citywide looting. Trump said the economic rebound “is a tremendous tribute to equality” and said the pre-pandemic economy had the lowest rates of unemployment for many groups, including African Americans. “Hopefully George is looking down right now and saying this a great thing that’s happening for our country. There’s a great day for him. It’s a great day for everybody. It is a great, great day, in terms of equality,” Trump said. White House spokesman Ben Williamson said Friday afternoon that Trump was “talking about the fight for equal justice and equal treatment under the law” and not about the economy when he mentioned Floyd’s possible thoughts in heaven.

Canadian plane and train maker Bombardier Inc said on Friday it would cut 2,500 jobs, or about 11 percent of the workforce at its aviation unit, as the coronavirus pandemic’s crushing impact on the air industry adds to its long list of problems. The aviation industry has been among the worst hit by the pandemic, which has dented travel demand and forced several aircraft manufacturers, including planemakers Boeing Co and Airbus SE, to cut production as customers defer deliveries. “We are now faced with the difficult decision to adjust the size of our business, considering both disruptions in our supply chain as well as industry-wide forecasts calling for approximately 30 percent year-over-year drops in unit deliveries due to the pandemic,” David Coleal, president of Bombardier Aviation, said in a memo to workers about the layoffs which was seen by Reuters. Bombardier Aviation spokesman Mark Masluch said the company is starting to scale back production, but he would not give specifics. Bombardier, which has nearly 60,000 employees at its aviation and rail units, said it would book a $40 million charge related to the job cuts. The company, which recently exited the commercial aircraft business, is in the process of selling its rail business to French train maker Alstom for up to 6.2 billion euros ($7.02 billion). The sale would leave Bombardier as a “pure play” business jetmaker. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers said the layoffs would affect 717 of its members in Montreal who are now benefiting from an emergency wage subsidy program implemented by the Canadian government to counter the fallout from the outbreak of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus. The union said in a statement that “Bombardier had the means to avoid the layoffs today,” if it extended the program, which runs through the end of August. Masluch said the company needed to act now to give required notice about the layoffs.

PARIS – French police have banned a demonstration planned to take place in front of the US Embassy in Paris on Saturday as protests mount around the world over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The Paris police department said on Friday it had decided to ban the demonstrations because of the risks of social disorder and health dangers from large gatherings due to the coronavirus pandemic. Trouble had broken out at another anti-police demonstration in the French capital on Wednesday. Thousands had turned up despite a police ban on the event in memory of Adama Traore, a 24-year old black Frenchman who died in a 2016 police operation which some have likened to Floyd’s death. Unrest has broken out across the United States after the killing of Floyd, a 46-year-old African American who died after a white policeman pinned his neck under a knee for nearly nine minutes in Minneapolis on May 25.

RIO DE JANEIRO – Brazil’s total COVID-19 death toll blew past that of Italy on Thursday, as the Health Ministry reported 1,437 deaths in the last 24 hours and 30,925 additional coronavirus cases. The Latin American nation has now reported 34,021 deaths from the coronavirus, trailing only the United States and the United Kingdom.

Ten long weeks after a massive coronavirus outbreak sidelined one of the Navy’s signature warships, the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt has returned to sea and is conducting military operations in the Pacific region. Lining the flight deck in their dress white uniforms, sailors wearing white face masks stood a virus-safe 10-feet apart in a final, formal thank you as the ship sailed out of port in Guam Thursday and headed into the Philippine Sea. “We manned the rail, which we don’t normally do. There was a lot of symbolism in that,” Navy Capt. Carlos Sardiello told The Associated Press in an interview from the ship Thursday. “They’re excited. They’re fired up to be back at sea doing the mission.” The Roosevelt pulled into Guam March 27, with a rapidly escalating number of sailors testing positive for the virus. Over time, more than 1,000 were infected with COVID-19, setting off a lengthy and systematic process to move about 4,000 sailors ashore for quarantine and treatment, while about 800 remained aboard to protect and run the high-tech systems, including the nuclear reactors that run the vessel. Slowly, sailors were methodically brought back on board, while the others who had remained went ashore for their mandated two-week quarantine. And in late March, the ship with only about 3,000 crew aboard went out to sea for roughly two weeks of training, including the recertification of the flight deck and fighter squadron, such as takeoffs and landings on the carrier. Earlier this week, the Roosevelt wrapped up training and returned to Guam to pick up nearly 1,000 sailors who had been left there to either complete their quarantine or to manage and work with those still on the island. As the ship sailed into the port, it was flying a flag with the words “Don’t Give Up the Ship,” a famous Navy battle cry from the War of 1812. “Our sailors didn’t give up the ship. They fought and got it back. So I thought it was appropriate,” said Sardiello, who asked one of the other Navy ships to borrow their flag. “The ship was clean and the ship was healthy with no COVID cases. So I said, ok, we’re going to fly that one time on the way into Guam as a symbol to bolster their morale.” RS1 Katie VanDrimmelen was one of the sailors left ashore during the two week training. She had tested positive for the virus and was in quarantine for about five weeks. Walking back onto the ship, she said, was like being welcomed home from a deployment. “It was amazing,” said VanDrimmelen, of Ogden, Utah. “It was very comforting to be back in our normal atmosphere. Everybody was happy.” Sardiello said that watching the sailors board the ship was a great feeling, But he knows he’s not done yet. There are still about 350 sailors on Guam who are either in isolation or are there as support staff. “More and more of those sailors are meeting the return-to-work criteria, and we’re flying them on board every single day. So we’re whittling down that number day by day,” said Sardiello. “But I really want those 350 remaining back. And we’re working hard on that.” He said that any sailors who don’t recover in time will be transported back to the U.S. The ship is expected to continue operations in the Pacific, and then would likely head home to San Diego later this summer. The Roosevelt has been at the center of a still unresolved controversy that led to the firing of the ship’s previous captain, the resignation of the Navy secretary and an expanded investigation into what triggered the outbreak and how well top naval commanders handled it. Sardiello, had previously captained the Roosevelt, but was abruptly sent back to the ship in early April to take command after Capt. Brett Crozier was fired for urging his commanders to take faster action to stem the virus outbreak onboard. After a preliminary review last month, Adm. Mike Gilday, the Navy’s top officer, recommended that Crozier be reinstated as ship captain. But the Navy decided to conduct a broader investigation. That review, which effectively delays a decision on Crozier’s reinstatement, was finished and submitted to Gilday at the end of March and he is still reviewing the extensive report, which includes several hundred pages of interviews, documents and recommendations. Cmdr. Nate Christensen, spokesman for Gilday, said it will take time for the admiral to finish his review and make any decisions.

Tennessee must give all of its 4.1 million registered voters the option to cast ballots by mail during the coronavirus pandemic, a judge ruled Thursday. Davidson County Chancellor Ellen Hobbs Lyle ruled that the state’s limits on absentee voting during the pandemic constitute “an unreasonable burden on the fundamental right to vote guaranteed by the Tennessee Constitution.” The judge wrote that any eligible voter can get an absentee ballot to avoid contracting or passing on COVID-19 in the “upcoming elections during the pendency of pandemic circumstances.” The decision upends a determination by Republican Secretary of State Tre Hargett’s office that fear of catching or unwittingly spreading the virus at the polls wouldn’t qualify someone to vote by mail. The state argued such an expansion wouldn’t be feasible for the 2020 elections, claiming lack of money, personnel and equipment for increased voting by mail, among other concerns. The decision requires the state to “prominently post on their websites and disseminate to County Election Officials that voters who do not wish to vote in-person due to the COVID-19 virus situation are eligible to request an absentee ballot by mail or that such voters still have the option to vote in-person during Early voting or on Election Day.” The judge wrote that the state has taken an “unapologetic” position and has relied on “oddly skewed” assumptions — including assuming preparations for 100% of registered voters to vote absentee if all were allowed — that go against its own expert and industry standards. Eleven other states, meanwhile, have taken a “can-do approach” by relaxing voting by mail restrictions for the 2020 election, while two-thirds of states have allowed vote by mail for everyone for years, Lyle wrote. “When, however, normal industry-recognized assumptions are used, the evidence establishes that the resources are there to provide temporary expanded access to voting by mail in Tennessee during the pandemic if the State provides the leadership and motivation as other states have done,” the judge wrote. Hargett spokeswoman Julia Bruck indicated that the fight is expected to head for an appeal. The attorney general’s office blasted the court’s decision as failing to appropriately consider the “extensive safety measures” within the state’s COVID-19 election plan. “It is yet another court decision replacing legislation passed by the people’s elected officials with its own judgment, largely ignoring the practicalities of implementing such a decision, and doing so in the midst of a pandemic and budget crisis,” Attorney General Herbert Slatery said in a statement. Tennessee has more than a dozen categories that qualify someone for an absentee ballot, from being sick to being 60 or older. The Republican-led Legislature and GOP Gov. Bill Lee have dismissed the idea of offering absentee ballots to all voters, with lawmakers voting against Democratic expansion proposals more than once this week as they meet during pandemic times. Instead, state election officials have recommended preparations as though all 1.4 million registered voters 60 and older — about 1 of every 3 registered voters — will cast mail-in ballots in the Aug. 6 primary. Historically, Tennessee has historically seen less than 2.5% of votes cast by mail, the state has said. Several states who have refused have been sued, including Texas, where a federal judge last month ordered absentee voting be made available to any voter in the pandemic. Tennessee’s voter turnout was 14% in the August 2016 primary, then almost 62% for the November 2016 general election, featuring the presidential election. In the 2018 non-presidential year, about 30% of registered voters turned out for the August primary, and 54% in the November election. Tennessee’s August election will be another test case as U.S. states try to safely prepare for the fall general election highlighted by the re-election bid of President Donald Trump, who has been staunchly against opening up absentee voting to everyone during the pandemic. The state court lawsuits were led by #UpTheVote901 and by the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee. “This is a major victory for voting rights, said Dale Ho, director of the ACLU’s Voting Rights Project. “This ruling eliminates the excuse requirement for the 2020 elections, meaning Tennesseans will not have to risk their health in order to vote.” The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and the Campaign Legal Center have filed a similar federal lawsuit.

Doctors at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) said Thursday that the coronavirus appears to be declining both in virulence and infection rate. “The virus may be changing,” Dr. Donald Yealy said Thursday during a news conference. “Some patterns suggest the potency is diminished.” Yealy said UPMC has successfully treated more than 500 patients with coronavirus since March, and fewer patients are requiring ventilators to help them breathe. People seem to be contracting the virus less easily and cases appear to be less severe than when the pandemic first began, he explained. “We’ve tested 30,000 and the positivity rate was less than 4 percent. We tested 8,000 with no symptoms and only 21 came back positive,” Yealy said. He also said the risk of being in a car crash on the Pennsylvania Turnpike “is greater than the risk of testing positive for asymptomatic COVID symptoms.” The chief medical officer of UPMC Senior Communities, Dr. David Nace, said that thanks to the measures taken by medical officials in the hospital, there were zero reported cases Thursday in the UPMC long-term care and senior care facilities. “We’ve followed the basics of infection control that others have also tried to follow,” Nace said. “Including attention to surveillance of patients who exhibited signs and symptoms.” “We can’t test our way out of COVID-19,” he added. “Testing is a tool, not a cure.” Researchers at UPMC are unsure at this point why they are seeing lower infection rates, but said it could be a variety of factors including weather and the fact that “viruses tend to mutate with time.” “And, finally, we are probably making better decisions about who needs what kind of care,” Yealy added. Elsewhere in the world, Central and South America are now seeing higher rates of infection with the biggest rise in caseloads in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Haiti, Mexico and Peru, according to the United Nations.

Citi Field, which has been closed due to the coronavirus, has been slapped with a “junk” rating amid fears that it won’t be able to pay its debts. Ratings agency Standard & Poor’s on Thursday downgraded Citi Field from an investment grade “BBB” rating to “BB+”, or junk status, saying it may need to tap its debt reserve to make a $22 million payment due in December — and warning that it could run out of money next year if there’s a baseball strike. Citi Field makes two $22 million payments annually to the New York City Industrial Development Agency, which issued $612 million in bonds to build the stadium, completed in 2009 as home to the Mets. The Wilpon family-owned Mets are technically separate from the stadium, which is paid for through sales of luxury suites, party suites, club seats, concessions and merchandise. S&P says the Mets may seek to help the stadium make the December payment to keep its lease intact.

There remains no outward signs MLB and the players’ association are moving toward each other in time to begin the regular season with the optimum start, Independence Day weekend. The MLB Players Association released a statement Thursday evening saying that its executive board and more than 100 players talked via conference call and recommitted to wanting to play this year. Importantly, though, not under the key demand of owners that they take a pay cut from their prorated salaries for games played. “The overwhelming consensus of the Board is that Players are ready to report, ready to get back on the field, and they are willing to do so under unprecedented conditions that could affect the health and safety of not just themselves, but their families as well,” executive director Tony Clark said in a statement. “The league’s demand for additional concessions was resoundingly rejected.” On Wednesday, MLB spurned a union proposal delivered Sunday that namely called for a 114-game season (MLB had proposed 82) and full prorated pay (MLB asked for major concessions with a sliding scale that would particularly impact the highest-paid players). At the Sunday meeting, MLB told the union of a concept to implement a season of roughly 48-54 games with full prorated pay. MLB believes the sides’ March 26 agreement empowers commissioner Rob Manfred with the power to decide scheduling and a number of games as long as key economic and health/safety issues have been considered by the league. The union is against such a schedule and could try a variety of tactics to block the implementation, such as refusing to accept a key national TV money maker for the owners — the expansion of the playoffs. “Earlier this week, Major League Baseball communicated its intention to schedule a dramatically shortened 2020 season unless Players negotiate salary concessions,” Clark said in his statement. “The concessions being sought are in addition to billions in Player salary reductions that have already been agreed upon. “This threat came in response to an Association proposal aimed at charting a path forward. Among other things, Players proposed more games, two years of expanded playoffs, salary deferrals in the event of a 2020 playoff cancellation, and the exploration of additional jewel events and broadcast enhancements aimed at creatively bringing our Players to the fans while simultaneously increasing the value of our product. Rather than engage, the league replied it will shorten the season unless Players agree to further salary reductions.” MLB has claimed its financial losses will be too overwhelming to pay full proration on a season of much longer than 50-ish games. The union already considers its concession to not be paid for games not played this year a substantial sacrifice and see the owners asking for more as a request that goes too far. All of this imperils the most ideal restart date of the July 4 weekend, when MLB would be able to best try to renew its historic place as the national pastime. But to do so, the sides were likely going to need to be able to complete a negotiation by early next week at the latest to still give three weeks for a spring training 2.0. But at this point, the sides publicly remain entrenched in positions that not only threaten the best start time, but maybe the whole season.

President Trump is taking heavy criticism for his announcement last week that the United States is “terminating its relationship with the World Health Organization.” But evidence is mounting that the $450 million America spends yearly on the WHO is money down a rat hole. This week, the Associated Press revealed how the WHO lied to the world about China’s initial coverup of the coronavirus outbreak. Those lies, which delayed other countries’ responses to the virus, caused hundreds of thousands of needless deaths. The AP gained access to recordings of internal WHO meetings in January. Those recordings capture WHO officials discussing keeping China’s secretive conduct under wraps, even as the WHO kept praising China publicly. That sugarcoating left the world unaware and unprepared for the pandemic about to hit. Even without this damning new information, Trump would have been right to pull American dollars and prestige out of the WHO. The organization has an abysmal record dealing with previous global diseases, from SARS to H1N1 flu and Ebola. In the aftermath of the Ebola outbreak in 2014, the Harvard Global Health Institute’s director, Ashish Jha, wrote of the growing skepticism toward the WHO because it “often fails to perform when the world needs it most.” Look at how the WHO spends its money. Only 4 percent goes for medical supplies, but double that goes for air travel and 10 times on salaries and perks. The agency is a bloated, cushy, underperforming bureaucracy. It spends hundreds of millions a year on meetings, business-class travel and top hotels and turns a blind eye when senior staff go “with girlfriends on fabricated missions,” according to an AP investigation. Why should US taxpayers pay for global junkets? Don’t confuse the WHO with the Red Cross, Doctors Without Borders or other organizations delivering care to the sick. On Sunday, Trump’s national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, suggested the US will shift its support to such front-line care. In the AP’s latest revelations, the WHO’s top staff are recorded discussing behind closed doors how China is concealing the virus, while publicly the agency praised China for transparency. China had mapped the genetic makeup of the virus by Jan. 2 but withheld the information until Jan. 11. Worse, it concealed until Jan. 20 that the virus is contagious, even though Wuhan hospitals were flooded with patients. By the time China locked down the city of Wuhan, some 5 million residents had fled, carrying the disease across the world. “It’s obvious that we could have saved more lives and avoided many, many deaths if China and the WHO had acted faster,” explains the University of Washington’s Ali Mokdad. Yet here is WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Jan. 30 whitewashing China’s deception: “The speed with which China detected the outbreak, isolated the virus, sequenced the genome and shared it with WHO and the world are very impressive and beyond words.” He called it a “new standard of outbreak response.” The Communist standard — lie and let hundreds of thousands die. Just like China tried to hide SARS in 2003. When Trump suspended the WHO’s funding in April, Tedros pompously lectured: “Don’t use this virus as an opportunity to fight against each other or score political points.” Tedros needs to look in the mirror: He’s the one playing politics, barring Taiwan from participating in two emergency coronavirus meetings. Taiwan had some of the earliest cases and was the first to tip off the WHO that the coronavirus was likely contagious. But any concessions to Taiwan infuriate Beijing, and that’s where Tedros’ loyalty lies. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi claims the president doesn’t have the constitutional authority to hold back WHO funding or leave the organization without Congress’ approval. Let the lawyers haggle over that. Trump’s got the big picture. The organization is not worthy of US support. It puts politics ahead of global health and blows our tax money on travel boondoggles and high living for its staff. Betsy McCaughey is a former lieutenant governor of New York, the chairwoman of the Committee to Reduce Infection Deaths and author of the forthcoming book “The Next Pandemic.” 

The Big Apple marked a major turning point in its battle against the coronavirus pandemic Wednesday with no new confirmed deaths from COVID-19 for the first time since March 12. “In the face of extraordinary challenges, New Yorkers have gone above and beyond to keep each other safe throughout the crisis,” said City Hall spokeswoman Avery Cohen. “With hope on the horizon, we will continue to do everything we can to reopen safely without losing sight of the progress we’ve made,” Cohen said. By Friday, city health officials had revised the overnight death count from zero to seven as additional information became available. There were zero additional deaths between Tuesday and Wednesday, according to the city’s Health Department data, which is reported with a 24-hour lag. During that same period earlier this week, the city saw just three probable deaths of people who never tested positive for the virus but showed telltale symptoms. Those probable deaths could be reclassified as confirmed deaths in the coming days, Cohen said. There were 500 new fatalities each day during the pandemic’s peak in early April. The city’s current COVID-19 death toll of 21,752 includes 16,992 confirmed fatalities and 4,760 probable ones.

The head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday that police crowd-control chemicals cause coughing that could spread the coronavirus — and he will raise the matter with the White House task force. CDC Director Robert Redfield told the House Appropriations Committee he fears George Floyd protests across the nation will become a “seeding event” for COVID-19 and noted high pre-protest transmission rates in some cities where demonstrations are taking place. “Definitely coughing can spread respiratory viruses, including COVID-19,” Redfield said. He agreed with Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) that crowd-control chemicals can make people cough. “That’s been my experience,” he said. “I think you raise an important point,” Redfield told Pocan. “I’ll pass on this comment to the next task force meeting.” Outside the White House and across the country, police have used capsaicin-based compounds including pepper spray and pepper balls among the tightly packed crowds.

Protesters themselves have lit fireworks and set fire to buildings and garbage bins full of plastics, emitting foul fumes. “We have advocated strongly the ability to have face coverings and masks available to protesters so that they can at least have those coverings, but you do raise an important question,” Redfield told Pocan regarding police chemicals. The CDC director told lawmakers he’s concerned about how the protests will impact the pandemic, which has sickened nearly 2 million Americans and killed almost 110,000. Redfield said protesters should go get tested for the virus. “The first thing that I would like to see is those individuals who have partaken in these peaceful protests or been out protesting, particularly if they are in metropolitan areas that really haven’t controlled the outbreak to the extent we want — Minneapolis happens to be one that is still having significant transmission, DC is another one — we really want those individuals to highly consider being evaluated and get tested,” Redfield said. “I do think there is a potential, unfortunately, for this to be a seeding event.”

This was bound to happen. When schools began opening up their campuses for voluntary football workouts, positive tests of the novel coronavirus were sure to follow. Early on, Alabama has been hit the hardest, with at least five players testing positive, 247Sports.com reported. The names of those players were not known, and it is uncertain if they were showing symptoms. The workouts were set to begin on Monday, after the SEC announced in May all teams were able to do so. Under the conference’s guidelines, players had to be tested within 72 hours of entering the facilities and daily after activities begin. Student-athletes who test positive would be isolated immediately. Alabama, of course, isn’t alone. Three Oklahoma State players have tested positive – they were asymptomatic — leading the school to tell freshmen not to report this week, and a member of the Iowa State athletic department was also a positive case.

The authors of a study published in the medical journal The Lancet that said taking hydroxychloroquine to treat coronavirus could be fatal retracted their findings Thursday after multiple reports questioned its data. The database belonged to a small Illinois company called Surgisphere, which is owned by Dr. Sapan Desai, one of four co-authors of the study, and which has a science fiction writer and an adult content model on its small staff, who have little or no medical or science backgrounds. The other three co-authors, including Dr. Mandeep R. Mehra, a professor at Harvard Medical School, retracted the article after their attempt to verify the data’s accuracy and authenticity were thwarted by Desai, who did not return requests for comment from The Post. “We launched an independent third-party peer review of Surgisphere with the consent of Sapan Desai to evaluate the origination of the database elements, to confirm the completeness of the database, and to replicate the analyses presented in the paper,” their statement said, The New York Times reported. “Our independent peer reviewers informed us that Surgisphere would not transfer the full dataset, client contracts, and the full ISO audit report to their servers for analysis as such transfer would violate client agreements and confidentiality requirements,” the authors continued, referring to a type of audit that seeks to determine whether Surgisphere, in this case, actually did what it claimed to do. The World Health Organization and several world governments changed their coronavirus policies and resumed trials of hydroxychloroquine because they got questionable data from the company, The Guardian reported Wednesday. Data the Chicago-based company claims to have obtained from more than a thousand hospitals worldwide formed the basis of scientific articles that led to changes in coronavirus treatment policies in several countries. The company also influenced the decision by the WHO and other research facilities to halt trials of hydroxychloroquine, which President Trump has touted and took as a precaution against coronavirus. The WHO announced Wednesday that those trials of the anti-malarial drug would now resume. The Lancet on Tuesday released an “expression of concern” about its published study. The medical journal said in a statement Thursday that “there are many outstanding questions about Surgisphere and the data that were allegedly included in this study.”

COPENHAGEN – Danish researchers have developed a fully automated robot that can take coronavirus swabs so that health care professionals are not exposed to the risk of infection. Researchers from Southern University of Denmark (SDU) and Lifeline Robotics hope their prototype ‘swab robot’ can soon be deployed to relieve health professionals of the potentially risky task of testing patients. When a patient presents an ID-card, the robot prepares a sampling kit, performs the swab and puts the sample in a container ready for testing, explained Thiusius Rajeeth Savarimuthu, professor of robotics at SDU. In a video, Savarimuthi tested the robot on himself. He positioned his face with his chin in a plastic frame, opened his mouth wide and allowed a robotic arm to stick a swab into the back of his throat and rotate it. The robot, powered by artificial intelligence, uses cameras to find the right part of the throat and is programmed to swab it gently, the developers explained. “You get exactly the same procedure repeated again and again which will give better quality of the samples,” Savarimuthu said. “There’s going to be a global demand, a global need for more testing, more automated testing, to protect and shield those that are in the front line,” said the chief executive of Lifeline Robotics, Soeren Stig.

JOHANNESBURG – When Zinzi Lerefolo was sent home from her fee-paying girls’ school in a leafy Johannesburg suburb in March, her family set up a virtual classroom that allowed her to continue studying uninterrupted. The 13-year-old has access to the internet and her school has the means to provide online teaching during the coronavirus lockdown. For Phuti Ngoetjana, 14, it has been a different story. Her state school has no resources to make the leap to cyberspace and even if it did her family could not afford the data to access lessons in the one-room brick home in the east Johannesburg township of Tembisa where she lives. The contrast between the black girls’ education during the pandemic has played out the world over. In South Africa, it is especially acute and sensitive. Although elite schools that were open only to white South Africans under apartheid are now integrated, most black pupils can’t afford them and the country has struggled to bridge huge inequalities 26 years after the fall of white minority rule. The country remains one of the world’s most economically divided, with the top 10 percent of households owning 71 percent of the wealth, according to World Bank data from 2018. As schools prepare to partially re-open from Monday, the educational gap risks widening and government ministers, teachers’ unions and parents are worried. Those institutions built under apartheid in predominantly black townships and rural areas are the least well equipped to cope with the pandemic, with poor internet access, crowded classrooms and sparse amenities. “COVID-19 has exposed the divide,” said Lerefolo’s father Simon, now a church pastor who escaped the townships to a top university in 1994 and who was able to pay for an elite education for his daughter. “And it’s got us thinking: what have we done, us who are privileged, to reduce this divide?” When to re-open? Schools were supposed to have resumed this week, but some teachers and unions argued it was not safe to do so until the government did more to ensure employees were safe from COVID-19. Government officials have countered that a generation of school children risks losing a key part of their education and the future opportunities it brings, even though the virus affects them far less than the sick and elderly. In Western Cape, the opposition Democratic Alliance, which unlike the governing party is not beholden to unions, has defied orders from Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga to delay opening for the last grades of primary and secondary school. That’s despite the province accounting for two-thirds of the country’s coronavirus cases. Western Cape education chief Debbie Schafer said that schools there had taken the necessary precautions and she would not wait for another week to start. They re-opened on June 3. An education department spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on this article. ‘Two-tier’ system  South Africa’s education system has left millions of children without basic skills. Literacy tests carried out by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement in 2016 found that 78 percent of South African pupils could not read for meaning by the age of 9 or 10, compared with 64 percent in Morocco and 4 percent in the United States. Of 100 students who start school, 40-50 will pass their final high school exam and 14 will go to university, Amnesty International said in a report in February. “We still have … two South Africas living side by side,” said Nic Spaull, an education expert at Stellenbosch University in Western Cape province. “The two schooling systems have de-racialized, but you still have two systems.” Under lockdown, these inequalities are being enlarged by disparities in digital access. International Telecommunication Union data shows just 22 percent of households have a computer in South Africa, while 60 percent have internet access. Since the end of apartheid, the governing African National Congress has brought electricity and piped water to millions and slashed poverty by a third. Education has also improved: in the two decades since 1994, the number of black university graduates quadrupled to 48,600, Spaull said. But for the poorest, the situation remains dire, which he put down in part to a failure to improve the quality of teachers – many of whom were themselves a product of apartheid education. “I’m not connected”
Zinzi Lerefolo has used the dining room in her spacious family home to attend classes held via videolink and do homework handed out using social media. “It wasn’t really an issue going online,” she told Reuters, taking a break in her lounge with a view of the pool outside, before positioning her phone for a virtual art class. About 35 km (20 miles) away, Ngoetjana sat in her parents’ single room – where they rest, eat, wash clothes and dishes – trying to study. Noise from traffic and people talking outside was ceaseless. “The teachers didn’t give us any homework during this lockdown,” she said, looking up from her maths exercises. “I haven’t learned much because I’m not connected online.” Most black South Africans depend on cash-strapped free schools like hers. Under the former apartheid system, they were designed to provide only limited education: their role was to prepare black children for lower-paid jobs and keep them subservient to whites. But the all-race democracy introduced in 1994 was supposed to change that. Whether Ngoetjana’s school resumes on Monday, when classes are meant to restart for the crucial last years of primary and secondary school, is unclear. Teachers’ unions are adamant they will not go back until all schools are equipped with masks, hand washing facilities and sanitizer. That is a tall order given that, according to Spaull, more than a quarter of schools don’t have running water. Many rural schools lack bathrooms – they use outdoor pit latrines instead. Dozens of school buildings were also vandalized or burned during the lockdown. “The consequences are huge,” said Zama Mthunzi, of the Equal Education activist group. “Learners might not end up finishing or going to university … They’re going to be left behind very badly.” Unlike Lerefolo, the fortunes of Ngoetjana’s father, Julius, have not changed much since apartheid ended. He said in some ways his daughter’s school reminded him of his: 60 kids jammed in a classroom making learning challenging. “Things have improved but not enough,” he said.

British drugmaker AstraZeneca has doubled manufacturing capacity for its potential coronavirus vaccine to 2 billion doses in a handful of deals involving Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates that guarantee early supply to lower-income countries. The deals with epidemic response group CEPI and vaccine alliance GAVI are backed by the World Health Organization and aim to quell concerns that the company was committing all initial supplies of the vaccine to the developed world. It is unclear if vaccines will work against the coronavirus but dozens of companies are in the race to develop one, and AstraZeneca’s partnership with Oxford University is one of a handful to be backed so far by the US COVID task force. The White House last month secured 300 million of the first doses of the potential vaccine, named AZD1222, in a deal that also committed more than $1 billion in backing to testing and manufacturing. UK has booked another 100 million. Under Thursday’s deals, the company will supply 300 million doses, starting this year, to CEPI and GAVI as it aims at fair and equitable distribution of the vaccine, Chief Executive Pascal Soriot said. He said AstraZeneca had also agreed terms with Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest manufacturer of vaccines by volume, to supply one billion doses for low and middle-income countries. Part of the vaccine doses produced by Serum will be used in India, with the remainder allocated to GAVI, the company said on a call with journalists. That leaves AstraZeneca with 300 million doses in planned production capacity, which has yet to be earmarked for use. Experts predict a safe and effective vaccine could take 12 months to 18 months to develop. The vaccine, previously known as ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, was developed by the University of Oxford and licensed to AstraZeneca. Immunity to the new coronavirus is uncertain and so the use of vaccines is unclear. “You can’t spend your time wondering is it going to work. We have to commit. That’s what we do in the industry — we bet on something. We are completely committed to the vaccine program to deliver,” Soriot said.

Keep your distance from the wildlife… and other people! As local restrictions are lifted and states gradually reopen amid the coronavirus pandemic, the National Park Service (NPS) is reminding visitors to avoid close contact with other parkgoers through a creative new poster series encouraging social distancing. The park service recently unveiled the artwork to improve visitor communication as NPS sites proceed with phased reopening plans, Mother Nature Network reports. “A little space goes a long way,” one clever graphic reads, illustrating the six-foot mark of safe social distancing space recommended by the Centers for Disease Control as a moose’s antlers, one grizzly bear, two picnic tables between friends, or a national park sign. “Observe wildlife rules… but with people!” another sign orders, reminding visitors to frequently, thoroughly wash their hands with soap and water, stay home when sick and cover sneezes or coughs with a tissue – as well as, playfully, not “use slower friends as bear bait.” Another poster explains the “right” and “wrong” ways to social distance, showing that 6 feet is a good distance to keep from a friend, and 300 feet is a safe space to keep from wildlife. Get any closer to the wild animals, the graphic warns, and you’ll need “good luck.” Other graphics ask fans to recreate responsibly by avoiding crowded areas, carrying out personal items carried in and perhaps even consider virtual visits from home. Before heading out into the great outdoors, be sure to confer with evolving NPS guidance to see if your local park is open and heed these safety tips to protect yourself inside the parks amid the COVID-19 outbreak.

It’s now for real. The NBA Board of Governors voted 29-1 Thursday to bring back their season, with training camp beginning June 30 and the season reopener July 31 with a 22-team format in Orlando, the league announced. “The Board’s approval of the restart format is a necessary step toward resuming the NBA season,” commissioner Adam Silver said in a press release. “While the COVID-19 pandemic presents formidable challenges, we are hopeful of finishing the season in a safe and responsible manner based on strict protocols now being finalized with public health officials and medical experts. We also recognize that as we prepare to resume play, our society is reeling from recent tragedies of racial violence and injustice, and we will continue to work closely with our teams and players to use our collective resources and influence to address these issues in very real and concrete ways.” The players association is expected to rubber-stamp the decision Friday, but how the league will sort out coronavirus testing has not been established. “‘I’m ready to go,” Mavericks owner Mark Cuban told The Post. “We have more work to do, because safety will always be our primary focus, but it’s going to be fun to have the guys back on the court.” The Nets and the other 21 clubs will begin training camp for a week on June 30 then continue it in Orlando after July 7. The additional six teams beyond the playoff quaifiers based on the March 11 standings are the Trail Blazers, Pelicans, Kings, Spurs, Suns and Wizards. That’s five teams from the West and one from the East — based on the formula of teams having to be within six games of a playoff spot. It also worked out those teams have the league’s 22 best records. The Blazers, ninth in the West, were the lone dissenting vote — they pushed for just 20 teams, according to a source. After eight regular-season games called “seeding games,’’ there will be a play-in event between the Nos. 8 and 9 seeds in each conference — but only if the ninth seed is within four games of the playoff spot. The NBA Finals could conclude as late as Oct. 12, with training camp for next season not commencing until Nov. 10, according to the NBA. The season opener for 2020-21 would “likely’’ be Dec. 1, the NBA said.  Teams will be secluded in a bubble atmosphere at Disney World with a series of protocols. The NBA statement read: “The NBA and the NBPA are working with infectious disease specialists, public health experts and government officials to establish a rigorous program to prevent and mitigate the risk related to COVID-19, including a regular testing protocol and stringent safety practices.” As previously reported, the Knicks won’t be part of the Disney World fun and can embark on a coaching search, with Tom Thibodeau penciled in as favorite. The Knicks have always been ambivalent about a restart with their record finishing at 21-45 — officially now seven straight seasons out of the playoffs. The Nets, seventh in the East, will partake in the eight-game regular season that will be followed by a potential play-in series then the playoffs. One report stated the 2021 Finals would be in July, so as to ensure NBA players would be available for the postponed Tokyo Olympics, which are scheduled to begin late that month. The NBA was the first sports league in America to shut down and now is ready to officially be the first up and running.There were doubters in March that the NBA would play again, with Jeff Van Gundy among those predicting the season was over.

A Miami plastic surgeon is offering drive-through Botox for quarantined residents. Michael Salzhauer, otherwise known as “Dr Miami,” has been running a clinic for injections in the garage of his Florida home. The plastic surgeon told Reuters he came up with the idea when he was sitting in his car at a drive-through site to get tested for coronavirus antibodies. Salzhauser said while waiting for a patient: “The areas that we inject Botox are the upper face, exactly the parts of the face that aren’t covered by the mask so it’s really ideal.” Per Reuters, patients who want drive-through Botox sign up for Salzhauser’s services online — paying an average of $600. A client of Dr. Miami’s, Arman Ohevshalom said the idea was “very creative.” “After seeing how they’re running it I feel just as comfortable as I would in the office,” he added. As of Thursday, Florida had more than 58,700 coronavirus cases and at least 2,500 deaths. Gov Ron DeSantis ordered all “non-essential elective medical procedures” to be stopped as of March 18 because of the pandemic. But in early May, Florida eased up slightly on coronavirus restrictions. Cosmetic and elective medical procedures, like Botox injections, were allowed to begin again. Hospitals were allowed to resume surgeries and doctors in South Florida said they were separating plastic surgery patients from COVID-infected ones. “We are not overwhelmed. We screen every patient that walks through the door and we test every patient that goes upstairs,” Dr Randy Katz, medical director of emergency services at Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood told WFOR-TV. “We keep patients separate and we keep people safe — our patients and healthcare providers.” The chief of general surgery, Dr. Brett Cohen, added: “We have rearranged our schedules. We have spaced outpatient care so that they have an individual appointment and won’t run in to anybody else.” “The patient waiting rooms have been changed, so chairs are spaced out.” As noted by Reuters, tattoo artists in the Sunshine State — of which there are around 10,000 — remain frustrated that they can’t open up, too. A Miami-Dade spokesperson said local officials haven’t set a date for tattoo shops to reopen, but said they’re working on it.

Al ULA, Saudi Arabia – Abeer al-Howayan despaired of ever working after spending eight years trying to find a job that would put her chemistry degree to use in the Saudi Arabian town of Al Ula. She eventually abandoned her scientific ambitions and turned to selling homemade cakes, before she was chosen last year for a government training program to support a $20 billion flagship tourism project in the kingdom’s northwestern region. The 31-year-old learned how to make artisanal soap from French experts flown in by Saudi authorities and in late December started selling her creations at a booth near the rock-hewn tombs of Madain Saleh, site of an ancient civilization. She also started offering her wares online. Then the coronavirus struck. Even after all her compromises, Howayan’s future is uncertain once again. The pandemic has hammered Saudi Arabia’s nascent non-religious tourism industry – among the few new sectors to have emerged under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s drive to diversify the economy from oil and create millions of jobs. “It is very tough, but I keep telling myself things will get better after corona. One has to remain optimistic,” Howayan, whose online business has also slowed, told Reuters. Women in the United States and Europe have taken an outsized hit from the wave of unemployment caused by the coronavirus, but for women in Saudi Arabia the downturn is particularly damaging because it struck just as their efforts to enter the workforce and gain greater financial independence were gaining traction. Howayan is among nearly one million unemployed Saudis – 12 percent of the working-age population – pinning their hopes on the prince’s vision to modernize the conservative and patriarchal country with ambitious projects. Women make up about 83 percent of the jobless, according to the Saudi statistics office. And it’s an educated group; 70 percent of those women have high school diplomas or university degrees. And many were counting on the new sectors such as tourism to provide their entry to the workforce. Private sector squeezed 
Tackling unemployment is a main pillar of Prince Mohammed’s plan. He promised in 2017 “better unemployment numbers by 2020” and to cut the jobless rate to 7 percent over the next decade. But the rate has fallen by less than 1 percentage point. A tough task has become even tougher as coronavirus disruptions and austerity measures have squeezed the finances of the private sector. “To reduce unemployment, the private sector will need to create at least 500,000 to 1 million jobs for Saudis, said John Sfakianakis, a Gulf expert at the University of Cambridge, “But this year alone, the private sector will unavoidably contract by 7 percent … and that’s just this year.” Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan told Reuters that the government remained committed to job creation targets and was still funding training and capacity building. “Coronavirus is with us this year and possibly for a part of next year, but then it will go away and when it goes away we need to make sure that we have seized this time to build more capacity and train more people to be ready when we start offering services again,” said Jadaan. He did not specifically address the issue of women. According to regional experts, a faltering of the reform drive could lead to the public questioning the social contract between the ruling Al Saud family and the people in a country where 80 percent of the population is under 30. Oil wealth is shared across the kingdom in exchange for popular submission to absolute monarchical rule. However there could be some social discontent if jobs do not materialize and Saudis find themselves paying more taxes with less state benefits, according to Yasmine Farouk at the Carnegie Middle East Center. “It will eventually guide the country into a political discussion that the leadership doesn’t want,” she said. Ending gender segregation
Saudi Arabia has largely struggled to lure foreign capital outside the energy sector as many investors hesitate over Riyadh’s human rights record and the commercial viability of some domestic mega projects. But the entertainment and tourism industries started taking off last year, accompanied by social reforms to open up the kingdom, including ending gender segregation in most public places and introducing public entertainment. Thousands of jobs were created and Saudis flocked to concerts, festivals and sporting events. Last year, the kingdom attracted international acts from Cirque du Soleil to Mariah Carey, Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli and Greek musician Yanni. Saudis also cheered female WWE wrestlers in Riyadh and heavyweight boxers Anthony Joshua and Andy Ruiz Jr in a custom-built 15,000 person stadium. However, the Saudi tourism minister told Reuters in April that the industry, including Muslim pilgrimages, could decline by 35-45 percent this year due to coronavirus measures. Abeer Mohammed Jumuah is another example of a woman who benefited from the prince’s reform drive. She spent years looking for a job as a teacher after graduating from university in home economics and eventually joined a government training program last year to learn cooking skills in Paris. The 31-year-old has returned to a catering role in Saudi Arabia helping Michelin-starred chefs, but it is only temporary and she will eventually need to find new work – something that has become a trickier proposition in the wake of the pandemic. “I hope that one day I can open a café where I can offer a breakfast menu with lots of French pastries,” she said. “I want to be financially independent and I want my two daughters, aged four and seven, to have a better living standard.” Changing expectations 
Analysts said they expected a recovery in tourism and entertainment to start in the first half of 2021, with the sectors requiring government support for at least a few years. The Royal Commission for Al Ula, set up in 2017 to carry out reforms in the crown prince’s drive, said it planned to reopen in October this year and a spokesman said it was committed to job creation. Some are hopeful for the future. Madiha al-Anazy, 29, joined a five-month tour guide training program when she returned from Florida in May 2019 with a masters degree in biotechnology and now has a permanent job as a tour guide. Her 33-year-old husband, Mohamad, was temporarily taken on as a part-time “ranger” to protect heritage sites and the couple is betting on a revival in the tourism sector. “We hope he will find a permanent job one day,” Anazy said. Private-sector job creation is partly intended to wean citizens off reliance on the state as more than two-thirds of the Saudi workforce is employed by the government and their salaries account for roughly half of 2020 budget spending. Low oil prices would make it difficult for past state largesse to continue. This could lead to many young Saudis taking lower-income jobs typically relegated to foreigners, in a societal shift, according to Karen Young, a Gulf analyst at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. “People’s expectation for income and lifestyle are going to be different to their parents,” she said.

Whether you’re a freshman coming to college or a returning student, there isn’t much certainty about the fall semester. Individual colleges are periodically announcing plans — often subject to change — for courses that are fully online, largely in-person or some kind of hybrid. In addition, it’s hard to envision what the experience of attending college in the midst of a global pandemic and accompanying economic recession will look like — and whether it’s worth the hefty investment. But students and families can control how they react. The unknowns have some students considering taking a gap year, transferring to a different institution for a period or even changing their college choice overall. By gathering the right data, they can make an informed decision about their plans for the fall. Here are questions to consider and pose to universities as families think through their options: Are you living on campus with certain restrictions? Students and families need to determine what factors matter to them the most in making their decision, said Jayne Fonash, the president of the National Association for College Admission Counseling. Are students worried about how being on campus might affect their health? Are they comfortable living on campus with certain restrictions? How have the family’s finances changed? These are some of the questions students and families can put to themselves that can help them define their priorities before asking for information from their colleges. In addition, students should think about what kind of resources — including, technology, food assistance and academic help — that they might need to be successful in school, said Teresa Steinkamp, the advising director at the Scholarship Foundation of St. Louis. Students should also be thinking about how the fall semester may fit into their broader plans and goals. “We have an obligation to the students who are considering enrolling or who are continuing their education this fall to really think about the cost-benefit analysis and understand that pausing right now is not necessarily indicative of a failure or a personal flaw on their end,” she said. What happens if you get sick on campus? Jean Chin, an associate clinical professor of medicine at the University of Georgia, who is also chairing the American College Health Association’s COVID-19 task force, said there are a whole slew of pandemic-specific questions, including: How are you going to support my physical and mental health? What will happen if the student gets sick in the residence halls? Does the school have its own health service? If not, where will they send students who need their health care needs met?” Parents and students should also try to get an understanding of how a college will handle a situation where one student is infringing on another’s health, Chin said. “What’s going to happen if a student doesn’t want to wear a mask or doesn’t respect my six-foot physical space?” In addition, if a student is medically high-risk, ask whether the college has a plan for keeping them safe, she said. Chin also suggests families look at individual colleges’ websites to see what plans the schools have already communicated and whether they sound reasonable to the family. Her committee has released a set of guidelines for colleges looking to bring students back on campus. Access to widespread testing for students, faculty and staff with symptoms as well as the ability to contact-trace and quarantine infected individuals are key to minimizing the spread of the virus on a campus, according to the document. “Anybody who posts a well-documented plan to me seems like they’ve got their ducks in a row,” Chin said. “They may not have thought of everything — it tells you that their process of thinking is really sound.” Students and families may also want to get a granular understanding of the safety measures schools with in-person courses are taking to protect students, Fonash said. Will masks be required in certain settings and, if they’ll be provided, how big will classes be? And what will a room in residence look like? Families may also want peace of mind about the social aspects of the college experience. “I don’t know that a campus can monitor 24/7 every party, every gathering, every individual decision, but certainly knowing what the policy is going to be on the campus, is a legitimate question,” she said. How does the pandemic impact your expenses? College costs and financial aid always play an important role in students and families’ decisions of where to attend school, but economic considerations are particularly crucial during a period when so many are out of work and the product colleges are delivering is noticeably different than what students expect. “It’s important for a student to understand completely the cost of their education, the aid that they’ve been offered and what, if any, unmet need remains,” Steinkamp said. “That’s really important this year because students are being asked to commit to institutions where there’s still a lot of uncertainty.” Are financial-aid offers are final or an estimate? Steinkamp says students should be sure the offer is final before committing to a school. In addition, students and families should reflect internally about what it means to attend an institution during this period that requires parents or students to take on a sizable loan, she said. Her organization is advising students to make parallel plans, laying the groundwork to attend a community college if — for health and finance reasons — it makes sense to go to a less-expensive school close to home, while also keeping track of deposit deadlines — and crucially when those deposits can be refunded — at other colleges they’re considering. How will financial aid be impacted by the current environment? The CARES Act, one of the stimulus bills passed by Congress earlier this year, temporarily suspended the requirement that colleges match the money provided by the government for work-study programs. “Either the average work-study job is going to be less money or they’re going to have fewer of them,” said Mark Kantrowitz, the publisher of savingforcollege.com. In addition, if certain campus facilities are closed, students may not be able to get hired for a typical work-study gig, like staffing the library desk or swiping students into the cafeteria. What does that look like in the fall if you can’t do your work-study position? Do you have all the resources necessary to cover your expenses? If not, how does that affect your ability to continue at that institution? If students are considering taking a gap year or signing up for courses at a local community colleges, how might that affect your eligibility for financial aid when you return? Need-based financial aid will always be based on a college’s assessment of a student’s free application for federal student aid or FAFSA, Fonash said. Will merit-based scholarship or grants be the same if you return to their school six months or a year from now? Will you have to reapply for financial aid if you take a gap year or enroll elsewhere for a period? It’s also often the case that colleges make less financial aid available to transfer students, Kantrowitz said. What is the average award for transfer students versus a first-year student? Given the economic uncertainty surrounding so many families, students and parents should also find out from colleges how they’ll help them afford the cost of school if their financial situation changes. That may already be the case for some students since need-based financial aid is based on income information provided by families from the 2018 tax year. Students always have the option to ask colleges to reassess their financial-aid packages, Kantrowitz said. How can you appeal for more financial aid? Typically, schools will issue a form or they’ll tell students to write a letter about their change in circumstances, he said. In addition, the Seldin/Haring-Smith Foundation, a nonprofit focused on higher education and immigration issues, launched SwiftStudent last month, a free tool students can use to streamline the process of writing to their schools for more financial aid. How is the school handling increased demand for financial aid? In addition, get a sense of whether the amount students will be asked to pay will change if the campus experience does, Kantrowitz said. Will housing deposits, room/board and tuition will be refunded if classes start or move online? When campuses were forced online in the spring, many schools offered at least pro-rated refunds on room and board, but very few provided tuition rebates. If a college promises some kind of refund, will it be a cash refund or a credit? Cash won’t affect students’ eligibility for financial aid the following year, but a rebate will, he said. Understanding changes to the academic experience
Regardless of whether courses are delivered mostly online or largely in-person this fall, a student’s academic experience will be different from previous years. The way colleges approach this new learning environment could impact students’ decision to attend. For many students and colleges, the rush to convert courses from in-person to remote was disappointing. How will virtual courses in the fall look different than those in the spring? Steinkamp also suggests students reflect on how the online learning experience went for them in the spring and factor that into their decision-making in the fall. Will they change their course load or pick different classes? Were they able to access tutoring and the other academic resources that they might need to succeed online? Depending on the answers, it may make sense for some students to take a semester off if the experience is fully online, Steinkamp said, particularly if they’re borrowing for those courses. Ultimately, never agree to attend a college without these two questions answered: What do you need to be successful as a student? And what are you hoping to get out of your education?

BEIJING – From outbreak to lockdown and reopening, the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the novel coronavirus emerged late last year, has been through all stages of dealing with the health crisis. Specific characteristics allowed Wuhan to impose some of the tightest restrictions in the world on its 11 million residents until the outbreak was under control. This interactive graphic takes you through how’s it’s currently working to lift those restrictions.  Much of the city, the capital of Hubei province, is organized in residential compounds of apartment blocks, outdoor spaces, convenience stores and other basic services. The compounds are often walled off from the street and gated. People were restricted to their compounds from Jan. 23 when Wuhan went into a lockdown that lasted 76 days. Extensive surveillance infrastructure and strict housing registration rules already in place helped to facilitate the implementation of the restrictions and the easing of them later. Now, Wuhan residents live and move under the auspices of colored QR codes embedded in WeChat and Alipay smartphone apps that use automatically-collected travel and medical data. A green rating allows for unrestricted movement in and out of residential compounds and public areas, while orange and red signify a quarantine for seven and 14 days respectively.

Hong Kong’s Legislative Council passed a law banning residents from dissing China’s national anthem — a bill that sparked confrontations between rival lawmakers that turned physical, Bloomberg reported Thursday. Pro-democracy lawmakers and activists opposed the law as part of the mainland’s Communist government to thwart dissent following violent protests in the territory over a feared loss of liberty. The law will go into effect June 12, Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Erick Tsang said. “We’ve reiterated that we hope the public respects the national anthem, which is the symbol and sign of our country,” Tsang said, speaking after the law had passed, according to the news service. “Critics have said that this is an evil law that would suppress freedom of speech. That’s not true. If you do not publicly and deliberately insult the national anthem, you don’t have to worry that you’re breaking the law.” The harsh new law carries a prison sentence of up to three years for people convicted of insulting the anthem or singing it in a “distorted or derogatory” manner, either online or in public — even at a sporting event. The legislation prompted demonstrations in last month, and comes as China seeks to enact new national security legislation on the former British colony. Chief Executive Carrie Lam had pushed ahead with the anthem bill despite the opposition, saying in May that it would get priority in the legislature. At sports events in the semi-autonomous city, residents often boo the Chinese national anthem, “March of the Volunteers,” and protesters last year came up with their own anthem, “Glory to Hong Kong.” The passage of the bill came on the June 4 anniversary of China’s 1989 crackdown on activists in Tiananmen Square, a milestone that is usually marked by protests in Hong Kong. But Hong Kong authorities barred the event this year, citing social distancing measures taken to combat the coronavirus pandemic. Authorities cited the need for social distancing amid the outbreak, despite the recent reopening of schools, beaches, bars and beauty parlors, Fox News reported. Hong Kong has had comparatively few cases of the virus and life has mostly returned to normal in the teeming city of 7.4 million. Hundreds or possibly thousands of people were killed when tanks and troops assaulted the center of Beijing on the night of June 3-4, 1989 to break up weeks of student-led protests authorities called a threat to authoritarian Communist Party rule. “We all know the Hong Kong government and the Chinese government really don’t want to see the candle lights in Victoria Park,” said Wu’er Kaixi, a former student leader who was No. 2 on the government’s most-wanted list following the crackdown, referring to the location of the commemoration for the past three decades. “The Chinese Communists want us all to forget about what happened 31 years ago. But it is the Chinese government themselves reminding the whole world that they are the same government which 31 years ago suppressed the peaceful demonstrators and in the last year, the same government doing the same in Hong Kong,” he told The Associated Press in Taiwan, where he lives. Other vigils, virtual and otherwise, are planned elsewhere, including in Taiwan, the self-ruled island democracy whose government has criticized Beijing for hiding the facts of the massacre. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian called the statement “complete nonsense.” “As to the political disturbance that occurred in the late 1980s, the Chinese government has had a clear conclusion. The great achievements that we have achieved … have fully demonstrated that the development path China has chosen is completely correct, which conforms to China’s national conditions and has won the sincere support of the Chinese people,” Zhao told reporters at a daily briefing. Meanwhile, police pepper-sprayed some Hong Kong protesters on Thursday who defied the ban to stage rallies. Scuffles broke out briefly in the working-class Mong Kok area where hundreds had gathered and some demonstrators tried to set up roadblocks with metal barriers, prompting officers to use spray to disperse them, according to Reuters witnesses. Several protesters were arrested, police said. Earlier, a few thousand people joined a peaceful main rally in Victoria Park, many wearing masks and chanting slogans such as “Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time” and “Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.” “We are just remembering those who died on June 4, the students who were killed. What have we done wrong? For 30 years we have come here peacefully and reasonably, once it’s over it’s ‘sayonara’,” said Kitty, a 70-year-old housewife. The ban on the vigils also comes as Chinese media and some Beijing officials voice support for protests in the US against police brutality, and as relations between the world’s two largest economies continue to sour.

As if the coronavirus pandemic wasn’t enough of a circus already. An enterprising Polish aerialist has managed to both pass the time and sharpen her skills during lockdown by practicing her gravity-defying feats at home in las Vegas. Since performers around the globe have been sidelined, with circuses canceling shows over COVID-19 concerns, Aleksandra Kiedrowicz has been posting her tricks on social media for her fans. In an impressive montage, the 25-year-old performs her high-flying routine using everything from cars to teacups. In one shot, the Season 8 winner of “Poland’s Got Talent” can be seen making herself a mug of coffee using only her feet while contorted on the counter in an awkward crab position. Another shows Kiedrowicz — known on social media as Flexy Alex — doing splits between a parked car and one driving in reverse, like the modern equivalent of the rack. Needless to say, the social-media masses have been applauding the acrobat’s impromptu displays. “I could watch this for days,” commented one fan on an Instagram video of Kiedrowicz busting out a spine-bending routine on top of a car. “Oh my goodness! I’d get sick!” said another of a clip of her spinning while dangling precariously from chains attached to her ceiling. This isn’t the entertainer’s first rodeo — er, circus. Kiedrowicz has strutted her stunts for places like Cirque Paris and Italy’s prestigious “Alis” show by Le Cirque: World’s Top Performers, according to her Facebook page. She also appeared on both “America’s Got Talent” and its British counterpart as half of a knife-throwing duo with her now-fiancé, Alfredo Silva, reports the Sun. Of course, Kiedrowicz’s isn’t the only entertaining work-from-home video out there. Dancer Conor McKenzie went viral in April after performing an elaborate runway show while wearing only a blanket.

PHILADELPHIA — Mayor Jim Kenney kicked off a recent briefing on Philadelphia’s coronavirus response with an unusual request for residents: Be careful what you flush. Between mid-March, when the city’s stay-at-home order was issued, and the end of April, most of the 19 sewer and storm water pumping stations in Philadelphia had experienced clogs from face masks, gloves and wipes residents had pitched into the potty, Kenney said. “Please do not flush any of these items down the toilet,” the mayor said. Officials in other US cities and rural communities — and the US Environmental Protection Agency — have issued similar pleas as wastewater plant operators report a surge of stopped-up pipes and damage to equipment. The problem has sharpened the longstanding clash over whether wipes are suitable for flushing. While drain clogs aren’t new, most of the more than 15 cities contacted by The Associated Press said they’ve become a more costly and time-consuming headache during the pandemic. Home-bound Americans are seeking alternatives to bathroom tissue because of occasional shortages while stepping up efforts to sanitize their dwellings and themselves. “When everyone rushed out to get toilet paper and there was none … people were using whatever they could,” said Pamela Mooring, spokeswoman for DC Water, the system in the nation’s capital. Sanitary sewer overflows jumped 33 percent between February and March in Houston because of clogs from rags, tissues, paper towels and wipes, said public works department spokeswoman Erin Jones. In Murfreesboro, Tennessee, crews are cleaning sewage pumping stations a couple of times a week that previously needed it once a month, said John Strickland, manager of the treatment facility. At Beale Air Force Base in Northern California, a squadron that usually deals with airfield maintenance and weaponry disposal has been yanking wipes from the base’s plumbing. “Our airmen are working 16-plus hours to unclog the pipe systems and that takes them out of the mission and puts a strain on the rest of the team,” Master Sgt. Destrey Robbins said in an article on the Beale website. By flushing the wrong things, people are taxing infrastructure that’s already deteriorating, said Darren Olson, vice chairman of the American Society of Civil Engineers’ Committee for America’s Infrastructure. “Your latex glove may not be the thing that causes a clog, but you are adding to the burden.” Hundreds of areas, like a portion of Philadelphia, have combined sewage and stormwater systems so sanitation officials say that means discarded masks and gloves that litter sidewalks and parking lots can also reach and help gum up treatment plants. Olson said masks and gloves thrown in the street can travel through storm drains in separate systems to lakes and other waterways. George Leonard, Ocean Conservancy’s chief scientist, said he’s concerned discarded personal protective equipment could wash out to sea and eventually add to “the plastics burden that the ocean is already suffering from.” Costs of clearing, cleaning and restarting equipment are mounting for utilities. To reduce the likelihood of clogs, WSSC Water — a wastewater utility that serves nearly 1.8 million customers in Prince George’s and Montgomery counties in Maryland — installed about 27 debris grinding pumps over the last decade at a cost of $1.5 million. “At one wastewater pumping station alone, one that does not have grinder pumps, we have seen an increase of 37,000 pounds of wipes during January–March 2020 compared with the same time period in 2019,” said utility spokeswoman Lyn Riggins. Michigan’s Macomb County spent $50,000 in 2018 removing a “fatberg” of debris, oils and grease that was 100 feet long and 11 feet wide, said Candice Miller, public works commissioner. The suburban Detroit community also spent millions to install screens that snag thousands of pounds of wipes weekly. Municipal officials say the solution’s simple: Put nothing in toilets but human waste and toilet paper. “Don’t be fooled by wipes packaging claims that these products are flushable,” DC Water said in a March advisory. “They are not.” The Association of the Nonwoven Fabrics Industry, which represents hundreds of companies including major wipes producers, agrees most wet wipes are unsuitable for toilet disposal and says they’re labeled as such. But one type is designed to perform the same functions as toilet paper and merits the “flushable” label, said Dave Rousse, president of the industry group. These cellulose wipes begin breaking down immediately and dissolve within hours, Rouse said. “These wipes are incapable of causing the kinds of problems that wastewater operators are accusing them of,” he said. Critics contend “flushable” wipes don’t biodegrade as manufacturers claim.  In Macomb County outside Detroit, maintenance workers are removing two tons of wipes per week from one pump station and officials say some clearly are the “flushable” variety. This month, the county sued wipe manufacturers, alleging voluntary flushability standards are based on testing that doesn’t reflect actual conditions in a sewer system. In March, Washington became the first state to adopt requirements for the size, placement and visibility of “Do Not Flush” warnings on wipes that manufacturers and local officials agree should not go down toilets. Similar legislation is under consideration in California. Meanwhile, many cities are using public education campaigns to make their case against flushing pandemic debris. The message may be getting through, says El Paso, Texas water utility spokesman Carlos Briano. Before the media blitz, emergency maintenance teams were dispatched about seven times a day to clear pipes. Now, it’s once a day. “It’s slowed, but it’s still not pre-pandemic,” Briano said.

Mayor Bill de Blasio on Thursday said that city restaurants will be able to temporarily create an influx of seating on sidewalks, in parking spaces and in open streets during Phase 2 of the Big Apple’s reopening from its coronavirus-induced shutdown when outdoor dining only will be allowed. “We will provide a massive expansion of curbside seating, a big expansion of open space,” de Blasio said during his daily City Hall press briefing, in explaining how the city will accommodate Big Apple eateries financially-ravaged by the coronavirus crisis. Outdoor dining at restaurants will be permitted in Phase 2 of reopening, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Wednesday — and de Blasio, who maintains that the city is still slated to enter Phase 1 on Monday, said Thursday that the Big Apple could move into Phase 2 “as early as the beginning of July.” However, under the state’s reopening schedule of two weeks per phase, the city should, if on track, hit Phase 2 by June 22. Under the city’s new “Open Restaurants” initiative, the de Blasio administration will make it easier for food joints to set up sidewalk seating and allow restaurants to convert adjacent parking spots into more seating. To use curbside seating =, restaurants must comply with guidelines that include: accessible seating, not blocking bus stops or fire hydrants and seating located away from intersections. And eateries must provide their own vertical barricades, planters, tables and chairs. For curbside seating, there will be a simple process for restaurants to register and self-certify online, according to the mayor’s office. Under the outdoor dining plan, restaurants will also be allowed to create seating areas directly in front of their establishments in the more than 45 miles of open streets across the city. The city is looking to identify new open streets on commercial strips with a high number of restaurants and bars as it continues to roll out more open roadways in the coming weeks and months as part of a goal to open up 100 miles of streets. “We’ll do what it takes to help this key part of life in New York City,” the mayor said, adding, “This is going to be another important step,” but that “health and safety” comes first. Big Apple restaurants must adhere to the state’s outdoor dining rules, which say that tables must be spaced six feet apart and all staff must wear face masks. Customers must also wear face coverings when not seated. “Monday, June 8, Phase 1 begins and we are resolute that we will continue this restart process,” Hizzoner said, noting, “We must have health and safety as the priorities in this restart.” Meanwhile, during a City Council Consumer Affairs committee hearing on legislation to expand outdoor dining Thursday, Department of Transportation Commissioner Polly Trottenberg discussed the possibility of restaurants using pedestrian plazas and parking lots for seating. She promised any application process will be simple and streamlined. In order to speed up the process, restaurants will not need approval recommendations from local community boards like they did in the past, she said. “We don’t want to be heavy-handed. Enforcement will be a light touch,” Trottenberg said. Trottenberg noted there will not be a “one-size fits all” approach to outdoor dining and there could be “whole block solutions” where all restaurants on a block agree to an outdoor dining plan. Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, there were 27,000 restaurants in the Big Apple with 42 percent in Manhattan, 24 percent in Brooklyn, 22 percent in Queens, 8 percent in The Bronx and 4 percent on Staten Island, according to Trottenberg.

China on Thursday said it will let American airlines resume flights to the mainland after the Trump administration moved to bar Chinese carriers from entering the US. Some 95 foreign airlines that are currently banned from flying to China will be allowed a single flight per week into one city starting Monday, the Civil Aviation Administration of China said. Airlines will be able to run two flights to China if they go three straight weeks without any passengers testing positive for COVID-19, Beijing regulators said. Their service will be suspended for a week if at least five passengers have the virus and for four weeks if at least 10 passengers test positive, according to officials. The move came a day after the US Department of Transportation said it would ban Chinese passenger carriers from flying in and out of the US in an effort to punish China for shutting American airlines out of the country. In late March, Chinese regulators told foreign airlines they could only run one flight a week based on schedules they were using on March 12. That effectively banned US carriers from entering the country because they had already halted flights to China by that date, according to the feds. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Beijing officials “deeply regret” Washington’s decision and that they would submit “stern representations” to their US counterparts. The Department of Transportation has said it would reconsider the looming ban if China changed its policies affecting American airlines. “We hope the US will not create obstacles for resolving this issue,” Zhao said at a news conference, according to a transcript the foreign ministry released. The airline spat comes amid growing tensions between the US and China over the Beijing’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic and its recent crackdown on Hong Kong’s autonomy. President Trump last week moved end the US’ special treatment for Hong Kong after China passed a national-security law targeting the territory. With Post wires

BARCELONA, Spain — For florist Laura Gómez and many other Barcelona residents, the COVID-19 pandemic has one silver lining, amid all the death and suffering. For the first time in decades, locals won’t feel outnumbered by the throngs of foreign visitors that flood Spain’s top tourist destination each summer. No one doubts that their absence will deepen Spain’s pandemic-induced economic slump, but those like Gómez who have avoided infection hope to enjoy at least a few weeks’ respite from mass tourism, which they believe is ruining their hometown. “Las Ramblas are ours again,” Gómez said, tending the flower stall her family has run for four generations in a prime location on that iconic Barcelona promenade. She reopened it last week after two months of lockdown due to the coronavirus outbreak that has killed more than 27,000 in Spain. Where caricature artists normally hawk their works and the incessant chatter of the flowing crowds masks all gentler sounds, you can now hear something unfamiliar: birdsong. “You can’t imagine how annoying it is” with tourists, Gómez said. “People asking you all day long where the cathedral is, where the beach is. I am not a tourist information office!” She still sells her dwindling number of local clients cut roses and sunflowers, bouquets, seed packets and potted geraniums, shunning the cacti in souvenir mugs that are a staple of other flower stalls. “Tourists only want to take a photo, why would they want to buy flowers?” said Gómez. “No one lives here anymore. Go to the outer neighborhoods and you see people in the street. Here the people couldn’t take it any more and left.” Some, however, miss the vibrancy they say tourists provide. “It is a pity to see Las Ramblas like this,” said José Montero, who works nearby and lunches daily at an outdoor restaurant on the street. “Las Ramblas needs life.” The city’s other top site, Antoni Gaudí’s La Sagrada Familia Basilica with its sandcastle-like spires, remains closed. Without the gawking multitudes, the only sign of life outside was an elderly man dozing on a bench. But whatever their feelings on tourism, Barcelona’s residents are about to feel the economic pain of living without a huge chunk of the 10 million foreigners who visit each year. Unlike Italy, which is opening up to foreign tourists, Spain is waiting until July to lift its 14-day quarantine on incoming travelers — despite pressure to restart its economy that relies on tourism for 12 percent of its activity. The national statistics office said on Monday that zero tourists arrived in April. A year earlier, 7 million tourists spent 7 billion euros ($7.8 billion) in Spain. While Europe considers how to safely resume continental travel during a pandemic, Spain’s government is encouraging Spaniards to vacation domestically. Catalonia’s separatist-led regional government has even launched a tourism campaign to attract people from elsewhere in Spain. Many business owners and workers, however, fear they may not make it without foreigner customers. Jesús Martín runs the Can Ramonet restaurant specializing in paella near Barcelona’s seaside. He is unsure whether he can cover his costs with local clients. “This place has been in my family for three generations, so staying open is about more than just money,” Martín said. “We depend on foreign tourists… I am not sure if we can get by with just Spaniards.” Barcelona became one of the world’s top destinations after using the 1992 Summer Olympics to showcase its Mediterranean climate and cuisine, mesmerizing architecture and liberal lifestyle. Visitors kept on coming, despite a terror attack on Las Ramblas in 2017 and rioting by Catalan separatists last year. The city of just 1.6 million people welcomed a record 11.9 million tourists in 2019, almost 10 million of them from abroad. But even though the sector provides Barcelona with 15 percent of its economic activity and 10 percent of its jobs, a growing number of citizens have soured on tourism. A survey of 3,600 residents by the city hall last year found that 61 percent felt Barcelona could not handle greater inflows. Graffiti saying “Tourists, go home” popped up, along with protests against short-term rental platforms like Airbnb which residents blame for driving up real estate prices and forcing locals to move out. Many complain about the replacement of family-run stores by global chains and the rowdy behavior of foreign youths lured by low-cost flights. “Barcelona has become a top destination for cheap, drunk partying. I’m all for partying, but I’m the first one to go out on my balcony and shout for people to be quiet,” said Mario, who did not share his last name because he works in the tourism sector. Mario was rollerblading along a beachfront free of rental bikes and Segways weaving around couples taking selfies. In place of sun-baked bodies luxuriating in the warm sun and gentle breeze, the sand was occupied by a handful of families who flouted a temporary prohibition on sunbathing and let their children frolic in the surf. “The beach has become wholesome and pure again,” Mario said. Rafaela Pérez and her husband considered the hiatus from the hubbub bittersweet as they lingered on the boardwalk. “It is glorious to have all this space for ourselves, but we know that it is not good for the economy,” the 63-year-old Pérez said. “We have neighbors who are having (financial) difficulties. And the worst is yet to come.”

STOCKHOLM – The Swedish government on Thursday urged its citizens to take their fight to the internet after thousands in the capital defied coronavirus restrictions to protest against racism and U.S. police violence. Demonstrators bearing signs like “Black Lives Matter” gathered for several hours at a square in the heart of Stockholm during Wednesday afternoon to show support for George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis who was killed by police. Pandemic-hit Sweden has a ban on public gatherings of more than 50 people. While COVID-19 deaths have slowed since the peak in early April, healthcare resources are still strained. Home Affairs Minister Mikael Damberg said it was a democratic right to protest but that the rules from the Health Agency must be respected. “I would urge anyone who wants to protest against racism to use digital media instead. Otherwise, many people risk getting sick and dying,” he said in a written comment to Reuters. More than 4,500 people have died in the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in Sweden, many times more relative to the size of the population than in neighboring Nordic countries. Floyd, who was unarmed, died after a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, and event that has set off the biggest anti-racism protests seen in the United States in decades.

I don’t care. What the owners make, what the players make. I hope for fairness. That no one is exploited. That transparency wins. I do think the players are the engine of the game, the product that fans spend money on. Thus whatever players receive you will never read in this space that they are greedy or undeserving. Still, when covering, say, Gerrit Cole’s negotiation if he received $10 million a year, fine; if he received $50 million a year, fine. Don’t care. In the current negotiations to restart the season, the advocates from both sides try to twist me to their view. And, in real time, both sound reasonable and right. If I must decide on a jump ball, I will do the best possible to figure out where I stand. But whether the advocates believe it or not — and most times I think they do not — I really don’t care how they split the money until it encroaches on what I do care about. The baseball. The history. The integrity. The continuity. MLB is talking about implementing a 50ish-game season that feels a slander to the league’s history, integrity and continuity. In a pandemic maybe you take what you get. But it is not the virus stopping owners and players from staging a more representative season. It is the money. When this is all forensically gone over in the future, I suspect we will discover that if the sides had been cooperative they already would have been in spring training for a few weeks now and been capable of playing a regular season that ends in September and was 100 or more games. MLB’s first offer of 82 games was going to invite asterisks. But at least it is half a season. Being in first place at roughly the traditional All-Star break feels relevant, if incomplete. Teams reach 50 games at about Memorial Day, normally the first pitstop to assess the season, not determine everything from ERA titles to championships. Maybe expanded playoffs would cover some shorter-season sins. But the 50ish game season with full prorated pay would be something forced upon the players. They would have to approve going from 10 to 14 postseason teams, and why would they do that moneymaking favor for the owners? MLB has had five teams (10 total) in each league make the playoffs each season since 2012. Seven times in those eight seasons a World Series participant was not in postseason position through Memorial Day, including the champion Nationals last year and both the AL-winning Tigers and champion Giants in 2012. Using June 30 for an approximation of when teams reach 82 games, five 2012-19 World Series participants still were not in one of the 10 playoff spots. But if the playoffs expanded to 14 clubs all World Series teams would make the playoffs except for last year’s Nationals, who would have had to compete in a play-in as they were tied for the final playoff spot, and the 2012 Tigers, who were just 38-40 though June 30. If the playoffs were kept to 10 teams, the numbers rise slightly with 57 of a possible 80 teams from 2012-2019 in postseason position through June 30, compared to 54 through Memorial Day. But there has to be more than just the data here. This sport just had to penalize the 2017 Astros and 2018 Red Sox for illegal sign stealing, throwing further doubt on the credibility of those champions. Again, 82-100 games would not be perfect. But a half season-plus of accomplishment is way meatier than one-third. Baseball is a game appreciated for its daily, serial journey. The endurance is part of the joy. And I believe, fans would have provided a lot of the needed credibility if MLB and its players were maneuvering together to play as many games as possible during a pandemic. Not playing when MLB could be a unifying force in time of racial strife, a monetary boon amid financial disaster (don’t forget how many subsidiary jobs in travel, hospitality, transportation, media, etc, benefit from the game) and a symbol that some form of normality will rise with all the sickness and death is so short-term, blinders-on stupid for both sides that they are not going to get any benefit of the doubt by playing less not more. Really, I don’t care how they split the money. But I do think more would be there than is projected. There are avenues in which some attendance returns and opportunities to do marketing deals with so little fresh entertainment content available from, say, Hollywood. There are expanded playoffs. The chance to get larger than prorated dollars from regional sports networks. But the sides are losing time to do that to the best use, which is starting by the Independence Day weekend and playing no fewer than 82 games. Already by fighting so publicly on this matter, MLB has hurt its reputation. Putting on a season shorter than it needs to be will do credibility damage that carries well beyond a schedule of any length.

Jesse McCartney paid tribute Wednesday to former Dream Street bandmate Chris Trousdale, who died Tuesday at the age of 34 after battling coronavirus. “It pains me to say that an old friend, Chris Trousdale, from my early days in the music industry has passed away due to complications from COVID-19,” McCartney, 33, penned on Instagram. “Chris had an explosively charming personality with boundless amounts of talent.” Trousdale joined Dream Street in 1999, teaming up with McCartney and fellow performers Greg Raposo, Matt Ballinger, and Frankie Galasso. Their self-titled album dropped in 2001 and featured the singles, “It Happens Every Time” and “I Say Yeah.” “We were young kids with budding talent who shared an overwhelming love for music and performing,” McCartney recalled. “Chris, in my opinion, was the most popular among us, who had a way of drawing every eye to what he was doing on stage. As an incredibly trained dancer, he would pick up an entire dance number in a matter of minutes; something that would take the rest of us days. I truly envied him as a performer.” McCartney also spoke about the bond he and Trousdale forged with their bandmates at the time. “We were a part of something people never get to experience in an entire lifetime at the tender ages of 12 and 14. Although we were a band for only 3 years, at that age, it felt like a lifetime and we built a real brotherhood,” he shared. Dream Street split up in 2002 amid legal troubles between the parents of the group’s members and the band’s creators. The singers went their separate ways, with McCartney finding success as a solo artist and an actor. He recently appeared on “The Masked Singer,” and is engaged to girlfriend Katie Peterson. “In later years, we would grow apart as our lives would take different turns, but I would often reflect on our early days together and think about how exciting it all was,” McCartney said. “My deepest sympathies go out to his mother whom I know cherished him dearly. RIP Chris. I’ll never forget your smile. #DreamStreet #ChrisTrousdale.” Trousdale went on to make guest appearances in the Disney Channel shows “Shake It Up” and “Austin & Ally.” In 2012, he appeared on NBC’s “The Voice,” but did not make it beyond the blind auditions. He previously collaborated with the girl group Play on the single, “I’m Gonna Make You Love Me,” and later worked with band member Anna Sundstrand on the 2009 duet “If Only.” She too posted a touching message about Trousdale on her Instagram story. “The first time I saw you on stage I was amazed and inspired by your talent,” Sundstrand, 31, wrote. “Together we danced, sang and became very good friends. R.I.P. my friend and thank you for all the good times.” Trousdale died Tuesday at a Burbank hospital due to coronavirus complications, TMZ reported Wednesday, citing a family member.

Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter joined San Dimas High School’s virtual graduation ceremony on Tuesday to deliver a totally bodacious message to the class of 2020. Reeves and Winter starred in the 1989 film “Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure,” which takes place in San Dimas, Calif., with Bill and Ted attending the high school. The cult classic centers on a history project Bill and Ted must complete for school, but their world is turned upside-down when they find a time machine and use it to interact firsthand with some of history’s biggest names. Before the graduating seniors’ names were read, Reeves and Winter appeared with a video message for the San Dimas students. Reeves sported a “Be Excellent to Each Other” t-shirt, referring to a quote from “Bill & Ted,” and the two introduced themselves as the “Wyld Stallyns,” the name of Bill and Ted’s band in the film. They then offered words of encouragement to the graduating class. “We know that it’s a tough time right now and you’re having to do this virtual graduation,” Winter said. “We want to wish you the best of luck moving forward.” “Congratulations to the graduating class of 2020. Well done,” Reeves added. Reeves and Winter couldn’t resist adding in a few more nods to “Bill & Ted.” “San Dimas High School football does rule,” Winter said, again referencing a famous line from the film. “But most importantly, we wanted to tell you to be excellent to each other.” Reeves then ended the video message with, “And party on!” Reeves and Winter both starred in the movie’s 1991 sequel, “Bill & Ted’s Bogus Journey” and started production for the third installment, “Bill & Ted Face the Music,” in June 2019.

Staten Island Amazon workers sued the company over its handling of the coronavirus crisis, saying lax workplace policies put them at risk of catching the deadly disease. The federal lawsuit aims to hold Amazon legally accountable for what workers say are insufficient efforts to protect them from the coronavirus, which has reportedly killed at least eight Amazon staffers and infected hundreds more. One of the plaintiffs, Barbara Chandler, contracted the virus in March at the JFK8 fulfillment center and brought it home to her family, the Wednesday complaint says. It eventually infected her cousin — whom Chandler found dead in the bathroom less than a month later — and her son, who’s also a plaintiff, according to the lawsuit. The complaint accuses Amazon of prioritizing productivity over safety at its JFK8 fulfillment center by failing to keep workstations clean, discouraging workers from washing their hands, and tacitly encouraging them to work while sick. Amazon has not disclosed how many warehouse workers have caught the coronavirus. But the complaint says the Staten Island facility has seen at least 44 confirmed cases and at least one death. Amazon also took weeks to pay Chandler only part of the “quarantine leave” that she was entitled to under New York law as a worker who contracted COVID-19, the suit says. “As New Yorkers consider a gradual return to normalcy, JFK8 workers and their families live with the very real threat of infection every day,” says the complaint, which seeks an order forcing Amazon to better protect workers from the virus. The other plaintiffs include two Amazon workers and their family members who worry they could catch the virus as a result of the warehouse’s working conditions, court papers say. Warehouse associate Derrick Palmer is suing along with his live-in girlfriend, Kendia Mesidor, who could only see her father once in the months leading up to his May death because she worried she could be carrying the coronavirus, the lawsuit says. “We want to protect our own health, but also peace of mind for our family members, and safety for the many communities in which JFK8 workers live,” Palmer said in a statement. In response to the suit, Amazon said it has followed guidance from state and local health authorities during the coronavirus pandemic and that it always complies with public health laws. The Seattle-based company has put $4 billion towards safety measures and other coronavirus-related initiatives from April to June, spokeswoman Rachael Lighty said. It also offered unlimited time away from work from early March to May 1 and leave for vulnerable staff since then, she said. “We are saddened by the tragic impact COVID-19 has had on communities across the globe, including on some Amazon team members and their family and friends,” Lighty said in a statement.

Doctors in Barcelona have reportedly been taking coronavirus patients the beach as part of their recovery process. Photos that were taken this week show doctors from Barcelona’s Hospital del Mar wheeling patients to the seaside, according to a report. The attempt to humanize its intensive care units comes as Spain has eased restrictions amid declining cases of the novel coronavirus. The lax approach is a stark contrast to just a few months ago when Spain ranked behind in Italy in Europe — and third overall in the world — for the highest number of coronavirus cases. At the peak of lockdown, people were prohibited from going outside to exercise, while children couldn’t leave their homes for any reason. Tuesday marked the second day in a row that Spain did not report a single coronavirus death in the previous 24 hours, the BBC reported. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Wednesday requested from parliament another extension to the state of emergency through June 21. “We have overcome the worst of the pandemic,” Sanchez said. As of Wednesday, Spain has reported 240,326 cases of the coronavirus with more than 27,120 deaths, according to the latest figures from Johns Hopkins University, which tallies global cases.

COPENHAGEN, Denmark — Authorities in Norway have turned down applications to hold rallies in the country’s three largest cities in support of protesters in the US over the death of George Floyd, citing the coronavirus restrictions on gatherings. Rallies were planned in Oslo, Bergen and Trondheim but local authorities said that without a dispensation from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, not more than 50 people can gather in one place, Mohamed Awil, president of the African Student Association UiO told The Associated Press. The association is co-organizing the rally in Oslo where more than 15,000 people had said they planned to take part in Thursday’s demonstration outside the US Embassy. Awil said they were considering an alternative demonstration but details were not immediately available. Similar events took place in the in the capitals of Sweden and Finland Wednesday. They attracted thousands of people even though the limit in Sweden is currently 50 and in Finland is 500.

That didn’t take long. Less than a week after resuming flights, Lion Air is suspending domestic and international flights until further notice. According to a statement from the airline, this decision was made after it was discovered that many passengers were either unable or unwilling to follow regulations to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. A statement on the airline’s website says that flights will be suspended starting June 5th. The statement also explains that travelers who already bought a ticket for after June 5th will be able to either receive a full refund or change the date without any additional charge. On its website, Lion Air posted a statement which explained, “Lion Air Group’s decision was based on considerations from an evaluation of previous flight operations, that many prospective passengers were unable to carry out air travel because they did not complete the required documents and conditions during the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic alert period.” Lion Air only recently resumed flying after halting operations due to the pandemic, the Jakarta Globe reports. According to the news outlet, a spokesperson for the airline, the largest in Indonesia, said, “many passengers had to cancel their trip because they could not show the required documents.” The Indonesian Transportation Ministry requires that travel is allowed under certain circumstances, but travelers must show documents stating that they are not infected with COVID-19. They must also show other documents proving that the reason for their travel fits one of the approved instances (business and family emergencies).

A Chinese doctor whose skin turned dark brown while he fought the coronavirus has died in a Wuhan hospital — more than four months after he was first infected, according to reports. Dr. Hu Weifeng, 42, went viral in April after photos were released showing his skin radically darkened as he was being treated for COVID-19, a condition put down to either liver damage or drugs he was prescribed. He died early Tuesday, according to Global Times — almost 20 weeks after he was diagnosed on Jan. 18. The urologist fell sick while treating coronavirus patients at Wuhan Central Hospital — the Chinese hospital where the pandemic was first identified. He appeared to be recovering, but suffered cerebral hemorrhages on April 22 and May 21, the report said. Hu is believed to be the sixth employee there to have died from COVID-19, Global Times said — including whistleblower Dr. Li Wenliang, who was allegedly silenced when he tried to alert the world to the new contagion. Other medical whistleblowers at Wuhan Central Hospital — including emergency unit director Ai Fen — have told Chinese media they were punished by authorities for speaking out, according to Agence France-Presse. Another colleague who also turned a dark color — Dr. Yi Fan, also 42 — was discharged from hospital on May 6, Global Times said.

An 8-year-old North Carolina girl has died after she got sick with coronavirus and suffered a seizure that left her in a coma, according to a report. Aurea Soto Morales, who was a second-grader at Creekside Elementary School, died Monday after she was hospitalized at UNC Hospital with severe complications from the virus, news station WNCN reported. The young girl, known as “Yoshi,” started feeling sick last week after both of her parents tested positive for the virus. “My sister and I started to get the COVID-19 symptoms,” her sister, Jennifer Morales, told the outlet. Morales said her sister suffered a seizure Friday and was rushed to the hospital, according to the report. “On Saturday, her brain started to swell up and she went into a coma,” Morales told the outlet. She ultimately succumbed to complications from the virus Monday — and now her family is urging parents to take the illness seriously. “Everyone associates it with old people, as they think they’re the only ones who are going to get it, but that’s not true. My sister got it,” Morales said. Jennifer Morales Jennifer Morales Jennifer Morales View Slideshow

The nation’s biggest mall operator is suing its largest tenant for not paying rent during the pandemic in what could be the beginning of a torrent of litigation over rent payments. Simon Property is suing the owner of Banana Republic, Old Navy and The Gap for $66 million in back rent and other charges related to its 412 stores in Simon malls, according to the complaint filed in Delaware State court on Tuesday. The Gap stopped paying rent on its stores in North America in April when it said in a public filing that its monthly lease obligations in the region represent $115 million per month. The apparel giant also acknowledged that it might not be able to negotiate rent deferrals or abatements and that “any dispute under these leases may result in litigation with the respective landlord,” according to Gap’s April 23 filing. Gap has already been sued in Manhattan for not paying rent for its store at 1212 Sixth Ave. and other locations in Orange County, Calif., according to The Real Deal, which first reported on the Simon complaint. “The bottom line is, we do have a contract and we do expect to get paid,” Simon CEO, David Simon said in a May earnings call in which he was referring to closed stores in the malls.

Nearly 1.9 million Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week as the coronavirus crisis put 42 million people out of work in less than three months, new data show. Thursday marked the first time since mid-March that US Department of Labor’s weekly figure fell below 2 million — a number that would have been unthinkable before the pandemic sparked an American employment crisis not seen since the Great Depression. “The states are opening up, but the job offers are turning down,” said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank. “We can’t keep getting weekly initial claims for unemployment benefits at this level and say the economy is A-OK.” The seasonally adjusted totals of initial jobless claims have steadily declined since peaking at 6.8 million in late March. But last week’s number was still nearly triple the 665,000 claims seen at the height of the Great Recession about a decade ago. Moreover, the number of people filing continued unemployment claims rose again after falling earlier in May, a troubling sign as states eased lockdown measures aimed at controlling the virus. There were 21.4 million continuing claims in the week ending May 23, up from 20.8 million the week prior, according to the seasonally adjusted data. “I think it generally signals that whatever reopening had occurred by right before Memorial Day had no meaningful impact on rehiring,” unemployment insurance expert Andrew Stettner told The Post. “People are still excited to get things going again but we’re not seeing it yet in these numbers.” States such as California, Texas and Oregon saw big upticks in continued claims that outweighed decreases in 37 states, noted Stettner, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation think tank. The number of people claiming Pandemic Unemployment Assistance — the federal benefit created for gig workers and others not usually eligible for regular benefits — also surged by nearly 3 million to about 10.7 million in the week ending May 16, the feds said, citing data from 35 states. New York saw the nation’s biggest decrease in initial claims last week as several regions began to emerge from coronavirus lockdowns, data show. The state recorded an unadjusted 82,981 filings, down from 189,087 the prior week, according to the feds. Economists were expecting the feds to report about 1.8 million new jobless filings ahead of Friday’s closely watched employment report for May. Experts predict it will show the unemployment rate at or near 20 percent given that job losses continued last month even as some parts of the country started reopening their economies. While the April report indicated most jobless Americans expected to be only temporarily out of work, the limits under which businesses will have to operate once they reopen may slow the pace of rehiring, according to Stettner. Friday’s report “will tell you the steep hole that we are facing,” Stettner told The Post. “If the virus stays contained this will be the bottom of the labor market, and it will show you the depth of getting up from it.” With Post wires

Luxury giant LVMH is examining the coronavirus pandemic’s impact on its $16.2 billion takeover of Tiffany amid reports that it wants to renegotiate the deal. The Paris-based conglomerate’s board of directors discussed this week how the virus crisis could affect Tiffany’s “results and perspectives” in relation to the companies’ November acquisition deal, LVMH said Thursday. The Louis Vuitton owner also sought to quash rumors that it’s considering buying Tiffany stock on the open market, where the storied New York jeweler’s share price plunged as the coronavirus hammered retailers worldwide. Tiffany shares closed Wednesday at $114.24, roughly 15 percent below the $135 per share that LVMH agreed to pay. “Considering the recent market rumors, LVMH confirms, on this occasion, that it is not considering buying Tiffany shares on the market,” the company said in a statement. LVMH agreed to buy Tiffany months before the coronavirus upended the retail industry by forcing stores to close around the world. Tiffany’s shareholders approved the deal in early February, just weeks before the virus tanked global stock markets. LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault has been looking for ways to pressure Tiffany into lowering the per-share price of the takeover amid the pandemic, Reuters reported Wednesday. But Tiffany reportedly isn’t convinced that there’s a legal basis for reopening the talks as it’s followed the financial covenants laid out in the deal. LVMH — whose portfolio includes other posh brands, such as Fendi, Givenchy and Dom Perignon — also said it would not buy Tiffany shares on the open market in March, when Bloomberg News reported that the company raised the idea with Tiffany’s board. Tiffany did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday morning.

George Floyd had tested positive for the coronavirus in April, though it was not a factor in his death, his full autopsy has revealed. Floyd was likely no longer symptomatic when four Minneapolis police officers killed him during an arrest on Monday, according to Dr. Andrew Baker, the chief medical examiner at Hennepin County. “Since … positivity for [COVID-19] can persist for weeks after the onset and resolution of clinical disease, the autopsy result most likely reflects asymptomatic but persistent … positivity from previous infection,” Baker wrote in the report, which was released Wednesday with the permission of Floyd family. The full 20-page report maintains that Floyd’s death was a homicide — that he died when his heart stopped while Officer Derek Chauvin compressed his neck in the widely viewed video of his arrest. Floyd’s family had conducted an independent autopsy that was released this week and ruled differently — that Floyd’s homicide was caused by asphyxia from both neck and back compression due to the weight of fellow Officer Thomas Lane pressing on his abdomen. Chauvin, Lane and the two other officers who assisted in the arrest, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao, have all been fired and charged with felonies. The medical examiner’s office’s findings included “other significant conditions” of Floyd’s: heart disease, fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine — details released in the initial report that angered Floyd’s family attorney, Benjamin Crump. Crump said Tuesday the inclusion of those conditions, which were not ruled to be a factor in his death in either autopsy, was an attempt to assassinate Floyd’s character ahead of the officers’ trials. Along with the positive COVID-19 test, the full autopsy detailed that Floyd had suffered blunt-force injuries to his face, shoulders, hands, arms and legs; bruises on his wrists from handcuffs; and a broken rib during cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

New York City businesses have likely suffered tens of millions of dollars in damages and theft as a result of the rampant open looting and vandalism that exploded in the Big Apple over the last few nights – and some may never recover, experts told The Post Wednesday. “I think it’s pretty safe to say it’s going to be in the tens of millions of dollars,” Nicole Gelinas, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, said of the financial and physical destruction to businesses citywide. That estimate includes the expense of repairs as well as other facets like increased security and insurance costs, Gelinas explained, adding that the pilfered merchandise likely accounts for “several million dollars.” Over the past three nights since Sunday, looters and vandals taking advantage of the mass protests in the Big Apple over the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd have plunged swaths of the city into chaos, hitting hard Midtown Manhattan, SoHo and parts of The Bronx. Gelinas estimated there were likely “hundreds, if not thousands” of storefront windows smashed during the wild looting sprees around the five boroughs. “These are pretty custom-made, specialized glass,” said Gelinas, noting that merchants also have to buy lumber to board up the bashed-in windows in the meantime. “You put it all together, it’s certainly not incidental,” she said. “It’ll be a big cost to the retail industry’s recovery.” Mark Dicus, the executive director of the SoHo Broadway Initiative business improvement district, said that 37 retail stores along Broadway from Houston to Canal streets and some surrounding streets suffered damaged storefronts during the mayhem. Seth Gottfried Seth Gottfried William Farrington William Farrington William Farrington William Farrington William Farrington William Farrington William C. Lopez Richard Harbus Richard Harbus Richard Harbus View Slideshow There was “extensive damage” to shops on Prince, Spring, Grand, Mercer, Greene streets, said Dicus who added, at least 80 percent of retail businesses in the area are “now boarded up.” Nineteen area stores had goods stolen least once and some more than that including, The North Face, Shops of SoHo, Lulu Lemon, Bloomingdale’s, Foot Locker, Verizon, Broadway Market, Duane Reade, Zara, H&M, Prada, American Eagle, Timberland, and Balenciaga, according to Dicus. Brazen looters also raided stores in Midtown, including Macy’s flagship on Herald Square, a Sephora, a Nintendo store and a Microsoft. In The Bronx, crooks broke into pharmacies, banks and other small businesses along Fordham Road and Burnside Avenue. Jonathan Bowles, the executive director of the Manhattan-based public policy think tank Center for an Urban Future, predicted that some merchants already grappling with staggering financial losses from the city’s coronavirus-induced shutdown could close up shop for good given the costs of repairing the destruction caused by looters. “For some that are already struggling to reopen or considering whether it’s financially feasible, this could be a factor in their decision,” said Bowles. The risk of shutting down permanently is even higher for small businesses, he said. “The chances are they’ve got less of a cushion to fall back on, and many of them are already financially weak from the pandemic,” Bowles said. Gelinas expressed a counterpoint that chain stores “may have a harder time.” “A lot of chains were already struggling before this,” she said. “They had too much debt. They probably over-expanded compared to what happened with competition from online shopping, paying very high rent in major retail corridors.” Still, if the city can get the looting situation “under control in the next day or two, there may not be any problem at all,” according to Bowles. “We may entirely bounce back,” he said. “This doesn’t have to be a sign of what’s to come.

Urban beat: Pandemic and Pandemonium “The rage ignited by the death of George Floyd is symptomatic of a profound sense of alienation that has been building for years” and was “worsened” by the coronavirus crisis, Joel Kotkin argues at Quillette. COVID-19 and progressive city governments’ response to it have “devasted poorer communities,” creating “urban malaise.” Hence the return of a “riot ideology,” in which “radical activists” — and even some more mainstream left-wing politicians — applaud “random looting and even killings” as “part of a glorious ‘rebellion’ or uprising.” In response, our cities need a “laser-like focus on economic opportunity” to “repair the social safety net broken by COVID-19” and “promote self-sufficiency and not dependency.” The alternative is “watching them burn when minority and working-class resentment inevitably erupts.” Culture critic: The Unforgivable Sin Treating whiteness as an “original sin, an inherited moral defect one must atone for” has “gone uber-mainstream” since George Floyd’s “brutal execution,” Spiked’s Brendan O’Neill sighs. But such “collective guilt on the basis of racial origin” is “wicked” — and, ironically, racist. It also distracts us from “the real problems facing the US,” including the “police brutality” and “structural disarray” that resulted in Floyd’s death. That’s why “corporate America and the new political elites” have embraced “the woke ideology of pathologized whiteness”: It “takes the heat off the powers-that-be.” Science desk: Politicized Meds in the Trump Era With President Trump having taken hydroxychloroquine to guard against the coronavirus, his “critics in the press seem to be on a mission to discredit the therapy,” The Wall Street Journal’s Allysia Finley observes. And “a prestigious medical journal may be joining in.” A study by The Lancet found a 30 percent “increased risk of death for hospitalized COVID-19 patients” treated with that drug or a related one. But “some 120 doctors, statisticians and epidemiologists” write in an open letter that they have “both methodological and data integrity concerns.” For instance, “more deaths were reported from five Australian hospitals collectively than had occurred in the entire country during the study period,” and the average reported dose of the drug “was 100 milligrams higher than FDA guidelines.” With headlines such as “Study says drug hailed by Trump is harmful,” experts worry trials of what could be a life-saving treatment won’t go ahead as planned. From the right: How Urban ‘Forests’ Die Elites “excusing the destruction of our cities” have clearly “never built a business themselves,” bemoans National Review’s David Harsanyi, whose parents “would never see a penny for the years of preparation, exertion and sacrifice” after thieves looted their business. Alas, many American small-business owners may “end up in similar circumstances” because of our elected officials’ unwillingness to stop “criminals and cosplay revolutionaries.” The worst example: Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who said, “Yes, America is burning, but that’s how forests grow,” even as rioters and arsonists are “destroying poor and minority neighborhoods.” Small businesses in those neighborhoods may never recover, and even big stores may leave for good when they start “paying higher insurance rates.” The forest, in fact, “doesn’t always grow back.” Lockdown watch: Dems Push Cuomo To Reopen “Withering before our eyes is the pulse that once made New York great,” Democratic Assemblyman Simcha Eichenstein and City Councilman Kalman Yeger write in a letter urging Gov. Andrew Cuomo to reopen the state. “Three months of difficult lockdown” came “at immeasurable cost.” “Unemployment is at record highs,” “children’s skills and knowledge are regressing at unknowable rates” and “unrest is growing at exponential levels.” Business owners “are aware of the need to be safe, even while going about their business.” And let’s face it: “The calls for mass peaceful marching without any regard for social-distancing have rendered a continued lockdown at this point ludicrous.” It’s time to heal: “New Yorkers are unemployed, broke, anxious and emotionally drained. We need an infusion of hope, a burst of energy, a restoration of normalcy.” And the only thing that can bring it is an immediate, “unmitigated reopening.” — Compiled by Karl Salzmann & Kelly Jane Torrance 

Researchers out of Bar-Ilan University in Tel Aviv have discovered disinfectant technology that is now being used for a sanitation tunnel, which sprays visitors with disinfecting liquid before they enter large venues to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The industrial automation firm RD Pack in Karmiel, Israel, took the process that makes a disinfectant out of water and applied it to a tunnel structure, according to The Times of Isreal. The tunnel is reportedly made out of an aluminum and polycarbonate frame and is currently being tested at Bloomfield Stadium in Tel Aviv as soccer players prepare to return to stadium play, albeit without fans. “When people walk through the tunnel, their whole body gets sprayed with the disinfectant, which works fast and efficiently, and provides the complete sterilization of a person,” Eran Druker, business development manager at RD Pack, told The Times of Isreal during a demonstration on Tuesday. The method was developed by Dr. Eran Avraham, Dr. Izaak Cohen and professor Doron Aurbach, head of the electrochemistry group of the Department of Chemistry and Institute of Nanotechnology and Advanced Materials at Bar-Ilan. The main advantage of the disinfectant, hypochlorous acid, is that it is not harmful to human skin or food, Avraham told The Times of Israel. The tunnel would mostly be used for other public and private events such as stadiums games, concerts, airports, schools and businesses. Druker said the team is waiting for the conclusion of the pilot program so regulators can inspect the tunnel before the process moves ahead. As of Tuesday evening, the coronavirus pandemic has infected more than 6 million people worldwide and killed nearly 380,000 people, according to Johns Hopkins University.

The coronavirus isn’t mutating to become more dangerous, the World Health Organization said Wednesday. Scientists around the world studying the virus have not found it to be mutating in a way that could pose a new threat, as some health officials feared early on, WHO infectious disease epidemiologist Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove said at a briefing. “There are normal changes in this virus that one would expect over time,” she said, referring to the ways in which RNA viruses like the flu and the coronavirus mutate. “None of these changes so far indicate that the virus itself is changing in terms of its ability to transmit or to cause more severe disease.” But COVID-19 is continuing to devastate the world, with outbreaks now moving to poorer nations like Mexico and Brazil after ravaging wealthier countries like Italy and the United States. Van Kerkhove said lockdown fatigue and a relaxing of social hygiene could still pose a significant threat, warning that the pandemic is “far from over.” “People grow tired. It’s very difficult to keep up all of these measures and we must remain strong and vigilant — to have government fully engaged and people fully engaged as these lockdowns are listed,” she added. “That has to be done in a slow way.” Van Kerkove warned that outbreaks could force the return of unpleasant and economically damaging lockdowns. “In some situations, these measures, these public health and social measures, may need to be reintroduced again and that may frustrate people, which is completely understandable,” she went on. “And that in a sense could make the virus more dangerous because people become complacent.” In the US, the nationwide protests around the death of George Floyd have upended social distancing measures, with massive crowds gathering in cities. While the protests have brought fears of a spike in COVID-19 cases within the coming weeks, Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday delivered a sunny forecast for the virus in New York, saying outdoor dining could return to the city by late June during a Phase 2 of reopening.

The coronavirus pandemic has exponentially exacerbated screen addiction, easily preying on already tech-dependent populations suddenly out of work, locked in their homes and attempting to follow the breakneck news cycle. For many, just the idea of using smartphones less — let alone taking a break from all technology while still in quarantine — is distressing. But these folks took a tech-free meditation “retreat” right at home — and loved it. “I had not been away from my computer for over two years; to pull myself away from all that, it gave me tons of anxiety,” says retreat participant Franz Aliquo. But much to the experiential event director and artist’s surprise, he found that the three days he spent off the grid in his Queens apartment flew by. “By the end of it I was like, ‘Holy s - - t, that went so quickly,’ ” he says. The retreat was originally planned as an eight-day silent meditation at Joshua Tree National Park in California, a midway “immersion” in the 3½-month online Alchemical Leadership program. “We were going to go to the desert for this,” program leader Larissa Conte tells The Post of the April excursion. Unable to safely travel or meet in-person, she reworked that portion of the program to be an at-home “quest.” The eight participants range in age from their mid-30s to late-50s and live across America, with one Amsterdam-based individual. They planned solo retreats in a four-day window during which they intended to spend from 10 hours to the full period near home but without technology. Aliquo spent his retreat going on long, aimless walks with his Shiba Inu, taking bubble baths, reading and making dishes from old hand-written recipe books. The only human interaction he had was some four words he exchanged with his roommate, and he abandoned his bed to live out of a comforter “nest” he created in his apartment hallway. “It was like camping inside my house, 10 feet from where I usually sleep,” he says. While he admits the experience was “the weirdest s - - t and less comfortable,” the combination of removing tech and waking up in a space simultaneously familiar and unfamiliar was profoundly powerful, giving him the feeling of “openness and relaxation you get from traveling.” “I thought that three days in that little area, not doing anything, was going to take forever and I would be dead,” he says. “But I really don’t know what the f - - k happened to the time, and it’s not like I was sleeping 12 hours a day.” One Maine-based participant held an all-night fire in his yard while his wife and two daughters slept in the house. “For my quest, I spent two days alone in nature fasting on water from dawn until dusk,” says creative strategist Lily Betjeman, of San Francisco. After spending two days at home with her digital devices turned off, which she describes as “a feat in and of itself,” Jennifer Conti-Davies went on a 13-mile solo hike through a local preserve. “That was the first time I spent an entire day in nature alone,” she says. “It’s an incredible gift to slow down and listen.” For her own retreat, Conte sheltered in her San Francisco apartment, went on walks through her Eureka Valley neighborhood, gardened and rested. In reflecting on their experiences, she says, participants reported varying levels of difficulty with being tech-abstinent, but everyone said it ultimately gave them a feeling of massive relief. Aliquo says he’s also found himself using tech less since giving it up for a weekend. Conte is not surprised, and despite the immensity of foregoing technology in 2020, she did not worry she was putting the group in danger with the activity. “I’ve been guiding for over a decade. People can encounter wildlife, they can find scorpions, rattlesnakes — just having their phone in the off position? Not that big of a deal,” she says. Being forced to stay in place was, in this instance, a surprise blessing, she says. “So often people go on retreats far away from their home. There’s a magic in traveling because we assume beginners’ eyes when we travel,” she says. For her, the coronavirus has been a good excuse to try and find that magic at home. “Creating spaces to completely unplug and shift the way we view life —  especially at a time when the mystery is so loud and we don’t know what the future holds — lets us more consciously navigate our moment to moment.”

SYDNEY – Learning Australian bush survival skills is becoming popular as city folk turn to nature with the easing of the coronavirus lockdown, organizers of a course outside Sydney said. The Bushcraft course teaches basic survival skills like foraging for food and water, and also offers insight into traditional indigenous cultures. The course filled up soon after the lockdown began to be eased late last month, and there is a lot of demand, the organizers said. “A lot of people come to learn self discipline. How to organise themselves and organise themselves in a natural environment,” said instructor Gordon Dedman at Bushcraft Survival Australia, who is a former army commando. “The more knowledge you have… it actually gives you a sense of confidence and then you can make better informed decisions.” Course participants learn how to erect a shelter, build a fire, solar and celestial navigation, forage for edible plants, some within a timed environment designed to emulate the stress of a real survival situation. “They’ve got a timed period to make a fire using the procedure that we’ve given them because it makes it efficient. They may have to light a fire to signal for help, to boil water to give to a person that’s suffering from hypothermia,” Dedman said. “The other thing is that the timed deliverables gives an element of stress and in a survival situation you’re going to be very, very stressed.” The interest in the course comes as Australia loosens its lockdown laws after months of restrictions that saw runs on supermarket staples, and many Sydney dwellers cooped up at home. Now beaches are reopening and pubs in Sydney are allowed to accept ten patrons for meals. “I’ve been caught up with that supermarket mayhem. I didn’t realise how entrenched I was in that,” course participant George Hamza said. Hamza is one of 11 participants taking part in a three-day intermediate course near Ku-ring-gai National Park, Ingleside, north of Sydney. “Coming out here and spending a few days here and removing myself from that, I’m feeling like I’m detoxing a little from that sphere of the world,” he said.

“Saturday Night Live” cast member Chris Redd has launched a fundraiser to provide COVID-19 testing and treatment for those participating in protests over the death of George Floyd. Redd announced the GoFundMe campaign on Twitter. “COVID19 protest relief is live!! Give if you can, share if it’s in your heart!! #BlackLivesMatter and more to come!!,” Redd tweeted. “As thousands of people take to the streets to protest racial discrimination and the many Black Lives lost at the hands of injustice, we also have the unfortunate fact that this deadly pandemic is still upon us,” Redd wrote in the GoFundMe campaign description. “The lives at risk of the injustice being fought against are also the most vulnerable to COVID-19. Many will not be in position to pay the inevitable cost associated with their brave efforts,” he added. “This fund is to assist those that contract this disease while protesting and other protest-related injuries as many are being attacked while speaking out.” The fund also will provide support for treatment/hospital bills as related to COVID-19, injuries obtained while protesting, bail relief and court expenses for protesters. The fund so far has raised $125,240 of its $250,000 goal.

At the peak of the coronavirus pandemic, all four New York University hospitals in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Long Island were filled to the brim with infected patients. Over the course of the pandemic, the hospital system added 189 beds in their two Manhattan hospitals alone. Dr. Fritz Francois, chief medical officer at NYU Langone Health, spoke with Fox News about the plan their hospitals have in place in preparation for a second wave of coronavirus. He says they are following the seven T’s to keep their workers and patients safe: Tools, Testing, Teams, Triage, Treatments, Trials and Throughput. “I can’t emphasize enough how important it is for us to do research and publish what it is that we find, as opposed to just doing things anecdotally,” Francois told Fox News. “And we now know so much more about it [coronavirus] than we did before.” Stocking up on the tools they need, like personal protective equipment (PPE), is one of the many ways Francois is keeping his staff safe. He’s also relying on testing to ensure his patients stay safe too. Every incoming patient regardless of symptoms is getting tested for COVID-19. Knowledge is power and the more you know about a patient the better you can treat them, Francois said. “[We developed] specialty teams to deliver types of care that other institutions don’t have, such as an ECMO team or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, [which] was a dedicated team,” said Francois, who is also a patient safety officer at NYU Langone Health. From how many times a nurse can go into a room to how they clean equipment, triage processes got a total overhaul because of the virus. “We developed ways in which we can have some of the equipment outside of the room so that minimizes the need to go into a room multiple times,” Francois said. NYU is doing a number of trials to see what fights coronavirus best. The trials include treatments like convalescent plasma and stem cell therapy. “[Throughput] is in terms of how do we ensure that patients can safely transition [back home or to a rehab center] when they [beat the virus],” Francois said. With this in mind, Francois believes that if there is a second wave they will be more than prepared to battle it. “We’re not in the same position, we know so much more, we’re better prepared — and that really is going to make all the difference in the world.”

The World Health Organization and several world governments have changed their coronavirus policies and resumed trials of hydroxychloroquine because they got questionable data from a small US healthcare company — with a science fiction writer and an adult content model on staff. The company, Surgisphere, whose employees include an unidentified sci-fi author and adult model doubling as a sales director, has produced data on multiple studies on COVID-19 co-authored by its chief executive — but has refused to adequately explain its data or methodology, The Guardian reported Wednesday. Data the Chicago-based company claims to have obtained from more than a thousand hospitals worldwide formed the basis of scientific articles that led to changes in coronavirus treatment policies in several countries. The company, formed by Dr. Sapan Desai, a vascular surgeon in Springfield, Illinois, also influenced the decision by the WHO and other research facilities to halt trials of hydroxychloroquine, which President Trump has touted and took as a precaution against coronavirus. The WHO announced Wednesday that those trials of the anti-malarial drug would now resume. Two top medical journals – the Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine – published studies based on Surgisphere data that raised concerns about potentially fatal side effects from hydroxychloroquine, reports that prompted researchers to abandon trials.  The Lancet on Tuesday released an “expression of concern” about its published study after inquiries from the UK news organization, and the New England Journal of Medicine offered a similar message. An independent audit of the data has been commissioned by the authors not affiliated with Surgisphere because of “concerns that have been raised about the reliability of the database,” The Journal said. The Guardian’s investigation revealed that a search of public records found that several of Surgisphere’s employees had little if any data or science background. The paper also found that one employee listed as a science editor was apparently a science fiction author and fantasy artist, while another listed as a marketing executive was an adult model and events hostess. The company’s LinkedIn page has fewer than 100 followers and last week listed just six employees — a number that was changed to three employees on Wednesday. While Surgisphere claimed to run one of the biggest and fastest hospital databases in the world, it has a lame online presence, with fewer than 400 followers on Twitter as of Wednesday afternoon. At a press conference Wednesday, the WHO announced it would now resume its global trial of hydroxychloroquine, after it determined there was no increased risk of death for Covid patients taking it. Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that all parts of the so-called Solidarity trial, which is investigating potential drug treatments, will go ahead. “On the basis of the available mortality data, the members of the committee recommended that there are no reasons to modify the trial protocol,” said Tedros. “The executive group received this recommendation and endorsed continuation of all arms of the Solidarity Trial, including hydroxychloroquine.” Last month, the Lancet published a study that found that hydroxychloroquine was linked with a higher mortality rate in Covid-19 patients and increased heart problems. The study, which listed Desai as one of the co-authors, claimed to have analyzed Surgisphere data collected from nearly 15,000 patients with COVID-19, admitted to 1,200 hospitals around the world, who received hydroxychloroquine itself as well as in combination with antibiotics. The negative findings made global news and prompted the WHO to halt the hydroxychloroquine arm of its global trials. But many of the hospitals that supposedly took part in the study questioned the data, which was contradicted by reports from Johns Hopkins University, which tracks worldwide cases. The Guardian reached out to other hospitals who also contradicted the study’s data. Desai did not immediately return a request for comment from The Post.

A Pennsylvania man arrested during a violent protest over the death of George Floyd says he has the coronavirus — and officials now worry he may have sparked an outbreak of the disease. Julio V. Torres disclosed that he was COVID-positive during his arraignment Tuesday on charges of aggravated assault, rioting and resisting arrest, Lancaster Online reported. The 22-year-old had been told to self-quarantine, but still went to a 250-person demonstration in Lancaster on Monday evening — and didn’t wear a mask or social distance. “[He] has placed other people at risk — both the public who were peacefully participating in the protest and law enforcement,” said Lancaster County President Judge David Ashworth, while releasing the information to the press. “I know of no other way to get the word out,” the judge said. Police said they haven’t confirmed that Torres tested positive, but he told a district judge and prison staff of his diagnosis. “If it’s all made up on his part, then it is. All we can do is act on his word. He has told a number of officials now that he is positive,” Ashworth said. Charging documents allege that during the protest in front of a police station, Torres threw “objects which could cause bodily harm at police officers” and spoke to others in the crowd “appearing to be directing their action.” He’s also accused of hurling a barricade into the middle of the street. “These actions taken by Torres were done with the intent to prevent or coerce official action and then with the intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm,” the documents state. He was being held in Lancaster County Prison after being unable to post 10 percent of his $25,000 bail, court records show. Lancaster Mayor Danene Sorace told the outlet on Tuesday that she was “very worried about an outbreak following days of demonstrations.” She said the state Department of Health has said contact tracing is ineffective if people were exposed at large gatherings. But she was monitoring any uptick in cases over the next two weeks. “While it has been shown that young people seem less susceptible to severe symptoms, I worry about others they come into close contact with, especially their families,” Sorace said. “Wear a mask. Self-isolate. Get tested if you have symptoms.”

A Mexican lawmaker accidentally showed up topless in a government Zoom meeting — but later insisted she was “not ashamed” of having shown her body. Senator Martha Lucía Mícher Camarena, 66, said she had no idea she was still on camera when she stripped off to get changed during last Thursday’s meeting about the economy — only realizing when colleagues alerted her. She later apologized to everyone watching — including members of the media — saying she realized that she accidentally broke the expected standards of conduct, and blaming her lack of understanding of new technology. The senator for Guanajuato refused, however, to be ashamed of having been so openly exposed. “I am Malu Mícher, and I am not ashamed to have shown by accident a part of my intimacy,” Camarena wrote on Twitter, declaring herself a proud feminist. “I am a woman of 66 years of age who has breastfed four children, three of whom are today professional and responsible men, and I feel proud of my body for having nourished them,” she continued. “I am a woman who is not ashamed of her body, which I love and care for.” CEN CEN CEN View Slideshow Many of her colleagues spoke in support of the politician, instead attacking those who spread the images. Fellow Senator Ricardo Monreal Avila called her an “exemplary woman,” saying, “Morals and integrity will always be stronger than infamies and attacks.” She was not the first to have fallen foul of the coronavirus-era reliance on video meetings. In Brazil, a leading judge was caught shirtless in a Zoom hearing. And even in New York, the city’s hospitals chief, Dr. Mitchell Katz, was caught changing his shirt as reporters waited for a virtual press conference to begin.

Halima Aden wants to help those who wear hijabs and turbans protect themselves during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Somali-American model, 22, has teamed up with mask-making startup Anywear and Allure magazine to create a capsule collection of simple hijabs and turbans that are compatible with face coverings to protect from coronavirus. Each hijab set costs $45, while a pack of three masks is $40 and a turban set retails for $52. All products are made from 100 percent organic cotton and come with built-in buttons and extenders to ensure that the masks stay attached to the hair coverings. For every purchase, Anywear will donate a medical hat with buttons to a healthcare professional. “As many hijab-wearing women are working at health care facilities, I wanted to make sure they have a comfortable option for wearing a mask while keeping their hair covered,” Aden, who was the first hijab-wearing woman to appear in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, wrote on the company’s website. “It can also get hot running around at the pace health care employees are right now, so a breathable fabric was a must.” As for the pastel color palette, Halima added, “I really wanted the pieces to give a feeling of tranquility and calm, so I went with soft shades that bring a feeling of peace.”

Chris Trousdale, a former member of short-lived boy band Dream Street, has died following a battle with COVID-19. He was 34. TMZ, who is reporting the news, says Trousdale died Tuesday in a hospital in Burbank, Calif., of complications from the coronavirus, according to a family member. “Chris left this earth at 8:44 pm yesterday after a horrible battle with [an] acute strep infection that shut down his body,” says a comment on his Instagram left by a woman named Jane Gagle, who works at the Pacific Ballet Dance Theatre, which Trousdale worked with. “Chris was in a coma, on life support when he passed.” Trousdale joined Dream Street, which also counted Jesse McCartney among its members, in 1999. Formed by producers Louis Baldonieri and Brian Lukow with the intent of capitalizing on teenybopper pop’s grip on the mainstream, the group, despite all being underage, were already veterans of the NYC acting and Broadway scenes. Their songs “It Happens Every Time” and “I Say Yeah” were Radio Disney hits and their self-titled debut went gold. The group split in 2002 after a lawsuit from their parents alleged a wide variety of sordid behavior from Baldonieri and Lukow, such as encouraging them to sleep with teenaged fans and providing them with liquor and pornography. Despite starring in the Dream Street film “The Biggest Fan,” Trousdale had a harder time launching his solo career than McCartney. He continued to act in smaller roles and eventually auditioned for “The Voice” in 2012, but did not make it past the blind auditions. At the time, he was working as a waiter in a sushi restaurant. “It’s hard to be serving somebody and she’s like, ‘What are you doing here, you were my idol, I had you on my bedroom wall,'” he said on the show. “Chris was one of a kind and always the brightest light on any stage he stood on,” Gagle’s comment reads. “Thank you for the love you gave him. He felt it to the end and I’m sure still as he watches from heaven.”

Officials in the Chinese city of Wuhan claim they only detected a few hundred coronavirus cases out of the millions of people tested through an ambitious initiative to screen all residents. There were 300 asymptomatic carriers out of the 9.9 million residents who have been tested so far in Wuhan, the original epicenter of the virus, officials said. China does not count patients who don’t report any symptoms in its confirmed case tally, so officials told reporters there were no new cases of the virus. Officials said the asymptomatic carriers were determined to not be infectious — adding that masks, toothbrushes, phones, door handles and elevator buttons that they touched had no traces of virus. Wuhan announced last month that it planned to test all 11 million residents after a new cluster emerged  from the same residential compound. The city-wide testing effort ran a bill of about $126 million. Wuhan was the hardest-hit city in the nation during the crisis, accounting for the majority of the 4,634 deaths and 83,022 infections reported in mainland China. With Post wires

A top World Health Organization official had good news and bad news Wednesday — warning that there was a “definite threat” of another coronavirus outbreak but adding that the world would be better prepared this time around. “We still have neither a vaccine nor a cure for Covid-19,” Hans Kluge, the WHO’s European director, said during a news conference conducted in Russian to reach people in countries where many speak the language, from Russia to Armenia and Israel, Russia Today reported. “The second wave is not inevitable. But an increasing number of nations are lifting restrictions, and there is a definite threat of a repeat outbreak of the Covid-19 infection. If those outbreaks are not isolated, a second wave may come and it may be very destructive,” Kluge said. The good news, he added, was that the world was now in a better position to deal with coronavirus after the first outbreak. “We better understand the virus, which measures work, how we must prepare,” Kluge said. The initial pandemic, which broke out in China in late 2019, has to date killed more than 380,000 across the world, including more than 105,000 in the US. Experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, initially predicted it could take up to 18 months to develop an effective vaccine. But Swiss drugmaker Novartis will start producing a genetic coronavirus vaccine this month under a deal with Massachusetts researchers. AveXis, Novartis’ gene-therapy arm, agreed to manufacture the vaccine being developed by Massachusetts Eye and Ear and Massachusetts General Hospital. Production will start in time for clinical trials that are scheduled to begin in the second half of this year, according to a Thursday announcement. And President Trump has asserted that a vaccine would be developed and ready for use by the end of 2020 under an ambitious effort he dubbed “Operation Warp Speed.” “We’re getting ready so that when we get the good word that we have the vaccine, we have the formula, we have what we need, we’re ready to go, as opposed to taking years to gear up,” he said when announcing the effort last month. “We’re gearing up. It’s risky. It’s expensive, but we’ll be saving massive amounts of time, we’ll be saving years if we do this properly,” the president added. Trump has also bashed the WHO for its handling of the outbreak, particularly its purported kowtowing to China, and said the US was suspending relations with the organization.

They’ve lived through World Wars, the Great Depression and other pandemics, so they weren’t about to let a little COVID stop them. Meet some of the oldest coronavirus survivors — all 100 years old and above — whose optimism and fighting spirits inspire all who hear their stories. Read on for their longevity secrets — and the life lessons they say aided their recoveries, from good eating habits to keeping calm under pressure. World War II was no match for East Rockaway, LI, resident Walter Reed. And neither was COVID-19. The 100-year-old Reed, who drove race cars up until a year ago, says he has more days ahead of him thanks to a life full of good judgment. “I never smoked,” he says. “I watched my diet. I always try to do the right things: You never hear me cussing … I don’t get angry, I hold my temper down. I walk away and have a good relationship with everybody.” Even so, the coronavirus did a number on the Norwalk, Conn., native. “I don’t remember much of anything,” says the retired MTA train operator of his battle with the illness. “I’ve been on Earth a long time, I’ve never been like that. I didn’t know where I was — you lose track of everything. My memory isn’t as good as it was before.” His biggest hope? To get behind the wheel of a racing car again. “I still want to get back at it,” he says. Courtesy Courtesy View Slideshow “God takes good care of me,” says lifelong West Sayville, LI, resident Rose Leigh-Manuell, 101. The devout Protestant — who was born during the Spanish flu pandemic — is exceptionally optimistic due to her faith, says her 63-year-old son, Gary Leigh-Manuell. “She always has this upbeat attitude,” he says of his mother, who has three additional children, 17 grandchildren, 19 great-grandchildren and eight great-great-grandchildren. “One of her famous sayings is ‘this too shall pass.’ ” She’s also long prioritized being social and spending time with her son. “We were going out to dinner at least a couple times a week,” says Gary. “About 10 days before she tested positive [for the coronavirus], we went out to dinner three nights in a row.” In April, she fell ill with a fever and chills, and spent two weeks battling the virus at the Good Samaritan Nursing and Rehabilitation Care Center in Sayville, and was able to avoid a ventilator. Leigh-Manuell has always been tough: She lost her husband nearly 50 years ago and she had to start working to support her family. At one point she was employed as a fire department dispatcher, then at a fish market until 95. “The only reason she retired was because the fish market closed,” says Gary. “She says to me, ‘When this is all over, we have a dinner date, right?’ ” 104-year-old Lilian Menendez credits her longevity with good genes. “My mother was 98 and she didn’t have a gray hair in her head — she was jet black,” says Menendez, the eldest resident at Apex Rehab & Healthcare in South Huntington, LI. Menendez adds that her mother, who raised six children alone in Manhattan, taught her to be strong — and made sure they were fortified to do so. “My mother took very good care of us,” says Menendez. “We ate a lot of rice and beans, and chicken. Sunday we got chicken because we were poor then.” The Harlem native grew up to have two children, four grandchildren and several great-grandchildren. Since recovering from the virus in April, “I feel wonderful,” says Menendez, who once worked at Lord & Taylor on Fifth Avenue, where she made $10 a week. “I’m as strong as a bull.” What’s more: symptom-free, she says COVID-19 is now in the past. “I’m back 100 percent,” she says. Courtesy Courtesy View Slideshow In early May, Jennie Stejna was so ill that her grandson Dave Stejna said his goodbyes. But on May 4, the “feisty and tenacious” 103-year-old woke up and said, “I’m not sick!” Once she was cleared of the virus a couple of weeks later, she celebrated with a cold beer, something Dave says she’d often indulge in on a hot summer day. The family matriarch, who lives in a nursing home in Wilbraham, Mass., was the first person to contract the deadly virus in the facility and the first there to beat it. Dave tells The Post that it is her active nature that’s propelled her through her century of life. “She’s the most high-energy person I ever met,” says Dave, 49, who lives in Easton, Mass. “Into her 90s, I would go places with her and I could barely keep up.”  An avid Red Sox fan, Jennie spent most of her time in her garden, according to her grandson, where she grew tomatoes, cucumbers and mushrooms. She also consistently weeded and mowed her lawn, and went out regularly to play Bingo and go shopping. She also quit smoking cold-turkey when Dave was a newborn. “Did she lead a sedentary lifestyle?” says Dave. “Not in the slightest.” Even though she’s now legally blind and using a wheelchair, she still manages to keep moving. “She’s using her legs,” says Dave. “She pedals herself around [the nursing home] where she makes the rounds.”

Back in April, in the heart of the coronavirus pandemic, NASA stepped up to help by developing a ventilator specifically designed for COVID-19 patients. The device was nicknamed VITAL (short for Ventilator Intervention Technology Accessible Locally) and it was meant to be a low-cost, easy-to-build piece of life-saving medical hardware. Now, as the pandemic continues to rage on, the space agency has announced the companies that have been chosen to manufacture the VITAL ventilators. In a new blog post, NASA reveals that over 100 companies submitted applications to be chosen as manufacturers for VITAL. After narrowing down the dozens of options, the Office of Technology and Corporate Partnerships at Caltech, which manages NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and holds the patents on VITAL, selected a total of eight companies as manufacturing partners. These are the companies that made the cut, per NASA: “The VITAL team is very excited to see their technology licensed,” Leon Alkalai of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and VITAL team member, said in a statement. “Our hope is to have this technology reach across the world and provide an additional source of solutions to deal with the on-going COVID-19 crisis.” The ventilator has proven itself capable of tackling the challenge that COVID-19 poses. It was tested by scientists at the Icahn School of Medicine and demonstrated its usefulness on a number of simulated patients. “We were very pleased with the results of the testing we performed in our high-fidelity human simulation lab,” Dr. Matthew Levin, Associate Professor of Anesthesiology, Preoperative and Pain Medicine and Genetics and Genomics Sciences at the Icahn School of Medicine previously said. “The NASA prototype performed as expected under a wide variety of simulated patient conditions. The team feels confident that the VITAL ventilator will be able to safely ventilate patients suffering from COVID-19 both here in the United States and throughout the world.” A slightly tweaked version of the VITAL ventilator uses compressed air and could be made more widely available on a shorter time frame. The design for that device is currently awaiting approval by the FDA under Emergency Use Authorization, according to NASA.

What if the answer to treating the coronavirus was in our medicine cabinets all along? Despite early speculation that ibuprofen was exacerbating coronavirus symptoms, a later study found that those negative side effects could not be attributed to the common anti-inflammatory drug. Now, some scientists think that ibuprofen may, in fact, be an effective defense against COVID-19, according to the US National Library of Medicine’s clinical trials database. Doctors from London’s Guy’s and St. Thomas’ hospital and King’s College are beginning clinical research on patients in a trial program dubbed “Liberate,” wherein half of the test subjects will be treated with ibuprofen while the other half will receive treatment without the added drug. Scientists note that they will be using a unique formulation that wouldn’t be found in drugstores; rather, it’s in lipid capsule form that’s prescribed for conditions such as arthritis. Findings in animal studies have suggested that ibuprofen could treat acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is known to develop in coronavirus patients. “We need to do a trial to show that the evidence actually matches what we expect to happen,” says professor Mitul Mehta of King’s College London. The idea that ibuprofen may lead to severe coronavirus complications was inspired by a report in March of a 4-year-old British child whose symptoms worsened after taking the fever-reducing drug. This prompted the UK’s health officials to rescind recommendations for taking ibuprofen to treat symptoms. Later the French health minister Olivier Véran bolstered the claim when he said the drug could “aggravate the infection.” This prompted King’s College London researchers to conduct a review of 13 previous studies about ibuprofen, but ultimately they found no evidence that it had the potential to weaken the immune system. They published their report in the journal Ecancermedicalscience on March 27. “Our search did not identify any strong evidence for or against the use of ibuprofen for treatment of COVID-19 specifically,” the study reads. “The current literature does not give conclusive evidence for or against the use of NSAIDs in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.”

MLB rejected the players association’s proposal for a 114-game season and is building internal consensus around implementing a season of roughly 50 games for full prorated pay for players, unless the union is willing to accept 82-ish games at less than proration, sources told The Post. MLB informed the players association there would not be a formal counter to the union plan, continuing a staredown that further threatens what kind of season, if any, can be played. The union on Sunday made a counterproposal to MLB that would call for a 114-game season and no cutbacks in prorated pay. MLB has objected to both of those concepts. The league’s initial offer was for an 82-game regular season that concluded in September with the playoffs in the traditional October, largely out of concerns that the coronavirus could rebound with a strong wave in cooler weather and lead to the cancellation of the postseason, which is the sport’s big national TV moneymaker. The union’s plan called for the regular season to end in October with the playoffs in November. And MLB also has been strident that it would not play that many games at full prorated salaries and incur what it said would be greater losses by playing. During what was at times a contentious negotiation Sunday between top officials from both sides, MLB floated the notion that if full prorated salaries were a must, then the March 26 agreement between the two entities gives commissioner Rob Manfred the right to implement a season of any length, as long as it was at full prorated salaries for the players. MLB’s current concept would call for a regular season of 40-60 games, but the expectation is the league would center it more at 48-54 games. MLB would essentially be giving the union a choice of two months of games at full prorated pay or three months worth of games at potentially more money overall, but not at a full proration. Scott Boras, who represents some of the biggest and most influential players in the game, told The Post, “In March players compromised and gave to MLB nearly $2 billion in salary concessions — over a 40 percent salary cut — as consideration to receive a defined pro rata salary per game. MLB does not dispute that.” MLB, though, has maintained it will not give that prorated total for its proposed 82-game season. But the commissioner is in control of the number of games and scheduling via the March 26 agreement between the sides. Thus, as long as it proves health/safety and economic feasibility requirements, MLB can impose a season of any length it desires. But the union could provide impediments. The players, theoretically, could disagree with health/safety protocols, which need both sides’ approval. Or they could refuse to accept MLB’s desire for expanded playoffs, which almost certainly would lead to a larger payday from TV partners. The players association had offered expanded playoffs for 2020-21 as part of its presentation Sunday. But it was part of a lager proposal and can always be pulled. But even if the players agreed to a shorter season and the full prorated pay, is that going to be self-defeating to the industry? There already are asterisk-level credibility questions that would arrive with an 82-game campaign. What if it were 48 games? Would fans think the ultimate World Series winner is truly a champ or that the stats are legitimate or that it is worth their time to care? Also, would more players stay away believing if there are questions of legitimacy why even show up and take on the risks created by the coronavirus? Would that lead to fights about service time? There is still so much to work out and time dwindling if the goal is to begin the regular season advantageously on Independence Day weekend.

Steven Avery, the subject of true-crime series “Making a Murderer,” has tested positive for coronavirus, his lawyer said Wednesday. “Steven Avery has tested positive for COVID-19, and is confined to his cell,” tweeted Jerome Buting, Avery’s former criminal defense attorney. Buting said his client’s ex-fiancee, Sandy Greenman, reports Avery’s symptoms were “short-lived” and that he’s in “good spirits.” Avery, 57, is serving a life sentence without parole for the 2005 murder of Teresa Halbach in Wisconsin. His case received worldwide attention with the 2015 hit Netflix documentary “Making a Murderer” that examined whether Avery and his nephew Brendan Dassey were wrongfully convicted. Buting and lawyer Dean Strang have both argued that Avery and Dassey are innocent. The two no longer represent Avery, TMZ reported, but his new lawyer, Kathleen Zellner, is working on an appeal. “It is true that Steven Avery has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus — he will fully recover,” Zellner tweeted. “The bigger threat to him is whether the COA [Court of Appeals] will cure the disease that caused him to be wrongfully convicted.”

In April, Carhartt, the workwear company out of Dearborn, Michigan, pivoted from announcing new types of brown pants and jackets to making medical masks and gowns, aiming to help the “men and women working on the front line,” with the gear they need to protect themselves. The company said, “As long as these critical items are in short supply, Carhartt will continue to assist in production.” Carhartt is producing 50,000 medical gowns and 2.5 million masks, since stockpiles of personal protective equipment will be needed to avoid any catastrophic shortages. The company has gained fashion cred with teens for its woolen beanies, and is known for making rugged, durable wear for men and women. “We had to transition everything from the design to material to machinery. There were a number of challenges along the way, including the sourcing of raw materials which are far different than our famous brown duck,” says William Hardy, Carhartt’s senior vice president of supply chain. The move has a precedent, however. “Serving and answering the call during times of need has always been an integral part of
Carhartt’s history,” he says of the firm founded by Hamilton Carhartt, who began producing bib overalls with two sewing machines and a half-horsepower electric motor in a small Detroit loft in 1889. “We retooled our facilities during World War I and II to support the country’s troops, and immediately knew that we wanted to get involved to support the hard-working first responders.” The firm used a staggered approach to bring supply chain associates back to the facilities. All associates receive a daily no-contact-thermometer temperature check and short questionnaire. ”We also provide masks, which associates are required to wear while in our facilities,” says Hardy. Workers in Carhartt’s US factories were on paid leave due to the pandemic, but some
volunteered to do the new work. The company worked with local health authorities to figure out the layout and handling protocols for production, which must be done in a sanitary environment. With more than 5,500 associates worldwide, Carhartt is family-owned and managed by the descendants of the company’s founder. They temporarily closed all company-owned stores and brought in temporary rotating paid-work schedules in manufacturing and distribution facilities. “Serving and answering the call during times of need has always been an integral part of
Carhartt’s history and it’s why consumers have trusted us to have their back for more than 130 years,” says Mark Valade, chief executive officer at Carhartt. “We are humbled and honored to help all the essential workers serving and protecting us right now.” Tony Ambroza, chief brand officer of Carhartt, will be a keynote speaker at Brands Across America on Friday, June 5.

President Trump on Wednesday called it a “strange deal” that the coronavirus was largely contained to the city of Wuhan within China, but at the same time spread all over the world. “I ask this, why is it Wuhan? It came out of Wuhan, why is it that it didn’t go to [all of] China but it went to the rest of the world. It went to Europe, it went to the world, it went to the United States, [but] it didn’t go to Beijing,” the president said during an interview on Fox Radio. “How come they let it go out into the world but they didn’t let it go into China. It went all over the world, that’s a little strange deal going on there.” Trump also alluded to a report Tuesday from the World Health Organization that said that China delayed releasing critical information about the coronavirus in the weeks after the outbreak was first reported. “The plague came in from China, they shouldn’t have let it happen. It’s not right. In fact I see today there’s a very big article that they weren’t very transparent or forthcoming, to put it mildly. The stall, they call it,” he said, referring to the WHO report, which also lauded the Communist country for its quick response to the pandemic, which has killed more than 380,000 worldwide, including more than 105,000 in the US. The president also touted his phase one trade deal with China, but seemed to cast doubt on its future because of the pandemic and escalating tensions between the world’s two largest economies. “The trade deal was done, but the ink wasn’t dry before the virus floated over from China and started killing everybody in the world. Not just here, in the whole world. Look at Brazil, look at what it went through, Spain, France, all of them, the whole world,” he said. “I did a great deal but you know what? I’m not excited about anything with respect to China right now because of what happened. They could have sealed it, they could have closed it off.” He also trashed his predecessors, asserting that past presidents had been snookered by the Chinese Communist Party government, which has pulled back from meeting some provisions of the deal. “China was having, before the plague, China was having the worst year they’ve had in 66 years because of me. I’m not proud of that. I’m just saying that these presidents let China pick our pockets,” he said.

Sweden’s top infectious disease expert admitted Wednesday that his controversial coronavirus strategy of avoiding a strict lockdown resulted in too many deaths, according to a report. As the country’s fatality rate soars, its chief epidemiologist Anders Tegnell — whose light-touch approach left many businesses and schools open as the pandemic raged — told Swedish Radio he should have implemented stricter policies. “If we were to encounter the same illness with the same knowledge that we have today, I think our response would land somewhere in between what Sweden did and what the rest of the world has done,” Tegnell told the station. “Clearly, there is potential for improvement in what we have done.” Earlier this week, Sweden’s death rate per capita emerged as the highest in the world, according to the Guardian. At 43 fatalities per 100,000, it has far surpassed neighboring countries such as Denmark and Norway, which have imposed tougher stay-at-home orders. During the pandemic, Swedes have been able to dine at restaurants, go shopping, attend gyms and send kids under age 16 to school. Tegnell — the brains behind those measures — has argued that a relaxed response to the virus would be more sustainable long-term than severe and sudden lockdowns. While his strategy was widely supported in Sweden,  it was both hotly criticized and praised in other countries. On Wednesday, some Swedish politicians were stunned by Tegnell’s admission that he may have screwed up. “Astonishing,” Jimmie Akesson of the Sweden Democrats tweeted. “For months, [his] critics have been consistently dismissed. Sweden has done everything right, the rest of the world has done it wrong. And now, suddenly, this.” There’s limited evidence showing Sweden’s decision to leave businesses open has boosted the country’s economy, according to Bloomberg News. Finance Minister Magdalena Andersson has warned that Sweden is facing its worst economic crisis since World War II, with gross domestic product set to slump 7 percent in 2020 — roughly as much as the rest of the European Union, the outlet reported. On Monday, Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven vowed to investigate the handling of the crisis before the end of the month.

GENEVA – More than 600 nurses worldwide are known to have died from COVID-19, which has infected an estimated 450,000 healthcare workers, the International Council of Nurses said on Wednesday. The death toll among nurses more than doubled in the past month from 260 on May 6, according to its figures, which are based on data from more than 30 countries. “In the last two months, we have seen the number of deaths of nurses as a result of coronavirus around the world rise from 100 to now in excess of 600 and we think worldwide the number of healthcare workers who could be infected by the virus is around 450,000,” Howard Catton, chief executive officer of the Geneva-based ICN, told Reuters Television. “These are numbers that keep going up,” he said. The pandemic’s true cost among health professionals was not known, the association said, renewing its appeal for greater protection for them and systematic collection of reliable data. On average, 7 percent of all cases of COVID-19, the lung disease caused by the novel coronavirus, are among healthcare workers, which means that nurses and other staff are at great personal risk “and so are the patients they care for”, it said. Extrapolating from more than 6 million reported cases gave its estimate of some 450,000 infections among healthcare workers. Infection rates among healthcare workers vary greatly between countries, with fewer than one percent in Singapore and more than 30 percent in Ireland, it said. Spain and Germany have recorded low numbers of fatalities among healthcare workers despite large outbreaks, it added. “Why do the rates of deaths among nurses appear higher in some Latin American countries?” it asked, referring to the region that the World Health Organization (WHO) says has emerged as the new epicenter for the pandemic. “Why are some countries reporting disproportionate deaths among black, Asian and minority ethnic HCWs (healthcare workers)? This is an issue raised directly by the Philippine Nurses Association to ICN, concerning Filipino HCWs in the UK,” it said. The ICN represents 130 national associations and more than 20 million registered nurses.

Two large movie theater owners issued dire warnings on Wednesday about their ability to bounce back from the coronavirus. AMC, the nation’s biggest cinema chain, said in a regulatory filing that there’s a “substantial doubt” about its ability to “continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.” Companies issue “going concern” warnings when running low on cash and AMC has been dogged by persistent rumors of bankruptcy since it was forced to shutter 630 theaters across the nation in March. “We are generating effectively no revenue,” the filing said. AMC expects to take a first-quarter loss of up to $2.4 billion as revenue dropped 22 percent to $941.5 million, it added. The company says its cash balance of $718.3 million will be enough to sustain it through the end of the summer, but warned that its business woes could persist even after stay-at-home orders are lifted as Hollywood studios have also been forced to push back production and delay the release of films. Mark Zoradi, chief executive officer of rival movie theater chain Cinemark, expressed similar concerns — saying he doesn’t expect the industry to return to normal until 2022. “The reality is, I don’t think we’re going to be able to get into a full-on rhythm again of product cycles and all that we had prior to COVID-19 until 2022,” Zoradi said on a first-quarter earnings call with analysts. “That’s more production-related than our operation-related because as studios have had to adapt to not being able to do filming and do post-production, they’ve had to move their schedules. Therefore, we’re going to adapt as well.” In addition to a new program of deep cleaning, Cinemark plans to limit its seating capacity to 50 percent in each of its 525 theaters, with six feet between patrons for social distancing. The CEO, who said he expects the chain to begin reopening its doors on July 1, said Cinemark could still be profitable operating at that level. During the first quarter, however, Cinemark posted a loss of $59.6 million, or 51 cents a share, compared with a profit of $32.7 million, or 28 cents a share, a year earlier. Adjusted earnings totaled $66.2 million. Revenue slid 24 percent from $714.7 million to $543.6 million.

WALENSTADT, Switzerland  – Two Swiss conceptual artists are offering seven open air “hotel rooms” this summer across a “performance space” encompassing eastern Switzerland and Liechtenstein. The Bushcraft course teaches basic survival skills like foraging for food and water and also offers insight into traditional indigenous cultures. The course filled up soon after the lockdown began to be eased late last month and there is a lot of demand, the organizers said. “A lot of people come to learn self-discipline. How to organize themselves and organize themselves in a natural environment,” said instructor Gordon Dedman at Bushcraft Survival Australia, who is a former army commando. “The more knowledge you have… it actually gives you a sense of confidence and then you can make better-informed decisions.” Course participants learn how to erect a shelter, build a fire, solar and celestial navigation, forage for edible plants, some within a timed environment designed to emulate the stress of a real survival situation. “They’ve got a timed period to make a fire using the procedure that we’ve given them because it makes it efficient. They may have to light a fire to signal for help, to boil water to give to a person that’s suffering from hypothermia,” Dedman said. “The other thing is that the timed deliverables gives an element of stress and in a survival situation you’re going to be very, very stressed.” The interest in the course comes as Australia loosens its lockdown laws after months of restrictions that saw runs on supermarket staples and many Sydney dwellers cooped up at home. Now beaches are reopening and pubs in Sydney are allowed to accept ten patrons for meals. “I’ve been caught up with that supermarket mayhem. I didn’t realize how entrenched I was in that,” course participant George Hamza said. Hamza is one of 11 participants taking part in a three-day intermediate course near Ku-ring-gai National Park, Ingleside, north of Sydney. “Coming out here and spending a few days here and removing myself from that, I’m feeling like I’m detoxing a little from that sphere of the world,” he said.

CLUJ, Romania/BUCHAREST – Soon after a two-month lockdown to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus eased in Romania in mid-May, Grigore Lup, a Romanian shoemaker from the Transylvanian city of Cluj, noticed people were not respecting the rules of social distancing. So Lup came up with the idea of long-nosed leather shoes to help keep people apart. They come in a European size 75. “You can see it on the street, people are not respecting social distancing rules,” said Lup, who has been making leather shoes for 39 years. “I went to the market to buy seedlings for my garden. There weren’t many people there but they kept getting closer and closer. “If two people wearing these shoes were facing each other, there would be almost one-and-a-half meters between them.” While he also sells ready-made shoes, Lup’s shop, which he opened in 2001, relies heavily on custom orders from theatres and opera houses across the country, as well as traditional folk dance ensembles. His business ground to a virtual standstill as live events were canceled or postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic, but he was cautiously optimistic that sales would recover over time. The European Union state, which has reported 18,791 cases of the coronavirus and 1,240 deaths, began gradually easing its lockdown on May 15. Lup, who said he adapted the long footwear from a model he made for actors, said he had so far received five orders for social distancing shoes. It takes him two days to make a pair, which requires almost one square meter of leather. They cost 500 lei ($115) a pair. Now 55, Lup first started making shoes when he was 16, learning from a cobbler who at 93 today still makes traditional ethnic Hungarian footwear.

An Oklahoma State linebacker said he tested positive for the coronavirus after attending a protest, according to new reports. Amen Ogbongbemiga announced his diagnosis on Twitter Tuesday evening. “After attending a protest in Tulsa AND being well protective of myself, I have tested positive for COVID-19,” he wrote. “Please, if you are going to protest, take care of yourself and stay safe.” Ogbongbemiga was one of 30 players to return to Oklahoma State on Monday, the first phase of university athletes returning to campus during the coronavirus pandemic, ESPN reported. Each of those players, in addition to coaches and other staff members, were tested for the coronavirus, a source told the outlet. Ogbongbemiga will be quarantined in separate on-campus housing, as per university protocol, according to ESPN. He will be retested Friday, and then again at a later date. Protests over the police-involved death of George Floyd in Minneapolis have been held in Tulsa for four straight nights, Tulsa World reported.

Amanda Kloots says she’s been told to say goodbye to husband Nick Cordero amid his two-month battle with COVID-19 but has faith he’ll pull through. “I’ve been told a couple times that he won’t make it. I’ve been told to say goodbye. I’ve been told it would take a miracle. Well, I have faith,” Kloots, 38, posted to Instagram Wednesday. “Faith that is small as a mustard seed sometimes, but that is all you need sometimes.” In April, the 41-year-old Broadway star was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in LA with a suspected coronavirus infection. He had to have his right leg amputated due to complications from the virus and has been on a ventilator for weeks. Cordero recently suffered a setback with a lung infection. Kloots added, “He’s still here and despite his odds gets slightly, slightly better every day. Where there is faith, there is hope. Where there is hope, there can be a miracle! Like my dad has said since day one, every day he’s still with us is a miracle. I believe God is with us, with the doctors and with Nick.”

Meet the “24-hour meat machine.” The owner of a butcher shop and restaurant in Rochester, NY, told Fox News that his meaty new vending machine is a hit with customers, who can now purchase their steaks and chops with minimal person-to-person contact in a sectioned-off vestibule at the front of his shop. “The response has been unbelievable,” said Kevin McCann, the owner and head butcher at McCann’s Local Meats. “On Saturday, I was cutting and restocking the machine four or five times.” McCann can’t take all the credit for the idea. As he tells Fox News, his friend and mentor Josh Applestone, who operates Applestone Meats in the Hudson Valley, has been utilizing refrigerated meat vending machines for years. “He’s sort of been a bug in my ear, trying to get me to do this,” McCann said. “And with the coronavirus and [our efforts] to keep people safe, it just seemed like a no-brainer idea to implement at this time, as an added service to what we already do.” McCann’s new vending machine doesn’t merely help with social distancing protocol, either. The butcher tells Fox News that he hopes his machine — which carries fresh cuts of meat as well as prepared foods — will also provide a much-needed service for the local health care community in Rochester. “With regards to the coronavirus pandemic, a lot of our customers here work in the hospital system,” McCann said. “A lot have crazy schedules and not much time to do their grocery shopping. I’d like to give them the option to be able to come here, pick up a steak and a couple of different sides… to be able to sort of have a complete, healthy meal without having to resort to fast food.” McCann planned to debut the concept at McCann’s Local Meats on Monday, June 1. But after stocking the refrigerated vending machine on Friday, as part of a test run, McCann said it only took a few hours for folks to find out about it. “We didn’t announce to people that it was open. We figured we’d get to it on Monday,” he said. “[On Friday night], I wanted to show my wife, from the shop’s security camera. And I saw customers in there already, who were just sort of figuring it out on their own.” McCann then spent the rest of the weekend slicing meat and stocking the machine for the influx of customers, all the way through Tuesday, when McCann’s Local Meats officially reopened its meat counter and take-out sections for to-go orders. “It gave us a poetic opportunity to reemerge from this pandemic,” said McCann, who noted that June 1 was the company’s five-year anniversary. “It brought us back in a way customers would recognize and remember us.”

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the United Kingdom will not abandon Hong Kong if China imposes a harsh national security law and would admit 3 million people from the former British colony. “Hong Kong succeeds because its people are free,” Johnson wrote in the Times of London newspaper. “If China proceeds, this would be in direct conflict with its obligations under the joint declaration, a legally binding treaty registered with the United Nations.” “Many people in Hong Kong fear that their way of life — which China pledged to uphold — is under threat,” he added. Johnson said he would allow British National Overseas passport holders in Hong Kong to settle in the United Kingdom and provide them a path to citizenship. He said there are about 350,000 holders of the passport in Hong Kong and 2.5 million are eligible to apply for one. Communist China’s parliament rubber-stamped a measure last week that would crack down on secession, sedition, terrorism and foreign meddling in Hong Kong. “If China proceeds to justify their fears, then Britain could not in good conscience shrug our shoulders and walk away; instead we will honor our obligations and provide an alternative,” Johnson said. Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997 and it was granted autonomy under a “one country, two systems” policy with Beijing. China told the United Kingdom to butt out of its affairs. “The UK’s irresponsible remarks and accusations … have grossly interfered in China’s internal affairs including Hong Kong affairs,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said, according to Reuters. “We advise the UK side to step back from the brink.” Unrest in Hong Kong has been ongoing since March 2019 when Beijing considered a now-abandoned measure that would allow criminal suspects in Hong Kong to be returned to mainland China for trial.

More than a dozen West Point cadets from the Class of 2020 who were brought back for graduation where President Trump is expected to give the commencement address have tested positive for the coronavirus, according to reports. Sources on Capitol Hill told USA Today that the number of infected cadets was 16. “About 1½ percent” of the Class of 2020 who were brought back have tested positive,” a US Army spokesperson told CNN. None of the infected cadets have displayed any symptoms, the spokesperson said, adding that “no cadet has contracted through person-to-person contact while under the Army’s care” and that those infected were isolated. The graduating class comprises about 1,000 cadets. Of them, 850 have returned to the campus since spring break in March, USA Today reported. “The Army and West Point have done meticulous planning to ensure the health and safety of the returning cadets of the U.S. Military Academy’s Class of 2020,” the rep said. In April, Trump announced he was going to address West Point’s graduating class on June 13 — a decision that was criticized for putting cadets’ health at risk. West Point said in a statement later that the graduation procession “will look different from recent graduation ceremonies due to current force health protection requirements” related to the pandemic. Army Lt. Gen. Darryl Williams, the West Point superintendent, declined to specify the number of cadets affected, but told USA Today that screening and safety procedures will permit the ceremony to be held safely. Sources on Capitol Hill told the paper that of the 16 affected cadets, 14 had tested positive for the antibodies that indicate they had contracted the bug and recovered. Also, 71 of the more than 5,000 faculty, staff and civilians at the military academy have tested positive for COVID-19 since March. All but four civilians have recovered, USA Today reported. Army brass have defended Trump’s decision to address the graduating class. “We can’t telecommute to combat,” Army Chief of Staff Gen. James McConville told Pentagon reporters when asked about the decision.

Mayor Bill de Blasio is now urging New Yorkers to stay home and continue to practice social distancing over coronavirus fears, despite days of thousands taking to city streets to protest the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd. “I want people to stay home to the maximum extent possible,” de Blasio, who has previously welcomed the peaceful mass protests, said during his daily City Hall press briefing Wednesday. De Blasio said he wants Big Apple residents to “get back to” social distancing “because it has been working and we need it to beat back this disease.” The comments come after thousands have flooded city streets daily for nearly a week in protest over the death of Floyd — a black man who died May 25 when a white cop kneeled on his neck — and as the Big Apple readies to enter phase one of reopening from its coronavirus-induced shutdown. “We all now need to turn our attention to the hugely important moment coming this Monday, June 8, where we take phase one of the restart,” de Blasio said, adding that “the single most important thing happening in New York City is the battle against the coronavirus. “Right after that is restarting our city, helping people get their livelihoods back,” he said. “Their No. 1 concern, overwhelmingly, was their economic reality … Their No. 2 concern was the health and safety of their families.” De Blasio continued, “We need to get back to that focus.” Meanwhile, for the past three nights, looters and vandals turned parts of the city into chaos following the demonstrations, but de Blasio insisted Wednesday that what unfolded Tuesday night was nowhere near the unruly level of the previous night, when looters struck Midtown and parts of The Bronx, leaving slews of storefronts in ruins. “Overwhelmingly, it was a very different reality in New York City last night,” de Blasio said, explaining, “We took a step forward.” “We saw a very different picture around New York City last night,” the mayor said, noting, “We still have more work to do.” Hizzoner said the city saw “peaceful protests during the day — yeah some tense moments undoubtedly, but overwhelming some peaceful protests.” “We saw a few instances where some people decided to do something illegal or violent around the protests but that was rare,” said de Blasio. Areas in Midtown and The Bronx hit by looters Monday night “did not see that kind of activity in any meaningful number last night.” De Blasio, who implemented an 8 p.m.-to-5 a.m. citywide curfew for Tuesday through Sunday, chalked up the progress to a “series of strategies” and a “different adjustment” taken by the NYPD. “Those strategies, I think, by and large, were effective,” de Blasio said.

In an effort to encourage volunteers to donate blood, Vitalant — a non-profit organization that helps distributes blood to hospitals — said that it will start informing blood donors if they have coronavirus antibodies. The antibody test Vitalant is using has already been approved by the FDA and will help individuals determine if they were exposed to the coronavirus, regardless of whether or not they ever exhibited symptoms. The impetus for the program is that blood for various surgeries and medical treatment plans is in short supply because blood drives have effectively been on hiatus on account of COVID-19. “While a positive antibody test does not mean that someone is immune to COVID-19, it does mean that they may be eligible to donate convalescent plasma in the future and help people with the disease,” Vitalant marketing officer Cliff Numark explained. “Convalescent plasma can be given directly to patients currently battling COVID-19 to help boost their ability to fight their illness.” Indeed, Vitalant is interested in testing blood for coronavirus antibodies precisely because it can help scientists and researchers come up with an effective plan to combat the virus. You might recall that Microsoft a few weeks ago launched a program to help people determine if they’re eligible to donate plasma for coronavirus research. In a blog post highlighting the benefits of studying blood with coronavirus antibodies, Microsoft explained: Thankfully, as the human immune system learns to fight off the disease and people recover, we see some very promising ways that people’s naturally produced antibodies, which are present in convalescent plasma, can be used as treatment for others. The use of convalescent plasma is a technique dating back to the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic and was effective more recently during the SARS outbreak. Today, there is mounting clinical evidence that plasma collected from those who have recovered from COVID-19 can be used to treat ill COVID-19 patients. Vitalant has already been collecting convalescent plasma for a weeks but the new program will hopefully result in a surge of blood donors. Vitalant notes that the following individuals are not in a position to donate blood: You can read more about the eligibility requirements to donate over here.

The Trump administration said Wednesday it will ban Chinese passenger carriers from flying in and out of the US starting June 16, ramping up pressure on Beijing to allow American carriers to resume flights to the country. The US Department of Transportation announced the move, which penalizes China after the country’s Communist rulers failed to comply with an earlier agreement on flights between the world’s two largest economies, Reuters reported. Relations between the two countries have also soured in recent months amid escalating tensions surrounding the coronavirus pandemic, Taiwan and Hong Kong. The order applies to Air China, China Eastern Airlines Corp, China Southern Airlines and Hainan Airlines Holding. Delta Air Lines and United Airlines have asked to resume flights to China this month, even as Chinese carriers have continued US flights during the pandemic. Delta said in a statement on Wednesday that “we support and appreciate the US government’s actions to enforce our rights and ensure fairness.” China “remains unable” to say when it will revise its rules “to allow US carriers to reinstate scheduled passenger flights,” the Transportation Department said in a formal notice made public on Wednesday. The Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the news service. The Trump administration on May 22 accused China of making it impossible for US airlines to resume service to China, and ordered four Chinese carriers to file flight schedules with the US. The Chinese carriers are flying no more than one scheduled flight a week to the States but also have flown a large number of additional charter flights, often to help Chinese students return home. The Trump administration is also cracking down on Chinese passenger airline charter flights and will warn carriers not to expect approvals. Administration officials have suggested charter flights have been used to circumvent Chinese government limits on flights. On Jan. 31, the Trump administration barred most non-US citizens who had been in China within the previous 14 days due to the coronavirus crisis but did not impose any restrictions on Chinese flights. Major US carriers voluntarily decided to halt all passenger flights to China in February. Delta and United are flying cargo flights to China, and Delta had requested approval for a daily flight to Shanghai from Detroit and Seattle, while United had asked to fly daily to Shanghai from San Francisco and Newark and between San Francisco and Beijing. China’s air authority in late March said Chinese airlines could maintain just one weekly passenger flight on one route to any given country and that carriers could fly no more than the number of flights they were flying on March 12, according to the US order. But because US passenger airlines had stopped all flights by March 12, China “effectively precludes US carriers from reinstating scheduled passenger flights to China,” the Transportation Department said. The move is just the latest in the escalation of tensions between the two countries. The US beefed up restrictions on Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant, and blocked a government pension fund from investing in China. President Trump announced Friday that he was starting to end the US special relationship with Hong Kong, and that he will place sanctions on officials responsible for Beijing’s rollback of civil liberties in the former British colony.

For those of us working at home, I’m willing to bet that it has instilled tremendous gratitude for two things: pajamas and PDFs. Whether you’re a lawyer or accountant, marketing manager or sales exec, Adobe Acrobat, along with Adobe’s suite of other products, has proved indispensable — especially sans office printers. “We are fortunate to be in an industry that is not as heavily impacted as some [by coronavirus-related layoffs]. Indeed, our software has never been more critical than today,” says Ann Lewnes, Adobe’s executive vice president and chief marketing officer, who will be a keynote speaker at Brands Across America on June 5. “We are committed to keeping businesses up and running, students learning, creatives creating, and governments connected to their citizens. As challenging as these times are, we are blessed that our mission has never been more relevant and that our products make a meaningful impact in the lives of so many people.” From Photoshop to InDesign, Dreamweaver to Flash Builder, Adobe makes working from home easier. Now, the San Jose, California-based software company is also going above and beyond to make life a little bit easier for those in need across the country. “To date, Adobe has committed $6 million to support our local and global communities, including giving to organizations providing essential needs like the International Red Cross, Silicon Valley Community Foundation, American India Foundation and the Akshaya Patra Foundation,” says Lewnes. As part of this initiative, a $1 million fund has been created to go toward projects made by members of their creative community. All visual creators can apply to the fund. Since March, employees have raised over $1.6 million through Adobe’s two-to-one employee-matching grants program. In addition, staffers have virtually volunteered nearly 25,000 hours to nonprofits since the pandemic’s outbreak in March. And just because the world as we know it has come screeching to a halt, that doesn’t mean creativity should. To that end, the company has gifted 30 million students with free Creative Cloud subscriptions, offering more than 20 desktop and mobile apps and services for photography, design, video, web, UX and more. The company’s employees, too, have played a key role in fostering imagination and artistry to help self-expression thrive during quarantine life. Since March, many Adobe employees have stepped up to share their talents with their communities, as illustrated by the following examples. Take Kyle Webster, an illustrator at Adobe based in Winston-Salem, NC, who, with his team created Draw Along with Kyle Webster, providing drawing classes for children to enjoy virtually, helping to both spark ideas and teach new skill sets. “There are several reasons why creativity plays an important role in times like this” says Webster of his thrice weekly YouTube drawing classes. “First, the mental-health benefits of engaging in creative project work, which includes anything from a 10-minute origami folding session to a four-hour stretch of painting on canvas, have been proven time and again. Making things is meditative and healthy — creative thinking often leads to innovation and solutions to problems.”  Based in Salt Lake City, Brandon Pack, director of software engineering, and his wife, Mindy, a vocal coach and singing specialist, partnered with their good friend Dr. Reena Gupta, an ENT physician working on the front line of the COVID-19 pandemic in Los Angeles. As they witnessed how musicians were being impacted by the coronavirus crisis, they self-funded a virtual choir project to bring attention to the MusiCares COVID-19 artist relief fund, providing singers with a paid gig. Within days of making their announcement, they received over 200 virtual auditions. Reflecting on the experience, Pack says, “For the team, these submissions highlighted how strained musicians are right now. This project helped artists cover bills or pay for meals. But crucially, it also allowed these creative individuals to connect with their art, share their talent with the world, and prove that this pandemic would not silence their voices.” Indeed, their voices resonated as powerfully as ever, with the virtual choir performing a beautiful cover of composer Scott Alan’s “The Distance You Have Come,” edited and produced by Australian actor and singer, Ky Baldwin, using software donated by Adobe. Then there’s Jonathan Lancar, engineering manager, who has worked tirelessly with his wife, Genevieve, to 3D print and assemble face shields for medical workers across the Bay Area. Since they started in March, they have printed, assembled and delivered over 600 shields to front-line personnel, with some going to other parts of California, Arizona and New York. “We have learned a lot along the way and I can only be grateful for how Adobe has handled this situation,” Lancar says. “It has truly inspired us to follow our leadership and take action.” We’re also moved by the example of Kavita Mittal, who’s a group product manager in the Bay Area. Along with her two sons, Kavita made homemade masks to donate to the Good Samaritan Hospital. Determined to do more, she decided to share her skills online and made an instructional video (using Adobe products, of course) to show others how they can easily make their own creative masks at home. “It’s a drop in an ocean, but hopefully the cheery prints will make someone less stressed and keep our folks at the front line a tiny bit more protected,” says Mittal. “I am so happy to be part of Adobe, that makes software to allow people to take their inspiration to fruition, sharing and hopefully, proliferation.” For people at home who want to get involved with Adobe’s community support projects, they have also launched an #HonorHeroes campaign, helping to bring a bit of joy into the lives of men and women who do so much for us, by celebrating their achievements. “Creativity has the power to bring us all together even in the most challenging times,” says Lewnes. “Everyday people are doing extraordinary things. Health-care workers, first responders, delivery drivers, sanitation workers, mail carriers, supermarket staff, school teachers and thousands of other essential workers have been working tirelessly to keep us all safe. We’ve partnered with iconic artists from around the world to honor these workers and volunteers, telling their stories through personal creative tributes. We have been so moved by the work we have seen from our community. We just released a film that highlights some of the work from this campaign.” To submit your own creative message of gratitude, use the hashtag #HonorHeroes when posting on social media. Our war against this virus makes this much clear: Creativity endures during adversity, and perhaps the most valuable of Adobe’s multipronged relief efforts is nurturing that light inside of all of us. For now, for tomorrow, and for the young Picassos they’re igniting, one digital sketching lesson at a time.

The coronavirus turned out to be chicken soup for Campbell’s profits — but did little to boost the stock. The canned-soup giant reported a 15 percent surge in quarterly net sales Wednesday thanks to consumers stockpiling shelf-stable foods amid the pandemic. Customers snapped up Campbell’s items so fast last quarter that the company struggled to keep up with demand, according to Chief Executive Mark Clouse. The initial stockpiling “exceeded shipment capacity,” and the company is working to add capacity amid continued supply challenges, he said. The company’s capacity concerns, along with expectations that demand could waver post-coronavirus, helped send Campbell’s shares down as much as 6.4 percent to $48.65 by early Wednesday afternoon. “I think especially some of the shorter-term investors were maybe expecting a little bit more of an upside relative to what we saw,” Bank of America analyst Bryan D. Spillane told The Post. “They basically under-shipped consumption as retailers were selling product out of inventory and Campbell’s had a little trouble keeping up with demand.” Investors are also shifting toward stocks that will benefit from the economy reopening after coronavirus-related lockdowns, Spillane said. The New Jersey-based company’s signature soups saw a 35 percent spike in US net sales for the three months ending April 26, a period marked by coronavirus-fueled panic shopping. Net sales jumped 20 percent in Campbell’s broader meals and beverages segment, which includes brands such as SpaghettiOs and Prego pasta sauce. The sales boom came as millions of new consumers bought Campbell’s products, with millennials making up the largest cohort, Clouse said. The company said its “household penetration” rose nearly 10 percentage points compared to the same quarter last year. “Consumers also have gravitated to these brands because of the comfort they bring,” Clouse said in prepared comments. “All of them have seen significant consumption gains during the crisis.” Campbell also increased marketing expenses by 26 percent to keep its brands relevant with a focus on snack ideas and recipes, the company said. Campbell reported adjusted earnings of 83 cents a share for its third fiscal quarter, beating Wall Street’s expectations for about 75 cents a share, according to Bloomberg data. The company now expects net sales to jump 5.5 to 6.5 percent for 2020, up from previous guidance for a 1 percent increase at most.

Calvin Klein’s usual Pride month promotions throughout June have this year morphed into its COVID-19 response. In recognition of the pandemic, Calvin Klein has partnered with OutRight Action International on their COVID-19 LGBTIQ Global Emergency Fund, offering financial resources to LGBTQ organizations around the world who are serving people impacted by COVID-19. The underwear-and-more firm also recently launched #ProudInMyCalvins, a celebration of self-expression among the full spectrum of LGBTQ identities. It features photos and videos of nine talents, chosen for their unique stories, all shot by Ryan McGinley, the outsider photographer whom, in 2014, GQ called, “the most important photographer in America.” “The theme of the campaign is taking pride in everything that makes you unique,” says McGinley. “My goal is always to create honest photos that connect to the viewer on a human level and show the subject’s power and vulnerability as human beings.” The actor, writer and activist Chella Man is featured, as is his partner, photographer MaryV. As a deaf, genderqueer, Chinese-Jewish youth, Man found that he didn’t see himself represented in mainstream media or have role models to look up to. Together with MaryV, whose first solo exhibition will document Man’s gender transition, they have brought widespread awareness and attention to not only the trans and queer experiences, but also the experience of being disabled in the queer community. Others include Brazilian singer and drag queen Pabllo Vittar, who says, “I never imagined myself making money with a wig on my head, but bitch, I’m here,” and trans queer model, activist and actor, Jari Jones, who says of growing up with no family support, “With no blueprint set out for us, we had to make it our own.” Ryan McGinley Ryan McGinley View Slideshow The campaign also stars Mina Gerges, the Egyptian model and actor who uses his platform to advocate for LGBTQ visibility and acceptance in Middle Eastern culture, and Gia Woods, the Persian artist whose songs first served as a personal journal, and later, an outlet for coming out. It features actor Tommy Dorfman, whose work reflects their journey as a gender-nonconforming person and focuses on telling stories that shine a light on the queer experience and finding comfort in their identity, and model and poet Reece King, who hopes to inspire others through his self-published book of poems and messages of self-care and self-love. Finally, actor, model and activist Ama Elsesser, who uses their platform to inspire others, will also star. “First, you have to come out to yourself. That’s the biggest thing.” Additionally, to show financial support to all impacted by the pandemic, PVH Corp., the parent company of Calvin Klein, committed $2 million toward COVID-19 relief efforts. The money will support front-line medical workers, the fight against food insecurity, supply chain and industry relief and community resiliency. Ryan McGinley Ryan McGinley View Slideshow Nonprofit grantees include several hospitals and health-care organizations, including Mount Sinai Health System, Montefiore Health System and Northwell Health in New York, plus RWJBarnabas Health and Hackensack Meridian Health in New Jersey. They’ve also sent funds to Feeding America, Coalition for the Homeless in New York City, the Food Bank of Somerset County in New Jersey and the NYC Small Business Continuity Loan Fund. Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger also donated product in the US and around the world to support front-line health-care workers.

At the heart of a community, pharmacies play an integral role in the daily lives of their base, providing essential goods and supportive advice on products and services that affect our well-being. Since the onset of COVID-19, Walgreens has risen to the task as both a community and consumer ally, and an essential service provider at its 9,200 physical locations nationwide. “It’s been an amazing experience for us to be a part of the whole country coming together in support of trying to keep everyone as safe and secure as possible,” says Patrick McLean, senior vice president, chief marketing officer for Walgreens. “I’m really proud of all of our team members — they really are the heroes.” At Walgreens, additional customer service features include free shipping, accelerated drive-thru purchasing and a curbside pickup option, says McLean. Through an expanded partnership with Postmates, which offers local delivery of goods, “We’ve learned more about the demand for our retail products,” says McLean. “All these safety and prevention techniques and investments we’ve made aren’t going away anytime soon. They will stay in place indefinitely.” Walgreens’ commitment to the community is further demonstrated through its philanthropic endeavors. On Red Nose Day on May 21, (the sixth annual fund-raising campaign run by the Comic Relief US public charity to end child poverty) Walgreens continued its support while having to quickly adapt the way in which it participated. Unlike in previous years, the iconic and symbolic red noses weren’t for sale. Instead, those interested in supporting and raising awareness of the cause could unlock their own digital red nose by donating online. Thousands of employees posted digital nose filters on social-media networks, sharing internally with team members and challenging them to show their best red nose shots, says McLean. “Red Nose Day has always supported the most vulnerable children in America and around the world, and this year, the health crisis made it clear there was a greater urgency to help than ever before,” McLean said in a recent press release. “Walgreens was honored to work with Comic Relief US on the first digital red nose, which allowed us all to continue to come together, even while we remained apart, in support of such an important cause.” Over the last six years, the Red Nose Day campaign has raised more than $230 million, including nearly $32 million so far in the 2020 campaign. Walgreens debuted Frontline Hero Discount Day on April 25, offering a special 30 percent discount to celebrate front-line workers. “It was a really successful day for us,” says McLean. Additionally, they have collaborated with AT&T and Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit educational organization behind Sesame Street, to co-create an initiative in response to the uncertainty facing kids and families as the virus situation evolves. At SesameStreet.org, resources are provided to help parents comfort kids and manage anxiety, as well as stay mentally and physically healthy. A campaign was released including a Muppet video thanking “Super Families” of essential workers, many of whom have young kids. “In communities across the country, our customers often look to their local Walgreens team members as a sign of comfort, whether that’s for filling a prescription or finding the perfect gift,” said Richard Ashworth, president of Walgreens, in a recent press release. “Now, it is more important than ever in these unprecedented times, that we explain to children about essential workers and their roles while also celebrating their extraordinary care.” Teachers are also working to address social issues in their classrooms amid this global health crisis, and Walgreens’ WE Teachers program, a no-cost curriculum for educators across the country, offers teachers across the country free resources with training, modules and the WE Teachers Award. This celebrates teachers who have an impact on their communities. With a gravely rising need for mental-health resources since the COVID-19 outbreak, Walgreens has also completed its first phase of pharmacist training in mental-health first aid, which is administered by the National Council for Behavioral Health and accredited by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education. Pharmacists are being taught to understand the risk factors and warning signs for mental-health and addiction concerns and strategies for how to help in both crisis and noncrisis situations. Service to community has always been at the heart of the Walgreens brand’s values. Kevin Hook, a store manager at Walgreens in Chicago who’s been with the company for more than 20 years, oversees 100 employees. His location is one of the busiest stores within the company.  Once the coronavirus hit, Hook says his store had to swiftly switch gears. “We had fewer tourists and more people who lived in the neighborhood,” he says of a quick switch to carrying more cleaning products, paper goods and grocery items. Hook is constantly checking in with his team members to ensure they are feeling alright. “As a dad, it’s especially upsetting to know that children are often left most vulnerable when something like this happens,” he says. “We rallied around the Red Nose Day cause, knowing funds raised help children in our local communities to have meals, have a safe place to sleep, receive health-care services and access to educational programs. It really does foster a stronger sense of community, and bring us closer together as a Walgreens team,” says Hook. “People often refer to their local store as ‘my Walgreens,’ because they feel a sense of kindness and community there. Kindness has been at the route of our culture well before the pandemic and as an essential business.”

You may not know Fernando Machado, but you are probably familiar with some of the marketing and branding campaigns he has run for Burger King. A few years ago, at Pride week in San Francisco, the fast-food chain sold a limited edition of the Whopper burger, wrapped in rainbow-colored paper. When opened, customers found the same familiar Whopper they’d known for years. The campaign’s message? “We’re all the same inside.” More recently there was a time-lapse BK ad that shows a Whopper accumulating green mold over 34 days. Its tagline: “The beauty of no preservatives.” “The idea was to illustrate that we use only fresh, preservative-free ingredients,” says Machado, global vice president and chief marketing officer of Restaurant Brands International which includes Burger King, Popeye’s and Tim Hortons. The commercial was so cutting-edge that Ad Age wrote, “There are only two eras in advertising: ads that came out before Burger King’s Moldy Whopper, and ads that came out after.” But, during the COVID-19 epidemic, outrageous ads are tasteless, says Machado, who has won numerous awards from Ad Week, Andy Awards, Cannes Lyons, and others, and will be a keynote speaker at the June 5 Brands Across America webinar. “They don’t reflect how society feels. The first thing we thought about (when COVID-19 arrived) was how we could step in and help people. That’s more important than advertising and social media at this moment.” Restaurant Brands International (RBI) concentrated on setting up new practices for store employees, like wearing masks and gloves and taking employees’ temperatures, contact-free. They redoubled sanitizing and cleaning standards, updated the drive-through experience and added contactless home delivery. However, with schools closed, RBI recognized that some children who depend on academic institutions for their meals, might go hungry, so they set up a program that provides two kids meals free of charge whenever an adult makes a purchase via the Burger King app. More than one million kids’ meals were given away nationwide. In New Orleans, Popeyes pledged to give away one million meals to those affected by COVID-19 through a partnership with customers who stepped up to help. They sold a “NOLA Strong” package for $28 that consisted of 12 pieces of Popeye’s fried chicken, two sides, six biscuits, a Popeye’s brand “NOLA Strong” t-shirt and a hat, with 100 percent of the proceeds going to the Second Harvest Food Bank, the largest anti-hunger network in Louisiana. “You cannot go wrong when you help people,” says Machado. Tim Horton’s, whose locations are primarily in Canada, used coffee trucks to give away free java and baked goods to doctors, nurses, paramedics, ambulance drivers and others who serve the communities they are in. Machado has since added a little fun and service into his promotions which are meant to bring a little laughter into your life during quarantine, and to remind you to stay safe at home and to feel good about your purchases. One ad suggests that you are a patriot for lazing around at home, using the slogan: “Your country needs you to stay on your couch and order in. Do your part and we’ll do ours. Order through the Burger King app and the delivery fees are on us. So, staying home doesn’t just make us all safer — it makes you a couch potatriot.” The ad also promises to donate Whoppers to nurses and to support the American Nurses Foundation. More recently BK put out ads with the intention of making quarantine fun. One of them features a QR code dancing around on a TV commercial. “If you can catch it and scan it with your phone, Burger King might have something for you the next time you order on the app,” says Machado. “It doesn’t feel like advertising, it feels like fun.” Now that things are beginning to open up and people are slowly venturing out, what can we expect from Burger King? “There are a lot of unemployed people, so we’ll have to deliver good value,” he says, without providing more of a hint. Of course, advertising, branding and marketing aren’t worth as much if the employees on the front and back lines don’t feel cared for, safe and well-treated. At BK, and others, employees who work during COVID-19 earn a bonus, Machado didn’t reveal the amount. And if they get sick with COVID-19, two weeks paid time-off is provided. When it comes to what working from home looks like for Machado, he says that in one way work is becoming more structured because you have to set up a call to talk to a colleague instead of walking by and popping into their office. But that’s just one side of the story. “Before, if you were working from home and your child made noise, it would feel awkward. Now, I was in a video call with global executives when my young son came to me asking for more yogurt, it seemed normal. New normal,” he says. “I think we’re all becoming more flexible, more empathetic.”

Paul Van Doren, the founder of skateboarding shoes and apparel company Vans, once said that Vans isn’t so much a shoe and apparel company as it is a people company that makes shoes and apparel. Although the brand originated in 1966, that statement has perhaps never resonated more than during the turbulent times of the coronavirus outbreak. Without a doubt, this is one of the toughest times that fashion and apparel companies have faced. But this historic chapter in history is also a meaningful opportunity for businesses to show their true colors — loudly, proudly and in the case of Vans, one signature skateboard swivel logo at a time. “Looking after our people has always been and will remain top priority,” says Nick Street, vice president of global integrated marketing at Vans, and one of the keynote speakers at the Brands Across America event on June 5. To that end, the Costa Mesa, Calif. headquartered company has been working nonstop on a variety of charitable initiatives and donations, planning for the brighter days ahead while showing their employees and communities across North America that they are ready to lend their support and solidarity amid uncertainty. First, back in late March, Vans began coordinating a well-deserved shoe delivery program as a gesture of gratitude for the multitude of volunteers who are working around the clock on their feet all day at food banks across the US and Canada. So far, they’ve donated more than 24,000 pairs of Vans “Slip-On” and “Authentic” shoes, and they’re working hard to make sure they get more sneakers in the hands (and on the feet) of tireless workers. “We are grateful to Vans for donating such comfortable footwear for our volunteers,” says Ana Martinez, director of volunteer services at the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, one such recipient of this offering. “The volunteers have been so appreciative, and even more motivated to help us fight hunger in LA County.” The sneaker and apparel leaders have also quickly pivoted to help give back to the medical heroes who do so much for us all. In early April, Vans teamed up with designer Michael Schmidt and donated upward of 40,000 Vans shoelaces to enable Schmidt and his team’s efforts to create and donate medical face shields to front-line hospital workers. Since each face shield needs two 18-inch shoelaces to secure the piece to the worker’s face, Vans’ donation serves as a key element for some 20,000 units to be donated to health-care workers around the country. As face masks have also become this season’s hottest accessory (and necessity) Vans has shifted part of their supply chain operations to collaborate with Hedley & Bennett, current Vans partner and kitchen and workwear brand, to donate more than 250,000 reusable, nonmedical-grade face masks, which are crafted from the canvas typically used in the making of Vans shoes. In a small gesture of appreciation for first responders and health-care workers, Vans also offered a discount of 30 percent off any one-time purchase made by these individuals on their Web site from May 18 to May 25. Vans has also stepped up to help small businesses during these difficult months with their Foot The Bill campaign, which targets community-driven restaurants, music venues, skate shops, surf shops and art galleries. “We launched the Vans initiative [to focus on] supporting 160 small businesses who are feeling the incredible strain COVID-19 has put on their livelihoods,” says Street of this collection of Vans “Customs Slip-Ons.” “Fans can support their local business by selecting its pattern for purchase and further customizing it through the Vans ‘Customs’ offerings.” So far, they’ve seen so much success with the program — which has sneaker designs paying homage to institutions and businesses as diverse as Amityville Music Hall on Long Island, the Meatball Shop in New York City and Homegrown Skateshop in Ithaca, NY — that they also added custom-designed T-shirts. The Vans “Customs Slip-On” sneakers cost $90 and the T-shirts $30, with the net proceeds from both going directly to the indie business partners. Beyond all of these worthy endeavors, Vans has also taken great strides to ensure they look after their own employees. In March, as they moved from their corporate offices to remote setups, they also temporarily closed all of their stores in the US and Canada to protect the health and safety of their store associates and consumers. Despite the closures, Vans continued to support retail associates in the US, Canada and Mexico. “In April, our parent company VF Corp. made the announcement that we would continue supporting our North American retail employees as their stores remain temporarily closed, by further extending full pay and benefits to all retail associates through May 30 and increasing pay through July for our US and Canada distribution center associates,” says Street. For us folks at home, Vans is doing its part against the Battle of Stir-Crazy. “We’ve been focused on not only helping our local communities through giveback initiatives and donations, but also engaging our Vans Fans through content shared across Vans.com and our social-media channels,” says Street. Most notably, they launched the Make Something campaign to spark creativity, and have shared new content on social media with the #OffTheWallsChallenge hashtag, featuring musical and artistic demos and livestream sessions with their Vans athletes. As for what’s next for the iconic skateboarding shoes and apparel company, like businesses around the globe, adaptability is the name of the game. “We all know how fluid the situation is and as a global brand, we are in tune with the needs and circumstances of our consumers around the world,” says Street. “Given the changing nature of the pandemic, we continue to lean into our purpose of enabling creative self-expression. We also continue to review and evolve our plans to remain reactive and agile as we navigate through these uncertain times. We remain committed to supporting our communities, fans and loyal consumers — just like we have always done.” Makes sense — after all, that’s what a people company always does.

The coronavirus has numbed us in many ways, but to one thing it has not: the unflappable generosity of the human spirit. And our everlasting need for caffeine. That’s where the booming grassroots philanthropic campaign NYLovesCoffee comes in, slinging java to those on the front line of the coronavirus crisis while helping small businesses at the same time. The concept behind NYLovesCoffee is simple: Individuals and corporations can remotely buy anywhere from four to 150-plus cups to be enjoyed by hospital staffers battling the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to help with their mind-boggling fatigue. To sweeten the deal, doughnuts can also be tacked onto orders. Four cups of coffee costs $10; 100-plus is $230 and a custom delivery of 150-plus cups of coffee to an area hospital of your choice is $300. As of press time, the organization has even had one generous soul buy 300 cups for three different hospital locations. To prepare for deliveries, all coffee contributions are tallied up until there is enough for a hospital department delivery. Typically, this amounts to around 50 cups of hot and iced coffee, with iced tea sometimes thrown into the mix for the java teetotalers among our health care heroes. The logistics are ironed out from there. At this point, a New York City specialty coffee shop is selected to fill the order and a hospital location is confirmed for the drop-off. “These coffee purchases keep these small businesses brewing throughout this crisis at a time when they have lost almost all their foot traffic business and many have closed completely,” says Paul Kontonis chief marketing officer at WHOSAY, who spearheads NYLovesCoffee’s marketing efforts. Kontonis was brought on after being approached by his longtime friend Dane Atkinson. As the CEO of Odeko, a startup artificial intelligence tech company based in New York City for — you guessed it — coffee shops, Atkinson founded NYLovesCoffee as a way to help health-care workers and small businesses simultaneously. Now, Kontonis is proud to share that they’ve delivered over 35,000 cups of coffee since deliveries began in mid-March. Still, there’s much work to be done: “Even though we have gone to the hospitals many times, there are still departments we have not reached yet. Let’s not forget all the night-shift workers!” Currently, participating coffee shops include local favorites like Bean & Bean Coffee, Bird & Branch Coffee, Birch Coffee, Buunni Coffee, Dough Doughnuts and Everyman Espresso. “I feel like it is incumbent upon us [to make] that 12-hour shift for them as palatable as we can. We can’t really thank them enough,” says Jeremy Lyman, co-founder of Birch Coffee on why he participates in this worthwhile operation. In addition to participating in coffee drop-offs, Birch Coffee has also done several pop-up barista stations at hospitals during which they set up a barista bar in their van where employees can get their free coffee. Brian Zak Brian Zak Brian Zak View Slideshow Jiyoon Han, head of innovation at Bean & Bean Coffee (she’s also the daughter of the company’s founders), echoes that sentiment, noting, “Of course, a cup of coffee can only do so much for all the stress our frontline workers are going through. It’s a token of appreciation.” But sometimes, such an offering of gratitude can be the difference between another grueling day on the battlefield of the coronavirus pandemic, and a moment of happiness. Most of the hospital coffee deliveries that NYLovesCoffee facilitates are conducted outside of the building, during which you’ll see the doctors and nurses themselves pushing any handcart they can find to load up and carry all the coffee and doughnuts back inside to share with their colleagues. “These are not glamorous, organized events, but all-hands-on-deck activities,” says Kontonis. “The power of smiles behind their masks is something to behold. Every person that we have delivered coffee to is beaming with happiness that people are thinking of them and giving them something as simple as a cup of coffee. Even though their faces are covered, you can see them smiling and saying thank you.” For Atkinson, an Elmhurst Hospital drop-off will forever stick out in his mind as a powerful reminder of his team’s work. “The doctors and nurses were lined up and waiting for us to bring the coffee and doughnuts,” Atkinson says. “They were so happy everything was organized for them and they made a line that wrapped the many hallways of the hospital. When we arrived everyone was clapping and literally dancing in the hallways.” On the receiving end, NYLovesCoffee’s efforts are far from unrecognized by the grateful hospital employees. “On behalf of Elmhurst Hospital and all the staff here, I want to thank you guys, it really made our day,” says Wayne Zimmerman, chief operating officer of the Elmhurst Hospital, of their recent brew bounty which was delivered courtesy of a $1,000 donation from the Cosmopolitan Junior Soccer League. “It’s certainly going to brighten up a lot of the spirits here.” Nicole Porto, associate director of patient experience at Mount Sinai also expresses her tremendous thanks for NYLovesCoffee’s regular drop-offs, which arrive every Friday for both day and night-shift workers. (While many organizations regularly deliver food and beverages to hospitals during regular business hours, night-shift workers are often overlooked even though they’re putting in the same Herculean efforts as their daytime counterparts.) “We have so many incredible front-line employees, not only doctors and nurses, but also [those in] food services, engineering, environmental services and more. NYLovesCoffee has really been a lifeline in supporting our communities and something we look forward to week after week,” says Porto. “Every cup of coffee we pour ourselves is an opportunity for us to feel cared for and a reminder of what we’re fighting for during a time when our staff is working tirelessly to save people’s lives.” On a parting note, Atkinson urges us to remember how big an impact these seemingly small gestures have. “Hospital workers always remain positive and when they get their coffee deliveries, they never let us leave without sending back messages of love. Challenges reveal the greatness in people,” he says. “We are currently doing 200 to 500 cups of coffee a day for tens of thousands of cups total. They are swept up the moment we arrive. This helps the small shops and the responders alike, so please keep it coming, New York!” Ready to put some pep in the step of New York City heroes? Visit NYLovesCoffee.com and send a cup of joe on its way to a hospital worker in need of a caffeine lift.

When COVID-19 first struck Boston a few months ago, one of the first calls Boston Medical Center (BMC) CEO Kate Walsh received was from John Hancock’s CEO Marianne Harrison. “She wanted to know how they could help,” says Walsh. BMC serves a proportionately higher number of uninsured and otherwise vulnerable individuals. As a result, BMC depends heavily on the goodwill of others and the generosity of donors. Like many hospitals all over the country, BMC’s COVID-19 efforts are centered around saving the lives of coronavirus patients who need to be hospitalized, and sending those who test positive but are well enough to recover at home to get better and self-isolate. But “that’s a problem when you have no home to go to,” says Walsh. Keeping those individuals in the hospital was not a choice — they needed the beds for patients who were extremely ill. But sending those that are housing insecure and suffering from COVID-19 out into the streets seemed cruel, irresponsible and could lead to bigger problems. Thanks to funding from John Hancock and others working with the Boston Resiliency Fund, BMC was able to open a COVID Recuperation Unit, which has discharged 253 patients to date. But that’s not all. Boston-based John Hancock is the primary sponsor of the Boston Marathon which was due to be held on April 20. The event not only shuts down the city for that day (most workers get the day off) but it also celebrates athletes and raises money for organizations in need, many of which are Boston hospitals. The marathon had to be cancelled, but, the Boston Athletic Association (BAA) and John Hancock found a way to make something good of it by donating 124 Boston Marathon invitational entry bibs to organizations helping COVID-19 patients. These bibs, mind you, are great fundraising vehicles; consider that Massachusetts General Hospital used them to create an Emergency Response Marathon Team after the 2013 Boston Marathon Bombing. The hospital has raised $2.3 million as a result. Dr. David Brown, head of Emergency Medicine at Mass General says that the hospital will receive 15 additional bibs for the September Marathon. Money raised will be used to fund training, conduct drills and to scale up treatment when surges occur. But it’s not only hospital executives who are excited by John Hancock’s generosity. Many of the city’s residents can recite the slogan the company crafted to show its gratitude to COVID-19 frontline workers. “You are essential. We are grateful.” Those words can be seen on doors and windows all over Boston; John Hancock made templates of the sign that kids could print and color available on their Web site. A highly visible expression of gratitude currently lights the skies of Boston. On April 6 John Hancock ignited its historic weather beacon blue — the color of healthcare — and committed to leaving it that way until the Stay at Home order was lifted. “Not long after we lit it, others followed,” says Barbara Goose, John Hancock’s chief marketing officer. “We’re expressing our gratitude and encouraging each other,” says Goose. Still, there was something more that John Hancock felt it could do. They purchased 8,500 meals which were distributed over a period of six days to feed employees at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston Medical Center, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital and Tufts Medical Center. These were not just any meals, according to Goose they were procured and delivered through Off Their Plate which partners with some of the city’s finest restaurants to get meals. “We were grateful to get such fine food,” says Walsh. Not only healthcare workers benefited from this donation — restaurant workers who might have otherwise been laid off became able to earn a paycheck at a time when dining establishments are takeout only or closed. Altruistic giving is not the only thing John Hancock cares about. Its customers and employees rate just as highly. These individuals are sheltering in place, trying to learn how to be productive at home, communicating in new ways, getting their questions answered and more. “We went digital almost overnight,” says Goose, which in some case, required quickly training workers so that customers could be serviced in the usual way, with the addition of one thing: “We trained our call center employees to be even more empathetic,” she says. Caring for employees at John Hancock isn’t an afterthought. At a time like this they have questions, cares, and worries. The company has redoubled its commitment to be fully transparent by offering three communications from executives each week, including a live “Ask me anything” with the CEOs of John Hancock and Manulife, its parent firm. John Hancock has created and provided its employees with access to 60 second videos covering topics such as using your (former) commuting time well, juggling work and caregiving, focusing, coping and more. “It’s been really good to hear from our leaders this often,” says Matt Gibson, head of vitality sales and distribution. Support for employee groups is high. The Global Women’s Alliance offers lunch time meditations during quarantine. Another group looks for alternative ways to celebrate PRIDE in light of its cancellation in nearly every city in the US. “One of John Hancock’s values is to ‘share your humanity,’” says Gibson, explaining that during COVID-19, “we’ve really done that.” He points out that he and his co-workers have literally been invited into each other’s homes via Skype and through conversations that illustrate what their childcare and elder care commitments look like. “We’ve learned that we all need to be flexible,” he says. “In a way, we’ve all become closer.”

Sometimes, it takes a crisis to bring out the best in ourselves, as well as in big business. Since the COVID-19 pandemic hit, essential business services large and small have had to adapt on the fly to customer demand, and all within a whole new set of preventative and safety parameters. Many have risen to the test in order to survive, and even thrive. Some have managed to do so while demonstrating gratitude and empathy through considerable philanthropic endeavors.
 Panera Bread has been able to continue to serve loyal customers throughout the coronavirus ordeal, since most of their 2,174 bakery-cafes across the nation and Canada remained open, says Scott Nelson, vice president of marketing for the company. “Nearly 90 percent of Panera cafes were able to stay open during the crisis with at least curbside, drive-thru or contactless delivery,” he says.
The good news is that it meant the continuation of Panera’s “Day-End Dough-Nation.” “Every night in every cafe, we donate our unsold breads and baked goods to local nonprofits in each of our communities,” says Nelson. “Last year, we donated over $100 million [worth] of baked goods to over 4,000 local nonprofits.” Thankfully for its 140,000 employees, the restaurant chain recognized the valiant efforts of their associates early on in the pandemic, as they quickly adapted to the brand’s off-premise model. The efforts of their delivery workers, in particular, were highlighted through a “From One Neighbor to Another” video commercial campaign. “This effort began early on during the pandemic when our delivery business was crucial to the environment we were living in, and our desire to make sure good, fresh food is accessible to all during this unprecedented time,” says Nelson.  The company reached out to cafe and franchise partners to seek out those drivers they thought the company should shine a light on. Such heartfelt, unscripted editorials were shot on driver smartphones. “We wanted to tell their amazing stories of being on the empty streets, the front lines, safely delivering food across America.” The belief that good food should be accessible to all is a tenet Panera operates by, and has diligently found ways to provide meals to those facing food scarcity during the global health crisis. Through a partnership with the Children’s Hunger Alliance (CHA) and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), Panera is providing freshly prepared, wholesome meals to kids in need in Ohio, says Nelson, and, via local franchise partners, “is leveraging its supply chain and bakery-cafes to provide ready-to-eat, freshly prepared meals to CHA for children vulnerable to hunger across the state.” In conjunction with other nonprofits and local school districts across the country, the company has scaled this model, providing more than 65,000 school meals. “We’re continuing to look for partners who need meals delivered, even during the summer months when school is out,” says Nelson. Building upon their long-standing partnership with domestic hunger-relief organization, Feeding America, Panera mobilized quickly with them to provide freshly prepped meals to people in need through the charity’s network of food banks. The joint altruistic effort is a much-needed boost, since the charity estimates that 17.1 million people could face hunger in the next six months as a result of the pandemic, according to a recent press release. To expand the reach of this collaboration, Panera turned to their online platforms. “Panera has a large social voice [nearly 500,000 Instagram followers] and we wanted to try to use it to do some good during this crisis and help to raise awareness of the need that’s out there right now,” says Nelson. “We launched the #SeeAPlateFillAPlate challenge on Instagram on April 24, inspiring Americans to donate and fill a plate for someone in need,” says Nelson. “To date we’ve been able to provide more than 340,000 meals nationally.” Generosity has also come in musical form. The new single, “Say the Word,” written and performed by Elektra recording artist, Livingston, is providing a portion of the proceeds to Feeding America in partnership with Panera’s Together Without Hunger campaign. 		  Tipping their hats to front-line workers, Panera also launched a Meals for Heroes initiative during National Hospital Week (May 10 to 16). “The project provides a way for local communities to further thank their health-care workers by providing them with a fresh Panera meal and reminder that we appreciate all they are doing for our communities,” says Nelson. It is also designed “to better assist hospitals with the influx of meal orders for front-line workers,” he says. “We have many relationships with hospitals and have been working to support them as they use their own resources and private donations to feed their front-line employees. We quickly realized that some of the friction in providing meals to employees could be solved through our online ordering technology and knowledge of these locations. We’re currently working with 600 participating hospitals nationwide.” Those looking to contribute to Meals for Heroes to give back to health-care workers can visit PaneraBread.com/MealsForHeroes.

When the going gets tough, the tough spring into action. With the coronavirus pandemic affecting every corner of the corporate world, top companies across the country have not only pivoted to protect their employees and their businesses, but have also extended their philanthropic outreach to those impacted by the crisis. In light of their important outreach, on Friday June 5, keynote speakers from Fortune 500 firms will be gathering for Brands Across America, a live, online event to talk about the public-spirited efforts their companies are embarking on, and how they are learning and growing from the unique challenges of the COVID-19 era. Hosted by Brand Innovators, the online event will be livestreamed by the New York Post at NYPost.com/Brands-Across-America, beginning at 10 a.m. “After hearing so many wonderful stories from our friends in the brand marketing community about how they are giving back to their consumers, we decided to document these acts of kindness in a full-blown virtual event,” says Marc Sternberg, co-founder and co-CEO of Brand Innovators. Sternberg’s aim is to galvanize support among other companies, both big and small. “We hope that the brand marketers and other people who tune in to Brands Across America will be inspired by our event and the stories that their fellow brand marketers share on our virtual stage,” he says.
There will certainly be top talent on board for the fireside chats, namely: After each fireside chat, there will be an opportunity for the audience to ask questions. Brand Innovators was established in 2011 by Sternberg and co-founder and co-CEO Brandon Gutman to “provide senior brand marketers from Fortune 500 and other leading brands with continuing digital education, to help them stay on top of all of the new and emerging technologies, platforms, channels and devices that were changing how brands engage with and build long-term relationships with their consumers,” says Gutman. It’s now the largest community (25,000 members) of senior brand marketers from leading brands in America.
In more usual times, ‍Brand Innovators produces live events all over the country, with typical gatherings featuring 20 to 25 senior brand marketers. These professionals share best practices and success stories, and explain how they use new and emerging digital technologies to form customer loyalty and long-term relationships. “We also produce over 100 virtual events throughout the year,” says Gutman. These feature livecasts, roundtables and happy hours.

The Jets will be wrapping up their virtual offseason program next week and will not conduct an in-person minicamp this month, according to sources. The NFL has yet to clear teams to hold minicamps, but there has been speculation teams might try to gather later this month to hold some practices. The Jets are going to finish up with their virtual sessions next week and then reconvene for training camp, which is scheduled to begin at the end of July. This offseason has been unlike any other for NFL teams, as COVID-19 restrictions have kept teams out of their training centers. Typically, teams have offseason practices beginning in April and continuing through June, ending with a three-day mandatory minicamp. This year, teams have had to conduct meetings through video conferences. Submit your Jets questions here to be answered in an upcoming Post mailbag The Jets began their program on April 27 and will wrap it up next week. The Jets reopened their training center in Florham Park on Wednesday on a limited basis. Only a limited number of people from their football operations, IT department, medical staff and personnel staff were working on site. No coaches have been permitted to return yet. The NFL said last week that head coaches may be permitted to return by the end of this week. Even if some coaches and staff return to the facility soon, it seems like players will not be back until late July.

The other day, speaking to a veteran player representative, I emphasized that I try not to be naive, try not to be corny, but that I thought baseball needed a hero right now. Someone who both players and owners trusted to broker a resolution. Someone who could make them see a bigger picture of what was good for the game. And I told the representative, sadly, that I did not see that person within the game, in politics, in business. But watching the unrest in the country brought a recognition that I was shooting too low with my bigger picture — what was good for the game. This is no time to be myopic. Not when coronavirus has killed more than 100,000, disproportionately raining death on African-Americans. Not when a police officer in 2020 can still drop his knee into another man’s neck draining George Floyd’s life while three other officers look on and we have to wonder if justice will prevail. The hero we need is Jackie Robinson, and baseball — owners, players, representatives, executives — must embrace the most important person in its history not just to solve its squabble, but to again be an agent of change for the nation. There is so much wrong with our game — our national pastime — but breaking the color line in 1947 is a triumph. There were people on the wrong side of that issue then and history exposed their irrational hatred and fear and stupidity. History will do the same to anyone now trying to find some other-siderism to how brutally we police, incarcerate and treat people of color in this country. Consider that if we watched a police officer in France or Russia or Brazil put his knee into an American citizen’s neck on their soil and kill him while three of his comrades looked on, we collectively as a nation would be ready to go to war with that country. Especially if such abuses had taken place over and over for centuries. Especially if we appreciated that if this one was caught on camera, how many of these atrocities are not? So how is there not 100-percent cohesion in the United States that this MUST STOP? It is not going to end without people of influence making relentless demands until real change happens. It is not going to stop without real money backing the best of our angels against devils who would mislead, misdirect and find justification in brutalizing our own citizens. So this is where MLB comes in. This is where Jackie Robinson’s legacy should matter. How about the owners and players — in Robinson’s name — agree to something along the lines of the following: That the players will play for 50 percent of their prorated salaries this year and that the other 50 percent will be donated jointly from the two sides to mutually agreed upon organizations that fight for equality, that support the most vulnerable in our society, that need dollars earmarked specifically for them in the areas of health and science. This is hundreds of millions of dollars. Do it over 10 years so if owners are really having short-term cash flow issues it does not get in the way of the long-term good. Do it in the name and lingering importance and values of Jackie Robinson. Who says no to this? Maybe MLB can’t play anyway in 2020 because the coronavirus ultimately will not allow it — everyone should be concerned that the sardine-jammed protests will foster new waves and that two Japanese baseball players tested positive already and that there has been a new Ebola outbreak in the Congo. But MLB is not at an impasse because of the virus. The two sides can find common ground on safety measures to at least try to play. This is about money. So put the disputed money to better use and rise to a better place together. There is much imperfect with baseball, including poor representation of people of color in roles from manager to owner. But what Robinson withstood in threat and hatred has produced on the field as close to meritocracy as we get in society. I would never say bias is 100-percent dead, but largely skin color, nation or origin; none of that matters much. If you can play, you can play and you do play. MLB can showcase that. The sport could have its most prominent voices not only thanking our first responders and medical personnel that are risking so much during this pandemic, but we can see Jose Altuve and Aaron Judge and Hyun-jin Ryu and Masahiro Tanaka and Mike Trout kneeling in solidarity, offering words of unity and mostly showing how seamlessly people from so many different backgrounds can work together for a common good. You know, showing not only the best of our national pastime, but of our nation. We need a hero to get there. I offer the best hero not just in our game, but one of the most important in American history. Jackie Robinson.

Hospitals have always been filled with heroes, even before the COVID-19 pandemic set in. A new docu-series on Netflix, “Lenox Hill,” serves as a timely reminder with its compelling look at the pre-coronavirus work done behind the walls of that titular New York hospital system. The show, which premieres June 10, was filmed over about 18 months between spring 2018 and fall 2019 — before the global pandemic took hold — at the hospital’s facility on the Upper East Side and its emergency room in Greenwich Village. That seemingly long-ago world, as documented on film, was quite different from the overrun hospitals that have struggled to contain the novel virus. “What I would tell myself, if I had a crystal ball before COVID, is, ‘Get ready,’ ” says documentary subject Dr. John Boockvar, the hospital’s vice-chair of neurosurgery, in an exclusive interview with The Post. “The current day, during the pandemic, was unlike anything we’ve ever seen,” he says. “Not just [us] in the documentary but any health-care professional. We never had a day like we had during the pandemic.” The eight-part series follows two brain surgeons (including Boockvar), an emergency room physician and a chief obstetrics-gynecology resident as they and their colleagues relay good news and bad to patients and navigate the emotional highs and lows of hospital life. The other documentary subjects include: In the show, the highs and lows encompass a broad spectrum. On one end, Langer is greeted by a smiling, 28-year-old Brooklyn patient who tells him following successful brain surgery, “I think you just saved my life.” And a visibly touched Macri is surprised with a baby shower before she takes maternity leave for several months. “This is honestly the best place to work,” she says before heading back to her department to see what emergencies have arisen. On the other end, Langer must grapple with another patient whose health takes a “very, very unfortunate” turn. “Complications are not things that I take lightly, and certainly in the vascular world it happens,” a pensive Langer says while biting his lip and trying to keep his emotions in check. “But this was, um, just hard to take.” The emotional drama and behind-the-scenes moments may be of particular interest to viewers today, says Boockvar, because of the spotlight that COVID-19 has shined on front-line workers since the crisis began. “I think that viewers are more curious — now, more than ever — about what happens in hospitals, particularly here in New York City, because of COVID,” Boockvar says. “I think, frankly, the docu-series is coming at a very opportune time because there’s a thirst, a real appetite for what health-care heroes do on a day-to-day basis.” And he makes certain to point out that the series isn’t the stuff of a fictional medical TV drama. “We didn’t fake it,” he says. “This is a documentary that its intent was to tell the truth and to show and expose the beauty of what goes on inside these great walls of hospitals across the nation and really to tell the stories of the patients and their suffering, and their success, and their crying, and the laughing, and the joys and the tears that go with it.” Of course, what the audience sees in the pre-pandemic series — routine childbirth, brain surgeries and lesions in need of lancing — is drastically different from what medical professionals are doing these days. Boockvar says the pandemic surge between approximately mid-March and mid-April saw the health-care system put to the test. With elective surgeries on hold, many specialized physicians found themselves assisting in other areas. For instance, Boockvar and his team were “redeployed” to run the hospital’s COVID-19 clinical trial program that offered “novel drugs and therapeutics,” which he calls “extremely interesting and fruitful.” And even with resources pushed to capacity, Boockvar is awed by what was accomplished. “We all worked 24/7 to make sure that we held the line,” he says. “We did not let the front fall here in New York. I’m quite proud of how well everybody did.” Boockvar admits that “before the coronavirus, life was different,” but he also sees a silver lining to the enduring pandemic. “I mean, we have changed as a health-care industry, as physicians, as nurses, as respiratory therapists — we’re all different,” he says. “We’ve improved in a lot of ways what we know were inefficiencies in the health-care system prior to the coronavirus. So, frankly, we’re more efficient now than we were before COVID. We have safety measures in place that we didn’t have before COVID.” Boockvar — whose father, grandfather, great-grandfather, uncle and brother have all been doctors — hopes that means an eventual return to so-called normalcy. Or better. “I think that the hospitals will actually get back to a superior sense of normalcy, meaning that we were normal before COVID, we had COVID and now we’re actually going to be even better than we were for having gone through COVID,” he says.

In his first seven months back coaching Rutgers football, Greg Schiano built a heralded recruiting class. He hired a staff quick to adapt to teaching through Webex meetings to players dispersed around the world. He listened to leading experts on the dangers of the coronavirus — some of whom come from Rutgers Medical School — and to emotional reactions to social injustice. What’s missing? “We have not lined up 11 guys on offense, defense or kick team and run through a play,” Schiano told The Post. “But we are not complaining. What we would install in one day if we were practicing, we have taken a week to install. Hopefully, from a mental standpoint, players will have a more thorough understanding.” Coronavirus restrictions canceled most college football spring camps — a challenge for all but especially first-year staffs with new playbooks. Rutgers University’s dormitories are closed and classes moved online through Aug. 14. In conjunction with direction from New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, the basketball teams could return to campus June 22. Football could be sooner.  “We are going to do everything we can to do it as soon as we can, but certainly not at the cost of being any way unsafe,” Schiano said. “You can’t swing and miss on this one. There is no margin for error.” The NCAA and Big Ten permitted athletes to resume voluntary individual on-campus workouts earlier this week. Some schools are delayed. So, coaches must accept they can’t control what will not be a completely level playing field of season preparation. “I spend very little time thinking of that,” Schiano said. “How can we remedy our own situation and make the best gains?” With no on-field drills to lead, Schiano’s focus is on recruiting and big-picture program development. He will drop in on an occasional position meeting, but much of the day-to-day instruction is left to assistants. Players can receive up to eight hours per week of coaching, per NCAA rules. Strength and conditioning coaches can watch voluntary at-home training, but most players don’t have home gyms like the pros. They eventually will return to new regulations. “Certainly it’s going to be smaller gatherings because you decrease the risk,” Schiano said. “We are in the middle of working out those details. Nothing is off the table, but nothing has been decided either.” Where Schiano has an advantage over other first-year coaches is in recruiting. Trust established during Schiano’s first 11-year stint with Rutgers — resulting in six bowl berths — and maintained after leaving in 2012 is seen in a 2021 class of 20 verbal commitments ranked No. 19 nationally by 247Sports.com. About 10 former Rutgers coaches and players and two ex-New Jersey high school coaches returned to this staff. There is a popular theory the pandemic, quarantine and travel restrictions will lead to more college recruits staying close to home and more teams eliminating risks by prioritizing in-state. That remains to be seen, Schiano said, but the elimination of summer camps helpful in identifying future recruits certainly emphasizes strong backyard relationships.  “These kids were 4 or 5 years old when we were winning big-time games around here,” Schiano said, “so it’s not in their wheelhouse. Really, what we are doing is being real: This is who we are. Then you get players who really want to be part of it.” The NCAA is considering an expanded six-week training camp. Rutgers is scheduled to open Sept. 5 against Monmouth and planning for an uninterrupted season.  “It gives your whole organization a goal you are working toward,” Schiano said. “If the date moves, then we’ll adjust. Until someone tells us we are not opening that weekend, we are opening that weekend.”

On the bright side, no one calls baseball “boring” at the moment. These heated negotiations to restart the 2020 season continue to entertain, even as they present absolutely terrible optics to a country coping simultaneously with a social crisis and a pandemic. Here are three thoughts on the latest developments: 1. If you’re wondering whether or how this collective bargaining differs from other turbulent talks that landed smoothly, look no further than the quote that Major League Baseball deputy commissioner Dan Halem gave in a text to The Post’s Joel Sherman on Monday night: “The one piece of good news out of [Sunday’s] meeting is that Tony Clark acknowledged that the March Agreement contemplated another negotiation over player salaries if the 2020 season could not be played in front of fans. We were concerned, based on media reports, if players knew that. Tony told us the players were aware that the March Agreement did not resolve the issue of player salaries in a season without fans. And he said the players’ decision to accept nothing less than 100 percent of their prorated salaries was due to the risks of playing the season, not because they were promised it in the March 26 agreement.” Halem is not accusing Clark of being unreasonable, or intransigent, or just plain wrong. He is questioning Clark’s competence, his process of disseminating information to his constituents. You don’t see much of that in these sagas. Halem could have been referring to reports like The Post’s last week, when Noah Syndergaard, amid a Twitter battle on another subject, accused MLB of going back on its word from the aforementioned March 26 deal. Extensive evidence exists that many players did not understand that, even after agreeing to prorate their salaries for this coronavirus-shortened campaign, MLB owned the right to at least try to take another bite of the apple. Tensions between the owners and players ran crazy high from the 1970s through the 1990s, leading to more work stoppages than “Fast and Furious” movies. They hated each other’s guts, and the players proved thrice, through an independent arbitrator, that owners colluded to suppress the free-agent market from 1985 through 1987. Yet would you rather believe that your partners/foes are malicious, as the players felt then, or inept, as the owners believe now? We’ll see which poison proves worse. 2. The 30-60-game season very likely won’t happen. It sounds like MLB didn’t offer this during Sunday’s virtual meeting as much as wryly mention it as a possibility that would give the players their prorated pay while not financially overextending the owners. Everyone knows how silly such a short schedule would look, especially with the decks clearing to hold a three-month regular season plus expanded playoffs in October. Even floating the notion does accomplish something, however: It yanks the moral high ground from under the players’ collective feet. Who can’t sympathize with the players’ desires to receive their full prorated income for putting themselves in harm’s way? Shoot, you can contend quite easily they deserve more than their prorated percentage. No owner will be sharing close quarters or risking collisions with other people while the coronavirus lingers, after all. But the only argument for more games, as opposed to higher pay per game, covers finance and statistical/historic merit, not what’s ethically right. Proposing the “fewer games/higher pay” concept would be like taking away Jacob deGrom’s slider. Though he can still prevail without it … he’d rather have it. 3. For all the understandable talk of Clark’s effectiveness and questions about his job security, it’s Rob Manfred and the owners who can lose the most. Folks rightly fault Bud Selig, not Donald Fehr, for canceling the 1994 World Series. Owners count on their franchises to increase in value, yet can that occur when those franchises don’t take the field? You’d think the owners would keep this in mind as they proceed here. Wouldn’t it make more sense for them to take a short-term hit — massive deferred player compensation still appears so darn logical — and live to fight another day than take a hard line now and severely damage those franchise values?

The company that administers the SAT college entrance exam is scrapping plans to provide a home version of the test this year, saying it can’t guarantee all students would have access to the needed technology. The College Board announced Tuesday that it’s pausing plans for the remote exam but still hopes to make it possible in the future. Offering the test at home would have required three hours of uninterrupted internet access, the company said. Officials in April said they were creating a home exam in case schools remained closed into the fall because of the coronavirus pandemic. Instead of offering the test on paper under a proctor’s supervision, the company said it would rely on “remote proctoring” using the computer’s camera and microphone. Instead, the College Board said that it’s working to expand the availability of the SAT at in-person test centers this fall, and it’s asking colleges to be more flexible with testing requirements. “There are more important things than tests right now,” said David Coleman, CEO of the College Board. “In making these difficult decisions we focused on reducing the anxiety that students and families are experiencing this year.” The company that owns the rival ACT exam said Tuesday that it’s continuing with previously announced plans for a home exam to be offered in late fall. A spokeswoman for the company said more details will be released in coming weeks. The College Board announced its change weeks after thousands of students ran into technical glitches while trying to submit online versions of the company’s Advanced Placement exams. Nearly 20,000 of the more than 4.6 million timed tests taken at home resulted in errors, according to data from the College Board. Students who were unable to submit their tests will likely have to retake them, officials said. For the SAT, the company is asking colleges to accept test scores as late as possible, to give equal consideration to students who were unable to take the test because of the coronavirus, and to recognize that students may have been unable to retake the test. The three-hour, multiple choice test measures math and English language arts proficiency. Most colleges require SAT or ACT exam scores as part of the application process, though an increasing number of institutions have made them optional in recent years, often to be more inclusive of students without access to private test preparation. The University of California system decided in May it would phase out consideration of the SAT and ACT. Critics of the tests have long argued that they put students of color and low-income students at a disadvantage, saying the test questions are slanted in a way that makes privileged children better equipped to answer and that those with privilege also have access to better preparation. The College Board has denied that the test is discriminatory. In-person SAT testing is scheduled to resume in August after spring exams were canceled. But many testing centers will have fewer seats amid social distancing measures, the company said, and some dates may be unexpectedly canceled. Although only a quarter of seats have been filled for August testing nationally, some states hit hard by the virus are already nearing capacity, the company said. Massachusetts is already at 75% capacity for August, while Rhode Island, New Jersey and Washington state are about 60% full. The company said it will add a January 2021 test date if there’s demand.

Meet some happy campers. Sales professional Bennett Prescott, 36, and his family usually spend summers adventuring far from their home in Wallingford, Conn. His job keeps him traveling more than half the year anyway, while his 38-year-old science-teacher wife,  Selena Gell, gets time off. Last year, the couple, with toddler Jacob, made stops in Fire Island, NY; Oregon; Italy and Norway. But as coronavirus risks loom for the third month and protests crop up across the country, a mobile retreat in rural America seems like the ideal escape. So in May, Prescott and Gell booked a 32-foot-long RV through rent-from-owner listings site RVShare. On Saturday, they packed camping gear, cooking supplies, their bikes and pup Edison into their new house-on-wheels — a Class A 2015 Thor Motor Coach Ace 30.2 — and headed west. “I’m a lot happier on this trip, where we have a lot of distractions and goals to look forward to and beautiful places to stay,” says Prescott, who is avoiding stops in major cities as riots ripple through them in response to George Floyd’s death last week at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer. The family, wearing masks and staying far from others to prevent virus transmission, has a flexible itinerary. “We’re going to plan as we go. It’s thrilling.” Akin to protected bubbles, RVs allow for easy movement while maintaining social-distancing and quarantine-like conditions. Their allure during the pandemic and civil unrest is undeniable: RV rentals have increased 1,000 percent since April, while RV sales jumped 600 percent in the same time period, according to the RV Industry Association and Kampgrounds of America (KOA). More than 25 million Americans will go RVing this summer, estimates the association, which also found that 80 percent of recent buyers are first-time owners. Indeed, Prescott and Gell’s six-week-long trip — on a route that will take them to Gell’s family in Rockaway Beach, Ore., and back via California, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana and Georgia with stops at the Grand Canyon and Utah’s Arches National Park — marks their first foray into this type of travel. One of their first overnight stays, at Greene Eagle Winery in Cortland, Ohio, was blissfully quiet. “There’s nobody here across 60 acres,” Prescott says. While Prescott and Gell have experience backpacking and car camping, they were still getting accustomed to handling their somewhat “ungainly” RV rental, which has proved “bouncy and loud” during five-hour stretches on the highway. “It’s much better when it’s parked,” Prescott jokes. “The mornings are great. You wake up in your little house on a winery, let the dog out, make coffee. It’s really lovely.” “We expect RVs to continue to gain traction as a preferred method of travel while consumers are seeking flexible options and a unique way to experience the outdoors,” says Jon Gray, CEO of RVShare. Its rental prices — comparable to other popular companies like Cruise America and Outdoorsy — generally range from $50 to $100 per night for a pop-up trailer to $175 to $275 per night for a Class A vehicle like Prescott’s. Meanwhile, Janine Pettit, 60, grew up camping with her family and had high hopes of instilling a similar passion in her husband Rick, 66. “That’s not what happened,” jokes the Princeton, NJ-based empty nester, although Rick occasionally meets her on her travels. So, in 2007, Pettit began organizing trips for solo women, founding the Web site GirlCamper.com and blogging for advice-oriented Go RVing. Pettit tows a 2019 19-foot Off Road Max teardrop trailer by Xtreme Outdoors for weekend trips to the Poconos, the Jersey Shore or Camp Taylor in Columbia, NJ. And she’s looking forward to driving to Kennebunkport, Maine, in August — all while wearing her mask in public and cleaning her hands often. Campground spots are spaced at a safe distance apart, Pettit notes, and her “little house on wheels” is completely self-contained with a bed, kitchen, toilet and shower. It was in Yellowstone, standing before a waterfall, that she had an epiphany about national parks: “They’re for everyone, whether you’re in a Class A or a van.” The equalizing power of the great outdoors could offer solace during turbulent times, she adds. “RVing and camping is going to be a route that’s so important to people until our country finds its way. People are stressed and need to get out in nature. It’s healing,” says Pettit, adding that the RV community is known for welcoming all comers, including her interracial family. “When you’re outside, you can decompress and restore. Nature takes you out of a state of trauma.” Aspiring road-trippers, be warned: With many campgrounds closed or operating at a limited capacity in response to the coronavirus, reservations are filling fast. An increased demand for RVs is also making them harder to secure. Pettit advises either advance planning or remaining ready to pounce if last-minute cancellations arise. You don’t need to worry about renting, though, if you buy your own house on wheels. Entrepreneur Jesse Itzler, 51, and his wife Sara Blakely, 49, founder and CEO of Spanx, caught the RV bug last year. Along with their four children, who are all under age 10, they camped across Idaho, Wyoming and Montana, visiting state parks along the way. “I love being outside,” Itzler says. “You can pull over and jump into a watering hole anytime. It’s a great way to keep the family contained and see the country with the freedom to create your own timeline.” So in April, Itzler took the plunge and purchased a 35-foot 2020 Thor Magnitude Super C Class for summer travel from their Atlanta home. That month, they drove to Florida with stops in Clearwater Beach, St. Augustine and Savannah, Ga. With their kids still in school remotely, Itzler describes their sojourn as “one-part home school, one-part ‘Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure’ and one-part summer camp.” Later this summer, the family plans to drive up the East Coast to Connecticut and then out west to Michigan and Montana. Itzler, who grew up in New York without much driving experience, has also had to confront the less glamorous underbelly of the vehicle: the power, septic system and water tanks. “I’m not super handy,” he admits, “but the learning curve is part of the fun.” “We’ve contacted friends and encouraged them to rent RVs and meet up with us this summer,” says Itzler. “There are benefits to flying. I love that privilege. But RVing is literally like having a vacation home on wheels. Home is wherever you park. The party is wherever you park.”

With trips to the ocean and lakes canceled because of the coronavirus and a long hot summer looming ahead, the idea of installing a backyard swimming pool couldn’t be more tempting. That is until the pain of sticker shock sets in since the average cost of building an in-ground pool is a whopping $35,000. Not wanting to risk ridicule about the aesthetic — or definite lack thereof — of a much cheaper plastic above-ground pool, hipsters have come up with the perfect solution: lounging around in stock tank pools, essentially a giant cattle trough filled with water. In other words, so-called “hillbilly hot tubs” are having a renaissance. Instagram is chock-full of supercool images of galvanized steel stock tanks — purchased from farm stores such as Tractor Supply Co. for between $300 and $600 — which creative fans of farmhouse design are customizing as pools. They include influencers Savannah McNeill and Casey Freeman, of the Instagram page Hey Wanderer, who have an 8-foot-diameter stock tank pool in their yard in Nashville, Tennessee. “We love it,” McNeill, 32, tells The Post of the tank, which holds 700 gallons of water. “It’s the ideal place to cool off in the heat. “It was tight, but we’ve even gotten eight adults in there at once.” She says while it might cost a little more than an above-ground pool, it will last longer, look better and require less maintenance. Such is the demand for stock tank pools, that McNeill and Freeman have launched a website called StockTankPoolAuthority showing people how to assemble them and buy accessories such as filters and pumps. “The page had 6,000 followers when we started it last year, but since the pandemic, it’s gone up to more than 18,000,” adds McNeill. “This spring and early summer, things have gone crazy.”

NYPD cops have been ignoring an official directive and abandoning their coronavirus face masks amid the violent protests over George Floyd’s killing — even though a top official took on the city’s health commissioner to get the protective gear. Dramatic images from recent street clashes show cops with surgical masks pulled beneath their chins or not wearing any at all while up close and personal with demonstrators whose mouths and noses are likewise fully exposed. Mayor Bill de Blasio has warned that the ongoing rallies — which entered their sixth day on Tuesday — could lead to a spike in cases of COVID-19, and he’s urged demonstrators to “stay home,” saying, “You’ve made your point.” Chief of Department Terence Monahan has also been repeatedly photographed without a mask in public, including when he held hands and kneeled in solidarity with unmasked protesters in Washington Square Park on Monday. Last month, The Post exclusively revealed that Monahan had to appeal directly to City Hall when Health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot ignored his desperate plea for 500,000 masks to protect NYPD cops and civilian employees from the deadly respiratory ailment. Christopher Sadowski Taidgh Barron/NY Post Stephen Yang Stephen Yang Stephen Yang POLARIS View Slideshow “I don’t give two rats’ asses about your cops,” Barbot told Monahan at the time. Barbot publicly apologized for the remark following The Post’s expose. During a May 22 meeting of the City Council’s Public Safety Committee, NYPD Assistant Deputy Commissioner of Legal Matters Oleg Chernyavsky said cops were under orders to wear masks as per “the protocol that we’ve instituted” to respond to the pandemic. “If they’re interacting with the public, they’re obligated to wear masks,” Chernyavsky testified. A high-ranking NYPD source said the situation surrounding the protests made it impractical for cops to wear face masks. “They’re not wearing them because they can’t breathe. It’s hot. You’re standing there for a long time,” the police official said. “Those masks aren’t for running. They’re heavy. The more you walk and move it’s harder to breathe.” Another NYPD source said, “Cops aren’t wearing masks with their helmets because it fogs up visors and it’s hard to breathe when you’re fighting.” Neither City Hall nor the NYPD immediately returned requests for comment.

RIO RANCHO, N.M. — Childhood disparities around malnutrition, graduation rates, and early deaths are worst among rural, black-majority counties in the American South and isolated counties with Native American populations, according to a new report. Those inequities put these populations more at risk for the novel coronavirus, the report by Save the Children concludes. “The Land of Inopportunity: Closing the Childhood Equity Gap for America’s Kids” report released Tuesday found that children in the most disadvantaged counties die at rates up to five times of children in the same state. Children in those counties also are 14 times as likely to drop out of school and are three times as likely to lack healthy food and consistent meals, the report said. Using federal data from 2018 and examining more 2,600 counties and their equivalents, the report found that about a third of the 50 worst counties are majority African American and a quarter are majority Native American. The counties and census areas of Kusilvak (Alaska), Todd (South Dakota), Madison (Louisana), Carson (South Dakota), and Bethel (Alaska) were the five worst-ranked, the report found. Todd County lies entirely within the Rosebud Indian Reservation and Madison Parish is 61% black. “These are just stunning statistics,” said Mark K. Shriver, senior vice president of U.S. programs & advocacy at Save the Children. “Children growing up rural areas, for instance, are more likely to die before their first birthday at a rate to 20% than in large urban areas.” The inequality comes from the lack of early childhood education, health care, and job training options in those areas, the report said. So far, children in some of the poor counties cited in the report live among the areas hardest hit by COVID-19. New Mexico’s McKinley County, which sits on the Navajo Nation — a tribe suffering amid the pandemic — is ranked near the bottom in child hunger and graduation rates. According to the report, Louisiana, Mississippi, and New Mexico are the lowest-ranked states for these childhood disparities. New Jersey, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire earned the highest marks. Save the Children recommends states and local governments invest more in early childhood education programs. The report comes more than a half-century after the late U.S. Sen. Robert Kennedy — Shriver’s uncle — embarked on a tour across the country to highlight the nation’s most impoverished regions. Kennedy visited Mississippi and South Dakota’s Pine Ridge Indian Reservation and was transformed by the hunger and inequality he saw. It also comes more than a half-century after President Lyndon Johnson’s Kerner Commission report, which sought to examine urban poverty and riots across the nation. Former U.S. Sen. Fred Harris of Oklahoma, the last surviving member of the Kerner Commission, said he’s not surprised by the report since the number of U.S. residents in poverty has grown in 50 years. “And most of that growth in poverty has been among children,” Harris said from his home in Corrales, New Mexico. “This is a great unfairness in our system.”

ATHENS, Greece — Greece is preparing to admit tourists from all over the world this summer but will be adhering to the advice of health experts to ensure it remains a safe destination in terms of coronavirus exposure, the country’s tourism minister said Tuesday. “Every tourist is welcome. … This has been a very stressful year for everyone, and the refilling of the batteries is the call of the day,” Tourism Minister Harry Theoharis said.. “But of course, we will have to wait for the experts, for the international bodies, to say when this is safe to do so,” “We don’t want to put at risk the people that visit us. And, of course, our population,” Theoharis told The Associated Press in an interview. The government imposed a lockdown early in Greece’s coronavirus outbreak, a move credited with holding infections to a level considerably lower than many other parts of Europe. Greece had a total of just over 2,900 confirmed cases and 179 deaths as of Tuesday, with no new virus-related deaths recorded in the previous 24 hours. Eleven people remained intubated in intensive care units. Lockdown restrictions have been gradually eased to the point where life is almost back to normal. But the country is heavily dependent on tourism, and the government has been eager to attract foreign visitors and help shore up the economy, which is only just emerging from a brutal decade-long financial crisis that wiped out a quarter of the GDP Authorities are now faced with the delicate balancing act of promoting Greece as a safe, attractive destination while ensuring that visitors don’t trigger a new outbreak. One illustration of the gamble involved came Tuesday, when authorities announced that 12 passengers on a Monday flight from Doha, Qatar, had tested positive. Greece’s Civil Protection Agency said it was suspending flights from Qatar until June 15. Currently, all arriving passengers to Greece are required to undergo tests and to pend the night in a designated hotel until the results come through. “The point is not to stop every economic activity in order to help the health situation, but it’s actually to find this balance, and for that, you need your health experts to guide you,” Theoharis said. One of those health experts, epidemiologist Gkikas Magiorkinis, told the AP that given current trends, the coronavirus outbreak in Greece was “in a trajectory of elimination. If we did not have other imported cases, it would be a matter of a month at most” for the virus to be stamped out in the country. But new cases will almost certainly arrive when Greece opens to tourists, he said. “Yes, we are worried because we know that globally the epidemic is a result of people moving around the world,” Magiorkinis said. “The question is how fast we will be able to contain the incoming cases. Because it will happen. There is no question that we will have incoming cases.” The government has outlined a two-part schedule for jump-starting tourism. As of June 15, visitors will be able to fly into Athens or the northern city of Thessaloniki. Direct international flights to regional airports, including on islands, will be allowed from July 1. Greece last week announced that visitors from 29 countries would be subject to random coronavirus testing and no quarantine, rather than the compulsory tests for every passenger and quarantines that currently apply. The announcement angered some nations, including neighboring Italy, that were not included. However, the government later clarified the measures referred to flights originating from specific airports rather than countries. Greece, it said, is basing its decisions on a European Aviation Safety Agency list of airports with high risk of coronavirus transmission. Visitors can still fly to Greece from those airports, but will be subject to compulsory testing, and either a seven-day self-quarantine period if they test negative for coronavirus, or a 14-day supervised quarantine if they are found positive. “Perhaps it was a misunderstanding that we’re blocking entire countries or anything of the sort. This is not what we intended to convey,” Theoharis said. He said the European agency’s list of high-risk airports was subject to change and airports could be removed as their regional public health situations improve. For example, Rome’s international airport is not on the EASA list, he noted. “We’re not actually blocking countries, but airports. And, you know, that shows that this is not about specific passports or nations,” Theoharis said.

Alcoholism. Drug overdoses. Suicide. These “deaths of despair” could reach 150,000 in the U.S. if more isn’t done to provide access to mental health care, increase emotional well-being, mitigate social isolation and blunt the impact of an economic downturn that has wiped away at least 40 million jobs, researchers warn. “More Americans could lose their lives to deaths of despair, deaths due to drug, alcohol, and suicide, if we do not do something immediately,” the executive summary of the study released in May by Well Being Trust states. “Deaths of despair have been on the rise for the last decade, and in the context of COVID-19, deaths of despair should be seen as the epidemic within the pandemic.” According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ National Survey on Drug Use and Health, there were 57.8 million Americans living with mental and/or substance use disorder in 2018, a number that doesn’t reflect the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. “Currently, suicide is the 10th-leading cause of death in our nation,” said Elinore F. McCance-Katz, the HHS assistant secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use, in a statement. “We know the stressors that are accompanying this pandemic – job loss and financial instability, anxiety, grief, depression and other factors – can lead to suicide and suicide attempts.” The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration announced on May 13 a $40 million grant program for suicide prevention efforts as part of the government’s response to the pandemic. The Well Being Trust study estimates anywhere from 27,644 to 154,037 additional deaths of despair in the U.S., depending on how quickly the economy recovers. However, the study’s authors note that their projections are based on data from the 2008 Great Recession – many economists believe this downturn is much worse – and don’t take into account developments in telemedicine and other forms of digital social connection. Therefore, the study’s numbers should be seen as estimates and not foregone conclusions. Due to social distancing measures that have slowed the spread of the virus, many health care programs and well-being services aren’t as accessible. “Many of the hospitals with dedicated beds for client detox had to reassign them to treat the influx of COVID-19 or critical patients, which limits the available treatment for those clients in acute withdrawal,” said Ellery Tarife, a certified nurse practitioner who oversees the outpatient withdrawal management program at CarePlus NJ. “Many private substance use disorder treatment facilities have limited their capacity and decreased their admissions, while some have even closed their doors for the time being.” CarePlus NJ, a nonprofit organization that offers a range of mental health care, substance abuse prevention and recovery-focused primary care services, is still providing therapeutic services – either virtually or in-person – during the pandemic. For people who are struggling in more extreme ways, Tarife may see them in weekly sessions, and clients can still come into the office for face-to-face visits if they need them. “In addition to the social isolation, skyrocketing unemployment rates and the fear and uncertainty surrounding the virus can serve as triggers to continued or increased substance use,” explained Tarife. “Clients can relapse, or increase their current usage while isolated, and without the appropriate checks and balances associated with treatment and support groups, things can escalate.” CarePlus’ Addiction Recovery Services program takes what it calls a “holistic approach” to addiction treatment by offering a wide range of outpatient services, as well as psychiatric evaluations, support groups and therapy, based on the needs of each person. As of Monday afternoon, there were almost 1.8 million infections and at least 104,584 deaths in the U.S. from COVID-19.

Mayor Bill de Blasio struggled to explain Tuesday why large religious gatherings remain banned and businesses deemed nonessential are still closed under coronavirus-related orders as thousands pack city streets to protest the death of George Floyd. “When you see a nation — an entire nation — grappling with an extraordinary crisis that’s deep-seated in 400 years of American racism,” a peevish de Blasio told a reporter during an hour-long press conference. “Sorry, that is not the same question as the understandably aggrieved store owner or the devout religious person who wants to go back to religious services.” “It’s about the deep, deep American crisis,” Hizzoner added. “I have eyes to see. We’re not going to treat it like it’s any other day, we’re not going to treat it like ‘why are people outside the bar.’ It was one in a slew of contentious exchanges between a visibly exhausted de Blasio and the City Hall press corps, following the Big Apple’s fifth night unrest in the aftermath of Floyd’s death. Hizzoner also attempted to explain the differing treatment by pointing to scientific research that shows there is less risk to contracting the disease from activities outside than inside. “It’s only been a few days,” of protests, De Blasio said. “It’s also been people outdoors, which, thank god, means less spread than when people are indoors.” Businesses, he added, will be able to begin to get back to work when New York City begins “Phase 1” of its pandemic reopening plan, which is still scheduled for Monday. Large religious services are approved to begin again under “Phase 2.” Floyd, who lived in Minneapolis, died on May 25 as he was arrested and violently detained by local cops over allegations he used a fake $20 bill to buy cigarettes. One of the police officers, Derek Chauvin, was captured on tape kneeling on Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes as the African-American said he couldn’t breathe. Chauvin was charged later charged in connection with his murder after protests — some of which turned violent — broke out across the country, including in New York City.

Safe sex during the coronavirus pandemic might soon require protection beyond just the nether regions. A new study from researchers at Harvard University says that hooking up carries some risk for transmitting COVID-19 from one partner to the other and recommends — among other practices — wearing a face mask while doin’ it. The research, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, ranked frisky situations based on how likely it is to catch coronavirus while in the act. Researchers recommend wearing a mask for the riskiest sexual scenario: sex with people other than those with whom one is quarantined. If you have an out-of-house coronavirus crush, the study says, besides keeping your mask on, you should avoid kissing, any oral-to-anal act and anything else that involves semen or urine. Shower before and after, and clean the space with alcohol wipes or soap. The study also mentions that having sex with people who are together in quarantine is safer, but there is still a risk. For instance, if one partner goes outside to run an errand and is exposed to the virus, they can transmit it to the other. Even if that person is ultimately an asymptomatic carrier, they can still infect the other. The safest approach to sexual activity, according to the researchers, is not having any. Abstinence, they say, is “low risk for infection, though not feasible for many.” Another option, they add, is masturbation. Other recommendations have come out since the coronavirus outbreak in the US, with some of them providing graphics to enhance the lessons. In April, the Oregon Health Authority released a sex guide that went viral, just weeks after the same happened to one released by the NYC Department of Health. The Oregon example stood out for its illustrations of condoms, a fleshlight and a peach, and NYC’s with its vivid warning about anal rimming.

Voters go to the polls in eight states and the District of Columbia on Tuesday amid the deadly coronavirus pandemic and the continuing protests taking place nationwide over the death of George Floyd while in police custody in Minneapolis. Four of the states – Indiana, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island – are holding their presidential primaries on Tuesday after they were postponed in April or early May because of health concerns related to the coronavirus outbreak. Like many of the states, Pennsylvania saw a surge of people wanting to receive mail-in ballots, and on Monday Gov. Tom Wolf extended the deadline for receiving them in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and a number of counties. “We think we’re prepared,” Pennsylvania Democratic Party Chairwoman Nancy Patton Mills told the Associated Press. “Thank goodness we have the opportunity of working this out in the primary because we don’t know where we’ll be with the pandemic in November.” Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, can formally clinch the nomination if he wins 89 percent of the delegates at stake Tuesday. The former vice president, who shot to the front of the Democratic pack following a strong showing in March’s Super Tuesday contests, needs 1,991 delegates to secure the nomination. Biden has 1,550 delegates and there are 479 up for grabs. But Biden is the only Democrat running in the primary after Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont dropped out of the race in April. Sanders, who endorsed Biden’s candidacy and urged his supporters to turn out for the former veep, is not actively campaigning. But he’s still hoping to amass delegates so he can use them as a bargaining chip to push for his progressive policies at August’s Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. “People who support Bernie Sanders and his agenda, who want to maximize the influence of progressives at the convention, should cast their vote for Bernie Sanders,” senior adviser Jeff Weaver told the AP. President Trump has no primary Republican challenger since former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld dropped out in March. With the presidential outcome settled, the down-ballot race and those for House and Senate will be prominent. Along with weighing which candidate to cast a ballot for, voters will have to consider the health risks of voting in person during the pandemic and navigate the curfews that have been enacted following the protests that have turned violent in many cities. In Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser will allow voters to remain out after the 7 p.m. curfew so they can get to polling places that will be open until 8 p.m. The same applies to Philadelphia, where voters can still go to the polls after the 6 p.m. curfew. Other states holding primaries on Tuesday include Iowa, Montana, New Mexico and South Dakota. With Post Wires

NAIROBI, Kenya — Residents of a slum in Kenya’s capital have protested the death of a homeless man who they said was killed by police for violating a dusk-to-dawn curfew for the coronavirus. Hundreds of people in Mathare left their homes and burnt tires on the streets Monday night in the latest outrage over alleged police brutality. Dominic Njagi said he couldn’t understand why police shot his brother, 51-year-old James Mureithi. “The pathologist I talked to said my brother was shot twice; one on the legs and the other on the chest,” Njagi told The Associated Press. “The pathologist said the chest wound was at close range.” He said Mureithi was a university-educated automotive engineer who suffered a mental breakdown after divorcing his wife 10 years ago. Police did not respond to a request for comment. Local elder Stephen Wesonga said Mureithi was well-known in the slum as he used to walk around collecting recyclables to sell. Rights activist Boniface Mwangi asserted that 19 Kenyans have died from police actions in enforcing the COVID-19 curfew, all from low-income neighborhoods. He said the Kenyan deaths and the global protests over the killing of George Floyd in the US show that “struggles against police brutality are the same everywhere.” People are more afraid of the police than COVID-19, Mwangi said. He said activists are planning demonstrations and had hesitated before because they feared arrest that could lead to six months in jail for illegal assembly — or 14 days in a quarantine facility. A statement Tuesday by the Independent Policing Oversight Authority, established by Parliament, said 15 deaths and 31 incidents where people sustained injuries have been directly linked to actions of police officers during curfew enforcement. The authority said it has dispatched teams to investigate another six deaths allegedly linked to the police since May 29, including that of Mureithi. Also Tuesday, Kenya’s director of public prosecution ordered the arrest and prosecution of a police officer in the death of 13-year-old Yasin Hussein Moyo, who was shot dead while standing on his family’s balcony in March as police moved through his crowded neighborhood enforcing the curfew. Police at first said he was hit by a stray bullet.

North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper on Tuesday said he was still waiting for Republican officials to share a plan for the party’s national convention — and accused them of reneging on a deal to scale down the event due to the coronavirus pandemic. In a letter addressed to RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and Marcia Lee Kelly, CEO of the party’s convention, which is to be held in Charlotte in August, Cooper said the pair in a May 30 letter and Trump in a Friday night phone call had demanded a “full convention,” which Cooper dismissed as “unlikely.” The event the GOP wants “19,000 delegates, alternative delegates, staff, volunteers, elected officials and guests inside the Spectrum Center.” The pair, according to the Democratic governor’s letter, also wanted “full hotels and restaurants and bars at capacity” despite their alleged earlier assurances that they would accept a smaller version “to protect the health of participants and North Carolinians.” Cooper added that he still wanted a “safe convention” in Charlotte that followed the Centers for Disease Control and Protections’ guidelines for safe mass gatherings — but that in the Friday night phone call with Trump, the president insisted on a full-blown convention. “The people of North Carolina don’t know what the status of Covid-19 will be in August, so planning for a scaled-down convention with fewer people, social distancing and face coverings is a necessity,” he wrote. The governor also said he was still waiting for a response from the party to questions about safety raised by the Tar Heel State’s health officials. “As much as we want the conditions surrounding Covid-19 to be favorable enough to hold the Convention you describe in late August, it is very unlikely,” he continued. “Neither public health officials nor I will risk the health and safety of North Carolinians by providing the guarantee you seek.” McDaniel replied by accusing Cooper of “foot dragging” — and blamed him for not informing the party of “guidance as to how to move forward with plans to safely conduct our convention,” despite Cooper’s reference to the CDC guidelines. McDaniel said moving the convention would cost North Carolina millions of dollars of revenue. At least 30,022 people in North Carolina have tested positive for the coronavirus and 961 have died, according to the state and county health departments, the Raleigh News & Observer reported Tuesday. Trump has insisted on having a full convention and ripped Cooper, threatening to move the event, scheduled for Aug. 24-27, to Florida or Georgia or another state with a Republican governor.

The coronavirus will slash box office revenues in half this year, and the pandemic is now poised to weaken the longtime status of movie theaters as destinations for first-run movies, according to an influential media analyst. Revenue from ticket sales will plunge to $5.5 billion this year, down more than 50 percent from $11.4 billion in 2019, MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson predicted on Tuesday. The drop could get steeper if theaters don’t reopen in July and if summer blockbusters like Warner Bros.’ “Tenet,” set to debut July 17,  or Disney’s “Mulan,” scheduled for July 24, get pushed back to later in the year. The analyst predicted “a significant bounceback” in 2021 to $9.7 billion in ticket sales, partly because a better-looking crop of movies is slated for release next year. But he also noted that movie theaters can’t count on their exclusive 90-day window for new releases to remain intact. The pandemic has not only kept movie theaters closed since March, but also pushed studios to bypass the theatrical window, which gave movie theaters a 90-day period to exclusively show new releases. In recent weeks, Universal Pictures released “Trolls World Tour” directly to video-streaming services instead of delaying it for when cinemas reopen. The kids’ flick sequel reportedly generated more than $100 million in home rentals during its first three weeks — more than the original “Trolls” movie reaped in a five-month theatrical release. “This unprecedented time, as movie theaters around the world have been closed, has led to headline-making experiments in studio windowing,” Nathanson said. “Before the shutdowns, these tests would have been met with strenuous push backs and likely blackouts by exhibitors.” Post-pandemic, Nathanson expects studios to narrow the window, and in some cases, bypass them altogether as streaming services like Netflix, HBO Max, Disney+ and Amazon Prime Video, have gained in importance.  “As long as multiple studios push forward with premium video on demand or some other form of window changes, the balance of power in favor of studios shifts even more in their favor and reduces the leverage the exhibitors have as they would be unlikely to boycott multiple studios’ upcoming releases,” he wrote. In the meantime, Nathanson said it will be difficult for the Hollywood studios behind big-budget flicks to move forward with summer release dates if major markets like New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles, which have yet to set a reopening date, aren’t ready to open. “Given the uncertainty around the key questions we mention above, including sticking to July release dates, when key markets reopen and willingness of movie-goers to return before a vaccine, our estimates today are very much a work in process with lots of volatility in the months ahead,” the analyst said.

She’s keeping up with the Kardashians in an extreme way. A plastic surgery-addicted Playboy Bunny is not letting the coronavirus pandemic keep her from undergoing operations until she resembles her favorite reality TV star: Kourtney Kardashian. The bunny’s bold proclamation comes a week after Brazil’s daily COVID-19 death toll surpassed that of the US. “I am not afraid of the coronavirus crisis, if I have to do the surgeries, I will do it,” model Nathy Kihara tells Jam Press of her obsession with emulating her idol. So far, the Brazilian bombshell has spent more than $200,000 on operations to help her achieve the unusual goal, which has made her a sensation online. Kihara’s Kourtney-parroting procedures have included lip fillers, nose remodeling, a bichectomy and eyebrow lifts, along with various other nonsurgical measures, she claims. Naturally, striving to mimic Kourtney instead of Kardashian family face Kim — who has her own lookalike following — might seem akin to modeling a basketball career after Larry Jordan (MJ’s brother). However, the self-proclaimed “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” fan since Season 1 says she identified with the mega influencer’s “personality, her lifestyle, the way she relates to people, and of course, her beauty.” Not only that, but Kourtney appears to be a helluva wingwoman. “In a way, the flirtation increased, because I was improving my body more and more,” says the saucy facsimile of her new and improved love life. The bodacious bunny reportedly always took care of herself via exercise and diet, “but after I saw the series ‘Keeping Up With the Kardashians’ and started to look like [her], yes, I had a very positive return,” she says. She even shouted out Kardashian in an April Instagram post, writing, “always making all my dreams come true. It is an honor to look like you.” The smoldering doppelgänger’s appeal extends to Instagram, where she has racked up 372,000 followers, and oodles of compliments from adoring supporters. “You are friendly, wonderful inspiration,” fawned one fan on the ‘gram. “This jacket fits you well,” said another under a photo of an almost indistinguishable side-by-side photo of Kihara and Kardashian. Kihara’s plastic surgery pilgrimage isn’t over yet. The celeb lookalike plans to undergo more operations this year, “even with a virus outbreak or not,” she says.

Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force Kaleth Wright on Monday announced an independent review of the service’s justice system after a series of scathing reports that showed it disproportionately punishes young black airmen. And in a lengthy, passionate Twitter thread posted as the nation continued to be roiled by protests and fury over racism, police brutality and the deaths of George Floyd and other black men at the hands of police, Chief Wright — who is the second black man in history to be the Air Force’s top enlisted leader — invoked several of their names and expressed solidarity with them. “Who am I?” Wright began. “I am a Black man who happens to be Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force. I am George Floyd…I am Philando Castile, I am Michael Brown, I am Alton Sterling, I am Tamir Rice.” Wright described his outrage at “watching another Black man die on television before our very eyes” — and said that his rank and position would not necessarily be enough to spare him, either. Wright said that, “like most other Black men in America,” his heart starts racing when he sees blue police lights behind him. “What happens all too often in this country to Black men who are subjected to police brutality that ends in death…could happen to me,” Wright wrote. “As shocking as that may sound to some of you, I hope you realize that racism/discrimination/exclusion does not care much about position, titles or stature…. so yes, it could happen to you, or one of your friends, or your Airmen, or your [non-commissioned officer in charge], your Flight Chief, your Squadron Commander or even your Wing Commander.” But Wright said his greatest fear is that he will one day wake up to a report that a black airman has been killed by a white police officer. However, the Air Force itself continues to struggle with the issue of racially fair and impartial justice. Last week, the advocacy group Protect Our Defenders released a report — the third in the last few years — that found black airmen at the E-2 grade were twice as likely to be punished as their white counterparts, and that the disparities have persisted. And Protect Our Defenders said the Air Force did little to fix the problem, set up a toothless working group to address the issue, and covered up data showing racial disparities. In his tweets, Wright acknowledged “the Air Force’s own demons … include the racial disparities in military justice and discipline among our youngest Black male Airmen and the clear lack of diversity in our senior officer ranks.” And Wright admitted he has been doing “Not enough.” “I can only look in the mirror for the solution,” Wright said. “I, the CMSAF, must do better in ensuring every Airmen in our ranks has a fair chance at becoming the best version of themselves. … I, along with every other leader across the force, am responsible for making sure it becomes a reality.” Wright said that he and 25 other people from a variety of racial backgrounds, and representing enlisted airmen, officers and civilians, have been meeting on this subject to brainstorm solutions on things like how to bridge the communications and understanding gap between law enforcement and young black men. As he closed his message, Wright urged people to — like he is — acknowledge how upset they are at the state of the nation. “But you must then find a way to move beyond the rage and do what you think is right for the country, for your community, for your sons, daughters, friends and colleagues…for every Black man in this country who could end up like George Floyd,” Wright said. And Wright urged people who are not black to listen to their black friends and colleagues, and learn what their experience is like. “You might think you know what it’s like to grow up, exist, survive & even thrive in this country as a Black person,” Wright said. “But let me tell you, regardless of how many Black friends you have, how Black your neighborhood was, or if your spouse or in-laws are Black… You don’t know. You don’t know the anxiety, the despair, the heartache, the fear, the rage and the disappointment that comes with living in this country, OUR country every single day.” And, he said, people must vote, protest peacefully, and be active in their communities to change things. “We didn’t get here overnight so don’t expect things to change tomorrow,” Wright said. “We are in this for the long haul. … We need all hands on deck.”

As US businesses reopen after weeks of pandemic lockdowns, many have been posting coronavirus disclaimers or requiring employees and patrons to sign waivers before entering. From hair salons and recreation centers to stock exchanges and wedding photographers, the notices have sprung up across the country, asking guests to acknowledge they might contract a disease that has so far killed over 100,000 Americans. Companies are using signs, forms and website postings as a shield against lawsuits, but the measures do not prevent people from seeking damages due to negligence, the same way someone might sue after falling on a slippery floor or getting sick from walls covered in lead paint, experts said. Lawyers said it would be tough to prove a business caused a customer’s illness, but concerns are so intense that a waiver may soon become the new normal. Entities including the YMCA of Greater Oklahoma City, a real estate agency in Arizona, a racecar speedway in Seinsgrove, Pennsylvania and the New York Stock Exchange have introduced waivers disavowing responsibility for anyone who might contract the disease onsite, Reuters has learned. Missoula, Montana-based lawyer Paige Marie Griffith created a waiver for COVID-19, the respiratory illness related to the novel coronavirus, that business owners can buy and customize online. Events industry workers, including makeup artists and wedding photographers, are using them, she said. “As essential as we feel, everyone getting their hair done is choosing to do so,” said Cody Brooke, who owns 10th Avenue Hair Designs in Pensacola, Florida. “We don’t want the salon or stylist to be held liable knowing that they chose to come in.” Since reopening on May 11, the salon requires clients to sign a form stating they have no COVID-19 symptoms and have not visited a “hot spot” with high infection rates in the last 30 days. It releases the salon from liability for “unintentional exposure” to the virus. Ryan Reiffert did not mind signing a waiver recently for the gym where he practices martial arts near San Antonio, Texas. He had symptoms in March and later learned from antibody testing that had likely contracted the virus. “But even if I hadn’t had it,” he said, “I’d happily sign the waiver.” A gym attendant sprayed disinfectant on Reiffer’s hands and feet before he could enter, he said. Bigger companies are taking similar steps. Walt Disney Co’s website cites “severe illness and death” risks for customers at its Orlando, Florida, amusement parks due to reopen on July 11th. That warning did not deter the throngs who waited for hours to buy Mickey Mouse swag or apparel from familiar brands outside the Disney Springs shopping center that reopened on May 20. A Disney spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment. New York Stock Exchange-owner Intercontinental Exchange Inc and commodities exchange CME Group Inc also require entrants to sign waivers. Floor traders at the exchanges have historically shouted in close proximity to one another, sans masks, but that has changed. “I cannot stress enough that we will not be able to guarantee the safety of traders, clerks or other trading personnel that choose to access the trading floor,” said CME Chief Executive Terry Duffy. “It will have risk and will continue to have risk until there is a vaccine or some other cure for this disease.”

Gilead Sciences is developing easier-to-administer versions of its antiviral treatment remdesivir for COVID-19 that could be used outside of hospitals, including ones that can be inhaled, after trials showed moderate effectiveness for the drug given by infusion. Remdesivir is the only drug so far that has been shown to help patients with COVID-19, but Gilead and other companies are looking for ways to make it work better. For critically ill patients, Roche and Eli Lilly are testing drugs in combination with remdesivir. Gilead is also seeking to treat the virus earlier. Other antivirals, like influenza pill Tamiflu, work best when given as early as possible after someone becomes infected. Gilead in a statement on Monday said it is looking at ways to use remdesivir earlier in the course of disease, including via alternate formulations. The company confirmed in an e-mail that it is researching an inhaled version, but declined further comment. Company executives such as Chief Medical Officer Merdad Parsey and Chief Financial Officer Andrew Dickinson have been doing interviews with Wall Street analysts in recent weeks to discuss the plans, which are in early stages. They have said that in the longer term, the company is exploring a subcutaneous injection formulation of remdesivir, as well as dry powder versions to be inhaled. Remdesivir cannot be given as a pill because it has a chemical makeup that would degrade in the liver, and the intravenous formulation is only used by hospitals. In the short term, Gilead is studying how its existing IV formulation of remdesivir can be diluted for use with a nebulizer — a drug delivery device used to administer medication in the form of a mist inhaled into the lungs. The idea is that a nebulizer would make remdesivir more directly available to upper airway and lung tissue as the coronavirus is known to attack the lungs. It would also allow for early treatment of coronavirus patients who are not hospitalized. “People look forward to an inhaled formulation in time,” but development is in the very early stages, said Jefferies analyst Michael Yee, adding that demand may be limited as many people infected with the virus require minimal treatment. He said Gilead is building up its capacity to supply remdesivir and has begun talking to governments around the world about commercial pricing. Gilead on Monday reported trial results showing that IV remdesivir provided a modest benefit for hospitalized patients with moderate COVID-19 compared to standard care.

A technical snafu in a US government system caused many small businesses to receive loans twice or more under a federal aid program to help businesses hurt by the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly a dozen people with knowledge of the matter said. The money mistakenly handed out could amount to hundreds of millions of dollars that the government and lenders — which made the loans — have been trying to identify and recover in recent weeks, one of the people briefed on the matter said. The technical issue and scale of the resulting duplicate deposits made under the Small Business Administration’s $660 billion Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) have not been previously reported. They are the latest issue to emerge with the massive program, which was designed to keep businesses hurt by the novel coronavirus afloat and their workers employed. The error was caused by a blind spot in the SBA’s loan-processing system that failed to see when some borrowers submitted applications multiple times typically with several different lenders, three of the sources said. Information provided by the sources, which include industry executives and borrowers, as well as Reddit posts, suggest at least 1,020 duplicate deposits were issued. While that is a tiny fraction of funds disbursed under the huge program, it could amount to roughly $116 million dollars based on average loan sizes. A spokesman for the SBA declined to comment, while a spokesman for the Treasury, which jointly administers the program, did not respond to a request for comment. Launched in April, the PPP allows small businesses hurt by the pandemic to apply with a bank for a forgivable government-backed loan. The SBA has approved roughly 4.48 million loans averaging $114,000 in size for a total of $510 billion as of May 30. Under the program, lenders issue the loan and are later reimbursed by the SBA. The government has said it will only guarantee one loan per borrower, which means lenders, rather than the taxpayer, are likely to be on the hook for the error. Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, PayPal, Kabbage Inc., Square Inc. and BlueVine are among companies that have deposited duplicate loans, according to the sources and Reddit posts. “The SBA inadvertently issued duplicate loan approvals to some small businesses. It is our impression that the majority of these borrowers are…honest small business owners who had applied for a PPP loan through multiple lenders,” a spokeswoman for BlueVine said in an e-mail, adding “multiple” lenders were affected. A spokeswoman for JPMorgan Chase said the bank was aware of a “handful” of duplicate deposits and had referred those customers to the SBA. A spokeswoman for Square confirmed it was working with the SBA and borrowers to resolve the issue. Spokesmen for Wells Fargo and Bank of America declined to comment. A spokesman for Kabbage did respond to requests for comment. “We have seen a small number of duplicate applications funded through the SBA Paycheck Protection Program, despite the administration’s guidance that applicants not apply more than once for a loan,” said a spokesman for PayPal, which partnered with a bank to fund the loans. He added PayPal was working with the SBA and borrowers to resolve the issue. The PPP was launched hurriedly on April 3 as the government rushed to get cash to millions of desperate borrowers. From the outset, the unprecedented first-come-first-served program struggled with technology and paperwork problems that led some businesses to miss out while some affluent firms got funds. In the scramble for cash, many businesses applied with multiple lenders. Industry sources estimated that roughly 15 percent to 20 percent of the applications received by the biggest banks were duplicates. Most of those were spotted and withdrawn, but a fraction appeared to slip through if a borrower’s Social Security Number and tax identification code were mixed up in the system, one of the people said. Another source briefed on the issue said the SBA estimated that the universe of duplicate approvals amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars if not more. “The SBA has asked lenders to review duplicate loans based on a list they provided and work with any other lenders that may have extended funds to get one of the parties to cancel,” the BlueVine spokeswoman said. The SBA has said in the past that it doesn’t collect disbursal data from lenders, so the agency may not know the total amount of duplicate deposits. And lenders may not know if they have issued a duplicate deposit unless the borrower tells them, three of the people said. “How is it that I was successful at getting money from two different banks?” asked one California-based business owner who said she received two deposits, one of which was processed by Wells Fargo. She told Reuters that she returned the other loan. Businesses that refuse to return loans could be referred to the Department of Justice, which is probing suspected PPP fraud. Some borrowers said they weren’t clear on how to fix the issue. One Reddit user who last month reported receiving duplicate deposits from JPMorgan Chase and PayPal acknowledged having a “deep fear” that reporting the problem may mean being left “with no PPP at all.”

Pedro Martinez isn’t siding with the owners. He isn’t siding with the players. Instead, the Hall of Fame hurler is on the side of who he believes matters the most – the fans – in the midst of the dispute into starting the season amidst the novel coronavirus pandemic. “I hope that they take in consideration who pays our salaries and the people for us and how important the people are and at least bend your arm a little bit to try to find a middle ground for the negotiations,” Martinez said during NBCSN’s “Lunch Time Live” with Mike Tirico. Owners and players have struggled to come to an agreement over economics as they try to play a shortened season in front of no fans. Owners have proposed an 82-game season that would pay players only a fraction of their pro-rated salaries. The players response was a 114-game season that included deferrals if the postseason was unable to be played due to a second wave of the coronavirus, as is feared. They still remain far apart. “The economics is the dark part of baseball,” Martinez, the former Expos, Red Sox and Mets ace, said. “The business part of baseball is dirty. It’s dark.” 2020 has been dark, not only due to the pandemic, but also nationwide protests and riots in response to the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer. Baseball can help the healing process, but only if the owners and players can reach an agreement. “I’m hoping that both sides stop thinking about their own good and start thinking about the fans,” Martinez said. “I think people deserve to have their baseball teams out there to try to have people forget a little bit about what’s going on. It’s not only the pandemic. It’s everything that’s going on. People need something to actually do and find a way to relax. “I hope that the Players Association and MLB realize how important it is to bring some relief to the people.”

Coronavirus no longer “clinically” exists in Italy, which has seen the deadly disease lose potency, according to a doctor. New infections and fatalities from COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, fell steadily in the country in May. “In reality, the virus clinically no longer exists in Italy,” Alberto Zangrillo, head of the San Raffaele Hospital in Milan, told RAI television. “The swabs that were performed over the last 10 days showed a viral load in quantitative terms that was absolutely infinitesimal compared to the ones carried out a month or two months ago.” Italy has the third-highest death toll in the world from COVID-19, with 33,475 deaths and 233,197 confirmed cases as of Tuesday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Italy — the first country in the world to surpass China’s coronavirus death toll — was the first European country to lock down in early March. It began a slow reopening of some cities last month in hopes of kickstarting its dwindled economy. A second doctor, Matteo Bassetti, agreed that the coronavirus has weakened. “The strength the virus had two months ago is not the same strength it has today,” Bassetti, head of the infectious diseases clinic at the San Martino hospital in the city of Genoa, told the national ANSA news agency. “It is clear that today the COVID-19 disease is different.” Still, the Italian government urged residents to continue practicing social distancing and other safety measures. “Pending scientific evidence to support the thesis that the virus has disappeared … I would invite those who say they are sure of it not to confuse Italians,” Sandra Zampa, an undersecretary at the health ministry, said in a statement. “We should instead invite Italians to maintain the maximum caution, maintain physical distancing, avoid large groups, to frequently wash their hands and to wear masks.” With Post wires

The feds expect the coronavirus crisis to drain trillions of dollars from the US economy over the next decade, in the latest sign of the pandemic’s economic devastation. The crisis will lead to a $15.7 trillion reduction in the nation’s gross domestic product — the value of all goods and services produced here — from this year to 2030 without adjusting for inflation, the Congressional Budget Office said Monday. The nonpartisan agency expects a plunge of $7.9 trillion when adjusting for inflation, or 3 percent of the cumulative real GDP the office projected for that 10-year period in January. The CBO said social-distancing measures aimed at controlling the deadly virus and the resulting business closures will likely reduce consumer spending, while a drop in energy prices is expected to curtail US investment in the industry. Legislation aimed at blunting the economic impact of the virus will “partially mitigate the deterioration in economic conditions,” CBO director Phillip L. Swagel said. He added that the projections are uncertain because it’s unclear how the pandemic will develop going into next year and how it will affect the economy. “Additionally, if future federal policies differ from those underlying CBO’s economic projections — for example, if lawmakers enact additional pandemic-related legislation — then economic outcomes will necessarily differ from those presented here,” Swagel wrote in a letter to Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-NY), who requested the analysis. The nation’s GDP already suffered its worst contraction since the Great Recession in the first quarter of 2020 as the pandemic roiled the global economy. The CBO’s analysis also came ahead of the feds’ monthly employment report on Friday, which is expected to show unemployment at or near 20 percent in May. Schumer and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said the gloomy numbers underscore the need for Congress to pass another coronavirus stimulus bill. Lawmakers have already approved nearly $3 trillion in stimulus spending since late March, and they’ll be talking about another package “in the next month or so,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said last week. “In order to avoid the risk of another Great Depression, the Senate must act with a fierce sense of urgency to make sure that everyone in America has the income they need to feed their families and put a roof over their heads,” Schumer and Sanders said in a joint statement. “The American people cannot afford to wait another month for the Senate to pass legislation.”

MOSCOW — When nurse Maria Alexeyeva caught coronavirus at work, she isolated herself at home and followed the rules set down by Moscow authorities: She checked in with doctors regularly, didn’t leave her apartment and downloaded a smartphone app required by the city to keep tabs on quarantined patients. The Social Monitoring app tracks users via GPS and sends them random notifications demanding a selfie to prove they’re still at home. If it detects they’ve left home or they fail to provide a photo, they face a fine of about $56 each time. But soon the app became a nightmare for Alexeyeva. It crashed when she tried to take a photo. Weak with illness, she struggled with the software for days, sometimes on hold for hours with technical support. And when her quarantine ended, she discovered she had accumulated 11 fines totaling $620. “That’s more than my monthly wage,” Alexeyeva told The Associated Press. “This quarantine has been hard on me. And now I have to deal with this on top of it.” Thousands of Muscovites also complain they have been wrongfully fined by the quarantine app. In slightly over a month, authorities issued some 54,000 fines, totaling $3 million among its nearly 70,000 registered users. Authorities insist the fines were justified, issued to those who repeatedly violated quarantine. But the app’s users say it has glitches and flaws, sometimes demanding selfies in the middle of the night, adding that the fines were dished out arbitrarily. Moscow has been Russia’s biggest hot spot during the pandemic, recording nearly half of the country’s more than 414,000 cases. As the city of 12 million struggled to contain the outbreak, it used technology that later drew widespread criticism. After two virus cases were reported in February, Mayor Sergei Sobyanin authorized facial recognition software to track Chinese citizens in the capital, drawing complaints from rights groups. When the city introduced digital passes for commuters in April, tightly packed crowds formed at Metro stations as police checked smartphones individually. But the biggest complaints focus on the Social Monitoring app, which was rolled out in early April and was mandatory for those infected with the virus or suspected of having it. Patients had to sign a form requiring them to install the app as part of their quarantine notifications, although they said they were not told how to use the app or what actions would lead to fines. Grigory Sakharov, who self-isolated after a week in the hospital with coronavirus-induced pneumonia, was given six fines, totaling about $336. Two dated back to when he was still hospitalized, even though he didn’t install the app until after his discharge. “I don’t mind paying a fine for something I did wrong, but I don’t understand what I’m paying for here,” Sakharov told the AP. Svetlana Bystrova, quarantined at home with flu-like symptoms, didn’t install the app. She said her doctors didn’t tell her she had to and she didn’t notice a clause obligating her to use the app in the quarantine order she signed. After two weeks of strict self-isolation, Bystrova found she had been fined four times, totaling $224. One was for not installing the app, two said it detected her outside her apartment and one was for not giving details of her wrongdoing. “The one for not installing the app I get, fair enough,” Bystrova said. “But how can the app I never installed track my movements?” Vladimir Perevalov, who installed the app and diligently took selfies, was fined three times for $168. The app never sent him any notifications, he said. The outrage has mounted as tales of arbitrary fines mushroomed on social media. By the end of May, authorities got over 2,500 complaints contesting the fines and more than 200 lawsuits were filed. Three online petitions demanding to abolish the app got over 94,000 signatures. Tanya Lokshina, associate director for Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia division, said while many countries use mobile tracking apps, she hasn’t seen one getting so many complaints. “The situation is absurd. It’s insane,” Lokshina said. “Instead of serving to contain the epidemic, it in fact serves … to punish law-abiding citizens who actually attempt to play by the rules.” On May 21, Human Rights Watch urged Moscow authorities to drop the app, noting that on top of the arbitrary fines, Social Monitoring violated users’ privacy by accessing their location, calls, camera, network information and other data. Russia’s Presidential Human Rights Council echoed HRW’s stance, urging officials to cancel all fines. But Alexei Nemeryuk, the mayor’s deputy chief of staff, said there will be no amnesty, noting: “There’s a system for contesting the fines.” That has proved unsuccessful, said Leonid Solovyov of the Apologia Protesta legal aid group, which is working with over 100 people were fined. He said those who are fined must provide proof they did nothing wrong, which is difficult, while authorities are basing the punishment on data from the app. “Some fines are indeed being overruled,” Solovyov told AP, but only the “most egregious cases.” City Hall has said it was canceling 468 fines for failing to take a selfie because the app made those requests in the middle of the night. Another high-profile case involved Irina Karabulatova, a bed-ridden professor who hasn’t left her apartment in a year and got two fines for not installing the app. After her story made national headlines, the fines were canceled and officials apologized. “They canceled my (fines) because journalists stood up for me,” Karabulatova told AP. “But what is going to happen to the others is a big question.” On Thursday, Sakharov started receiving messages saying his fines were canceled. Alexeyeva, the nurse, also was contacted by officials who promised to lift all her fines. Then, Alexeyeva’s mother was notified she was being fined: Social Monitoring detected her leaving the apartment. “My mother was quarantined with me. She didn’t sign (a document) that had a clause on using Social Monitoring and she doesn’t have the app,” Alexeyeva said. “Looks like we got excited too soon.”

KAMPALA – Uganda will lose $1.6 billion a year in earnings from tourism as visitors stay away due to the impact of the coronavirus, President Yoweri Museveni said. Tourism is one of Uganda’s economic mainstays as the east African country attracts visitors to see a range of game including lions, giraffes, buffalos and others that roam its savannahs. Others are drawn by the mountain gorillas in forest in the southwest of the country on the border with Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda. “Already Ugandan will lose 1.6 billion dollars per annum from the loss of tourism,” Museveni said in a speech late on Monday referring to the impact of COVID-19 on the economy. The president did not say what time frame he was referring to. Latest available data from the country’s statistics office shows Uganda earned $2 billion from tourism activities in 2017, up from $1.7 billion the previous year. The International Monetary Fund said last month that Uganda’s tourism earnings were expected to fall 54 percent in the 2019/20 (July-June) fiscal year and decline 52 percent in the next year. Museveni said the economy would also lose a substantial chunk of the $1.3 billion sent home each year by Ugandans working abroad as many would be out of work due to the global economic downturn following the pandemic. Uganda has so far recorded 458 cases of COVID-19, with no deaths reported. Stringent measures implemented to curb the virus’s spread including bans on both public and private transport, temporarily shutting nearly all businesses and closure of borders has wiped out much of economic activity. The IMF last month nearly halved its forecast for economic growth in Uganda for the financial year ending in June to 3.3 percent and projects 3.7 percent growth in the following fiscal year. In the year ended June 2019, the economy grew 6.5 percent.

This pilot wants airline tickets to be the new toilet paper… kind of. When news of the coronavirus pandemic first hit North America, reports of panic-buying started to spread, with toilet paper apparently being one of the most sought-after items. This led to a temporary shortage of the normally easy-to-find household necessity. Unfortunately, not all businesses saw an increase in sales. The airline industry, for example, has been hit hard by the pandemic. Now, as businesses are starting to reopen, some airline workers clearly are hoping that things get busy again. Chris Pohl, a captain with Virgin Atlantic, shared an image on his Instagram page that showed him holding up a sign that read, “Buy airline tickets like you bought toilet paper.” In the photo’s caption, he explained, “I have been following Dude with a Sign since I started on Instagram and I saw Pilot Charlotte posted a similar message. I put them together to make my own version.” He then asked his followers to “re-post and pass this message to everyone you know, because it’s real. We need the world to start booking tickets, which will allow airlines to fill aircraft and get us all flying again. The only thing holding us back, is you; our loyal customers/passengers, without you, we’re grounded. Let’s get the world flying again.” So far, the post has received over 4,300 likes on Instagram. The post also received several comments from people telling Pohl the reasons why they were buying plane tickets, which included major events such as weddings but also included general vacations. One user joked, “If you give me nine tickets for $4.38 then yes. But seriously I hope virgin Atlantic stays afloat, I’ve got a holiday paid for and waiting.”

Could she be wearing any less clothing? Jennifer Aniston is putting her 1995 nude portrait by Mark Seliger on the auction block to raise money for coronavirus relief. The actor shared the announcement on Instagram with footage of the celebrity photographer working in his darkroom on that very photo. The iconic black-and-white image depicts Aniston seated cross-legged, strategically covering much of her body. The pair worked together when Seliger was assigned to shoot the entire “Friends” cast, which had premiered the previous year. “My dear friend @markseliger teamed up with @radvocacy and @christiesinc to auction 25 of his portraits — including mine :) — for COVID-19 relief,” Aniston, 51, wrote on Saturday. The post has now been liked by 1.2 million people. The current bid on the portrait is up to $6,500 (£5,200). All proceeds from the sale will go to the National Association of Free and Charitable Clinics, which “provides free coronavirus testing and care nationwide to the medically underserved,” according to Aniston. The Instagram account for NAFC Clinics responded to Aniston’s announcement on their page. “Thankful to @jenniferaniston for selecting the NAFC as her charity of choice in the @radvocacy @markseliger auction!” they wrote. Pal Rita Wilson commented on Aniston’s now-viral post, “Beautiful photo! Beautiful babe.” Said Robin Wright, “A true beauty . . . inside and out!” “Look at sweet baby you!” added Olivia Wilde.

A second-term Mississippi county prosecutor posted — and then deleted — a Facebook comment in which she apparently expressed optimism that “the deadly strain” of coronavirus would spread among rioters protesting the death of George Floyd in police custody, according to a new report. Pamela Hancock, who was first elected Madison County prosecutor in 2015 and was re-elected in 2015, was responding to someone else’s post, which read, “Does Covid spread during massive street riots or just in bars and restaurants? Asking for a friend,” Mississippi Today reported. In a since-deleted comment, Hancock replied, “We can only hope the deadly [coronavirus] strain spreads in riots!,” according to the report. Hancock, whose duties include bringing misdemeanor charges against individuals in justice court and county court — including disorderly conduct, trespassing and driving under the influence — told the outlet she would prosecute those involved in the rioting. “My job is to prosecute all crimes, including civil disobedience,” she said. “I’m against any breach of peace or criminal activity, and I would prosecute it. I have nothing against people peacefully protesting, but breaking into businesses and stealing things is a crime.” But when asked about her “hope” that the virus would kill rioters, she stepped back. “I was really just making light of it,” Hancock told the outlet. “I was not serious about wanting anyone to die. That’s not who I am. The post was kind of a joke, and I was attempting to joke back. Obviously, I did it very poorly. If you ask anybody that knows me, I don’t hold any ill will towards anyone or any group. I only try to be fair.” Brandon Jones, policy director at the Southern Poverty Law Center in Jackson, told the outlet that prosecutors should “be reflective about how we talk about these issues,” and Hancock’s post “sends all the wrong messages.” “We worry when people like Ms. Hancock say these things because of what message it might send to people who might have to face her in court,” he said. “It erodes the public’s trust that they’re going to be treated fairly with comments like this, even if they were in jest.” But Hancock said she “never meant to offend anybody” and the comment “was not directed toward anyone except for people that were rioting.” “What I saw on TV seemed to be people of all races,” she told the outlet. “If you ask anybody that knows me, I don’t hold any ill will towards anyone or any group.” “When I prosecute, I don’t look at someone’s color,” Hancock added. “I look at the crime they committed, the facts of the case … I only try to be fair.”

Unilever might seem like just a giant packaged goods conglomerate to some people, but it has worked hard at its mission to give back, rather than just sell more of its Dove, Ben & Jerry’s and Seventh Generation brands. When the coronavirus walloped New York, the company had to do a double-pivot. First, like many companies, it sent staff home to keep the business running from their couches and kitchen tables. But secondly, it ramped up its donations of time and money. Esi Eggleston Bracey, the head of beauty and personal care, has spent a lifetime in the beauty products industry and is responsible for many brands, including Shea Moisture, Dove and Vaseline. “The purpose of Unilever’s business is to do good in the world,” says Bracey, who will be a keynote speaker at the Brands Across America webinar on June 5. “With the crisis, it’s such an important time and there are many ways we believe our brands can help.” The company put together a day of service which could be participated in either in person or remotely. “It’s really inspiring watching how I was able to mobilize my team,” she says. During the May 21 event, Unilever donated the equivalent of one day’s worth of products produced at their US factories to Feeding America and Direct Relief. Unilever corporate employees and over 90 partners spent time virtually volunteering with national and local organizations. The company also mobilized employees, partners and consumers to send more than 4,100 letters of gratitude to essential food bank employees. Unilever US also announced a donation of more than $20 million worth of products, services and financial support for Americans, along with other efforts including a donation of more than 200,000 masks to local New Jersey hospitals. Unilever also worked with a service called the Right to Shower, a national program in San Francisco and New York. With bathrooms in coffee shops currently inaccessible, they are providing mobile showers, restrooms and laundry facilities. With the organization Lava Mae, Unilever also made 10,000 hygiene kits for grassroots distribution. Dove donated $2.5 million worth of products, while the Englewood Cliffs, NJ-based US branch of the corporation also donated $2 million to Direct Relief for personal protective equipment, ventilators and medicine for health-care workers on the front line, following a 200,000-mask donation to local hospitals in New Jersey. Dove also created the powerful “Courage is Beautiful” film, featuring images of workers putting their patients and community first. The images of medical workers with sweat-drenched faces, lined from wearing tight masks over long shifts, brought home the reality of the front line. Lipton, of tea fame, was on the front line too, in the form of a free tea cart outside of Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. Lipton products were sent to firehouses, food banks and Meals on Wheels in New Jersey and Virginia. Hellmann’s, the New York City condiments company, teamed up with Grubhub, the food delivery service that has kept many a kitchen-averse New Yorker fed. Their relief fund is providing $500,000 worth of meals, teaming up with local restaurants to provide 30,000 catered meals to health-care workers at three New York City hospitals.  Vaseline was part of the $2 million donation to Direct Relief for front-line health-care workers. Their donation will also go to supply hospitals and patients with essential equipment such as oxygen tanks. In addition, Vaseline donated 300,000 units of Suave hand sanitizer and $606,000 worth of products to approximately 1,400 free clinics and community health centers. Bracey independently helped raise money for food for the emergency room at the Harlem Hospital. The Upper West Sider and some friends launched the Cause We Care Harlem Emergency Aid Response Team (H.E.A.R.T.) initiative to help feed doctors and medical staff. The GoFundMe page raised $7,000 and helped them donate hundreds of meals and supplies. “I think this [pandemic] rocked everyone’s world,” says Bracey. “When you work in a business, you have a business plan and you work the plan. And then when the world changes, your plan has to change. You figure out how you can be of service today.”

The coronavirus pandemic is still ongoing, but the virus has seemingly started to subside in many areas across the country. This, coupled with the fact that many people are growing increasingly restless on quarantine, has prompted a number of states to loosen up coronavirus-related restrictions. Some states, for example, are now allowing non-essential businesses like barbershops to reopen. In light of the above, some medical researchers have cautioned that reopening states up too soon could result in a second and potentially more deadly, wave to emerge. Indeed, we’re already starting to see this play out in a few countries across the world. Take Israel, for example. The government there responded aggressively to the coronavirus pandemic and swiftly implemented nationwide lockdowns and enforced curfews for non-essential workers. As a result, Israel was able to effectively prevent the coronavirus pandemic from spreading far and wide. That being the case, the country recently started to loosen up existing restrictions regarding the operation of bars and restaurants. What’s more, the Health Ministry also eased restrictions with respect to public transportation. Buses, for example, are now allowed to run at 75 percent occupancy. Public transportation, however, typically involves individuals sitting and standing in relatively close proximity to one another. Consequently, Israel’s decision to loosen public transportation safety measures led to an uptick in coronavirus cases, according to a recent report from YnetNews: The Health Ministry posted the epidemiologic tracing of those confirmed to have contracted the virus on its website… A confirmed carrier of COVID-19 traveled on Thursday from Ashdod to the Haredi city of Elad. Two other people who were exposed to the virus traveled on an inter-city bus from Tel Aviv to Netanya. A day earlier, seven people who had since been confirmed to have the virus also traveled on public buses. Since Midnight on Saturday, 32 passengers using public buses, have tested positive with COVID-19, double the number of the day before. Notably, the dangers associated with mass public transportation prompted the British Government to issue the following directive two weeks ago:  “Consider all other forms of transport before using public transport.” Israel’s experience underscores how important it is for people to adhere to social distancing guidelines and other safety precautions. While it’s only natural to assume that things are back to normal once previously closed establishments open back up for business, the coronavirus pandemic is far from conquered. Indeed, without a vaccine, some researchers have suggested the pandemic may linger on for as long as two years. The good news, though, is that Dr. Anthony Fauci recently said that a second coronavirus wave isn’t necessarily an inevitability. “We often talk about the possibility of a second wave, or of an outbreak when you reopen. We don’t have to accept that as an inevitability,” Fauci explained. “Particularly when people start thinking about the fall, I want people to really appreciate that it could happen, but it is not inevitable.”

“Mission: Impossible 7” is preparing to leap back into action again in September after the Paramount feature was forced to radically change its shooting plans in February because of the coronavirus pandemic. Speaking to the BBC on Tuesday following the publication of British Film Commission safety protocols, first assistant director Tommy Gormley said he was “convinced” that the Tom Cruise franchise can get back to work again in the next three months and be wrapped by May 2021. “We hope to start shooting again in September. We were days from shooting in Venice — we were right at the epicenter when it all kicked off — so we had to shut down in Venice where we were four or five days from shooting,” Gormley told BBC Radio 4’s “Today” program. “We hope to restart in September, we hope to visit all the countries we planned to and look to do a big chunk of it back in the UK on the backlot and in the studio, so September through to end April/May is our targets. We are convinced we can do this.” Gormley added that the British Film Commission guidelines are “excellent” and were extremely bullish about the return to production on the Christopher McQuarrie-directed movie. He said it would not be without significant challenges given the scale of the shoot, its multiple locations, and “giant” crew, but added that it will be possible if “we break down all the procedures very carefully.” “We have to get back to work for every person in the film industry, tens of thousands of us, we have to get back to work. We have to do it safely and protect our colleagues, but it is definitely possible and we’re working flat out to make it happen,” Gormley said.

China delayed releasing critical information about the coronavirus in the weeks after the outbreak was first reported — even as the World Health Organization publicly lauded the Communist country for its quick response to the pandemic, according to a report Tuesday. The WHO in January praised China for “immediately” releasing a genetic map of the coronavirus and said its efforts to be transparent were “very impressive, and beyond words,” the Associated Press reported. At the same time, WHO officials behind the scenes were frustrated that China was slow-walking their ability to get information to combat the spread of the virus, which had first been reported in late December in Wuhan, China, because they were losing valuable time, according to the report. “We’re going on very minimal information,” said American epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove, now the WHO’s technical lead for COVID-19, in one internal meeting during the week of Jan. 6. “It’s clearly not enough for you to do proper planning.” “We’re currently at the stage where, yes, they’re giving it to us 15 minutes before it appears on CCTV,” the WHO’s top official in China, Dr. Gauden Galea, referring to the state-owned China Central Television, said in another meeting, the AP reported. The Chinese Communist Party did not release the genetic map of the virus for more than a week after three government labs had decoded the information, the report said, because of tight controls on releasing data. The genetic map was finally released after another lab published it on a virologist website on Jan. 11. It took the Chinese Communist Party another two weeks to provide the WHO with full data on patients and cases, according to recordings of internal meetings by the United Nations health agency. The delay in releasing the genetic data slowed the development of a vaccine and the absence of detailed information about patients made it difficult to determine how quickly the coronavirus was spreading around the world. Between the time a Chinese lab decoded the info on Jan. 2 and Jan. 30, when the WHO declared a global emergency, the virus spread by a factor of 100 to 200 times, the AP reported, citing infection data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. “It’s obvious that we could have saved more lives and avoided many, many deaths if China and the WHO had acted faster,” Ali Mokdad, a professor at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, told the wire service. There are now more than 6 million cases worldwide, and the death toll has surpassed 370,000. President Trump, who has accused the WHO of colluding with China to hold back data on the coronavirus, last Friday cut ties with the UN agency. “China has total control over the World Health Organization,” Trump said at the White House, noting that the US contributed $450 million to the WHO each year compared to China’s $40 million.

The coronavirus crisis could make America’s banks easy targets for bandits, a federal regulator warns. Requiring people to wear face masks in public amid the pandemic creates a “very real risk” of a spike in bank robberies, according to Brian P. Brooks, the US Treasury’s acting comptroller of the currency. Brooks issued the warning Monday in letters to the nation’s mayors and governors outlining how lockdowns aimed at curbing the virus could hurt the American banking system. He said many banks relaxed bans on masks and head coverings at the height of the pandemic to protect their customers’ health. “While that may have been a prudent decision when the extent of the health risk was still unknown, recent reports of face-covering-related robberies at bank branches and other establishments make clear that broadly applicable face mask requirements are not safe or sustainable on a permanent basis,” wrote Brooks, whose first day in the post regulating national banks was Friday. Mask-wearing robbers have indeed ransacked banks and other businesses during the pandemic, according to news reports. The feds accused a Connecticut man of robbing several gas stations while wearing a surgical mask in March, before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s early April recommendation to wear face coverings in public. Brooks’ letter did not detail how many such incidents have occurred nationwide or what kind of financial losses banks have incurred from the robberies. But he said restrictions meant to control the virus pose a range of other risks that could “threaten the stability and orderly functioning of the financial system.” For instance, banks could suffer from higher delinquency rates on loans to small businesses whose revenue has evaporated amid the lockdowns, according to Brooks. Vandals and burglars could hit properties that have been vacant for long periods of time, threatening the collateral for commercial real estate loans, he said. Local officials could also harm that collateral if they cut off utilities for businesses that defy lockdown orders, as some cities have threatened to do, Brooks said. “I ask that your members carefully consider the impact of their lockdown orders on the health and functioning of our shared national financial infrastructure as they implement the President’s guidance to determine when and how to unwind those orders,” Brooks wrote in his letter to the US Conference of Mayors.

Tim Gunn is letting it all hang loose. The fashion consultant says the impossible has happened during the lockdown — he’s fallen in love with comfortable clothes. “I used to condemn the whole notion of comfort dressing,” he said during a 92nd Street Y digital event, adding that after weeks in “pajamas and loose-fitting clothes,” real clothes are “an absolute assault on your body! You think, ‘I feel so constricted … I feel like I’m wearing a wetsuit!’ I have a tremendous amount of empathy now for people who want to dress comfortably.” Gunn revealed how far he’s taken comfort, saying, “I have on, below the waist, only underpants and a pair of socks.”

Hollywood wants badly to reopen — but not enough to give up the hot-and-heavy make-out scenes. In a 22-page document provided to the governors of New York  and California on Monday, Hollywood studios made their case for restarting TV and film production. And while the report is mainly filled with no-brainer recommendations, including that cast and crew members wear masks, wash their hands and social distance when possible, it also includes some headscratchers. For example, while acknowledging that certain activities “such as fight scenes or intimate scenes increase the risk of transmission,” it stops short of vowing to put those activities on hold. “Whenever possible, performers shall practice physical distancing,” the report says. And immediately after filming such scenes, “the performers shall put on their PPE and/or physically distance themselves.” It also recommends keeping unruly children away — unless, of course, they are filming. And warns against the petting of cute animal actors when the camera is not rolling. “As minors may have difficulty adhering to physical distancing, wearing PPE, and practicing hand hygiene, when not working, they should be relocated to a secure off-set location to the extent possible,” the report advises before turning to animal performers. “Animals should not be handled by others except those necessary for shooting a scene (i.e., no petting, cuddling, feeding). All those involved in touching animals should perform hand hygiene before and after.” The white paper — penned by the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, a group comprised of Hollywood studios, as well as Dr. Daniel Uslan, an infectious disease specialist at UCLA Medical Center — was meant to be submitted several weeks ago. But it was held up several times by unions representing Hollywood directors and actors, sources said. The white paper is considered an important first step for Hollywood studios to get back to work as stay-at-home orders begin to lift in the US. “The white paper is the result of an industrywide collaborative effort made up of production companies, unions and guilds to provide governments with a set of guidelines and principles to safely resume production,” said  AMPTP rep Jarryd Gonzales. “The next step is for governments to review the set of guidelines for their consideration.”

The federal government’s first tally of nursing-home deaths from the coronavirus shows nearly 26,000 fatalities nationwide — and that doesn’t even include all of them, according to a new report. A letter sent to state governors said at least 25,923 residents of nursing homes have been killed by COVID-19, ABC News reported. In addition, at least 449 nursing home staffers have died of the disease, according to the Sunday letter from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The staggering toll accounts for more than one-quarter of the nation’s 104,702 coronavirus fatalities counted by Johns Hopkins University as of Monday afternoon. But federal regulators acknowledged that their nursing home numbers don’t include data from some states prior to May, and potentially only account for about 80 percent of all facilities nationwide, ABC said. The letter also notes that the federal numbers may be “inconsistent with state data, particularly state death data,” due to the different ways in which individual states track the coronavirus, ABC said. According to the New York state Department of Health, there were 3,298 confirmed nursing home deaths from the coronavirus as of Sunday. In addition, there were 2,646 deaths presumed to have been caused by COVID-19, for a total of 5,944, according to the official figures. Gov. Andrew Cuomo has faced widespread criticism for his handling of nursing homes amid the coronavirus crisis, including a controversial, March 25 directive from the state Department of Health that mandated they accept patients discharged from hospitals with the infection. Cuomo — who reversed the order last month –has tried to pin the blame for the initial decision on guidance from President Trump’s administration. In addition to providing an initial nationwide death toll, Sunday’s letter warned that the feds plan to crack down on improper infection-control measures at nursing homes by increasing inspections and fines, ABC said. The total number of deaths cited in the letter is significantly lower than the 37,600 that ABC estimated earlier by conducting a mid-May analysis of reports from nursing homes and long-term care facilities in just 40 states and the District of Columbia.

It isn’t just toilet paper and anti-bacterial wipes that the coronavirus pandemic has made hard to get. You can add a known antidepressant to that list, too. Zoloft, which is one of the most widely prescribed antidepressant medications in the US, has fallen into short supply, Bloomberg reports. Why? The hiked-up demand is caused by mental-health issues that the pandemic has triggered, such as anxiety. The shortage also affects the generic drug sertraline, which is expected to face a monthslong back order. Lupin Ltd. and Accord Healthcare, drug companies that make sertraline, have told the Food and Drug Administration they can’t get sufficient active pharmaceutical ingredients to produce the medication. The firms didn’t tell Bloomberg where those ingredients are made. Bloomberg notes that Zoloft prescriptions rose 12% year-over-year to 4.9 million in March — the highest-ever level in the US. A month later, the prescriptions decreased to 4.5 million. Zoloft was first approved for use in 1991 and is prescribed to treat issues such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. A spokesperson for Pfizer, which produces Zoloft, told Bloomberg the company produces its own active ingredients for the drug.

When Geraldine Greenberg decamped from New York City to Long Beach Island, NJ, with her husband and 20-month-old son, she pictured an idyllic, six-week respite from a COVID-consumed world. Instead, she was shamed. “It’s straight-up discrimination against New Yorkers,” Greenberg, a 35-year-old real-estate agent, tells The Post. “We were definitely shunned by the neighbors when we arrived and for the entire time we stayed.” Popular vacation spots by the beach, upstate and in New England have been a magnet for Manhattanites fleeing the coronavirus. But as locals retaliate with verbal insults, pointed signs and other intimidating behaviors, stir-crazed city slickers — even those who were regular visitors before the pandemic — have been branded geographic undesirables. At the end of March, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a travel advisory for residents of New York, Connecticut and New Jersey. For two weeks, those in the tristate area were asked to halt nonessential travel. Even though those restrictions have been lifted, New Yorkers are still getting slammed for leaving the coronavirus-ravaged city. Memorial Day crowds in the Hamptons prompted Southampton to implement a new residents-only rule. Until at least June 5, beachgoers have to offer proof they live in the town “to prevent the resurgence of coronavirus in our community.” The board of nearby East Hampton implored Gov. Andrew Cuomo to delay the reopening of area hotels and resorts because nonresidents could “overwhelm our town, creating an untenable, and avoidable, surge in the ongoing public health crisis.” Back in March, law enforcement officers in Rhode Island stopped cars with New York license plates and even conducted door-to-door searches to rout out residents seeking shelter there. Andronika Zimmerman/NY Post AP Andronika Zimmerman/NY Post View Slideshow Being from the Big Apple used to be a badge of honor. Now, it’s something to hide. One Union Square resident, who left Manhattan in May for a three-month stint on the Connecticut coast, anticipated such backlash that she begged Hertz for a rental car that would conceal the truth: She was coming from the Empire State. “I don’t even want the dirty look,” says the mom, who fled to the Fairfield area with her husband and 13-year-old son. “I told the manager to save a car for me without New York plates . . . I don’t even care if the plates are from Kentucky.” Jennifer Grasso, 38, is also wary to tout her NYC bona fides — especially after the VRBO host of a Germantown, New York, farmhouse canceled her stay “because we were from the city.” “We felt awful,” says Grasso, 38, who is married with a 3 ½-year-old daughter. The family ultimately landed a Catskills rental through July. “For the first time ever,” she says, “I’m happy to have a New Jersey license plate.” Upper West Side mom of two Myra Smith, 43, jumped at the chance to relax at her upstate Saugerties house, which has served as a haven for her family for the past five years. Even though neighbors know her and her family, she braced for resistance. “What’s here now is a sense of animosity,” Smith, a college professor, says of the anti-city sentiment. While shopping at a nearby Price Chopper, she heard a clerk hiss to another local, “You wonder why our shelves are bare — all those city people coming up and taking your groceries.” Her husband grew up in the area, Smith says, so the harsh treatment stings. She adds, “We’re outsiders despite being insiders.” The Sunshine State is inhospitably stormy for New Yorkers, too. In May, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis openly discouraged owners of vacation homes from hosting residents from the Big Apple. “If you tell me you’re going to rent them out to people from New York City, I’m probably not going to approve that, OK?” said De Santis, adding that renting to people from other states was acceptable. Karen Armstrong, an Airbnb host who lives in Pensacola, Florida, kicked a Long Island resident out of her house for Memorial Day weekend. When the guest booked the stay, Armstrong, 59, was concerned that his profile showed he hailed from the New York area — until the guest promised he had been staying in North Carolina with family. But when he arrived with three other vehicles from Louisiana (“another banned state,” says Armstrong, who has earned “Superhost” status on the short-term rentals site), she asked them to leave. “I had no choice,” she says. “My neighbors are going to hate me. I’m going to be this town’s worst nightmare if we have a second wave [of infections].” Beth Dimenstein — a longtime resident of North Carolina’s beachy Brunswick Islands — started noticing the Empire State influx in March. “When I drive past the grocery store parking lot, it’s packed with so many New York license plates. It’s unbelievable,” says the paralegal, 60, who adds that she is especially worried because she is immunocompromised and cases in the county have jumped from 50 to 90. “I get it — it’s safer here than walking on Fifth Avenue, but please stay 6 feet apart, and please don’t let your teens walk around without masks,” Dimenstein says. “The tourists are not doing their part. It’s dangerous.” Even decades in a second home doesn’t guarantee goodwill from locals in pandemic times. An Upper East Side-based consultant tells The Post of “violence, threats and intimidation” at her longtime second home in Londonderry, Vermont — her onetime sanctuary. “The local community basically took the opportunity to let every second homeowner know that their diseased New York entitled bodies were no longer welcome in the state,” says the 53-year-old married mother of two, who declined to give her name because she fears retribution from Vermonters. “At one point, someone took over the construction road signs, which were changed to say ‘NY, NJ, CT, turn back.’ There were threats of violence.” “There are a lot of pissed-off people — I’m afraid of these people,” she says of locals’ attitudes, adding that Vermont hasn’t even been hit hard by the coronavirus. (There are 983 confirmed cases total, with zero currently hospitalized and 55 deaths, according to the state’s health department.) “I was so stunned and hurt — they were out for blood.” When she stayed in Londonderry over the Memorial Day holiday, she was too scared to venture out of the house. A friend had told her that a resident hostile toward tourists openly carried a pistol around town. “It’s been disgusting,” says the consultant, whose adult son had recovered from COVID-19 and donated plasma weeks before joining her to quarantine in Vermont. He was harassed, she says, and “confronted by neighbors for simply being at the house.” She says, “People forget how to be American in this thing.”

Lots of testing, protective gear, social distancing and coronavirus safety officers are at the heart of recommendations today from Disney, Netflix, CBS and other top studios, Hollywood’s leading guilds and producers to get the industry restarted from the pandemic that shut down production back in March. “The Industry-Wide Labor-Management Safety Committee Task Force (the “Task Force”) respectfully submits the following guidelines for consideration and adoption for the resumption of motion picture, television, and streaming productions in an environment that minimizes the risk of contracting or spreading COVID-19,” says a report for the governors of the states with the highest level of domestic film and TV production (READ THE REPORT HERE). In that vein, the “Proposed Health and Safety Guidelines for Motion Picture, Television, and Streaming Productions During the COVID-19 Pandemic” document was sent to New York’s Andrew Cuomo and California’s Gavin Newsom on Monday by the Industry-Wide Labor-Management Safety Committee Task Force via AMPTP. “Limiting face-to-face contact with others is the best way to reduce the spread of COVID-19,” the report proclaims. “Cast and crew must practice physical distancing whenever possible,” it adds. “Regular, periodic testing of the cast and crew will be used to mitigate the risk of the spread of COVID-19,” the long-expected document also asserts. “As tests are developed and others become more accurate, the testing protocols shall also change.” Perhaps most significantly, along with procedures of cleaning, protection and prevention that other industries have already began implementing as America reopens in phases and surges from the COVID-19 crisis, the recommendations want a whole new entity created for productions to ensure that safety is never compromised, at least in theory. “An autonomous COVID-19 Compliance Officer(s) with specialized training and responsibility and authority for COVID-19 safety compliance and enforcement will be in the workplace to address issues as they arise,” the 22-page slide heavy offering declares. “COVID-19 safety plan oversight and enforcement shall be the principal responsibilities of the COVID-19 Compliance Officer(s), provided they may be assigned additional responsibilities related to workplace safety.” Over a week after Gov. Newsom’s still unreleased production reopening plan was first set to be unveiled, there was no response from his Sacramento office today if they have received the White Paper from the Hollywood players. No word yet from back East if Gov. Cuomo’s folks have laid eyes on the report yet either. As well as the state executives, the proposal is also going to regional officials and offices like the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. For all the hopes and plans in this report, it is expected that production in the coronavirus ravaged LA and NYC will need several more steps before anyone feels the time is right to head back on to a set yet. With “special considerations” included for minors, animal performers, craft services making virtual writers’ room the new normal, avoiding location filming as much as possible and live studio audiences “discouraged,” the document was put together with input from the Walt Disney Pictures, Netflix, Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, Apple Studios, CBS Studios Inc., Amazon, Columbia Pictures, Disney Television Studios, Fox Corporation, HBO. HBO Max, NBCUniversal, Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures Television, and Warner Bros. Entertainment. The DGA, SAG-AFTRA, IATSE (including the Art Directors Guild, the Costume Directors Guild) the Teamsters and others were deeply involved in the process and crafting of the recommendations. What the governors and various state officials will do with this is now to be seen. “The ball is totally in their court,” one industry insider told Deadline today after the White Paper went out.

Hair salons, in-store retail and outdoor dining are set to reopen in New Jersey later this month as the state gradually lifts its coronavirus lockdown, officials announced Monday. The Garden State will reach Stage 2 of its recovery plan on Monday, June 15, Gov. Phil Murphy said. That means dining outside and non-essential shopping can begin again, with some capacity restrictions. Child care centers will also reopen on that day. On June 22, barber shops and hair salons will reopen, and outdoor, non-contact organized sports will be allowed to resume, according to ABC6. Gyms and health clubs will get the green light at a later, yet-to-be announced date. “Over the past several weeks, we’ve been able to take our first steps on our road back because we stayed true to our guiding principles,” Murphy said at a press conference. Murphy said the Stage 2 restart will be phased, and “we will not flick a switch.” “Just because the calendar says June 15, doesn’t mean that everyone should just go back to what they were doing pre-COVID,” he said. “Let’s use common sense for the common good.” The governor stressed that customers should still adhere to social distancing protocols and wear masks. “As we open, we know there is a greater chance of transmission of COVID-19. There is no cure. There is no vaccine,” he said. “There is no proven therapeutic. The only cure is responsibility.” “Safety will continue to be our number one priority.” As of Monday, there were at least 160,918 confirmed coronavirus cases in New Jersey and 11,721 deaths.

Officials across the U.S. South are still scrambling to adjust their hurricane plans to the coronavirus. The big unknown: Where will people fleeing storms go? The Associated Press surveyed more than 70 counties and states from Texas to Virginia, with more than 60% of coastal counties saying as of late May that they’re still solidifying plans for public hurricane shelters. They’re also altering preparations for dealing with the sick and elderly, protective equipment and cleanup costs. In Georgia’s McIntosh County, south of Savannah, Emergency Management Agency Director Ty Poppell said evacuations during the pandemic would be a “nightmare.” He worried about social distancing at shelters and on buses used to get people out. “I’d love to be able to tell you we’ve got that answered right now,” Poppell said. “It’s a work in progress.” Hurricane season officially starts Monday, though Tropical Storms Arthur and Bertha arrived early. Forecasters are expecting a busier-than-normal season. “Everything that we do will be affected in one way or another, big and/or small, by COVID-19,” Florida Emergency Management Director Jared Moskowitz said. Many counties are taking federal advice and hope to use hotels as smaller-scale shelters, while others plan to use more parts of schools besides large gymnasiums. Still others, especially in Louisiana, plan for big shelters with more social distancing. Officials emphasize that shelters are last resorts, urging people to stay with friends or in hotels. But massive unemployment is making the expense of hotels less feasible. “Our biggest change to our hurricane plan is sheltering. How are we going to shelter those that have to evacuate? How are going to shelter those that are positive COVID patients? There are multiple ideas that we are considering right now,” Mississippi Emergency Management Agency Director Greg Michel said. During tornadoes in April, the state used hotels as shelters, which was good practice for hurricane season, he said. Most counties surveyed said they’re still figuring out shelters. While that may sound worrisome, it could be beneficial because emergency managers need to update plans as the pandemic changes, University of South Carolina disaster expert Susan Cutter said. “Disasters are not going to stop for COVID-19,” Brad Kieserman, an American Red Cross executive, told reporters in May. “Hope is not a plan. And we’ve got to plan for tens of thousands of people to evacuate in the face of hurricanes and wildfires and other disasters.” Some officials acknowledged they aren’t as ready for storm season as they were a year ago because of the virus. Others were more confident. “We feel the current rating of preparedness for Craven County (North Carolina) is 50% or lower as we still have not finalized shelter options,” said Stanley Kite, emergency services director of the county hit by 2018′s Hurricane Florence. “Before COVID-19, would have estimated 90%.” Shelters were the most mentioned worry, but comfort levels with other aspects of hurricane preparations varied, reflecting the difference in how states plan for disasters. Having enough staff for shelters is a persistent problem locally and nationally, said Walton County, Florida, emergency management chief Jeff Goldberg. Protective equipment is the biggest shortfall in several North Carolina counties. Money is always an issue, with counties often waiting for federal reimbursement. Handling nursing homes, hospitals and COVID-19 patients “is one of the most difficult challenges and would require a larger state response,” said Jeffrey Johnson, fire chief in Newport News, Virginia. Other places downplayed concerns. Orleans Parish, where 2005′s Hurricane Katrina ravaged New Orleans, has added social distancing and protective equipment to a 10-year-old plan that’s otherwise “essentially unchanged. It’s a good plan,” said Collin Arnold, head of the city’s emergency preparedness office. A year ago, officials in North Carolina’s Beaufort County would have rated their readiness going into hurricane season at a 95 on a 0-to-100 scale. With the virus, that’s down to 75. Brad Baker, emergency management director of Florida’s Santa Rosa County, gave the same numbers “because there’s a lot of unknowns with COVID.” In Nueces County, Texas, which was swamped by 2017’s Hurricane Harvey, officials said they were at a 95 going into hurricane season last year. Now, it’s below 80, emergency management coordinator Melissa Munguia said. If another Harvey brings 50 inches (127 centimeters) of rain, she said the same reinforcements won’t arrive because “everybody’s been working their personnel for many hours for over 100 days.” Florida officials were far more upbeat. “While COVID-19 complicates things and you have to plan around COVID-19, I think Florida is as prepared as ever before in response to a hurricane,” said Moskowitz, the state emergency management chief. In Louisiana, disaster officials said they’re used to “overlapping emergencies, and you just have to plow through.” They anticipate making adjustments, “but it’s hard to pin down what those changes will be,” said Mike Steele, spokesman for the state’s emergency preparedness office. By August and September, typically the height of Louisiana’s hurricane season, the number of infections and social distancing requirements may have changed, he said. Coping with a hurricane is hard, and the coronavirus “is going to make it a little bit more difficult,” Federal Emergency Management Agency Director Pete Gaynor told reporters in May. But he said FEMA has hired 500 people since March and has a record of nearly $80 billion in its disaster fund. Vice President Mike Pence told President Donald Trump on Thursday that the federal government would ensure state and local authorities can handle hurricanes. “Bottom line, Mr. President, we’re ready.” Academics who study disasters aren’t so sure. “I don’t think they (federal officials) are doing the job they should be doing. I worry about their ability to handle a very large hurricane in addition to COVID-19,” University of South Carolina’s Cutter said. She and others said mixed messages on the coronavirus means some people aren’t believing what they’re hearing from Washington in an emergency. “I think our lives are in danger now because we don’t trust the federal government,” Cutter said. Between the pandemic, a crashing economy and patchy federal responses to three 2017 hurricanes, people should prepare for little help from the government, Virginia Commonwealth University emergency preparedness professor Hans-Louis Charles said. Experts also worry that it could take longer to return to normal after a hurricane. Search and rescue teams, utility workers who restore power lines and volunteers who help clean up may be slowed or not respond at all because of concerns over virus exposure, experts said. That and other issues may mean a storm that in the past caused $12 billion in insured damage, like 2018’s Hurricane Michael, may cost 20% more, catastrophic risk modeler Karen Clark said. While many officials are still trying to figure out shelters, they said if people are told to evacuate in a hurricane, residents must go. Storm surge is more dangerous than the virus, officials said. “In hurricane season, we can’t have mixed messages. If you live in an evacuation zone, your plan is to evacuate if ordered to do so by local officials,” former FEMA director Craig Fugate said. “This message will not change, COVID or no COVID.”

The FDA this week approved a coronavirus testing kit from Quest Diagnostics that will allow individuals to test themselves for COVID-19 from the comfort of their own home. After taking a swab from their nostril, users can then FedEx the sample overnight to a testing lab whereupon they’ll receive their results. In the wake of the approval, Quest Diagnostics said it’s planning to 500,000 kits ready to send out by the end of June. The approval of the new testing kits is significant because a lack of widespread testing has been a longstanding issue. Without expansive coronavirus testing, it becomes that much more challenging to ascertain the full impact of the virus and whether or not the number of cases are rising or falling. More importantly, accessible testing helps ensure that asymptomatic coronavirus patients — who would otherwise be unaware that they have the virus — take appropriate safety precautions. “COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing has been constrained partly by limited supplies of swabs and trained healthcare professionals to do the specimen collection,” Quest Diagnostics CEO Steve Rusckowski said in a press release. “The self-collection kit enables an individual to self-collect at home, and the process is far less invasive and uncomfortable than many traditional methods.” Quest Diagnostics said it plans to make its testing kits available across a “range of populations,” which is to say it will be available for state-run health programs, healthcare providers, and of course, individuals. The company highlighted a few of the key features of the new testing kits, which you can see below: Interestingly, the FDA approval for the testing kits came in faster than it would ordinarily as the agency approved it via an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). Though the standard FDA approval process is typically quite stringent, a provision passed by Congress decades ago allows the agency to green light “unapproved uses of approved medical products” in emergency situations if it can help “diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions…”

Sweden will launch a probe into the country’s handling of the coronavirus after controversially refusing lockdown measures, its prime minister announced Monday. Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said a commission would be appointed before the end of summer to look back at the decision to keep most schools, restaurants and businesses open after the virus reached the nation. “We need to take an overall approach to see how it has worked at national, regional and local levels,” Lofven told Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet. “We will make a decision for a commission before the summer.” The Scandinavian country has received criticism for taking a more lax approach in battling the virus, often relying on residents to self-regulate. Through some parts of May, Sweden had the highest number of COVID-19 deaths in Europe relative to the size of its population. More than 4,000 Swedes have died during the pandemic — a per capita rate many times higher than in other Nordic countries, all of which implemented tighter restrictions. With Post wires

Disney’s top brass weighed in on the the protests over the killing of George Floyd, as well as the devastating toll communities of color have taken in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Disney executive chairman Bob Iger, along with CEO Bob Chapek and company senior vice president and chief diversity officer Latondra Newton circulated a letter to employees Sunday night expressing their grief over the recent events. They joined Netflix, ViacomCBS, Warner Bros. and other media companies in expressing their solidarity with the black community. In a letter called “Resolve in a Time of Unrest,” the trio said they are “struggling to make sense of the recent tragedies that leave us feeling overcome with sorrow.” They cited the killing of Floyd, as well as other instances of “lethal attacks and harassment of unarmed black citizens in our nation,” as well as the pandemic, which has ravaged the African-American community and “pushed the issues of racial disparity into the open.” “While we don’t have all the answers, we resolve to use our compassion, our creative ideas and our collective sense of humanity to ensure we are fostering a culture that acknowledges our people’s feelings and their pain,” Chapek, Iger and Newton said. “We also realize that now more than ever is the time for us all to further strengthen our commitment to diversity and inclusion everywhere,” the executives promised. “We intend to keep the conversation going, not just today, but for as long as it takes to bring about real change,” they concluded.

Detroit — Stephanie Byrd agonized over temporarily laying off nearly the entire staff at her family’s trio of Detroit businesses when the coronavirus pandemic hit. But she’s not just concerned about the impact on their bottom line. She’s worried other black-owned businesses will struggle to withstand another wave of economic uncertainty, following decades of inequity that made it hard for many to flourish in the first place. “Most of the people I know who have businesses and are black are terrified right now,” said Byrd, whose family owns Flood’s Bar & Grille, The Block restaurant and the city’s Garden Theater. “There could be a new wave of black businesses that are able to reinvent themselves post-pandemic, but black businesses could also be wiped out for the most part within a black city. What would it look like without black-owned businesses?” COVID-19 has disproportionately impacted black Americans, infecting and killing them at higher rates across the nation. But experts say the pandemic has also exacerbated existing economic disparities and raised fresh concerns about the survival of black businesses, many of which have been the backbone of cities like Detroit and Atlanta for years. They also worry the pandemic could widen the existing black wealth gap. According to the Federal Reserve’s 2016 Survey of Consumer Finance, the median white family net worth of $171,000 is about 10 times greater than that of a black family’s, which is $17,150. AP AP AP AP View Slideshow Black businesses historically have struggled to gain access to financing due to discriminatory lending practices and a lack of relationships with big banks. But civil rights leaders and historians say their struggles are also rooted in the simmering effects of racism and Jim Crow-era laws that enforced racial segregation and denied black people equal opportunities. “Structural racism has created an environment where black businesses are starved for capital,” said Marc Morial, president and CEO of the National Urban League, a civil rights and urban advocacy organization. Juliet Walker, founder of University of Texas at Austin’s Center of Black Business, History, Entrepreneurship and Technology, said black enterprises existed even prior to the Civil War. They especially thrived during a “golden age” from 1900 to 1930 in areas such as Tulsa, Oklahoma’s Greenwood District, known as Black Wall Street. But those moments were short-lived. Tulsa’s once-thriving African American business community was destroyed in 1921 when a racist white mob killed hundreds of black residents. Black residents attempted to rebuild in the decades that followed, only to see their work erased during urban renewal of the 1960′s. “Blacks were able to establish successful business enterprises during the age of slavery where black people had no political or economic rights,” Walker said. “Yet, here we are today and the position of blacks in business differs very little from the position of blacks during the age of slavery.” Detroit was once home to Black Bottom and Paradise Valley — two predominantly African American neighborhoods, the latter of which had more than 350 black-owned businesses and a music scene that drew the likes of Louis Armstrong and Billie Holiday. Both were wiped out in the 1950′s and 1960’s, when a nearly all-white city government allowed the construction of a freeway system through the heart of the neighborhoods. Jamon Jordan, a black historian based in Detroit, said the pandemic could have a similar crushing impact on black American businesses. “Each time this happens, the amount of energy and time it takes to recreate something that’s even as simple as what was destroyed is monumental,” Jordan said. “Even though the coronavirus isn’t the fault of a single person or leader, the impact of the devastation on the African American community is part of a long legacy of discrimination and segregation for black people and black businesses.” Some black business owners have also expressed frustration with the Small Business Administration’s $659 billion Personal Paycheck Protection Program, which was meant to provide small businesses with loans to keep employees on their payrolls during the COVID-19 crisis. The initial round of funding ran out in just 13 days, with complaints over lag times and confusion over the application process. However, the SBA made improvements in its second round and more than $100 billion remains available. But the Center for Responsible Lending, a nonprofit group that works to end predatory lending practices aimed at low-income communities, said challenges remain. “This is just a new public health crisis and economic crisis that is coming after so many decades and centuries of structural inequality,” said Ashley Harrington, the center’s federal advocacy director and senior counsel. National Business League President and CEO Ken Harris said his team has been fielding hundreds of questions from members who are struggling to survive. The league, founded in 1900 by Booker T. Washington, is launching its own $1.8 million digital platform to help business owners gain access to funding. “It’s going to be a rebuilding process and we’re going to have to focus on economic recovery,” Harris said. Pinky Cole, the African American owner of the popular Atlanta-area Slutty Vegan restaurants and food trucks, said she’s been able to shift toward being a carryout business but others haven’t been so lucky. Through her Pinky Cole Foundation, she’s been paying the rent for small businesses that are struggling. “Black-owned businesses, we’ve always landed at the bottom of the totem pole as it relates to resources,” Cole said. “We put our blood, sweat and tears into these businesses and everything you’ve worked hard for can be lost in a matter of days.” Several business companies and entrepreneurs, including Facebook, Magic Johnson and Mark Cuban, the billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks, have announced plans to help businesses owned by people of color, but some worry the assistance might come too late. The Michigan Minority Supplier Development Council, which represents minority-owned firms that serve the country’s automotive industry, took matters into its own hands and worked to identify lenders willing to help small firms. “The difference for minority businesses is they can’t walk into a bank and get the same treatment and if anything, I believe COVID-19 has exposed much of our disparity,” said Michelle Sourie Robinson, the council’s president and CEO. OneUnited Bank, the nation’s largest black-owned bank, announced its participation in the Small Business Administration program in April to help minority-owned businesses gain access to the stimulus funding. “A lot of our customers as well as businesses who are in the community, I’ve counted on one hand the number that actually applied and got funded,” said Teri Williams, president and chief operating officer. “Our community was really getting shut out.” On Thursday, the SBA announced it was setting aside $10 billion exclusively for Community Development Financial Institutions, which work to expand economic opportunity in minority and other under-served communities. Bernard Kanjoma and his fiancée Jessika-Katherine Naranjo Colina, who co-own the graphic design and marketing firm Naranjo Designs, said they received an $8,000 loan May 5. Kanjoma, who emigrated to the United States from Malawi, said their 12-person team has seen an 80% drop in business but they’re identifying creative ways to weather the crisis. “We have been heavily impacted and it’s been challenging but I felt like all the hardships that I went through with immigration and everything else to be where I am now, this is something that is just going to blow over,” Kanjoma said.

President Donald Trump will resume in-person fundraising events this month — hosting two big-dollar events as he moves to restart a campaign season paused by the coronavirus pandemic. On June 11, Trump will host a fundraiser at a private home in Dallas, Texas before flying out to his Bedminster, New Jersey golf club for a June 13 event, a campaign official confirmed to The Post. Admission to the Dallas fundraiser costs $580,600 per couple, while the New Jersey event will cost each attendee $250,000. All proceeds will go to Trump Victory, the joint fundraising committee of the Trump reelection campaign, the Republican National Committee and state parties. A third event is reportedly in the works for July 4 weekend in Florida, according to Bloomberg. A campaign official told The Post of the two confirmed events that about 25 people are expected to attend each, and that event coordinators were taking extensive safety precautions to ensure that social distancing would be observed. Those attending the events will be evaluated by the White House medical unit and Secret Service. They will be required to test negative for the virus on the day of the event, as well as complete a health questionnaire and pass a temperature test. The president’s rival, presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, announced in early march that it was postponing in-person fundraising events “indefinitely” as the pandemic forced Americans into self-quarantine. Since then, the former vice president has taken to hosting virtual fundraisers for donors, using methods like conference calls and video events. Biden has defended his remaining on lockdown amid the pandemic, despite it throwing a wrench in typical general election plans. Last week, presidential hopeful clapped back at Trump and his GOP allies after weeks of being mocked for observing social distancing guidelines and remaining on lockdown in his Delaware home. “All this stuff about ‘Biden’s hidin,’ well, you know, the fact of the matter is, it’s working pretty well so far, doing the rules,” he told CNN last Tuesday. “He’s behind in almost every — every state,” he continued, noting that he recognized that the numbers could change between now and the November election. Biden was referencing his climbing poll numbers, which have recently shown him ahead of Trump both nationally and in key swing states. Since making those comments, the 77-year-old Democrat has made three public appearances, most recently assessing the damage and speaking to voters in Wilmington, Delaware after a night of protests and riots in response to the murder of George Floyd. A Biden campaign spokesperson did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment regarding his in-person fundraising plans.

We may not have seen the last of this year’s Knicks after all. There is a chance they could be back in some form. Although the Knicks are unlikely to be part of the postponed season’s restart in Orlando, as The Post previously reported, there is dialogue that the teams not involved may return to the court, according to ESPN. That would enable said teams to remain somewhat relevant in their respective markets, go through a mandatory training camp this summer and take part in regional fall leagues of four-to-five teams, so they wouldn’t go from March to December – when next season could start — without playing games. There is the belief the NBA will offer such a plan to the Players Association, ESPN reported, after shutting down the season on March 11 due to the novel coronavirus pandemic. “The message was something bigger, reminding people that some teams can’t just re-open the doors in nine of 10 months and so easily sell tickets or a sponsorship without having played basketball for that long,” an Eastern Conference official said. With the date of the 2020 NBA Draft still uncertain and unclear when free agency will be held, it is unknown how these rosters would be formulated. As for the Knicks in particular, it could be an opportunity for its new coach to get to know the roster, with new president Leon Rose expected to replace interim coach Mike Miller. Tom Thibodeau is considered the frontrunner right now. Submit your Knicks questions here to be answered in an upcoming Post mailbag A source told The Post there is expected to be more clarity for everyone after Thursday’s Board of Governors vote, when approval of a 22-team restart plan is expected. Three-fourths of the league has to approve the plan for it to pass, but the belief is that will not be an issue. On a recent conference call, commissioner Adam Silver told league owners that he is targeting July 31 for reopening the league and teams could hold a three-week training camp in Orlando beginning in early July. On Friday, the Knicks opened their practice facility in Tarrytown to give their players in the area a safe place to work out. Most of the roster had left to be with their families in the midst of the pandemic.

An NYC man is suing Delta Airlines and British Airways for $16,000 — demanding refunds for two flights that were canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic, new court papers show. Steven Schiesel says he bought himself and his wife a pair of one-way tickets for himself and wife Elaine to fly from New York City to Tenerife, Spain via Delta on April 14. But they were unable to go as both the US and Spain were under lock down at the time, a Manhattan Supreme Court lawsuit from Saturday says. Schiesel bought the Delta tickets on January 24 for $5,543 each and he requested a full refund prior to the flight, the court papers say. And he also booked a second one-way flight for the pair from Portugal back to the Big Apple on May 2 from British Airways for $5,952, which he also asked for a refund for ahead of the flight, the court filings say. But both airlines, “failed and refused to provide plaintiff with a full cash refund, and offered plaintiff a voucher to be used on another flight in the future, for which plaintiff had no use,” the court documents charge. The suit says this goes against British government, US government and US Department of Transportation rules “requiring  airlines to provide full cash refunds to passengers who purchased plane tickets on flights affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.” Schiesel is suing for breach of contract. In April, a Minnesota cop filed a similar lawsuit against United Airlines for a refund of a canceled South Carolina trip scheduled for April 4. Delta and British Airways did not immediately return a request for comment.

The Public Theater has postponed its digital gala, “We Are One Public,” due to the protests around the country. “In this time of national trauma, when the Covid crisis has so disproportionately impacted the Black community, when the injustices of our way of life have been made so clear, it just feels wrong for us to sail ahead with our event,” a note on the theater’s website stated. “This is a time for mourning and reflection,” the statement continued. “It has taken us far too long to proclaim the simple truth: Black Lives Matter,” the New York City-based theater company further stated. “We must stand in solidarity with Black artists, Black staff members, and the Black community … The Public is determined to be on the side that fights racism and inequality manifested inside and outside of our walls.” Meryl Streep, Alicia Keys, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Antonio Banderas, Glenn Close and more had been scheduled to participate in the event scheduled for Monday night.

To help enforce social distancing restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic, Walt Disney World has enlisted Stormtroopers from “Star Wars.” On May 20, parts of its Disney World reopened, including outdoor restaurants, entertainment venues and its shopping district, Disney Springs. Visitors must now follow rules that require all guests to wear face coverings, pass fever tests and maintain a distance of 6 feet from other guests whenever possible. Attractions Magazine shared a video last week of two Imperial soldiers encouraging visitors to “move along” and “stay in your sector” as they patrol from a balcony above a shopping plaza. Pre-recorded banter between the two troopers can be heard over a loudspeaker. “Hey, you! With the face covering!” yells one Stormtrooper in the video. “They all have face coverings,” the other mocks. “Well, we made them all look,” the first trooper responds. The Disney World amusement park has been closed since mid-March due to the COVID-19 crisis and went on to furlough some 43,000 Disney World Resort employees in April. Park officials plan to launch an incremental reopening on their theme parks starting on July 11, with Animal Kingdom and Magic Kingdom slated to open first. While fans await the relaunch of Disney’s Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge attraction, which just opened in late 2019, they may be able to get their Force fix with Lucasfilm’s new immersive VR experience, “Star Wars: Tales From the Galaxy’s Edge,” due later this year.

Cancer patients infected with COVID-19 had a much higher risk of dying within a month than non-cancerous COVID-19 patients, recent studies say. In a study published May 28 in The Lancet, 50 percent of 928 cancer patients and survivors with COVID-19 were hospitalized and 13 percent died. The most common malignancies were breast cancer and prostate cancer. According to data from Johns Hopkins University, the majority of the 10 countries most affected by coronavirus have death rates less than 13 percent. The US has a COVID-related mortality rate of 5.8 percent, whereas countries like Belgium, France and Italy have death rates exceeding 14 percent. Another study in The Lancet of cancer patients facing COVID-19 found an even higher death rate at 28 percent, increasing with age and underlying health problems like cardiovascular disease and hypertension. The study also found 22 percent of patients had interrupted anticancer treatment due to the pandemic. What do these findings mean for more than a million Americans diagnosed with cancer each year? Data from the American Cancer Society says there will be an estimated 1.8 million new cancer diagnoses and more than 600,000 cancer deaths in the US in 2020. The number of cancer survivors in the US will approach 18 million this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Dr. Jeremy Warner, a Vanderbilt University data scientist who led the wider study, told the Associated Press that the “results show the wisdom of measures that many hospitals have taken to delay or modify care for many cancer patients and the need for people treated in the past to be extra careful now.” “If they don’t have COVID-19, they want to do anything they can to avoid getting it,” Warner told AP.

Mayor Bill de Blasio said Monday it is time for protesters taking to the streets over the police-involved death of George Floyd to “stay home” as he warned that there could be a spike in coronavirus infections. “You’ve made your point. It’s time to stay home,” de Blasio said during his daily City Hall press briefing regarding the thousands of protesters and many looters who have flooded Big Apple streets for days. “People have a right to protest freely, but there is a line,” the mayor said, as he explained that “there’s a real danger this could” further spread the deadly bug “when we were starting to beat it back profoundly.” Demonstrators have inundated the streets of New York City over the past three days — sometimes turning violent and clashing with police — over the May 25 Minneapolis death of Floyd, who was black, at the hands of a white cop. “This is just a horribly complex situation,” said de Blasio. “We’ve never dealt with anything like this.” The Big Apple has been in a coronavirus-induced shutdown for more than two months and remains seven days away from entering phase one of the state’s four-phase reopening plan. “The safest thing at this point is for people to stay home,” said the mayor. “We don’t want people out there where they could spread this disease, where they could catch this disease.” Commenting on the protests, which Hizzoner has characterized as overall “peaceful,” he said, “This moment is the outpouring of such pain and suffering. “These things are happening outdoors, which, thank God, is better than it happening indoors,” the mayor said of the demonstrations amid the virus. Meanwhile, speaking during his own press conference Monday in Manhattan, Gov. Andrew Cuomo echoed some of those concerns about the potential impact the protests could have on the spread of coronavirus. “We don’t even know the consequence of the COVID virus of those mass gatherings. We don’t even know. We won’t know possibly for weeks. How many super spreaders were in that crowd?” Cuomo asked. “How many young people went home and kissed their mother hello … and spread a virus?” Cuomo continued, “We still have to be smart and at the same time we have a fundamental issue, which is we just spent 93 days limiting behavior, closing down, no school, no business, thousands of small businesses destroyed. People who have lost their jobs, people who wiped out their savings and now, mass gatherings with thousands of people in close proximity. One week before we’re gonna open in New York City? “What sense does that make?” the governor asked. “Took us 93 days to get here,” Cuomo said, referring to New York’s progress when it comes to the coronavirus crisis, including its steep decline in COVID-19-related hospitalizations, intubations and deaths. “Is this smart?”

A streaming Broadway-themed fundraising special scheduled to air on Sunday, June 7 – the night that originally had been set for the annual Tony Awards – has been postponed in the wake of national unrest over the police killing of George Floyd. “We stand in solidarity with Black Lives Matter,” said an executive producer of the special. In announcing the postponement today, Broadway on Demand CEO/President Sean Cercone said, “This is a pivotal moment in our nation’s history and our priorities at this time are to listen, to engage in meaningful dialogue and to do our best to enact real change in our industry and in our nation.” The special, which was to have streamed on the recently launched Broadway On Demand platform, will be rescheduled at a future date. “We are collectively saddened and angered by the senseless murders of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Tony McDade, Breonna Taylor and disheartened by the ongoing racism and injustices that continue to permeate our society,” said Cercone in a statement. “We at Broadway On Demand do not tolerate hate, racism, injustice or bigotry of any kind. The continued violence against Black Americans is inexcusable. We stand in solidarity with Black Lives Matter.” Read the entire statement below. With the Broadway coronavirus shutdown in place, the annual Tony Awards ceremony has been postponed, with no announcement yet on when or if the trophies will be handed out at all this year. CBS, the network home of the Tonys, has scheduled a Grease Sing-a-Long as a replacement, a move that disappointed some Broadway insiders who hoped for some sort of Tony-related programming. Broadway On Demand then stepped in by planning a one-hour celebration of theater and the Tony Awards, with the support of, and as a fundraiser for, the American Theatre Wing and The Broadway League, presenters of the annual Tonys. The special is the latest Broadway-related postponement since the protests began: Yesterday, New York’s Drama Desk Awards postponed its streaming event to a date TBD. That same day, New York’s Public Theater postponed its virtual We Are One Public gala. Here is Cercone’s statement in full: We are collectively saddened and angered by the senseless murders of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Tony McDade, Breonna Taylor and disheartened by the ongoing racism and injustices that continue to permeate our society. We at Broadway On Demand do not tolerate hate, racism, injustice or bigotry of any kind. The continued violence against Black Americans is inexcusable. We stand in solidarity with Black Lives Matter. This is a pivotal moment in our nation’s history and our priorities at this time are to listen, to engage in meaningful dialogue and to do our best to enact real change in our industry and in our nation. We truly believe theater has the power to educate, inspire, develop empathy, bridge cultural divides and ultimately unite under the banner of humanity. Broadway On Demand recognizes that we have the power to influence and change the world through art. Our goal as an organization is to create a platform where underrepresented voices can be amplified and uplifted. That is why it is of the utmost importance that the programs we deliver adhere to these beliefs and reflect the world in which we live.

China has ordered two major state-run agricultural businesses to suspend purchases of US farm goods, according to a report. The move will almost certainly impact China’s pledge as part of the US-China phase one trade deal to purchase $250 billion in US goods annually. Cofco and Sinograin, two state-owned traders, were ordered by Chinese Communist Party officials to cease the purchasing of US farm goods including soybeans and pork, Bloomberg reported Monday. President Trump signed phase one of the deal with China in January, ending a bitter trade war between the two countries that took place amid months of tense negotiations. Since then, relations have soured as the Communist nation has faced a wave of international scrutiny for its lack of transparency at the onset of the coronavirus outbreak. President Trump and top administration officials — most notably Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo — have squarely blamed China for the global health emergency. Beijing, meanwhile, has been engaged in a months-long smear campaign against the three men. In early May, Trump told The Post in an Oval Office interview that Chinese authorities were responsible for the virus’ spread. “I think the worst part of it was they could have extinguished the fire. And they could have stopped people from traveling and extinguished the fire. And they did stop people from traveling to China, but not to other parts of the world. So it’s a very sad event, I will tell you,” he remarked. The commander-in-chief asserted during a Fox News town hall last month that if China did not uphold its end of the bargain, there would be consequences. Responding to a question from a business owner who said he was losing money on tariffs placed on China, Trump said the duties in the trade agreement required China to make those $250 billion in purchases. “Now they have to buy, and if they don’t buy, we’ll terminate the deal. Very simple,” he assured the man. Asked by a reporter in the Oval Office one week later whether he was pleased with how China was fulfilling the trade deal, the president said he would have an answer “in a week or two,” but added that it was something the White House was “watching closely.” “They’re buying a lot of farm product, but are they buying to the level that they were supposed to? You know, they were going to buy $50 billion worth [of US farm goods], the most they ever did was $15 or 16 [billion]. And now they’re going to … anywhere between $40 to 50 [billion] in terms of farm [goods], but $250 billion overall,” he added. In the weeks since making those comments, Trump administration officials have been in debate over whether to stick with the deal if China is unable to meet its purchasing requirements, according to Reuters. Officials close to Trump have said that both he and the administration have little hope that China will be able to maintain its end of the deal, the outlet reported. Still, walking away from the deal could cause further economic harm, a risk the commander-in-chief is aware of. Canceling the agreement could risk an increase in unemployment at a time when US job losses are already at an all-time high, reigniting a fraught trade dispute as the global economy struggles to bounce back. Despite doubts, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He maintained China’s pledge last month that it would implement the agreement. White House Economic Adviser Larry Kudlow was not as enthusiastic during a CNBC appearance last week on the deal, calling the relationship between the two countries “complex” and saying that the agreement “does continue to go on for the moment.” Adding further tensions to the two countries’ relationship is the Communist country’s handling of Hong Kong. Pro-democracy protests took over the city for nearly all of last year and left the region in a tense power struggle with the Chinese Communist Party. The mobilization was sparked by the CCP introducing a plan that would allow for the extradition of criminal suspects from Hong Kong to mainland China. The bill was withdrawn last September but the rallies continued to support full democratic reforms and investigations into the police’s actions. Demonstrations were slowed down by the coronavirus pandemic, which forced the movement indoors. Since then, with more in the country going outside again, the protests have started up again, leading to numerous high-profile arrests. Renewed protests have also been motivated by Beijing’s push to impose a new “national security law” on Hong Kong, which White House National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien has threatened to sanction the country over. The law would restrict Hong Kong’s autonomy, which was established when the former British colony was returned to China in 1997. In response to US criticism of the Hong Kong measure, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian slammed American leadership on Monday, saying their allegations against the Chinese Communist Party “show a total disregard of facts.” “Any words or actions by the US that hurt China’s interests will be met with firm counterattacks,” Zhao continued. A spokesperson for the office of the US trade representative did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment. With Post wires

Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Monday raised the possibility of imposing a curfew on New York City — saying looters had “hijacked” protests over the police killing of George Floyd to break into luxury stores like Rolex and Chanel. “Many cities use a curfew,” Cuomo said. “My basic point is, last night was bad. The criminality, the looting was the most egregious, the people exploiting the circumstance.” During his daily coronavirus briefing in Albany, Cuomo said there was “no doubt that there are people who just use this moment to steal.” “What, is it a coincidence that they broke into a Rolex watch company? That was a coincidence? High-end stores, Chanel — that was a coincidence? That was random? That was not random,” he said. “So, can you have a legitimate protest movement hijacked? Yes, you can. And there are people and forces who will exploit that moment, and I believe that’s happening.” Cuomo also said that “extremist groups” had been infiltrating protests across the state to “come in to disrupt.” “I hear the same thing from all the local officials. They have people in their communities who are there to, quote-unquote, protest,” he said. “They’re not from their communities. They don’t know where they’re from.” Cuomo said he would speak later Monday with Mayor Bill de Blasio about imposing a curfew. “I could impose a curfew. Legally, I could impose a curfew,” he said. “I’m not at that point. But I know something has to be done. Because last night was not acceptable, and the night before was not acceptable on any level.” Cuomo has said previously that the National Guard was “on standby” to help quell protests across the state and on Monday noted, “We have 13,000 National Guard, who we can use at any moment.” About 5,000 guard members have been mobilized in 15 states and the District of Columbia since protests over Floyd’s killing turned violent last week, according to the Military Times.

Turkish mogul Baran Süzer has been forced to pull out of buying Miami’s Delano Hotel amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Page Six is told. Süzer, who is the owner of The Ritz-Carlton, Istanbul, had to forfeit the deposit he had put down in March ahead of a deal where he would have won majority ownership of the swanky South Beach hotspot. Per the terms of the deal, hospitality group SBE would oversee operations and management of the hotel, while Baran’s family business, Süzer Group, would hold majority ownership and fund the property. Süzer had previously been involved in other potential deals to buy shares of LA’s Sunset Tower and the Miami Setai, which never went ahead.

US stocks rebounded Monday as Wall Street cautiously bet on an economic recovery despite mounting unrest over police brutality and continued tensions with China. The Dow Jones industrial average rose as much as 93.12 points, or 0.3 percent, to 25,476.23, after shedding 0.5 percent at the open. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq similarly clawed back early losses in choppy trading to rise as much as 0.2 and 0.5 percent, respectively. Wall Street appeared focused on the prospects of the economy shaking off the coronavirus crisis despite a weekend of violent protests across the nation sparked by the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. “History shows effectively no correlation between social, political turmoil and stock markets,” said David Trainer, CEO of investment research firm New Constructs. He noted that the market posted a significant gain in 1968, a year marred by civil unrest and two major political assassinations. Investors also shrugged off China’s Monday threat of retaliation against President Trump’s move to start ending the US’s special trade relationship with Hong Kong after Beijing moved to restrict the territory’s autonomy. The protests and China tensions “just get dwarfed by the fact that the economy everywhere is coming back online, and I just don’t know how the market moves away from that,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Minneapolis-based Leuthold Group. Some recent economic data has suggested that the US economy is starting to turn around after the coronavirus pandemic sparked the worst downturn since the Great Depression. Reports released Monday showed manufacturing activity improving last month in both the US and China as the world emerged from lockdowns aimed at controlling the virus. New jobless claims in the US have also fallen steadily in recent weeks, though Friday’s monthly jobs report is expected to show unemployment at or near 20 percent. Optimism about an economic reopening has helped spur a significant rally on Wall Street since March, when the virus crisis tanked global markets. The S&P ended May just about 10.3 percent below its all-time high reached in February. With Post wires

I think the players have a responsibility to help find a financial solution that allows major league baseball to be played this year. For the long-term damage to reputation and revenue without games will make the 2020 salary dispute feel like fighting for a drop of water and ending up with an ocean of problems. I think the players are more than just the employees. They also are stewards of the game and they have a chance in the next few weeks to renew positive nostalgic ties with baseball and Americana while creating new fans that will ultimately lead to more revenue streams that set them, future players and the sport up in a better fashion. Here is what I don’t think: The players are greedy. That designation was tired when it was said about Babe Ruth and Sandy Koufax and Reggie Jackson. I get it you played baseball as a kid and think you would do it for free as a profession. You wouldn’t. No one works for free. You think the money would be better spent on nurses and teachers. Agreed. Redirect all you spent that helped make MLB an $11 billion industry last year to nurses and teachers. If there is less money in the game, players will make less. You think the players should be grateful. Most are. But also we should be grateful. I watched the owners’ replacement baseball folly in spring 1995 and sorry to break it to you, but you were not one better coach in high school away from the majors. These are the best players distilled through a Darwinian system that separates those who can and cannot. As a society we have decided to value this particular rare skill set. You and corporations paid the $11 billion. Owners gave roughly half of that to players, as they did pretty much every year before a pandemic. No one had a gun to anyone’s head to spend it. You think the players’ salaries have priced you out of tickets. Except the Orioles and Tigers cut their payrolls by $100 million each from 2017 to 2020. Were either lowering ticket prices to reflect the savings and certitude of a worse product? Add it all up and returning to the “greedy” player feels like wool uniforms — something that should have been retired long ago. The owners have gotten used to winning negotiations, the last collective bargaining agreement for sure, with the minor leagues, with umpires, with getting caps on the draft and international spending. They have done this with a strategy more jackhammer than stiletto. This is what any business does — tries to get the most production for the least cost. The players stood up to the jackhammer this time. It is not just that after years of rising revenues and franchise values, the owners now are asking for the players to help lessen their financial burden/loss. It is that the first official offer, among other things, asked the players who make the most to be walloped. On its surface — like believing high ticket prices are due to high player salaries — that makes sense. Many businesses are asking top earners for cuts to spare lower earners. But baseball is not other businesses. Players endure capped systems in either the draft or internationally at the entry level. They have to work through the minors, often for several years, making wages often below poverty levels. Those who reach the majors cannot seek an open market for six or, if their service time is manipulated, seven seasons (think those who have had their service manipulated trust owners right now?). In the first three years, teams can pay major leaguers whatever they want, usually close to the minimum. The next three to four years, the teams have an arbitration system that, yes, begins to pay players better, but within confines and without a free market providing true value in what often are players’ most productive seasons. In recent years, analytic front offices have smartly — but coldly — figured out how to get similar production for less cost, lowering many bars for arbitration-eligible players and free agents. One of the strategies is to keep the pay down on one end with all of the rules, then say the player is too old to get real money when he is finally free. Those who navigate all of that to command lucrative contracts are being asked to incur the brunt of the savings for owners. And, as opposed to owners and their heirs who have decades of runway to make back losses, players who get in 10-plus years in The Show are a small percentage. Also, whatever a player earns, we all will know it. We have no idea what owners make, which is central to the union complaint. MLB is crying poor but the Players Association is dubious. I have no idea if this is really crippling this year for the owners, or if players could be convinced of it even if true. But I do believe that within their suspicion, players must find a way to solution. Perhaps that is playing chicken and getting the owners to pay them the full prorated share. But it can’t be misreading that, which leads to no games, which would mean no salary now and less in the future. It would be calamitous 1) if MLB was approved by political and medical leaders to play amid the pandemic and didn’t for financial reasons when unemployment and monetary anguish is so high in the country, 2) if MLB didn’t play and every other major sport got back, 3) MLB failed to grab the goodwill and potential for long-term financial benefit by being the first sports league back and do it on July 4 weekend. Yes, the owners are bigger stewards. Still, the players cannot let this all burn. They are not greedy. But they must be big-picture thinkers and not let 2020 money blind them to the long-term costs without games.

NYPD cops will begin working 12-hour shifts this week — a “war time” response to the increasingly violent George Floyd protests and looting in New York, sources told The Post. Starting Tuesday, some cops will work a 5 a.m.-to-5 p.m. tour, while others will be on the clock from 5 p.m. until 5 a.m. the next day, according to an internal department memo obtained by The Post. “It’s obviously a dire response to the ongoing civil unrest,” a police source said Monday. “The fact that the NYPD would mandate such a drastic measure in light of the economic state of the city is austere indeed. It means the mayor and NYPD are at their ropes’ end to enact such a metaphorical ‘war time’ measure.” The move is a sign that the NYPD needs “all and every hand on deck,” and it is “a measure reserved for citywide catastrophes,” the source added. It’s unclear how long the new regulations will last or whether any officers will be exempt from them. The Big Apple faced a fourth straight night of violence and looting late Sunday into early Monday. More than 200 people were arrested, a dozen department vehicles were vandalized and at least seven officers were injured, according to the NYPD. More than 700 people have been arrested since Thursday. The extended shifts come as the city continues to battle the coronavirus — but the NYPD said last month that the number of cops calling out sick has dropped to pre-pandemic levels. The NYPD did not respond to a request for comment.

A majority of Americans believe controlling the spread of the coronavirus is more important than trying to restart the nation’s ailing economy, a new poll has found. The poll, conducted late last month by the Washington Post and ABC News, found that 57 percent of those surveyed think curbing the coronavirus pandemic is most important right now — even if it’s detrimental to the US economy. Thirty-seven percent of respondents felt the opposite, saying they believe giving a jolt to the nation’s reeling economy is more vital at the moment, the poll found. The divide was even starker along political lines, as 81 percent of Democrats said they thought controlling the virus’ spread was of greater importance, compared to 59 percent of independents and just 27 percent of Republicans. Given the choice between the two, restarting the economy was the top concern for 66 percent of Republicans, followed by 35 percent of independents and 14 percent of Democrats, poll data shows. Other key findings include 42 percent of people who said they know someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 — up from 11 percent in late March — and 68 percent who said they’re worried about a possible second wave of infections this fall. Fifty-eight percent of those polled also said they believe it’s too early to return to stores, restaurants and other public places, while 40 percent said they’re ready to head back. The poll of 1,001 US adults was conducted by phone from May 25 to 28 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.

An Indiana-based pharmaceutical company announced Monday it has started the world’s first human trial of an antibody therapy designed to treat the coronavirus. Eli Lilly and Co. said its potential treatment, known as LY-CoV555, is modeled after the antibodies found in the plasma of people who have recovered from the virus. The experimental treatment doesn’t contain plasma, but uses clones of the antibodies for the therapy, which is taken intravenously, the Wall Street Journal reported. The treatment is designed to target the spike-shaped protein structures of the virus and block it from locking on to human cells, thus neutralizing the bug. “We’re not experienced in vaccines, or antiviral small molecules,” Daniel Skovronsky, the company’s chief scientific officer, told the outlet. “But we’re really good at antibodies, engineering them, testing them, manufacturing them. That’s a capability we have, so the opportunity to work on antibodies against Covid-19 made total sense.” The company said the first phase of the study will assess how safe the medicine is and how well it is tolerated by patients hospitalized with COVID-19 — with the results expected by the end of June. New York University Grossman School of Medicine is one of the sites that will be testing it in the first phase. “What we’re doing here is taking patients with Covid, offering the opportunity to participate in a new treatment, hopefully to help them recover more quickly and uneventfully from their infection,” said Dr. Mark J. Mulligan, director of the infectious disease and vaccine research units at NYU Langone Health, according to the newspaper. If the drug is found to be safe, the company will move on to studying the potential treatment in non-hospitalized patients. With Post wires

Gilead Sciences’ antiviral drug remdesivir showed signs of helping certain coronavirus patients in a study showing better results from a shorter course of treatment, the company said Monday. People with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia who took a five-day treatment of remdesivir were 65 percent more likely to show “clinical improvement” at day 11 than people who received standard care, according to results of the phase-three study Gilead released. Patients who got a 10-day course of remdesivir also had “favorable” odds of improvement compared to standard care, the California-based company said — but they were not statistically significant, raising questions about why a longer course of treatment did not work better. “The lack of benefit in the 10-day arm is a surprise, in our view,” Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Marc Engelsgjerd and Jenna Li said in a note. “We need details on the standard-of-care arm and expected a greater benefit, given this was an open-label study.” Gilead shares dropped as much as 4.4 percent, to $74.40, on the news Monday. The company said it plans to submit the full research data to a peer-reviewed journal in the coming weeks. The results still added to the evidence that remdesivir can help treat the deadly coronavirus disease that has killed more than 100,000 Americans. The US Food and Drug Administration approved it for emergency use last month after a federal trial showed it could help speed recovery. “The additional data we have in hand today will further guide our research efforts, including evaluating treatment earlier in the course of disease, combination studies with other therapies for the most critically ill patients, pediatric studies and the development of alternate formulations,” Dr. Merdad Parsey, Gilead’s chief medical officer, said in a statement Monday. First developed to treat Ebola, remdesivir remains an experimental drug and can only be used to treat severely ill COVID-19 patients, according to Gilead. The company says the medicine was “generally well-tolerated” among the moderately sick patients it studied, though some experienced nausea, diarrhea and headache.

GUDELIAI, Lithuania – It took 13 seconds for Olivija, a 9-month-old girl, to crawl 5 meters from her family’s living room to the kitchen to be declared the fastest baby in Lithuania, where the annual baby crawlers race was moved online due to the coronavirus lockdown. The 13 babies competed by crawling through courses set up at their homes and broadcast live on Facebook via parents’ mobiles. The 14th competitor chose to take a mid-day nap instead. “Of course she does not understand what has happened. She is just a baby”, Olivija’s mother Ana said after the race, surrounded by three more of her children. “We believed Olivija will win because she crawls very fast. And you know what was at the finish? It was our pet’s food bowl. That is the top thing for her, she doesn’t need toys”, said Ana. An hour before the race, in a house just outside the country’s capital, Audrone, 29 and Tomas, 33, were continuously coaching their 10-month-old son Rokas to follow a 5-meter-long red ribbon marking the course. Various methods to tempt the baby towards the finish line were tested, from favorite toys and a promise of a hug from mother to an invitation to explore the open dishwasher. “Our baby was the best, even if he didn’t win”, said Tomas after Rokas finished not higher than fourth. Parents were told to lift up their baby as soon as his or her hand touched the finish line, to make it easier to time the runs and organizers pleaded with parents to avoid cheating.

SEOUL, South Korea — In a cramped office in eastern Seoul, Hwang Seungwon points a remote control toward a huge NASA-like overhead screen stretching across one of the walls. With each flick of the control, a colorful array of pie charts, graphs and maps reveals the search habits of thousands of South Korean senior citizens being monitored by voice-enabled “smart” speakers, an experimental remote care service the company says is increasingly needed during the coronavirus crisis. “We closely monitor for signs of danger, whether they are more frequently using search words that indicate rising states of loneliness or insecurity,” said Hwang, director of a social enterprise that handles SK Telecom’s services. Trigger words lead to a recommendation for a visit by public health officials. As South Korea’s government pushes to allow businesses to access vast amounts of personal information and to ease restrictions holding back telemedicine, tech firms could potentially find much bigger markets for their artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies. The drive, resisted for years by civil liberty advocates and medical professionals, has been reinvigorated by a technology-driven fight against COVID-19. It has so far allowed South Korea to emerge as something of a coronavirus success story but also raised broader worries that privacy is being sacrificed for epidemiological gains. Armed with an infectious disease law that was strengthened after a 2015 outbreak of a different coronavirus, MERS, health authorities have aggressively used credit-card records, surveillance videos and cellphone data to find and isolate potential virus carriers. Locations where patients went before they were diagnosed are published on websites and released through cellphone alerts. Smartphone tracking apps are used to monitor around 30,000 individuals quarantined at home. Starting Monday, entertainment venues in Seoul, Incheon and Daejeon will be required to register customers with smartphone QR codes so they can be easily located if needed. The requirement expands nationwide on June 10. But there’s a dark side. People here have often managed to trace back the online information to the unnamed virus carriers, exposing embarrassing personal details and making them targets of public contempt. A low point came in early May when local media described some Seoul nightclubs linked to hundreds of infections as catering to sexual minorities, triggering homophobic responses. Officials reacted by expanding “anonymous testing,” which allowed people to provide only their phone numbers and not their names during tests. There was a subsequent increase in tests. The past months have exposed a stark division about the best ways to make important decisions when privacy concerns collide with public health needs, said Haksoo Ko, a Seoul National University law professor and co-director of the school’s Artificial Intelligence Policy Initiative. Around 3,200 people across the country, mostly older than 70 and living alone, have so far allowed the SK Telecom speakers to listen to them 24 hours a day since the service launched in April 2019. The company expects users to at least double by the end of the year, judging by local government interest. The technology has reduced human contact in welfare services while still providing governments with a tool to prevent elderly residents from dying alone. That’s especially needed in a country grappling with an aging population and high poverty rates among retirees. The speakers are built with an artificial intelligence called “Aria” and a lamp that turns blue when processing voice commands for news, music and internet searches. The devices can also use quizzes to monitor the memory and cognitive functions of their elderly users, which would be potentially useful for advising treatments. But it’s difficult for SK Telecom’s clients to use the information without clear legal guidelines for handling health data on private networks. Similar reasons may also impede domestic use of health technologies developed by Samsung Electronics, which recently received approval for a smartwatch application that monitors blood pressure. KT, SK Telecom’s telecommunications rival, is focused on business customers, providing artificial intelligence devices such as speakers and service robots to hotels, offices and new apartments. President Moon Jae-in’s administration has said data-driven industries will be critical in boosting a pandemic-hit economy. Officials are preparing regulations for revised data laws that lawmakers passed in January after months of wrangling. They aim to allow businesses greater freedom in collecting and analyzing anonymous personal data without seeking individual consent. If they work as intended, optimists say the laws would allow artificial intelligence to truly take off and pave the way for highly customized financial and health care services after they start in August. But activist Oh Byoung-il said the changes could bring excessive privacy infringements unless robust safeguards are installed. “Companies will always have an endless thirst for data, but you can’t give it to them all,” he said. Doctors’ groups have also resisted government calls for legalizing telemedicine, raising concerns related to data security and a negative impact on smaller hospitals. Industrial benefits will be limited if officials can’t find the right combination of techniques to process personal information so that it can’t be used to identify individuals. Health and government authorities have failed to do this during the pandemic. South Korea’s anti-virus experience provides “lots of lessons and implications” as it steps toward a data-driven economy, Ko said. “With data, it’s bad to take ‘the more, the better’ approach,” he said. “An appropriate control system needs to be baked into the process, to make decisions on data access based on necessity and sensitivity and restrict access to information that isn’t really needed.” In Seoul’s Yangcheon district, officials are using SK Telecom’s tech to monitor some 200 seniors who live alone. Social workers, who have smartphone apps that look like a mini version of the main dashboard, make calls or visits when users don’t use their devices for more than 24 hours. “It’s nice to have something to talk to,” said Lee Chang-geun, an 89-year-old who has lived alone in his small apartment since his wife died three years ago. “But I wish they developed an Aria function for opening doors. What good is a distress signal if I die while emergency workers try to force open my door?”

Follow Eli Manning’s lead. Not just the script for his successor with the Giants, Daniel Jones. That’s also the advice quarterbacks across the NFL are getting during the coronavirus pandemic, courtesy of older brother Peyton Manning. Peyton told NBC Sports’ Peter King he is relaying a story of how Eli led the Giants through the 2011 NFL lockout, when contact between players and coaches was prohibited during the tense Collective Bargaining Agreement negotiations. The Giants finished 9-7 that season but won the NFC East and then beat the Atlanta Falcons, Green Bay Packers, San Francisco 49ers and New England Patriots to finish as Super Bowl 46 champions. Peyton and Eli recently were on a Zoom call for a friend who works in investment banking and someone asked, “How would you handle this situation as a quarterback?” “Eli talked about organizing their own workouts and taking some ownership,” Peyton said. “Eli got practice scripts, like blitz walk-through drawings, diagrams, he got practice jerseys, he organized workouts at a high school. He was kind of the head coach/coordinator and they were doing full routes and doing 7-on-7 and blitzes at practice. He was really thorough.” Submit your Giants questions here to be answered in an upcoming Post mailbag Comparisons between 2011 and 2020 are frequent around the NFL because of the closed facilities and lack of offseason practices. The key differences: In 2011, players could not talk to coaches. In 2020, players and coaches are having virtual meetings and, in some cases, workouts. In 2011, players could meet up for joint self-run practices. In 2020, social distancing limits the size of gatherings. “I’ve done a few Zoom calls,” Peyton said. “I did the Buffalo Bills quarterback room meeting. Did the Los Angeles Rams full team meeting. Did the Bears quarterbacks. That was kinda my message … follow Eli’s lead. Quarterbacks, take ownership. All these Zoom meetings, right now, the coaches are leading them. “My message was to the quarterbacks. ‘Hey, organize your own Zoom meetings without the coaches, just get you and the tight ends, you and the receivers.’ It’s actually an opportunity to even have better communication. Because there’s nothing else to do, right? Hey, every Tuesday, 9 a.m., quarterbacks and the offensive line, Zoom, watching film. Instead of complaining about it, see it as an opportunity to really improve. There’s no reason you shouldn’t have every play from last year studied down to the T.” If there is an NFL season and a Super Bowl, the popular favorites are the Kansas City Chiefs, Baltimore Ravens and San Francisco 49ers. But Peyton, who was 2-2 in the big game, favors whichever team quietly wins May and June. “I think the team that wins it all this year is gonna be the team that’s really getting an edge during this time,” he said. “Kind of like the Giants in 2011.”

 This is a terrible day for The New York Times – and freedom of expression everywhere. On Sunday afternoon, the Times announced that James Bennet, its editorial page editor, would resign, and Jim Dao, his deputy, would be reassigned. Their crime: publishing an opinion piece from a United States senator Times staffers and readers did not like. DAN GAINOR: NEW YORK TIMES SURRENDERS TO STAFF REVOLT OVER COTTON OP-ED AS EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR RESIGNS Last Wednesday the Times ran an op-ed from Senator Tom Cotton, R-Ark., suggesting American soldiers should be used to quell protests and violence related to the killing of George Floyd. To be clear, I thought Cotton’s op-ed was wrong. Last week I tweeted that invoking the Insurrection Act, which would allow active-duty soldiers to patrol in the United States, “is not a good idea.” The Insurrection Act should be a last resort. Even at its worst, last week’s violence did not rise to a level that police and the National Guard could not control. (And the way the piece compared the potential use of soldiers against the Floyd protests or riots to their use during the civil rights era to desegregate Southern schools was unnecessarily provocative.) But opinion pages exist to offer a diverse set of viewpoints. Knowing what people in power like Senator Cotton are thinking is especially important. Instead, Times readers – and more crucially, staffers – said the op-ed page should not have published Senator Cotton’s opinion at all. They called it racist and specifically dangerous to African-American employees at the Times. At a time when social media giants like Facebook and powerful technology companies like Amazon are openly censoring views they do not like, the fact that the Times – and other newspapers too – have also backed away from free speech is troubling and dangerous. “As a black woman, as a journalist, as an American, I am deeply ashamed that we ran this,” Nikole Hannah-Jones, a prominent Times reporter, wrote on Twitter. Roxane Gay, a regular contributor to the Times op-ed page, tweeted that “running this puts black @nytimes writers, editors, and other staff in danger.” At first Bennet and A.G. Sulzberger, the publisher of the Times, defended the Times’s right to publish the piece. “I believe in the principle of openness to a range of opinions, even those we may disagree with, and this piece was published in that spirit,” Sulzberger emailed Times reporters on June 4. But as the backlash worsened, Sulzberger changed his mind. By Friday he told reporters he found the piece “contemptuous.” Now Bennet, a sterling journalist who was once considered a front-runner to be the paper’s top editor, is out. And, according to the New York Times on Sunday evening, “Jim Dao, the deputy editorial page editor who oversees Op-Eds, is stepping down from his position…and taking a new job in the newsroom.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Remember: this was not a case of the paper publishing a plagiarized or fictionalized article. Seventeen years ago, The Times faced another crisis, after Jayson Blair – a young reporter and rising star – was discovered to have fabricated parts of several articles. I remember that debacle well. I was a reporter at the Times then. During a meeting, I famously asked Howell Raines, the paper’s editor, if he believed he had lost the confidence of the newsroom and would consider resigning. He did soon after. My colleagues and I were furious with Blair, and with Raines, who had enabled him. We believed in the mission of the Times, to report the news as honestly and completely as we could. And though I had never worked on the opinion page, I believed in its core mission – to encourage discussion and debate, even when those views might be uncomfortable to some. Bennet and Dao believed in those values too. Last year, they published an op-ed from me about the potential harms of cannabis, even though Dao knew many readers might disagree. Sunday, the Times has stood up for a different set of values; the values of conformity and groupthink and stifling dissent. I have a hard time imagining the Times’s next op-ed editors would run my cannabis piece. And if the opinion page will not publish unpopular views, what hope do reporters have of writing articles that break news that runs against the Times’s increasingly openly leftist attitude?

But if the most powerful platforms in American media are afraid to run voices that might make people uncomfortable, how can we? CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM ALEX BERENSON

 The Chinese Communist Party has a long history of exploiting crises to advance its strategic hegemony. During the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, for example, China invaded India while America and the Soviet Union were distracted. China’s war prize: the annexation of part of India’s Aksai Chin. Today, behind the cloak of a pandemic the Chinese Communist Party itself created, we are witnessing similar kinds of strategic behavior as China seeks to advance its own agenda and Chinese propagandists seek to advance a pro-authoritarian government narrative. Based on this behavior – including China’s attempt to snuff out democracy in Hong Kong – let’s consider whether COVID-19 might better stand for China On to Victory In Death by19 ways. GINGRICH & CHRISTENSEN: CORONAVIRUS WAS A WAKEUP CALL – NOW US-CHINA POLICY MUST BE REIMAGINED Here is a chronology beginning in late 2019: In mid-November, new pneumonia cases from a novel coronavirus start appearing in Wuhan. While the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) later suggests this outbreak started in a Wuhan wet market, two government laboratories in Wuhan handle exotic coronaviruses harvested from wild bats. In addition, China has had a coronavirus outbreak in at least one other lab in the past. Two Chinese scientists from the South China University of Technology identify the Wuhan Center for Disease Control as the possible source.  On Dec. 30, Dr. Li Wenliang sends a message to fellow doctors in a chat group warning of human-to-human transmission and community spread. He and seven other whistleblowers are detained by police and censured. Dr. Li later dies from the virus.  On Dec. 31, local Chinese officials bleach the Wuhan wet market. Doing this destroys the best possible evidence that could determine whether the wet market is the source of the coronavirus. Meanwhile, the virus samples gathered have yet to be shared with the world.  From early December through Jan. 20 this year, the CCP hides the virus from the world behind the shield of a puppet World Health Organization. China denies international experts and those from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention access to Wuhan to study the virus. On Jan. 14, the WHO tweets that “preliminary investigations conducted by Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission” of the coronavirus. On Jan. 7, Chinese President Xi Jinping issues demands to a CCP Politburo Standing Committee to “contain the outbreak.” Yet Xi allows Chinese diplomats to travel to the White House a week later to shake the hands of President Trump and his trade team. Only after the Phase I trade deal with the U.S. is signed on Jan. 15 does Xi reveal on Jan. 20 the “demon” virus the Chinese Communist Party has allowed to spread.  On Jan. 21, despite promising in the Jan. 15 trade deal not to steal American intellectual property, the Wuhan Institute of Virology – where the deadly virus may well have originated – applies for a patent on Remdesivir, a therapeutic developed by an American company. The clear objective: break the American patent.  By late January, the CCP locks down internal domestic travel but keeps international travel open until the end of March. While more than 5 million Chinese citizens flee Wuhan before its lockdown, hundreds of thousands of Chinese citizens fly around the world spreading the virus, thereby turning what could have been a contained outbreak in Wuhan into a global pandemic.  On Jan. 31, President Trump makes a courageous decision. He suspends and limits the entry into the United States of foreign nationals who had been in People’s Republic of China within 14 days of their attempted entry into the United States. The CCP calls it an “overreaction.” A day later presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden calls Trump a “xenophobe.” While hiding the China virus from the world, the CCP turns from a large net exporter of personal protective equipment (PPE) to a huge net importer.  China’s PPE hoarding including over 2 billion coveted N-95 masks – helps create a deadly shortage among doctors and nurses from Milan to New York and beyond.  After the Wall Street Journal publishes an opinion piece (not a news article) on Feb. 3 criticizing the Chinese virus response, the CCP revokes the credentials of three Journal reporters based in Beijing on Feb. 19. A month later, it revokes the credentials of reporters from The New York Times and Washington Post and – in violation of Hong Kong’s Basic Law – extends the bans to reporting from Hong Kong.  In late January, Beijing officials prevent the Wuhan Institute of Virology from sharing sample isolates of the novel coronavirus with the University of Texas biocontainment lab. This overrules an initial agreement by the Wuhan lab to share these samples. The CCP installs People’s Liberation Army Maj. Gen. Chen Wei, the Chinese military’s top epidemiologist and virologist, into a senior position at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.  As the CCP quells the outbreak in Wuhan, in part by barricading citizens into their own homes, it uses its vast stockpile of PPE to profiteer. Chinese enterprises hawk masks, gloves, gowns, and goggles at huge markups – even selling PPE at inflated prices back to countries like Italy that had originally provided the PPE. To further profiteer, China begins to flood world markets – from Spain, Turkey and the Netherlands to Georgia, the Czech Republic and the United States – with defective test kits and PPE.  Rather than fix the problems, the CCP blames “user error.”   On April 4, following a well-established playbook of capitalizing on international crises, a Chinese Coast Guard vessel sinks a Vietnamese fishing trawler. The CCP then adds 80 more islands, reefs and other sea features to further assert its false territorial claims in the South China Sea. The U.S. State Department warns the CCP to “stop exploiting the distraction or vulnerability of other states to expand its unlawful claims.” On April 24, Europe bows to CCP pressure by whitewashing China’s culpability in a European Union report on disinformation campaigns about the virus. On April 30, in a demonstration of “Wolf Warrior” diplomacy that rejects any acknowledgment of blame, the CCP warns the Netherlands to change the name of its de facto embassy in Taiwan or face a halt in PPE and a Chinese boycott of Dutch products.  On April 29, a senior CCP official blames the Trump administration for “wasting weeks after the threat posed by the virus first became apparent.”  On May 13, the FBI and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issue warnings that hackers with links to the CCP are attempting to steal the intellectual property of the American and other foreign companies seeking to develop a vaccine – this despite a CCP promise in the Phase I China trade deal to stop stealing America’s intellectual property. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER On May 18, the CCP promises $2 billion over two years in assistance for the pandemic response globally. This is a fraction of the more than $9 billion in U.S. funding to benefit the global China virus response and less than China borrows from the World Bank. China has failed in its attempt to block 193 other member states from adopting a resolution that calls for an impartial, independent, comprehensive investigation into the WHO’s response and the origins of the virus. But the CCP has already begun to try and stall these important investigations. On May 22, after subduing Hong Kong protesters with a lockdown and “under the cover of the virus,” the CCP moves in for the democracy kill with a new security law. This law will put Chinese security officials into the streets of Hong Kong, escalate surveillance of Hong Kong citizens, and impose a social credit score system designed to punish peaceful protests and dissent. This jackboot follows the April arrest of 81-year old Martin Lee, the founder of Hong Kong’s Democratic Party; news publisher Jimmy Lai; and more than 10 prominent pro-democracy leaders. As we move forward in time, there will likely be many more political, economic and military gambits added by the CCP to exploit a pandemic that the CCP’s own bad behavior created. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The irony, of course, is that the CCP is now propagating the myth that the Chinese authoritarian rule provides a superior system of governance to the free and democratic rule of law. If public opinion polls are to be believed, however, nobody is buying what the CCP is selling. We here in America surely are not buying it; and the CCP is hereby on notice that we are not distracted. We know exactly what the CCP is attempting to do. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM PETER NAVARRO 

Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton explains the inside story of his New York Times op-ed ‘Send in the Troops’ on ‘Sunday Morning Futures.’ Bruce Springsteen wrote, “No retreat, baby, no surrender.” Clearly, he wasn’t talking about The New York Times which saw the resignation of a top editor Sunday. The Gray Lady has been setting a surrender record in the past few days that would be the envy of Neville Chamberlain.The Times, D-NY, ran an op-ed from Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., earlier this week that urged the president to “Send In the Troops” to quell the rioting across the nation. Cotton said President Donald Trump should deploy the Insurrection Act, which is supported by “58 percent of registered voters.” DAVID MARCUS: TOM COTTON'S NEW YORK TIMES OP-ED HYSTERIA REVEALS SHOCKING COWARDICE AT THE PAPER
The paper has been capitulating to the leftist mob, including its own employees, ever since. Times staffers reacted with what the Daily Beast called an “Open Revolt” and forced their bosses to give in to the mob on Thursday, after the bosses initially supported publishing the opinion piece. First, Times leadership backed off their initial support. Then they held a staff meeting and announced the op-ed wouldn’t be running in the print paper. Late Friday, the paper added 322 words to the op-ed and gave in once more.
That wasn’t enough. On Sunday, the paper announced that “James Bennet, Editorial Page Editor since May, 2016, is resigning effective immediately.” That’s the kind of resignation people make when their cowardly bosses abandon all journalistic ethics and throw you under the bus. It’s also unclear if “resignation” was code for “You’re fired!”
“Jim Dao, the deputy editorial page editor who oversees Op-Eds, is stepping down from his position,” the paper announced in a story about the public relations disaster. But there’s more. Here’s a summary from The Times about the office revolt over the op-ed. “As of Thursday evening, over 800 staff members had signed a letter protesting its publication, addressed to high-ranking editors in the opinion and news divisions, as well as New York Times Company executives.”
The article went on to note: “Dozens of Times employees objected to the Op-Ed on social media, as well, despite a company policy that instructs them not to post partisan comments or take sides on issues.” Just in case you thought the paper was somehow neutral.
Reaction to the news about Bennet was swift. President Donald J. Trump tweeted mocking the paper: “Opinion Editor at @nytimes just walked out. That’s right, he quit over the excellent Op-Ed penned by our great Senator @TomCottonAR. TRANSPARENCY! The State of Arkansas is very proud of Tom. The New York Times is Fake News!!!" he wrote. Cotton also tweeted writing, "I'm beginning to suspect that @nytimes is not an objective, unbiased source of news. New York magazine Washington Correspondent Olivia Nuzzi noted that the whole fiasco had benefited Cotton. “This entire episode could not have gone better for Tom Cotton if he wrote the script himself.”
The Times’s cave-in to its leftist staff became very obvious when it added the Editor’s Note to the op-ed earlier this week. Here’s the money line to appease the mob: “we have concluded that the essay fell short of our standards and should not have been published.” “Should not have been published!” Perhaps The Times should change its slogan and have those words appear on every edition of the paper. The appeasement continued by whining about “the tone of the essay,” saying it “in places is needlessly harsh and falls short of the thoughtful approach that advances useful debate.” Wow, “needlessly harsh?” Our cities are burning and being looted, including New York, where this travesty of journalism is published, but let’s not be needlessly harsh. The paper didn’t hide the reason for its wimp out. It’s there in the first sentence: “this essay met strong criticism from many readers (and many Times colleagues), prompting editors to review the piece and the editing process.” The parenthetical says it all. Coddled Times staffers were mad that someone expressed an opinion they didn’t agree with. The result is the far-left Times, one of the most influential news outlets in the nation, is being pushed into complete loony land. You can’t have that at The Times, where even the allegedly right-leaning staffers regularly take left-wing positions. Columnist Bret Stephens, who Times employees seem to despise for being right-wing, hates both the Second Amendment and is an avowed Never Trumper. His most recent piece was headlined, “Donald Trump Is Our National Catastrophe.” But you’re never left enough for The Times now. The paper had already capitulated Thursday night, claiming the Cotton op-ed “fell short of the newspaper’s standards” in a separate article. Spokeswoman Eileen Murphy pretended “that a rushed editorial process led to the publication of an Op-Ed that did not meet our standards.” This wasn’t the first time Executive Editor Dean Baquet cowered in front of The Times mob. In August, the paper ran a five-word headline that was skewered by the left, especially at The Times. The headline said simply: “TRUMP URGES UNITY VS. RACISM.” CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER The headline was changed multiple times and then Baquet held an embarrassing staff meeting where he was criticized for not being liberal enough. He admitted “that our readers and some of our staff cheer us when we take on Donald Trump, but they jeer at us when we take on Joe Biden.” Things have devolved since, which explains the latest freakout. Opinion editor Bari Weiss described the conflict as the “civil war inside The New York Times between the (mostly young) wokes and the (mostly 40+) liberal.” The result is that the far-left Times, one of the most influential news outlets in the nation, is being pushed into complete loony land. “They call it ‘safetyism,’ in which the right of people to feel emotionally and psychologically safe trumps what were previously considered core liberal values, like free speech,” explained Weiss. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP She’s spot on. America’s left has radicalized in ways we’ve seen only in places like Cuba, Venezuela and the old USSR. It’s not just the rioters in the streets. It’s the people who claim to report on the news in an objective way. They have taken the knee and bowed to their woke employees, deciding that opposition voices are not welcome … because they are scary. Every fight in the near future will be like this — one of safety vs. liberty. And The Times no longer pretends to believe in liberty, just surrender. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY DAN GAINOR

 Pandemics are public health emergencies; they aren't supposed to be political. Yet, the American people have been subjected to Draconian lockdowns for months that have stripped our Constitutional rights -- to assemble, worship or even to leave our homes to go to work -- to prevent the spread of the coronavirus we've been told by government and health officials alike is extremely contagious and would kill scores if we didn't comply. We've been told that if we didn't obey the mandated national quarantine and other government guidelines and restrictions that the U.S. health care system could collapse. This means millions of businesses haven't opened their doors for months, causing a decimated economy and the loss of more than 40 million jobs. Approximately 57 million children, grades K-12, haven't gone to school since March. Places of worship have been closed, weddings and funerals canceled and professional sports on hiatus while beaches, swimming pools and millions of restaurants, bars, gyms and hotels remain shuttered nationwide. ELIZABETH AMES: DID GEORGE FLOYD'S HORRIFIC DEATH IGNITE A CORONAVIRUS POWDERKEG? Even our nation's beloved Disneyland, "The Happiest Place on Earth," had to close the doors of its amusement parks and furlough more than 100,000 workers in April. That's just the tip of the iceberg. Families across the country have been heartbreakingly restricted from saying goodbye in person to loved ones dying in hospitals and nursing homes. Americans have been forced to delay cancer screenings and other medical procedures that put our health at risk while also being forced to wear masks and practice social distancing or risk getting fined as much as $1,000 in places like Massachusetts. All of this was in the name of protecting vulnerable populations and curtailing the spread. Did the virus that robbed us of our basic freedoms and livelihoods just vanish overnight?  Now, we're seeing massive gatherings in cities across America protesting the wrongful death of George Floyd. Although our nation is rightfully appalled by the police brutality that led to his alleged murder, it doesn't eliminate the fact that the stringent social distancing rules that have been imposed on the masses have been completely ignored by tens of thousands of protesters and rioters -many of whom aren't wearing masks. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER But perhaps more troubling is the same government officials and so-called experts that implored us to #StayHome these past few months -- no matter how difficult -- have been noticeably silent about the throngs of protestors congregating shoulder to shoulder. Why is that? Did the virus that robbed us of our basic freedoms and livelihoods just vanish overnight? Or have we been led astray by power-thirsty officials and other "experts" who may have been wrong about the transmission of the virus all along? These are questions many Americans are now asking including Donald Trump Jr., the president's son, who tweeted on Monday: "Why is the media no longer concerned, and often almost gleeful, about all the mass gatherings that would have been so deadly due to COVID 19 just a few days ago? I guess these people magically aren't 'killing their grandmas' by going outside anymore?!?" The government that's been ignoring the potential spread of the virus from the massive crowds of protestors for over a week now is the same government that arrested a hair salon owner in Texas last month for daring to reopen her business to feed her family. It's the same government that arrested a paddleboarder in Malibu, California, in April for violating the lockdown order. And it's the same government that imposed steep fines or threat of imprisonment to any business owner that dared to reopen without permission. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Here's the deal. If someone contracts COVID-19, there's a four- or five-day incubation period, on average, before symptoms manifest. So, if the virus is as contagious as we've been told, we should soon be seeing a surge in new cases and hospitalizations given the mass gatherings began May 26. If that's not the case, then citizens should demand government officials revoke mask and social distancing requirements, reinstitute our freedoms and reopen schools, sports arenas and the entire economy -- today.

 On May 22, President Trump observed, “In America, we need more prayer, not less.” In light of recent events, I couldn’t agree more. Now, perhaps more than ever, Christians need to come together to pray for America. Our houses of worship are essential places providing essential services, and we must begin the process of returning to our churches in a safe way. Almost every church in America has been shut down for months, even on Easter Sunday. The president pointed out that it is not right for some governors to allow liquor stores and abortion clinics to reopen but require churches to remain shuttered. When he boldly stood up for religious liberty by calling for America’s churches to reopen, that resonated with millions of believers around the country. ADRIANA COHEN: CORONAVIRUS 'SHELTER-IN-PLACE' ORDERS -- DID THEY SUDDENLY VANISH? After the president’s remarks, he called me and made it very clear that he’s not asking for churches to open capriciously. It ought to be done carefully, and it needs to be done now. Of course, each congregation needs to make wise decisions according to their individual situations. At First Baptist Dallas, we have been very cautious about this. From the beginning, we have said that we are going to be data-driven, not date driven. We heeded the advice of our federal, state and local authorities. Recently, we observed an overall plateau in the number of COVID-19 cases in our area and a decline in the percentage of positive cases to overall tests. Based on these metrics, we prayerfully decided to partially reopen on June 7. Our church opened at 20 percent capacity, using a reservation system. In our “contactless service,” we didn’t exchange printed programs or pass offering plates; instead, we provided receptacles for offerings and decision cards. We encouraged social distancing and placed hand-sanitizing stations throughout our campus. We also strongly encouraged everybody to wear face masks. Unfortunately, wearing a mask has become a political issue for many people. It’s not a political issue; it’s a medical issue. It’s not about your freedom; it’s about keeping other people safe. Some believers will remain in quarantine while others will be on campus, but we are all part of the same family — and someday soon we will be together again. Some people say, “I feel comfortable not wearing a mask.” But it isn’t about you; it’s about other people. Yes, a mask may to some extent protect you from the coronavirus, but it’s more effective in keeping others around you from contracting it. The New Testament is filled with principles that say we ought not use our freedom to hurt other people. Romans 14:7–8 says, “Not one of us lives for himself, and not one dies for himself; for if we live, we live for the Lord, or if we die, we die for the Lord.” Philippians 2:3–4 says, “Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves; do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others.” What we do affects others, and we are to look out for the welfare of others. While you may feel OK about not wearing a mask, you may be around an elderly person or a person with respiratory problems who could die if they contracted this virus. That’s why we’re asking everybody to wear a mask so that we can protect one another as we worship together. Now, just because churches begin gradually reopening doesn’t mean it is the right thing for every person right now. At First Baptist Dallas, we encourage those who have underlying health issues or feel they are especially susceptible to this virus to stay home and continue worshipping with us on our iCampus at 9:30 and 11 a.m. We will also stream our live services on our website. Regardless of whether people worship with us in person or at home, they are an important part of our church. In Ephesians 3:14–15, Paul said there is one family — the family of God. Some members of the family have gone ahead of us; they are in heaven. Some are on earth. But if we are believers, we are all part of the same family. The same thing is true of our churches. Some believers will remain in quarantine while others will be on campus, but we are all part of the same family — and someday soon we will be together again. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Now, we’ve seen that tensions are high as people begin to go out into the community. I think one word that needs to characterize the way we interact during this time is grace. All believers need to exercise grace, love and understanding toward one another, especially in this transitional reopening process. But it’s clear that Christians across America are ready to get back to in-person worship in a safe atmosphere, and it’s time for our nation’s churches to reopen. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

 Make no mistake: Voter fraud is real. Democrats, the anti-Trump news media and the so-called public interest groups on the political left will tell you otherwise, but they are either lying or totally ignorant. Voter fraud is a threat to the integrity of our elections, the heart of our democracy. Democrats want to make the problem worse with their new voting laws. I believe this issue is incredibly important, now more than ever. So, as part of my ongoing Election 2020 podcast series, I decided to examine voter fraud in depth in this week’s episode of my podcast “Newt’s World.” RNC CHAIR MCDANIEL: DEMOCRATS AND VOTER FRAUD IN NEVADA — HERE'S HOW IT WILL IMPACT YOU My guest is Hans von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation and manager of the think tank’s Election Law Reform Initiative. He is one of the preeminent experts on election law and election fraud and explains how Democrats are pushing proposals that will clearly make fraud more prevalent. Anyone who denies the existence of voter fraud in the U.S. needs to go to Heritage’s online database, where they will find 1,285 proven instances of it – including 1,110 criminal convictions. Some of the stories are quite striking. In 2016, for example, Elbert Melton, the former mayor of Gordon, Ala., illegally notarized two ballots, without witnesses present, while running for reelection. Melton won the race by only 16 votes. Many local and state races are decided by such small margins. He was convicted of absentee ballot fraud, removed from office, and sentenced to one year in prison. The biggest way to expand voter fraud is to expand voting by mail. And Democrats want to impose universal vote-by-mail across the country. Traditionally, voters have long been able to request that an absentee ballot be mailed to them if they have a valid excuse for not being able to go to their local polling place – the physically disabled or sick, and of course our troops stationed abroad and their families. This is still the case in most states, but some – such as Oregon – simply mail an absentee ballot to every single registered voter. The problem with mailing ballots like this is that the lists of registered voters across the country are in terrible shape, and states do a poor job of cleaning their voter rolls. In fact, most states have given up on doing so. Every time they try, well-funded liberal groups accuse them of purging active, eligible voters from the rolls to suppress voting. As a result, ballots get mailed out to people who no longer live at the same addresses because they have moved or died. Therefore, a precious item, perhaps our society’s most valuable – the ballot – is just out there, for anyone to exploit. It isn’t that difficult to imagine how people could fill out fraudulent ballots, mail them in, and have them counted. Voting by mail also leads to ballot harvesting – the practice of allowing third parties to collect voters’ ballots and turn them in together to polling stations. Imagine a political operative or a campaign volunteer showing up at your front door to collect your ballot and deliver it for you. Your ballot would no longer be secret, but more importantly, the operative or volunteer could pressure or even intimidate you to vote a certain way – especially if you are sick, elderly, or speak poor English. Another invitation for dishonest elections and inaccurate voting is same-day registration. Under this system, if you aren’t registered to vote, you can register on Election Day and immediately vote. Election officials have no time to verify your information or determine if you’re even an eligible voter who lives at the address that you provide. Democrats are pushing all of these measures in earnest. They included each one and many more in HR 1, the very first bill that Democrats introduced after they retook control of the House in 2018. And House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., included the same measures in her $3 trillion monstrosity of a bill that is supposedly meant to stimulate the economy amid the coronavirus pandemic.  CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Pelosi and the Democrats are using the coronavirus as an excuse to impose these voting laws and other far-left ideas on the country. As Hans von Spakovsky explains to me, Liberia had a successful election in 2014 despite the Ebola epidemic. Wisconsin also held an election without problems earlier this year, as did South Korea, amid the current pandemic. Polling places just need to institute the necessary safety measures, which they can do. The fearmongering from the news media and the left about the consequences of holding the November election in person has no basis in reality. But Democrats are still pushing these voting laws as a deliberate strategy to maximize their ability to win elections. I’ve spent a lifetime in politics and don’t remember anything this bad, where people are so blatantly and openly willing to push illegality – in this case in the form of voter fraud. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As von Spakovsky notes, Democrats have gotten to the point where they believe the ends justify the means. They believe that President Trump is so terrible and evil that anything they do to win, even cheating, is justified. I hope you will listen to this week’s episode to learn how Democrats are trying to steal not only the November election but also future elections. And I hope you will listen to my next episode, set to air Wednesday, on the nationwide riots and protests following the killing of George Floyd.  To read, hear, and watch more of Newt Gingrich’s commentary, visit Gingrich360.com.

 From the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s to the 2009 Tea Party March on Washington in 2009 to the annual March for Life in our nation’s capital, peaceful protests have been a hallmark – and strength – of American democracy. But the violence that has erupted around the protests over the death of George Floyd has nothing to do with democracy. Attacks on law enforcement officers and innocent civilians; looting and burning small businesses (often in minority neighborhoods) – this is criminal behavior. It is the work of anarchists and lawless mobs, instigated by those who want to take advantage of the tragedy that occurred in Minneapolis. State and local law enforcement are responsible for protecting the public – including those engaged in civil protests – and going after those engaged in criminal violence. If police forces need help, governors may call upon their state National Guard to lend a hand. JAMES CARAFANO: LIKE HEROES OF D-DAY, NATIONAL GUARD MEMBERS NOW DEFEND US – THIS TIME FROM RIOTING IN US U.S. Attorney General William Barr has said that federal law enforcement also has a role in “apprehending and charging the violent agitators who have hijacked peaceful protest and are engaged in violations of federal law.” He added that the “violence carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly.” He’s right, if there are violations of federal law. The Federal Anti-Riot Act (18 U.S.C § 2101) allows the federal government to go after anyone who “travels in interstate or foreign commerce” or who uses “any facility of interstate or foreign commerce, including, but not limited to, the mail, telegraph, telephone, radio or television” to “incite a riot; or to organize, promote, encourage, participate in or carry on a riot; or to commit any act of violence in furtherance of a riot.” So anyone who travels from out of state or uses his phone or his computer with the specific intent to instigate and participate in riots is violating federal law. It also applies to those who “aid or abet” anyone else to carry out such acts. Someone found guilty can be fined, imprisoned for up to five years or both for each violation. The law contains an unusual provision that shows Congress was quite serious about using it to stop the type of anarchy we are seeing in some of our nation’s cities today. It directs the attorney general, when he believes that any person has violated the law, to “proceed as speedily as possible with a prosecution … and with any appeal” that may result “from any decision adverse to the government resulting from such prosecution.” The Justice Department also has the ability to use a criminal civil rights statute against those members of Antifa and other domestic terrorist groups who use face masks and disguises intended to hide their identity. Congressional intent is clear here: when riots break out, the executive branch must act as quickly as possible to go after those who are fomenting mayhem. This provision was used successfully to prosecute three white supremacists who traveled from California to Virginia in August 2017 to incite and organize violence in protests being held at the University of Virginia. In May of last year, a federal district court in U.S. v. Daley ruled that this statute was constitutional, rejecting the defendants’ arguments that it was not within the power of Congress to pass such a criminal law. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER The Justice Department also has the ability to use a criminal civil rights statute against those members of Antifa and other domestic terrorist groups who use face masks and disguises intended to hide their identity. The statute, 18 U.S.C. §241 prohibits conspiracies to “injure, oppress, threaten or intimidate any person … in the exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States.” It also prohibits individuals from going “in disguise on the highway or on the premises of another, with intent to prevent or hinder his free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege so secured.” These rioters are arguably violating the rights of peaceful protesters, business owners and law enforcement officers to exercise their free speech rights, to own private property and protect their lives, and to carry out their duties to protect the public and enforce law and order. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Violating this statute is punishable by up to 10 years in federal prison. Ironically, the disguise language was inserted into the statute to go after the Ku Klux Klan (KKK). It may be applicable here, as it seems obvious that Antifa and other radical groups have adopted the KKK’s tactics of violence and masking. State and federal law enforcement have to act to stop violent criminals from hijacking of the “peaceful and legitimate protests” – as Barr termed it – over George Floyd’s death. This type of criminal behavior has no place in a civilized, orderly society where we work out our problems peacefully through debate, political action and the democratic process.

Nancy Gray and her husband, Kenneth, stood guard over her mother's Illinois bridal shop for hours on Sunday, as looters took advantage of the protests related to the death of George Floyd. Gray said she passed the broken windows of the First Midwest Bank though tear gas, which stung her eyes and made her husband unable to see, The Chicago Tribune reported. Her mother’s store, Creaciones Morelos on Broadway in Aurora, was one of many businesses that were damaged when crowds reportedly clashed with police, including lighting a dumpster on fire. “My heart was beating so fast,” she told The Tribune. “It was heart-wrenching to see how they were destroying all these other businesses, and you couldn’t do anything about it.” MICHIGAN RESTAURANT OWNER SAYS HE USED FACEBOOK TO IDENTIFY SUSPECTS INVOLVED IN PROPERTY DESTRUCTION Gray said she was at her home in Oswego on Sunday night when a cousin sent her clip of a jewelry store near her mother's shop being robbed. That's when Gray and her husband decided to act. “Much like my family, they’ve come from little to nothing,” Kenneth Gray told The Tribune. “And they’ve worked hard, day in, day out, to make sure that their family is taken care of, and to make sure that they have a legacy to leave for them.” The store windows remained intact and the contents were thankfully not looted. However, Gray claimed she saw someone trying to sell looted goods in front of them, out on the street. “That’s not right,” Gray said. “This is not the way to do it. You’re hurting your community, like [the] minority community.” The couple also told the Tribune that they saw other business owners step in to protect their property. Men from a nearby barbershop offered to help the Grays defend the store and the couple repaid the kindness by helping board up another shop that had its door damaged.

 America is at a crossroads. Violent riots threaten our communities just as we begin to reemerge from months in lockdown. Now we face a choice between peace and fear, order and anarchy, light and darkness. Governors and mayors across the country acted in fear when they shuttered small businesses and closed houses of worship. As a result, millions remain out of work. Substance abuse, depression and suicide are on the rise. In response, Americans from all over the country turned to faith and called for reopening while Leftist politicians shamed them. As New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy put it, those who disobey social distancing orders have “blood on [their] hands.” NEWT GINGRICH: DEMOCRATS WANT TO STEAL NOVEMBER ELECTION – HERE'S HOW Now more than ever, we need peace, order and faith as our country reels following the senseless death of George Floyd. But, as thousands of looters and rioters ransack stores, burn churches and spread violence across our nation, where are these same Leftist politicians that chided faithful and freedom-loving Americans just weeks ago? Where were they as St. John’s Church in Washington, D.C., burned? I will always stand up for Americans’ First Amendment rights — whether it be peacefully protesting or practicing their faith. However, in no way is the behavior we are seeing a peaceful demonstration. The Constitution does not protect or condone setting churches ablaze, looting stores and destroying property. Yet, as these vigilantes take to the street, I have yet to hear any state or local leaders cry “social distancing” and break up these mass gatherings out of coronavirus concerns. The Leftist media suddenly isn’t concerned about the threat of coronavirus spreading among large crowds of angry protesters, when just weeks ago they lauded the arrest of hairdressers for reopening their shops. New York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio, who recently ordered the arrest of courageous New Yorkers seeking to worship at synagogues over COVID-19 concerns, now stands in the streets as looters shatter windows and steal countless business owners’ livelihoods. The same politicians who once called for total lockdowns of their states are now allowing looters and rioters to destroy the communities they claim to love. There is a difference between taking to the streets to peacefully protest the wrongful death of George Floyd and the destruction of property and entire communities that we are seeing. I grieve for Floyd’s family and look forward to justice being served. But the hypocrisy from Leftist leaders has only added fuel to this fire. The same politicians who once called for total lockdowns of their states are now allowing looters and rioters to destroy the communities they claim to love. Make no mistake, these destructive actions are compounding problems that will harm African-American communities more than we can imagine. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER In Minneapolis, rioters have burned low-income housing and a police precinct. In Dallas, a store owner was beaten unconscious by individuals who certainly were not honoring George Floyd’s memory. In our nation’s capital, the historic St. John’s Church, which Mayor Muriel Bowser forcibly shuttered for months, was set on fire by the same anarchists the mayor refused to remove from the streets. It’s sickening to see groups like ANTIFA use George Floyd’s death as an excuse to tear down our nation’s institutions and sow discord. New York's top terrorism official says anarchist groups initially planned to incite violence at protests nationwide. It takes a special kind of evil to take advantage of the nation’s grief and organize riots that have destroyed communities across the country. This terrible situation has only been exacerbated by the poor leadership of governors and mayors who have chosen to lock up business owners instead of the violent rioters terrorizing their cities. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP We must root out this darkness. As Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once said, “Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that.” Our governors and mayors need to refocus their priorities. They need to take a stand against violent anarchists burning cities to the ground, not hairdressers seeking to reopen their shops. Now is the time to honor George Floyd’s memory by restoring order, stopping these violent rioters in the tracks and letting light drive out the darkness. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY REP. KEN BUCK

Beginning in grade school, I had done all kinds of things for pay – ran errands for Howie, the owner of a local candy store, mowed lawns, shoveled snow, delivered newspapers and been a receptionist and janitor at our local church. But it felt different to put on a suit and step into the grandeur of American retail. I had shopped the store all my life with my parents, gazed admiringly at its windows at Christmas, and had always enjoyed the gentle, calm atmosphere. Pinning on my name tag that first day, I felt like I was joining part of a long and storied history. PAUL BATURA: AMID CORONAVIRUS CRISIS, LOOK FOR THESE MESSAGES OF HOPE AND INSPIRATION At first selling men’s suits and then shoes, the role was a good fit for me. I enjoyed talking with people and helping them, and the company’s motto made for a happy and satisfied clientele – the customer was always right. Bosses can make or break a job wherever you work. I went through a lot of them at Lord & Taylor, but there’s one, in particular, I’ll never forget. Sidney Rosenthal was short and stocky, a big shock of graying hair combed across his head. He was in his late 60s, had deep jowls and a gravelly voice. Even though he was diminutive in size, he used to take long strides as he hustled from the floor to the stock room to retrieve shoes. I liked Sidney immediately. He was kind and courtly and made me laugh. Told me all kinds of crazy and funny stories. He could be grumpy and used to complain when folks wouldn’t buy, especially if he thought they had a lot of money. Truth be told, he thought everybody was rich. “Look at the rock on that lady’s finger,” he would say. A lifetime bachelor, Sidney lived alone in a small apartment. He mentioned a brother, but no other family member. I remember he had a thing for Elizabeth Taylor, used to talk about her all the time, but never seemed to be dating anyone. He joked that the men’s shoe department was a bad place to meet rich widows. The attorney told me I had been named in his will and invited me to his office for a public reading of it.  One day I found Sidney sitting alone and unresponsive in the shoe department before the store opened. Most of the lights were off, and his stoic posture startled me. His eyes were open, but there he sat just staring off into the distance. I quickly dialed 911. It turned out Sidney had tuberculosis. When I went to visit him in the hospital, I had to put on a gown and mask. He said very little, fading in and out of consciousness.  Within a week he was gone. I received a call from his lawyer a few weeks later. The attorney told me I had been named in his will and invited me to his office for a public reading of it. At the time, I was still in college and scraping by like every other 20-something. Honestly, though I grieved my boss’ passing, the news that I was named in his will kind of intrigued me. With no wife or much family and a spartan lifestyle, was he worth big bucks? After all, we’ve all read the stories about the millionaire next door. Sitting in a small office with a few other individuals, including Sidney’s brother, who was a crossing guard, the attorney read the following: “To my good friend and colleague, Paul Batura, I leave my valuable record collection, including my all-time favorite album, ‘Saturday Night Fever.’ I have wonderful memories of our long conversations about our mutual love of music.” Sidney’s entire “collection” consisted of 12 records. And I had absolutely no recollection of us ever talking about a “mutual” love of music. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER As it was, Sidney liked to talk, and I liked to listen and ask him questions. I guess he simply interpreted my inquisitiveness for an appreciation of music. It’s been many years since my friend passed away, and whenever I see the albums on my shelf, I think of him and smile. It was greedy and selfish of me to think about receiving some financial windfall. I’m not proud to admit it. It turns out, I received something even more valuable than money, though, and I’m not talking about disco music and John Travolta. Instead, I received a reminder that sometimes the best thing you can give to people is your attention and your interest. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As we head into this strange COVID summer of 2020, adjusting to a new normal as we go, “Stayin’ Alive” – one of the hits of the famed “Saturday Night Fever” soundtrack – remains the top priority of everyone. Along the way, though, don’t forget that the best way to thrive while “Stayin’ Alive” is to show interest in other people. Don’t think less of yourself – just think of yourself less and more of those around you. In the end, that approach will leave you the richest man in town. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY PAUL BATURA

 George Floyd was killed in Minneapolis last week when a police officer used brutally excessive force to arrest him. It was the latest in a string of high-profile cases nationwide in which citizens, most of them African Americans, died from reckless police force. Once again, protests over police brutality turned violent and rioting ensued. The U.S. is torn apart over the national mass quarantine. Liberal blue states accused red restart states of recklessly endangering national health by allowing their populations to go back to work before the virus has left. Red states countered that blue states were hypocritical in wanting federal money to subsidize their locked-down residents while expecting other states to generate needed federal revenue. They also contended that there was no longer scientific evidence to justify the lockdown. CORONAVIRUS FACE MASKS SHOULD BE WORN IN PUBLIC, WHO SAYS IN UPDATED GUIDANCE The nationwide protests and rioting have inadvertently adjudicated the issue: States cannot jail the law-abiding barber who wears a mask at work but allow the arsonist without one to roam the streets burning with impunity. There is mounting evidence that an array of federal officials had plotted to disrupt Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign and his presidential transition, leaving Trump supporters furious. Meanwhile, likely Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is sequestered in his basement. He often appears confused. Yet Biden seems content that the more people do not see or hear him, the more they like the idea of him as president. Indeed, the more inert Biden has become, the more his poll numbers have risen against Trump and his tweeting. As the U.S. protested and bickered, China attempted to strangle what was left of Hong Kong’s enfeebled democracy. China’s theory seemed to be that if it’s going to be blamed for the spreading virus due to its deceit anyway, it might as well not let such a pandemic go to waste. The Chinese strategy in reaction to disclosures that it hid vital data about the virus and exposed the world to contagion while it quarantined its own cities has devolved from “So what?” to the current “What exactly are you going to do about it?” China also decided to ramp up its perennial border confrontations with India, as its forces encroached on Indian soil in the Himalayas. What better way to show the world that a defiant China is dangerous than agitate the world’s largest democracy? Beijing has warned European nations that if their independent media continued to condemn China, there could be commercial retaliation. A few European journalists still exposed Chinese deceit, even as shaken EU leaders backtracked and tried to contextualize Chinese misbehavior. Japan and South Korea worried that China might move on Taiwan. They knew that if China did, only the United States — convulsed by quarantines, riots and a contentious presidential race —could stand up to Beijing. For years, China has bullied and waged a virtual commercial war against Asian democracies such as Japan, South Korea, India and Australia. It has subverted almost all international trading norms. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER The Chinese government assumed that Western elites would get rich by being complicit in China’s cheating and would thus help sell out their own countries. They were mostly right on both counts. As China westernized its economy, it conned gullible Western officials that eventually it planned to become a useful member of the family of nations. In truth, China strategically hoarded cash from its asymmetrical trade surpluses. It planted its functionaries throughout transnational organizations and subverted them. It beefed up its military and planted island bases in international waters. It compromised strategically important nations by investing in their infrastructure through its neo-colonial and imperialist multitrillion-dollar Belt and Road initiative. China may have been forced by the global epidemic to give up its nice-guy façade. But it has insidiously pivoted from global friend to its new role as overt global villain. If the world had been anxious over the intentions of a suspiciously nice China, it will become downright terrified of an overtly hostile China. In other words, China is not wasting the disaster of the Wuhan outbreak. It once gained a lot by faking friendliness, but now it seems to think it has no choice but to get even more by being authentically belligerent. As part of the about-face, China no longer flatters the West in passive-aggressive fashion, but rather shows its disdain for a weak Europe and an increasingly divided U.S. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP China’s real message to a fence-sitting world? While America tears itself apart with endless internal quarreling and media psychodramas, while Europe appeases its enemies, and while the rest of Asia stays mute, waiting to see who wins, China is now on the move — without apologies.

 In normal times, no one would feel the need to point out the total absurdity of a movement called “Defund the Police.” The insanity of such a concept would be self-evident to anyone possessing the faculty of reason. The move to cut funding for police departments around the nation is motivated by the brutal and clearly unjustified May 25 killing of George Floyd, a black man who died when a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Floyd was handcuffed on the ground, not resisting arrest and posing no threat to the four officers who arrested him for allegedly committing a minor crime – passing a counterfeit $20 bill. All four officers have since fired and been charged with either second-degree murder or aiding and abetting second-degree murder.  LOS ANGELES TO SLASH UP TO $150M FROM LAPD BUDGET, REINVEST INTO COMMUNITIES OF COLOR Floyd’s killing – captured on cellphone video – has shocked millions of people around the world. As a result, we are no longer in normal times. Peaceful protests – as well as rioting and looting – have broken out in many American communities. Some of the groups protesting to achieve racial justice have gained frightening traction pushing the idea that slashing police budgets nationwide would help create safer communities and more peaceful interactions between blacks and whites. This is utter nonsense. We are a nation that continues to grapple with violent crime. According to the FBI, for example, an estimated 16,214 people were murdered in the United States in 2018. If we had fewer police on our streets that tragic figure would be higher. And you can bet that criminals would commit more robberies, assaults, rapes, burglaries and other crimes as well if there was a smaller police presence on the streets. We need police to continue to fulfill their vital function of protecting the innocent and holding lawbreakers accountable. And so, anyone who cares about America should proclaim from the rooftops that “defunding the police” would produce terribly dangerous consequences. Police officers in the United States risk their lives to serve and protect their fellow citizens. The overwhelming majority of officers are outstanding public servants who each day perform their difficult duties for all the right reasons. This defunding makes as much sense as cutting funding for a hospital or a school where a doctor or teacher has engaged in criminal conduct against a patient or student. Certainly, there are individual cops unworthy of the badges they wear, whether due to corruption, incompetence or hot tempers that get out of control. A small number of officers hired to fight crime turn into criminals themselves, violating the rights of citizens, engaging in police brutality, and – on rare occasions – even killing innocent people of all races. But the solution to this problem lies in specifically identifying the officers acting improperly within police agencies – and removing those who are incorrigible. Further, when whole departments show systematic patterns of improper behavior, wholesale leadership changes must be made The truth is that a small number of people in every profession engage in criminal conduct. We’ve all seen news stories about pedophile priests, doctors who rape patients, teachers who assault students, lawyers who swindle elderly clients out of their life savings, corrupt politicians who take bribes, and more. In all these professions, wrongdoers must be identified and removed from their positions – and imprisoned if convicted of crimes. In the slow and excruciating death of George Floyd, our nation witnessed just how horrific a situation can become when bad cops walk the street. Fortunately, justice now appears to be moving swiftly in that Minneapolis case. Defunding police departments, however, would only make positive reforms all the more difficult to achieve. In a troubling move, for example, the mayor of Los Angeles has proposed cutting as much as $150 million from funding for the city’s police department. This defunding makes as much sense as cutting funding for a hospital or a school where a doctor or teacher has engaged in criminal conduct against a patient or student. In all these cases, the criminal cops, doctors and teachers would not be the ones to suffer as a result of defunding. Hospital patients, students and the general public would suffer instead. When our communities hire police officers, we ask them to risk their lives to keep our families and neighborhoods safe. According to the FBI, 89 officers were killed around the nation in the line of duty in 2019. These deaths were a tragedy that should not be ignored.  The least we can do for our police officers is to ensure they have the best possible training and equipment – and enough funding for adequate staffing. Years before he became president, Teddy Roosevelt served as New York City’s police commissioner. In his autobiography, he wrote about his longstanding commitment to adequately fund police departments. “I have not the slightest sympathy,” he wrote, “with any policy which tends to put the policeman at the mercy of a tough [criminal], or which deprives him of efficient weapons.” With the turmoil and strife that have wracked our nation following the killing of George Floyd, perhaps it’s understandable that many people are acting and reacting out of emotion rather than logic. But we can do better. It is shameful that a real opportunity to tackle unresolved racial discord is being hijacked by anarchists who want to destabilize our nation. Following the killing of George Floyd, we have witnessed at least a dozen additional deaths in senseless violent riots. One of these tragedies occurred with the death of David Dorn, age 77, who was killed while trying to protect a friend’s pawnshop from rampaging looters in St. Louis. Dorn, a black man, was a retired police captain. His black life mattered. The fact that he was killed by looters rather than by white police officers does not make his death any less tragic. A former colleague recalled Dorn as someone “very dedicated to youth, especially disadvantaged youth” who “wanted to see them succeed.” Dorn “wanted to be a role model for those young men and women,” the former colleague said. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER We owe it to the memory of officers such as David Dorn – and all honorable police officers continuing to serve their communities – to keep supporting the work of law enforcement. And even more than that, we owe it to all our fellow citizens to pursue policies – including adequately funding our police agencies – that will best protect our families and neighborhoods going forward. As Americans of all races and backgrounds, let’s work together to make our police forces better. Let’s consider any and all substantive proposals truly aimed at their improved performance. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Let’s help all officers embrace the role of “guardian” as passionately as they embrace the role of “enforcer.” Let’s continue our quest for equal rights and equal justice for all.

 Let the naysayers neigh. President Trump was right all along when he said America’s strong and growing economy would bounce back from the coronavirus pandemic faster than almost anybody expected. We have a way to go, but we are on our way – unless governors and congressional Democrats more concerned about the next election than American workers can somehow stop the juggernaut. The latest jobs report shows that the U.S. economy added more than 2.5 million jobs in May, confounding analysts who had predicted a loss of between 7.5 and 8.5 million jobs. This means the U.S. economy outperformed expectations by over 10 million jobs in just one month. UNEMPLOYMENT RATE DROPS TO 13.3% IN MAY, SIGNALING RETURN OF US JOBS The unemployment rate, meanwhile, fell to 13.3 percent – a full 1.4 percentage point drop, contrary to fears that it could surge to as high as 20 percent. As significantly, the unemployment rate declined despite the fact that labor participation rate – the percentage of the population working or actively looking for work – increased, as 1.75 million people joined or rejoined the workforce. While the surge of job creation is directly attributable to the gradual lifting of stay-at-home orders by various states and localities, the torrential pace of the recovery – especially at such an early stage – is also a product of the underlying economic strength we built up before the novel coronavirus reached our shores. Let’s also give credit to the American workers, who are flocking back to work despite the availability of overly generous unemployment insurance benefits. As demonstrations across the country have shown – and May’s employment data confirms – America is ready to get back to work. “We were very strong. We had the greatest economy in the history of our country. We had the greatest economy in the history of the world,” President Trump said at a recent news conference. “And that strength helped us get through this horrible pandemic.” Indeed, this unprecedented economic rebound was no accident. President Trump took bold action starting from the early days of the pandemic to protect American workers and businesses from the devastating impact of state and local lockdowns. "We're going to rebuild [the economy] again in honor of all those who perished today," the president said in April. "And I think the stimulus, coupled with this pent-up demand and everybody wanting to get out and go back to work … I think we're going to have … a tremendous surge." As we can now plainly see, the emergency policies that the Trump administration shepherded through Congress – unprecedented relief payments to individuals and families, massive financial assistance for the private sector, and paid sick leave for all workers affected by COVID-19 – allowed the U.S. economy to stabilize and begin its recovery far sooner than expected. As a result, businesses were able to stay afloat and keep employees on their payrolls while awaiting permission to reopen. America is ready to get back to work. The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) has proven especially valuable for small businesses that were having a hard time paying their employees, since the low-interest federal loans automatically convert into grants if the money is spent on normal operating expenses. Even New York Times reporter Neil Irwin tweeted that “the May employment numbers count as a strong win for PPP supporters.” Best of all, the record-breaking surge in job creation we saw last month is only the beginning. Not every state has yet largely reopened. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Not only are we seeing the economic benefits of those states reopening but, perhaps most impressively, they have done so safely and responsibly – despite the claims of shutdown advocates. According to ABC, “there were no major increases in hospitalizations, deaths or percentage of people testing positive in any of the 21 states.” “Now the trajectory is great,” President Trump said during a recent press conference, noting that some of the most economically significant states – including New York and California – are “barely included” in the jobs report because they are not yet fully open for business. The May jobs report may well increase political pressure to more fully reopen from residents of these states who are anxious to retake control of their lives and return to work.        CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Once these governors safely more fully reopen the remaining states, the U.S. economy will once again quickly improve. This will generate a wave of prosperity that our country can ride over time to even greater heights than we reached before the pandemic. It looks like our economy could experience a V-shaped recovery after all, just as the president promised. That is, unless shutdown advocates prolong the misery. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM ANDY PUZDER

 The horrific May 25 killing by a white Minneapolis police officer of George Floyd, a black man in handcuffs who was not resisting arrest, has shocked the world and left America at a crossroads. Will we as a nation finally do the work needed to achieve true and lasting racial equality? Or will we choose the status quo and fail to make the changes needed to eliminate the cancer of racism that has plagued America since Africans were first brought to the colonies in chains 400 years ago? While slavery is long gone, a racial double-standard continues to plague our police departments, public schools, courtrooms and boardrooms. And black Americans continue to suffer disproportionately from poverty, poorer health, lower educational attainment, worse housing and in other ways. ORGANIZERS AIM TO BRING A MILLION PROTESTERS TO WASHINGTON IN LARGEST BLM DEMONSTRATION YET Truth be told, abandoning our nation’s long and immoral history of racism should be an easy choice. But in reality, making the move to become an anti-racism nation will require some real soul-searching and policy changes. On Friday, Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser renamed a street leading to the White House “Black Lives Matter Plaza.” This move by the black mayor of the nation’s capital, while unprecedented, was absolutely right. What Mayor Bowser has done with her action is to send a clear message to President Trump – a man born into wealth and white privilege who has no idea of the discrimination and indignities still suffered by African-Americans today. America needs a president who can understand that Black Lives Matter is something that our nation needs to embrace in words, actions and federal policy. You don’t have to be black to know that racism is an evil that should have been expunged from the American soul long ago – but President Trump is clearly oblivious to this indisputable fact.  Sadly, Trump has been pretty muted when it comes to speaking to the pain, outrage and anger coming from protesters of all colors across the globe outraged by the death of George Floyd. The president is clearly far more interested in tweeting insults and attacks against anyone who says something he perceives as negative about him. He is far more eager to show he is a tough “law-and-order” leader.  Trump has made the deliberate choice to be the “divider-in-chief” and created a mindset of “us vs. them” that is tearing our nation apart. In moments of national crisis, the American people have come to expect our president to take on the role of “comforter-in-chief.” Instead, Trump has made the deliberate choice to be the “divider-in-chief” and created a mindset of “us vs. them” that is tearing our nation apart. For America to be a great and moral nation it must care for all of its citizens, no matter their race, color, creed or citizenship status. And that is exactly what is missing at this moment. Black people in America aren’t looking for some magical instant solution to our pain, anger and distress resulting from systemic racism. We are looking for a meaningful dialogue on how American racism can get its knee off our necks. The George Floyd killing and the imagery of a white police officer pushing his knee into Floyd’s carotid artery for almost nine excruciating minutes represents a long-held symbol of racism and how black America interprets racism’s impact on our daily lives. From how our public schools are funded to how neighborhoods are policed, black Americans feel the systemic weight of racism in every chapter of our lives. We feel it when were are at the hospital and our physical pain is ignored. We feel it in our schools, where we see black educators being pushed out of the already under-resourced classrooms. We feel it at the bank when credit-worthy entrepreneurs are denied capital to start their new businesses. And we feel it when black parents are forced to have “the talk” with their children about interacting with law enforcement. Black people aren’t stupid. We know what works and what doesn’t, so we understand that those who give us empty phrases or buzzwords like “criminal justice reform” and “school choice” – or suggest another “task force” or “working group” be formed – won’t really improve our lives. If America’s elected leaders are truly committed to the work of fighting racism they must start by acknowledging that white privilege has always existed in our society and continues to exist. Yes, we know that the lives of black people have improved from the terrible days of slavery, to Jim Crow laws, to open and legally sanctioned discrimination. But we also know that claims that racism and inequality have disappeared are patently false, and we want our nation’s leaders to acknowledge this. This acknowledgment of reality should be quickly followed with collaborative solutions that incorporate the voices of those most harmed by privilege – black people. For far too long, we have watched misguided lawmakers pass policies and push half-baked solutions for black America, many resulting in more harm than good. And to be frank, we are tired. If you are in disbelief, just take a look at what happened this week in Minneapolis. After weeks of sustained peaceful protest and a tear-jerking memorial for George Floyd, the city has announced its plan to end the use of a highly frowned-upon and life-threatening chokehold by law enforcement.  OK, that’s a good step, but after weeks of protests much more is needed. To be honest, both parties have blind spots when it comes to fighting racism. But Trump seems more oblivious to this problem that past presidents in recent decades. Just take a look at Trump on Friday. In announcing improved jobs numbers as more businesses open after being closed due to the coronavirus pandemic, the president said that “hopefully George [Floyd] is looking down and saying this is a great thing that's happening for our country.” CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Mr. President, George Floyd is dead! He should be alive with us on this Earth today. He’s not going to get a job or get anything else from our improving economy. You have no right to hijack his memory and try to paint him as somehow cheering on your self-proclaimed achievements in office. Let him rest and peace and don’t try turning him into a political prop to boost your reelection campaign. Trump’s comments come on the heels of federal law enforcement officers clearing peaceful protesters from near the White House earlier this week so the president could stage a photo-op at a nearby church. The comments come as the president remains reluctant to acknowledge the power his words and is unwilling to answer the fundamental question being posed by peaceful protesters: “Do black lives matter and if so, what will you do to protect them?” In the fifth stanza of “Lift Every Voice and Sing” – often referred to as “The Black National Anthem” – songwriter James Weldon Johnson states: “God of our weary years, God of our silent tears.” And these words speak to the pain, anger and sense of neglect that African-Americans have been feeling. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP We want answers. We want change. And most importantly, we want honesty about the past and current sins of America. We are tired of seeing our black mothers cry in silence. We are tired of seeing our fathers being weighed down by society. Now is the time for our tears to end, and for society to create a renewed contract with its all citizens, no matter what the color of their skin. This must be a renewed contract that focuses on listening, healing and ending the policies, practices and actions caused by racism in America. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM RICHARD FOWLER

 On June 6, 1944, among those to take the first harrowing steps on the wet sands of Normandy were National Guardsmen from Maryland’s 29th Infantry Division. They bled just as much as their comrades in arms. They fought just as hard to get off the beaches. And when those who survived crested the scrubby bluffs above the German defenses, they changed the course of World War II. Today we remember D-Day – exactly 76 years ago – as a signature achievement of the Greatest Generation. Still, D-Day was just one day. In addition to serving abroad, armed forces members from the citizen-militias of the colonial era to our modern-day warriors have safeguarded American communities faithfully and selflessly for two-and-a-half centuries. They saved San Francisco after the Great Earthquake and fire of 1906. They helped rescue New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. Most recently, both National Guard and active-duty forces helped bend the curve during the COVID-19 outbreak. People marveled, for instance, at how quickly and efficiently they were able to convert New York City’s Javits Center into a hospital and staff it with armed services medical personnel. PETE HEGSETH BLASTS DC MAYOR, SAYS NATIONAL GUARD PREVENTED DESECRATION OF MONUMENTS Yet some would have you believe these servicemen and women have gone from heroic good guys to bad guys in less than a month. A chorus of critics – including some mayors, governors, activists, and journalists – are bemoaning the “militarization” of America. By this they mean employing troops to help restore peace in cities wracked by uncontrolled violence following the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. The National Guard tweeted Saturday: “Today, more than 43,300 National Guard members in 34 states and D.C. are assisting law enforcement authorities with ongoing civil unrest, while more than 37,000 Guard Soldiers and Airmen continue to support the COVID-19 response.” Complaints that the use of the National Guard creates a troubling “militarization” could not be more disingenuous. Let’s start by considering what military troops actually do when used in the U.S. Typically, the primary role they are assigned is guarding property. This mission doesn’t interfere with lawful protest in any manner. The presence of the National Guard is only a problem for people bent on destruction – those who want to break things, burn things and hurt people. In fact, people exercising their First Amendment rights – even those undertaking peaceful civil disobedience – are served as well. The military is there to protect them, too – and stop the violence and looting so they can peaceably demonstrate. The second mission the military usually performs in our country is supporting law enforcement. This is anything but “militarizing” the response. Rather, the military is freeing up, enabling and supporting police, fire, and EMT personnel so they can do their jobs. That makes our streets safer, not less free. Cities can use the military to help deal with rioting and looting without dishonoring the cause of peaceful protestors. In several of our cities, it is very clear that these additional resources are needed. Peaceful protesters fighting for a righteous cause are not the only people who have taken to the streets. Many others are trying to exploit the current protests over the death of George Floyd, using them as an opportunity to turn to rioting and looting – acts of violence that can’t be tolerated. Also in the mix are professional agitators –homegrown as well as foreign – from across the political spectrum. Dealing with all this is daunting. Not bringing in the assets needed to safeguard the rights, freedom and property of all citizens is just wrong. It is also worth reflecting on what the mission is and for whom the military work. When our soldiers are sent onto our streets, they are there to protect our freedoms, lives and property – not to take them away. Our troops serve under lawfully elected civilian authorities. They support those authorities; they don’t supplant them. And how those authorities may use those troops is governed by a plethora of laws, all of which have passed constitutional muster. To claim that having the military help quell violence is unconstitutional is utter nonsense. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Because the National Guard and active-duty forces serve under civilian authority, their effectiveness is often determined not by their training and capabilities (which are usually more than adequate), but by the competence of the civilian leaders who direct them. Cities can use the military to help deal with rioting and looting without dishonoring the cause of peaceful protestors. Washington is a case in point. Yes, there was much squabbling between the mayor and federal authorities over use of the National Guard. But after the squabbling ended and the Guard deployed, looting stopped. People continue to conduct lawful protests unabated. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP These are facts conveniently ignored by people who decry “militarization” and insult service members who are willing to put their lives at risk to keep peace on our streets. As we remember those American heroes who stormed the beaches of Normandy 76 years ago, we should also remember those soldiers here at home who stand guard on our street corners, protecting our individual rights as the nation works its way through an extraordinarily difficult season of division and disease.

 Every cult has the same goal: the utter submission of its members. Cult members surrender everything. They give up their physical freedom – where they can go, who they can see, how they can dress. But more than that, they give up control of their minds. Cult leaders determine what their followers are allowed to believe, even in their most private thoughts. In order to do this, cults separate people from all they have known before. They force members to renounce their former lives, their countries and their customs. They allow no loyalty except to the cult. The first thing they attack – always – is the family. Families are always the main impediment to brainwashing and extremism. If you’re going to control individuals – if you’re going to transform free people into compliant robots – the first thing you must do is separate them from the ones who love them most. 'CULT MOM' LORI VALLOW'S EX-HUSBAND SUED HER YEARS AGO FOR ALLEGEDLY HIDING THEIR DAUGHTER: REPORT In 1932, Soviet authorities began promoting the story of a 13-year-old peasant boy called Pavlik Morozov. Morozov, they claimed, had taken the supremely virtuous step of denouncing his own father to the secret police for committing counter-revolutionary acts. Once exposed as a traitor, the boy’s father was executed by firing squad, supposedly for the safety of the state. Soviet dictator Josef Stalin elevated the boy to the status of a national hero for what he did. People wept in the streets when they heard his name. They worshipped him like a saint. Why are we telling you this? Because it’s happening here. In the last 10 days, some of our most prominent citizens have sworn allegiance to a cult. Converts go by the term “allies.” Like all cult members, they demand total conformity. They ritually condemn their own nation – its history, its institutions and symbols. It’s flag. They denounce their own parents. If you’ve been on social media recently, you’ve likely seen videos that illustrate this – such as one showing a girl attacking her mother and father for the crime of insufficient loyalty to Black Lives Matter. Reporter Hanna Lustig of Insider.com wrote about that video, and strongly approved of it. What you just saw, Lustig wrote, is a young person “modeling the most important tenet of ally-ship.” Modeling. Meaning, something done to encourage others to do the same. It’s working. In a video of a 15-year-old from Louisville called Isabella – and there are many like her – the girl is shown crying and saying: "I literally hate my family so much." She goes on to say her parents defended the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. And then she calls her parents racists, followed by an obscenity. “I hate my family so much.” Just a week ago, it would have been hard to imagine that. Now, Isabella is a social media star. Celebrities tweet their approval. She may have her own cult before long. But the revolution is young. Children attacking their parents is just the beginning. On CNN Friday, a man called Tim Wise told viewers that, going forward, parents must hurt their own children: Wise said: “I think that the important thing for white parents to keep in the front of their mind is that if black children in this country are not allowed innocence and childhood without fear of being killed by police or marginalized in some other way, then our children don’t deserve innocence. If Tamir Rice can be shot dead in a public park playing with a toy gun, something white children do all over this country every day without the same fear of being shot, if Tamir Rice can be killed then white children need to be told at least at the same age. If they can’t be innocent, we don’t get to be innocent.” Your children are no longer allowed to be innocent, says Tim Wise. Happy childhoods are a sign of racism. The man saying this – and being affirmed by CNN anchors as he does – is a self-described “anti-racism activist.” He has been saying things like this for a long time. More than once, Wise has suggested that he approves of violence against those who disagree. How does Tim Wise make a living? In part, by lecturing students. Your kids may have seen him speak. They’ve almost certainly heard a lot from people like him. In America’s schools, the revolution has been in progress for quite some time. Last February, to name one among countless examples, officials at schools in Rochester, N.Y., created a Black Lives Matter-themed lesson plan. The teaching materials dismiss America’s bedrock institutions – indeed, America itself – as inherently racist. Suggested questions for students include: “How does mass incarceration function as a mechanism of racialized social control?” One specific racial group was singled out for exclusive blame. The curriculum promoted a book titled, “White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of our Racial Divide.” In other words, children, there’s a reason hatred and inequality exist: these people did it! That’s what your kids are learning right now. Thursday, at Darien High School in Connecticut, Principal Ellen Dunn sent an email to parents promising to increase “the race-conscious education of our students.” To do that, Dunn distributed materials from the Southern Poverty Law Center. Ironically, the SPLC is itself a hate group. That has been documented extensively. Now their agenda is the school’s agenda. It’s what your kids are learning. In Washington, D.C., an elementary school principal in the affluent northwest section of the city recently wrote a letter announcing: “We need more White parents to talk to their kids about race. Especially now.” The letter singled out “White Staff and White community members,” whom the principal alleged had committed “both macro- and micro-aggressions” against “Staff of Color.” The principal did not specify what those crimes were. She didn’t need to. Their skin color was their crime. This is a national theme. It’s incredibly destructive and dangerous. Countless public schools are now using the 1619 Project from The New York Times as a curriculum. That project is the work of an out-of-the-closet racial extremist called Nikole Hannah Jones. Jones recently argued it’s not violence to loot and burn stores – its justified. Her propaganda is now mandatory in public schools in Buffalo, Chicago, Newark and Washington. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Many parents understandably deeply resent this. It’s deranged, its racist. Others don’t. They’re “allies.” They’ve joined in. One mother in London, where the cult is also spreading, posted a photo on Twitter of her daughter on blended knee, holding a sign declaring her “privilege.” The Cultural Revolution has come to the West. What will the effects of this be? Years from now, how will that little girl with the sign remember her childhood? Her mother took Tim Wise’s advice. She no longer has innocence. Will she be grateful for that? It’s hard to imagine she will be. She’ll more likely feel bitter and used. Because she has been used. Many will feel that way. Is there a single person who believes this moment we’re living through will end in racial harmony? Is that even a goal anymore? It doesn’t seem like it. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It seems clear that many in power are pushing hard for racial division. For hatred. For violence. Let’s pray they don’t get what they want. Tribal conflict destroys countries faster than any plague. But keep in mind as this insanity continues that it’s not happening in a vacuum. Every action provokes a reaction – that’s physics. We don’t know where this is going. We don’t want to know. The cult members should stop now – immediately, before more innocents get hurt – and they will, if they don’t.

 Our nation has seen days of protests, riots and looting in the aftermath of George Floyd’s horrific death in Minneapolis May 25. Now the narrative is starting to become distorted about systematic racism. I watched our country come together and lock arms against a murder by a police officer in the hours after the video of Floyd’s killing surfaced. As a matter of fact, some of the most conservative supporters of law enforcement have been vocal advocates for pursuing first-degree murder charges against those responsible for Floyd’s death. We are all united against this evil. JACK BREWER: GEORGE FLOYD RIOTS – HERE'S WHAT THIS GENERATION OF PROGRESSIVE LEADERS IS LACKING Then, the divisiveness of our politics quickly sparked the emotions of our hurt and angry brothers and sisters across America. Now all sides have started to take their eye off the enemy of racism by turning the conversation into a debate about whether systemic racism and oppression exist. In fact, anyone who looks at the number of blacks killed by cops as an accurate reflection of the systematic oppression blacks face in this country is completely missing the boat. This growing misconception could actually set our nation back further in the struggle for equality for all Americans. This perspective desensitizes the reality that the most underserved black people in our communities face. And it adds fuel to a fire that has already spread throughout the frustrations of protesters across our nation. If you wonder why black crime rates are so high, go spend some time in our inner cities to learn about the real issues facing young black men. This is the very definition of systematic racism and oppression. The facts are that the vast majority of black men in America never get into an aggressive altercation with police. But the harsh reality is also that many poor black boys are born fatherless and are forced to attend underperforming public schools. The National Principals Association reports that 71 percent of all high school dropouts come from fatherless homes -- that's 9 times the average. Additionally, 73 percent of African-American kids are born out of wedlock. (I understand the difficulties here as I had my first two children in this scenario.) As these black boys grow on their way to manhood, they lack positive male role models in their lives. They get trapped in an education system that won’t allow them to break out of their neighborhoods to attend better schools so that they can increase their chances of success. Please don’t try to justify this sad truth by placing blame on the black community while denying the realities of our history that include slavery, Jim Crow laws, redlining and implementing welfare policies that have rewarded fatherless homes. Next, layer this on top of mass incarceration for more black men in America than all of the world combined. It all adds up to real evil. If you wonder why black crime rates are so high, go spend some time in our inner cities to learn about the real issues facing young black men. This is the very definition of systematic racism and oppression. I’ve been blessed to teach and minister in prisons around the country, so I’ve witnessed first-hand the realities facing Americans who grow up fatherless and locked into communities that provide them with little opportunity. I’ve had the privilege of serving many of our black inner cities with my American Heroes program. It aims to bridge the gap of fatherlessness while using godly principles to change the evil culture that has hurt many of our black youth. For proof of what I’m talking about look at cities like Baltimore, where the population has fallen victim to decades of failed leadership, despite being given financial resources. The state of education in Baltimore is so bad that the neighboring state of Pennsylvania recommended that the state of Maryland take over the Baltimore public schools I was disheartened to learn that Baltimore schools spend $16,000 per student per year and yet they and their students are failing. It’s such an injustice. My own son’s private school costs substantially less than what Baltimore is spending on its students. This is the systematic racism I’m talking about. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER This fact should anger all Americans and motivate all of us to stand against this oppression toward poor black kids who are born into this injustice. Baltimore has received over $15 billion from the federal government in the last two years, yet the systematic oppression continues to shackle the most underserved. Let’s focus on what we can all do to make America stronger while healing the realities of years of oppression. I’ve been blessed to teach and minister in prisons around the country, so I’ve witnessed first-hand the realities facing Americans who grow up fatherless and locked into communities that provide them with little opportunity. As Americans, we need to focus on becoming the one nation under God that we all so proudly claim. Wake up America, we are all one race, as our DNA is literally the same. The CEO of 23 and Me put out a moving statement that acknowledged that 95.5 percent of our DNA is the same. As children of God, you may want to deny the existence of systematic racism but none of us can deny our direct moral responsibility to help the most underserved. This means that we all need to be doing our part to address the realities that face a large portion of black America. If we step away from our politics and meditate on God’s word, this will be what unites us all.

It’s time for us all to put an end to the divisive narratives and open our hearts to do something about the issues at hand. CLICK HERE TO FOR MORE FROM JACK BREWER


 This week, The New York Times ran an op-ed by United States Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., urging that the military be used to quell the fires, looting and violence gripping the nation’s cities. A Morning Consult poll from this week found that 58 percent of registered voters agreed with that idea. But apparently it’s an opinion forbidden in the Times. Black staffers at the paper said the column made them feel unsafe. The day after it ran, the paper folded like, well, The New York Times, and apologized for it.DAN GAINOR: NY TIMES FLIP-FLOPS AND SAYS SEN.

 A week ago, in the wake of a possible flattening of the COVID-19 growth curve, President Trump’s campaign could maintain some optimism. While polls suggested that the public trusted likely Democratic nominee Joe Biden as better than Trump at dealing with the health crisis, they continued to trust the president more on handling the economy. The polls were consistent with the idea that if he could convince the country to make the election about “who’s better for ensuring a strong American recovery?” he might be in a competitive position in November. Then came the death by asphyxiation of George Floyd under the knee of a Minneapolis policeman. DOUG SCHOEN: GEORGE FLOYD UNREST — ONLY THIS CAN SAVE DEMS FROM DEFEAT IN 2020 In a matter of days, President Trump – whose political superpower has been his ability to manage through chaos – appears unable to orchestrate a simple photo-op, and is besieged by indirect but clear sniping from the only living Republican ex-president, direct criticism from his first Defense secretary, and polls suggesting he’s disadvantaged in the GOP must-win states of Florida, Texas and Ohio. His ability to “ride the bronco” is what enabled him to survive four corporate bankruptcies before starting a political career and navigate countless crises throughout his political career – from the Access Hollywood tape, the Mueller investigation, impeachment and even the COVID crisis through May. The news may be dizzying. The tweets appear reckless. The threats may seem dire. But, to date, Americans have kept their eyes fixed on this rodeo. Initially, the president appeared to be politically well-positioned in the face of the news. He tweeted his support for a Justice Department investigation. With video evidence clearly making the case that it was murder – and the Minneapolis DA initially not arresting any of the officers involved – his tweets made clear a desire to appear on “the right side” of the issue. Then came a series of protests across the country that devolved into civic unrest in many cities. Many argued that the protests – even the riots – were a justifiable response to a history of black Americans being killed by police. Indeed, the two largest cases of urban unrest were ignited by incidents of police attacking black people – the LA Riots in 1992 sparked by the videotape of police beating Rodney King, and the 2014 protests– and ensuing “Black Lives Matter” movement – sparked by police in Ferguson, Mo., killing a black teenager accused of shoplifting. But even among those who justified the unrest, there was a sense that it, particularly the video of looting and violence, could result in a sense of “white backlash” and play into President Trump’s reelection effort. This is a president who used his inaugural address to promise to fight “American Carnage” and has successfully appealed to “white backlash” throughout his career. Even among those who justified the unrest, there was a sense that it, particularly the video of looting and violence, could result in a sense of “white backlash” and play into President Trump’s reelection effort. The history of urban unrest – starting with the 1967-68 riots, but extending through 1992 and 2014 – was consistent with the belief that Trump could benefit politically. Indeed, the 1968 riots helped both George Wallace and Richard Nixon run on “law and order” platforms, the 1992 riots arguably helped lead to the 1994 “Super Predators” crime bill, and the 2014 protests clearly, in the end, benefited Trump politically. Indeed, many assumed that the response would help Trump successfully benefit from the 2020 unrest. Among those was Trump himself, who came out strongly arguing for “law and order” –criticizing governors who were not dealing sufficiently harshly with protesters, sending the U.S. military into Washington, D.C., and suggesting he was going to send them into other cities as well. But so far, it hasn’t worked out politically as some expected. Trump’s poll numbers continue to decline – Biden currently leads him by eight points in the RealClearPolitics average – a larger amount than even Obama enjoyed when he first ran in 2008, and rather than voters reacting to video of urban looting, they appear more focused on pictures of the U.S. military occupying the Lincoln Memorial. The mood has gotten so bleak that many administration insiders – both anonymously and on camera – have distanced themselves from the president’s actions. While his supporters may cry “disloyalty” – it’s evidence of what those insiders are sensing about November. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER What has Trump – along with many analysts – been missing? First off, they’re misreading history. Yes, if one studies 1968, 1992 and 2014, “law and order,” in general, and the GOP, in particular, became ascendant. But the real lesson is that in all three cases, the incumbent party (Dems in 1968 and 2014, GOP in 1992) was penalized – and voters opted for a change. Second, they – and President Trump – are misreading what folks mean by “law and order.” Yes, it was very much about cracking down on violent crime. But if you go back to the way Nixon talked in 1968 – there was a heavy rhetorical emphasis on “bringing the country together” and a clear optimistic message that “America is great because her people are great.” It’s a deft balance that to date, President Trump has appeared unable to manage.

 Once again, President Donald Trump is being scapegoated for societal problems that he didn't cause. He didn't bring the coronavirus to our shores, and he has not created an atmosphere of racial disharmony in this country. Is there anything Trump's haters won't blame on him? They've been trying to remove him since before he was sworn in, and every time they fail, they find another excuse -- from the Russia-collusion hoax to Ukraine to the coronavirus to economic hardship from the shutdown to the murder of George Floyd to the subsequent mayhem in our cities. Trump roundly condemned George Floyd's murder shortly after it occurred, but that wasn't enough. He condemned the organized thugs who hijacked the protests to vandalize, loot and endanger innocent people, but that was unacceptable. HEATHER MAC DONALD: RIOTING, LOOTING, ARSON AND VIOLENCE HAVE BECOME A CIVILIZATION-DESTROYING PANDEMIC By condemning the anarchists, he was somehow chilling the peaceful protestors' free speech rights and showing insensitivity to their cause and their pain. After delivering a speech in the Rose Garden during which he promised to restore order to America, he walked across the street with a Bible in his hand to visit St. John's Church. That, too, was revolting to his detractors, who pilloried him for staging a photo op. Actress Debra Messing tweeted side-by-side images of Trump and Adolf Hitler each holding a Bible and said that it was "a dog whistle to white nationalists and Nazis." The virtue-signaling activist's allergy to the Bible might tell you all you need to know about her. Sen. Chuck Schumer was so outraged by Trump's visit to the church and the temporary removal of protestors there that he offered a "sense of Congress" resolution to condemn Trump. There is just no end to their posturing. People who viscerally hate Trump find fault in everything he does. But his supporters are on to this now. The haters have gone to the well too many times, and they are as intellectually dishonest as they are excessive. They are out-of-control bullies always unwilling to give him the benefit of the doubt. Those wrongly accusing Trump of dividing the nation are themselves tearing us apart at the seams. He's working to restore law and order, and they're trying to undermine the peace. People who viscerally hate Trump find fault in everything he does. But his supporters are on to this now. The haters have gone to the well too many times, and they are as intellectually dishonest as they are excessive. When your policies are dramatically improving the lives of minorities, which they were before the shutdown and will be again, it's unsettling to your political opponents whose power depends on winning 90% of the African American vote and who have nothing to offer except patronizing policies and vilification of Republicans. Democrats so thoroughly take their vote for granted that their standard-bearer, Joe Biden, says blacks who won't vote for him aren't black. The left has been demonizing Republicans as racist for decades. And it maliciously depicts Trump's signature stance on immigration enforcement as racist as well, which enhances its false narrative that Trump is presumptively racist and all of his actions should be viewed in this light. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER So when Trump denounces antifa terrorists for turning our city streets into war zones; torching and pillaging commercial establishments; and injuring and murdering innocent people, he is accused of trampling on the Constitution. No. He is doing precisely what a president should do. He is upholding the Constitution by restoring law and order; reestablishing domestic tranquility; and protecting American citizens, their property and their livelihoods. He is not on some power trip here; he is trying to prevent criminals from engaging in wanton destruction and dismantling our civil society. Just as one can simultaneously defend the right of citizens to peaceably protest while condemning rioters and looters, one can support the overwhelming majority of good and honorable law enforcement officers while condemning renegade cops. If we surrender to domestic terrorists and criminals, we won't have a nation anymore, which is apparently what the anarchists want. Stunningly, they're making substantial progress. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has proposed cutting $100 million to $150 million from the Los Angeles Police Department budget to reinvest it in communities of color. Do you think this conspicuous pitting of cops against minorities is accidental? If LA officials want to increase expenditures to minority communities, why gut the police budget? The obvious answer is that Garcetti is sending a message that cops are the bad guys and punishing them somehow helps minority communities. Neither minorities nor anyone else will benefit from emasculating the police force. It is indeed a sad day for America when people cheer on the disintegration of our society. Of course, decent and civilized people must denounce the murder of George Floyd and any other despicable incidents of police brutality, but that doesn't mean losing our heads and condemning all police officers by the very same type of stereotyping and antipathy that lie at the root of racism. We are all individuals and must be accountable for our own behavior, not smeared by a broad brush of indiscriminate condemnation. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Couldn't Trump's opponents, who constantly accuse him of dividing the nation, just once try to join him in combating these deadly menaces threatening our society -- the virus, the economic shutdown and the violence in our streets -- instead of always focusing their energy on destroying him?

 As the United States copes with the aftermath of the horrific killing of George Floyd by police in Minnesota and the massive protests that came after, we must not forget our previous crisis – the COVID-19 pandemic. It is clear that the blatant lies, destruction of samples, and silencing of doctors orchestrated by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) during the coronavirus pandemic amplified the devastation and tragedy the world has endured throughout the past few months. As more facts have emerged about the Party’s cover-up of the coronavirus outbreak and its aggressive actions that followed, Americans have become increasingly skeptical toward China’s communist totalitarian leadership. A Pew Research Poll found that 71 percent of Americans don’t trust General Secretary Xi Jinping to do the right thing in regard to foreign affairs. EX-NEW YORK TIMES REPORTER ALEX BERENSON: UNREPORTED TRUTHS ABOUT COVID-19 AND LOCKDOWNS The pandemic was a real wake up call for Americans and policymakers alike. It exposed how the Chinese Communist Party’s oppressive censorship of information, global disinformation campaigns, control over critical supply chains, and influence over international bodies threatens the United States. But the threats and challenges we face against communist-ruled China extend beyond those that arose as a consequence of the pandemic. As we wrote in October 2019 in Trump versus China: Facing America’s Greatest Threat, “The interests, security, and values that our country cherishes, and the free world in which we are accustomed to living are being challenged.” Ultimately, “General Secretary Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party, are constructing a different kind of world that threatens the survival of our free and sovereign nation.” The Chinese Communist Party’s malign response to the coronavirus outbreak is evidence supporting this conclusion. These past months have confirmed that the U.S. belief that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) would adopt a more open and free system if it was incorporated into the international community was fundamentally wrong. We know now that China is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party which is committed to a Leninist ideology of power. In Xi’s own words, the CCP “has always adhered to the lofty ideals of communism.” The United States now finds itself at a critical juncture that will define the future of US policy toward the Chinese regime. The CCP clearly presents threats to the US. It is committed to Leninist totalitarianism which defines its goals and tactics. We can’t rebuild the relationship we’ve had for the past 50 years – we need to design a new one. A critical step in achieving this happened when the White House published the United States Strategic Approach to the People’s Republic of China. Unlike our approach in the past, which was founded upon what we hoped the Chinese Communist Party would evolve to become, this approach is rooted in the hard facts. It accepts realities about the Party and its aggressive actions — often in the Party’s own terms. The report outlined that the Chinese Communist Party’s ideology and tactics challenge our economic interests, values, and security. “To respond to Beijing’s challenge,” the report states, “the Administration has adopted a competitive approach to the PRC, based on a clear-eyed assessment of the CCP’s intentions and actions.” But now that we’ve identified the problems we face with the PRC, we need to build upon this approach to find solutions to overcome the challenges in this critical competition with China. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER We now need to design an all-of-government strategy based upon the framework of this report. We need to look at all of the laws, resources, communications platforms, agencies, departments, and tools that we have in place to facilitate the execution of this strategy. Congress needs to mobilize to fill in the gaps. Recently, we’ve seen the US government take strong actions against many of the CCP’s long-standing egregious behaviors. The State Department’s declaration that Hong Kong is no longer autonomous as Beijing approved a national security law proposal was important. President Trump’s announcement that the US will impose sanctions on officials who have had a role in “smothering” freedoms in Hong Kong is a strong step. The bipartisan passage of the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act in Congress that will impose sanctions on officials and export restrictions on items that are involved in the oppression of minorities in Xinjiang will help respond to the CCP’s horrendous human rights abuses. Finally, the Trump administration’s intervention to reverse a Thrift Savings Plan decision that would have invested federal pension funds in Chinese companies that present national security risks and human rights concerns helped us avoid serious problems in the future. This level of momentum and determined resolve needs to continue. Overcoming this challenge will also require an all-of-society approach. There needs to be a focus on clearly communicating to the American people—using facts and evidence—how the behaviors of the CCP can affect our businesses, schools, and investment portfolios. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP This influence extends to the movies we watch, products we consume, and social media platforms we use. To carry this effort forward, it needs to extend beyond the government and empower every American to stand against the Chinese Communist Party’s attacks on freedom, human rights, and the rule of law. These shared values and the ingenuity of the American people built the United States as the strong and resilient global leader it is today. Ultimately, they are what will see us through this competition with China. Claire Christensen is co-author of "Trump vs. China."

 When I served in the Army, I had the great privilege of serving in the storied 82nd Airborne Division as a supply officer and airborne rifle company commander. That’s the same Division that sent its paratroopers behind the beaches into the Normandy countryside in the early hours of June 6, 1944, knowing beforehand that it would be a hard-fought battle with staggering casualties. On that historic day, what we now call D-Day, nearly 1,500 paratroopers were captured or killed when they landed in Normandy, France. Several thousands more shed their blood on the beaches, fighting back against the Nazi forces dug into hardened positions on the shores. Operation Overlord was complex, the largest joint airborne and amphibious landing in human history. Allied forces were synchronized precisely at prearranged points on the battlefield, with 6,939 ships, 925 C-47 military airplanes carrying 23,000 paratroopers, and 156,000 Allied infantrymen on the ground. The 82nd Airborne had to complete a variety of objectives, seizing bridges, strategic junctions, and villages alongside the equally storied 101st Airborne Division.

 “Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts.” How quaint seems this trenchant observation by the late Daniel Patrick Moynihan, one of the greatest progressive thinkers of the 20th century’s latter half. Not because of the patriarchal pronoun presumptions of the aging white cis male. I refer to Senator Moynihan’s very assumption that there are facts. That there is an objective reality on which we can all agree, even if we disagree about what it means.

 Three big-name retired senior military leaders made headlines Tuesday and Wednesday when they sharply criticized President Trump’s leadership. There is nothing wrong with that – but their distinguished military service shouldn’t make their anti-Trump arguments immune from debate. Former military leaders have long been a force in American politics. In all, 26 of the 44 U.S. presidents have served in the military. Some – including George Washington and Dwight Eisenhower – have been top military commanders. Many former military members have served in Congress as well. Prior military service never stopped these veterans from taking strong political positions – or shielded them from criticism once they entered the political arena. DEROY MURDOCK: MATTIS WRONGLY CRITICIZES TRUMP – IGNORES FACTS ABOUT RIOTING AND PRESIDENT’S ACCOMPLISHMENTS So from that perspective, we should welcome the fact that former Secretary of Defense and retired Marine Gen. James Mattis, retired Navy Adm. Mike Mullen and retired Marine Gen. John Allen spoke out against Trump’s policies. But as these retired officers no doubt realized, President Trump – or anyone else – can also criticize them back. Given the tough language they aimed at the president, some return fire is in order. Here’s some of what they’ve been saying: Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people – does not even pretend to try,” Mattis wrote in The Atlantic. “We can unite without him,” Mattis continued, going on to declare the Trump has abused his executive authority. Mattis is not Moses bringing Ten Commandments on stone tablets. He’s that rare bird, a true contrarian who aggravated the Obama administration while on active duty, retired, and then went on to serve in and then clash with the Trump administration.  Granted, Mattis deserves credit, especially for rejuvenating nuclear command and control while he headed the Defense Department. But he’s over the top this time. The Mattis barrage was not new, helpful, or apt. You could hear his anti-Trump opinion on any street corner. On Tuesday, it was the turn of retired Adm. Mullen, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 2007 to 2011. In retirement, Mullen’s been no stranger to politics: The Washington Post pegged him as a potential Mike Bloomberg running mate in 2016. Yet Mullen went pretty far this week. He wrote in The Atlantic that he was “sickened” to see the clearing of protesters from Lafayette Square in front of the White House so Trump could walk to St. John’s Church to pose for photos. This “gave succor to the leaders of other countries who take comfort in our domestic strife,” Mullen wrote. Does Mullen mean China or Russia? If so, he is using fancy words to stop half an inch short of accusing Trump of aiding them. On Wednesday, retired Gen. Allen, now head of the Brookings Institution, predicted doom. “The slide of the United States into illiberalism may well have begun on June 1, 2020,” he wrote for Foreign Policy. Really? What is “illiberalism” anyway, and can I still get it if I’m wearing a face mask? Mattis and Mullen didn’t stop with Trump. They also lashed out at current Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, but in a particularly unkind way. Let me explain. “I think the sooner that you mass and dominate the battlespace, the quicker this dissipates and we can get back to the right normal,” Esper reportedly said on a Monday call with officials, according to news organizations. Neighborhoods aren’t “battlespaces,” said Mullen. Mattis rejected the idea of calling cities “battlespaces” to dominate. This was quite cynical on their part. Please understand that for anyone who’s dealt with the Pentagon in the last 20 years, “dominate the battlespace” is an epic cliché. It comes from early 1990s doctrine terminology, and refers to the area the commander can influence. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Obscure to you and me, perhaps, but something Mattis and Mullen knew well when they pilloried Esper. It’s sad that Mattis and Mullen were eager to catch him out. Anything to attack the Trump administration, I guess. Actually, Esper had something much more important to say at the Pentagon on Wednesday night. Here’s his direct quote: “National Guard forces did not fire rubber bullets or tear gas into the crowd, as reported.”  That puts the Lafayette Square walk in rather a different light. Let’s give Esper a break. He’s not the smoothest talker, but he is doing a good job and should get back to issues only his Department can handle, such as China’s fresh threats to Taiwan. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Retired generals and admirals should keep their cool and expect “incoming” fire when they join in political debate. Military veterans deserve our thanks and respect for their service. But even high-ranking former officers aren’t infallible. When they enter the political dialogue, their views and their records are fair game. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY REBECCA GRANT

 For the past week, all of us have seen chaos engulf our beloved country. The violence and the destruction have been so overwhelming, so shocking, and awful and vivid on the screen, that it's been hard to think clearly about what's going on. Most of us haven't been able to step back far enough to ask even the obvious questions. The most obvious, of course, is what is this really about? What do the mobs want? MINNEAPOLIS CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS AIM TO 'DISMANTLE' POLICE DEPARTMENT, 'RETHINK' PUBLIC SAFETY Well, thugs looting the Apple Store can't answer that question. They have no idea. They just want free iPads. But what about Apple itself and the rest of corporate America, which is enthusiastically supporting the rioters? What about members of Congress, the media figures, the celebrities, the tech titans, all of whom are cheering this on. What do they want out of it? Well, they haven't said. That's the central mystery. Now suddenly, it is obvious. It should have been obvious on the first day. This is about Donald Trump. Of course, it is. We just couldn't see it. For normal people, Donald Trump is the president. You may like him, you may not like him, but either way, there will be another president at some point, and we will move on as we always have. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER But for Donald Trump's enemies, there is nothing else. Everything is about Trump. Everything. Donald Trump defines their friendships, their careers, their marriages. Donald Trump affects how they raise their children. Trump occupies the very center of their lives. As long as Donald Trump remains in the White House. They feel powerless and diminished and panicked. So they cannot be happy. In everything they do, their overriding goal is to remove Donald Trump from office. And that's exactly what they're trying to do now. That's what these riots are about. The most privileged in our society are using the most desperate in our society to seize power from everyone else. Got that? That's the nub of it. The most privileged are using the most desperate to seize power from the rest of us. They are not seeking racial justice. If they were seeking racial justice, they wouldn't be denouncing their fellow Americans for their race, which they are. It has nothing to do with it. What they are seeking is total control of the country. And it goes without saying that none of this has anything to do with George Floyd. Shame on those who pretended that it did -- those who fell for the lie and those who knew better but played along because they are cowards. There are many of those. You know who they are, and someday we will look back on all of them with contempt. Meanwhile, the many people promoting this chaos remain clear-eyed. They are not lying to themselves. They never do. They know exactly what's going on, and they know what they hope to achieve by it. With every night of rioting, they grow bolder. Now, they are openly defending violence on television. Bakari Sellers, CNN political commentator: People worry about the protesters and the looters. And it is just people who are frustrated. Don Lemon, CNN anchor: They are frustrated, and they are angry, and they are out there. And they're upset. You shouldn't be taking televisions, but I can't tell people how to react to this. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.: I'm proud of the protests, and I think it is part of the tradition of New York. The violence is bad, reprehensible, and it should be condemned, but it is not the overwhelming picture in New York. Nikole Hannah-Jones, The New York Times: Destroying property which can be replaced is not violence. Chris Cuomo, CNN anchor Too many see the protests as the problem. Please, show me where it says that protests are supposed to be polite and peaceful. You're crushed by this. You can't believe what's happening to your country. But for the people you just saw, the real problem is that the rioting in some rare places is being stopped by police, and their aim is to fix that. They would like to eliminate all law enforcement for good. In everything they do, their overriding goal is to remove Donald Trump from office. And that's exactly what they're trying to do now. That's what these riots are about. The most privileged in our society are using the most desperate in our society to seize power from everyone else. On Thursday, Democrats in Dallas took down the statue of a Texas Ranger from the terminal at Love Field that has stood in the airport for more than 50 years. The Texas Rangers are cops, and cops must be removed, even when they're made of bronze. Meanwhile, the Lego toy company has ceased marketing sets that contain plastic police officers. Apparently, they're too dangerous for our children. And so on -- so much of this is going on right now. If it all seems like yet another episode of the silly and fleeting hysteria that sometimes grips our culture out of nowhere, usually in lulls in the news cycle, you should know that it's not that. This is entirely real. It is being pushed by serious people, and they are deadly serious about it. On Wednesday night, for example, Brian Fallon, who was the press secretary of the Hillary Clinton for President campaign in the last election cycle tweeted, "Defund the police." Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib agrees. Expect more members of Congress to agree soon. In some places, they're not talking, they're acting. Steve Fletcher represents the Third Ward in Minneapolis. He's on the City Council there. By this week, his city had been completely scorched by riots. At least 66 businesses were utterly destroyed by fire, 300 more had been vandalized or looted. Fletcher didn't even mention that. Instead, he attacked the city's police department for trying to contain the violence: "Several of us on the Council are working on finding out what it would take to disband the Minneapolis Police Department.". How would Americans feel if they actually defunded the police? Well, terrified mostly. That's how we would feel. Things would fall apart instantly. You'd think people in the city would be shocked by that. But at least on the City Council, everyone else nodded their approval. In the Ninth Ward, Councilwoman Alondra Cano tweeted this on Wednesday: "The Minneapolis Police Department is not reformable. Change is coming." According to City Councilman Fletcher, all nine members of the City Council are now considered getting rid of the Minneapolis Police Department. Hard to believe, but it's not just there. In the city of Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti looks out across the worst rioting in the nation's second-largest city in a generation, in almost 30 years. His conclusion? We need far fewer police. It could have been better if they hadn't been there. Garcetti has announced he is going to cut funding for law enforcement. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti: I want you to know we will not be increasing our police budget. How can we at this moment? Our city through our city administrative officer identified $250 million in cuts, so we could invest in jobs, in health, in education, and in healing And that those dollars need to be focused on our black community here in Los Angeles, as well as communities of color and women and people who have been left behind for too long. And will this involve cuts? Yes. Of course. To every department, including the police department. When Democrats across the country start saying the same thing at the same time, you can be certain there's a reason for it. And in this case, they clearly mean it. According to the president of the L.A. Police Commission, city officials may cut $150 million from the LAPD. That would be more than 10 percent of the entire police budget, in the wake of rioting. In New York, 48 separate Democratic candidates -- and they were including in that the Manhattan district attorney -- signed a letter demanding a $1 billion cut to the budget of the NYPD. Why are they doing this? There are reasons, not the ones they tell you. They tell you it's about racism. They tell you that cops are racist and must be reined in. Most Americans don't agree with that. That's not the experience they have. In fact, police departments are one of the most trusted institutions in the country. According to Gallup polling last year, 53 percent of Americans said they had a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in the police. That was far more confidence than they had in almost any other institution -- banks, religious leaders, the health care system, television, news, public schools, corporate America, newspapers -- name one. All of those were stuck below 40 percent. How many Americans trusted Congress? Eleven percent. And in fact, most African Americans still support the police. A 2016 Pew poll found that 55 percent of African-Americans had confidence in the police within their own communities. In other words, cops they actually knew and dealt with. They have confidence. A study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics from 2011 found that among those who called the police for help, more than 90 percent of African-Americans felt the police behaved properly. So, what would happen if we got rid of the police? Of all law enforcement? How would Americans feel if they actually defunded the police? Well, terrified mostly. That's how we would feel. Things would fall apart instantly. It would take hours. Don't believe it? Spend an afternoon in a place with no law enforcement and see what you think. Talk to anyone who was in Baghdad at the height of the Iraq War. Ask anyone who stayed in New Orleans for Katrina. Their memories will be fresh. They'll never forget what they saw. Here's the key. Eliminating the police does not mean eliminating authority. There is always authority. There are no vacuums in nature. The only question is whether or not the authority is legitimate -- whether or not the authority is accountable. Whether or not you can do anything if the authority abuses its power. In the absence of law enforcement, the answer is no. It means thugs are in charge. The most violent people have the most power. They can do whatever they want to you. That's the reality. Everyone obeys the violent people, or they get hurt. The mob literally rules. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP That probably sounds like a nightmare to you, because it is. But the people pushing this idea don't see it as scary because they don't fear the mob, because they control the mob. That's the key. And they see violence as an instrument of their political power. With mobs in the streets that they control, they will finally get what they want -- Donald Trump out of office and a hammerlock on the country. That's what's happening.

 Editor’s note: This is adapted from an excerpt of Alex Berenson’s booklet “Unreported Truths about COVID-19 and Lockdowns” posted on his website alexberenson.com. Amazon initially refused to sell the booklet but then reversed its decision.  Maybe the most important questions of all about the COVID-19 pandemic are: How lethal is the virus SARS-COV-2? Whom does it kill? Are the death counts accurate – and, if not, are they overstated or understated? Estimates for the lethality of the coronavirus have varied widely since January. Early Chinese data suggested the virus might have an “infection fatality rate” as high as 1.4 to 2 percent. A death rate in that range could mean the coronavirus might kill more than 6 million Americans, although even under the worst-case scenarios some people would not be exposed, and others might have natural immunity that would prevent them from being infected at all. ALEX BERENSON'S CORONAVIRUS BOOKLET HITS AMAZON AFTER ELON MUSK, OTHERS CALL OUT ONLINE RETAILER FOR 'CENSORSHIP' As we have learned more about the virus, estimates of its lethality have fallen. Calculating fatality rates is complex, because despite all of our testing for COVID-19, we still don’t know how many people have been infected. Some people who are infected may have no or mild symptoms. Even those with more severe symptoms may resist going to the hospital, then recover on their own. We have a clear view of the top of the iceberg – the serious infections that require hospitalization – but at least in the early stages of the epidemic we have to guess at the mild, hidden infections. But to calculate the true fatality rate, we need to know the true infection rate. If 10,000 people die out of 100,000 infections, that means the virus kills 10 percent of all the people it infects – making it very, very dangerous. But if 10,000 people die from 10 million infections, the death rate is actually 0.1 percent – similar to the flu. Unfortunately, figuring out the real infection rate is very difficult. Probably the best way is through antibody tests, which measure how many people have already been infected and recovered – even if they never were hospitalized or even had symptoms. Studies in which many people in a city, state, or even country are tested at random to see if they are currently infected can also help. Believe it or not, so can tests of municipal sewage. For now, the crucial point is this: randomized antibody tests from all over the world have repeatedly shown many more people have been infected with coronavirus than is revealed by tests for active infection. Many people who are infected with SARS-COV-2 don’t even know it. So the hidden part of the iceberg is huge. And in turn, scientists have repeatedly reduced their estimates for how dangerous the coronavirus might be. The most important estimate came on May 20, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported its best estimate was that the virus would kill 0.26 percent of people it infected, or about 1 in 400 people. (The virus would kill 0.4 percent of those who developed symptoms. But about one out of three people would have no symptoms at all, the CDC said.) Similarly, a German study in April reported a fatality rate of 0.37 percent. A large study in April in Los Angeles predicted a death rate in the range of 0.15 to 0.3 percent. Some estimates have been even lower. Others have been somewhat higher – especially in regions that experienced periods of severe stress on their health care systems. In New York City, for example, the death rates appear somewhat higher, possibly above 0.5 percent – though New York may be an outlier, both because it has counted deaths aggressively (more on this later) and because its hospitals seem to have used ventilators particularly aggressively. Thus the CDC’s estimate for deaths is probably the best place to begin. Using that figure along with several other papers and studies suggests the coronavirus has an infection fatality rate in the range of 0.15 percent to 0.4 percent. In other words, SARS-COV-2 likely kills between 1 in 250 and 1 in 650 of the people whom it infects. Again, though, not everyone who is exposed will become infected. Some people do not contract the virus, perhaps because their T-cells – which help the immune system destroy invading viruses and bacteria – have already been primed by exposure to other coronaviruses. Several other coronaviruses exist; the most common versions usually cause minor colds in the people they infect. An early May paper in the journal Cell suggests that as many as 60 percent of people may have some preexisting immune response, though not all will necessarily be immune. The experience of outbreaks on large ships such as aircraft carriers and cruise liners also shows that some people do not become infected. The best estimates are that the virus probably can infect somewhere between 50 to 70 percent of people. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER For example, on one French aircraft carrier, 60 percent of sailors were infected (none died and only two out of 1,074 infected sailors required intensive care). Thus – in a worst-case scenario – if we took no steps to mitigate its spread or protect vulnerable people, a completely unchecked coronavirus might kill between 0.075 and 0.28 percent of the United States population – between 1 in 360 and 1 in 1,300 Americans. This is higher than the seasonal flu in most years. Influenza is usually said to have a fatality rate among symptomatic cases of 1 in 1,000 and an overall fatality rate of around 1 in 2,000. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP However, influenza mutates rapidly, and its dangerousness varies year by year. The coronavirus appears far less dangerous than the Spanish flu a century ago, which was commonly said to have killed 1 in 50 of the people it infected. The current coronavirus pandemic appears more comparable in terms of overall mortality to the influenza epidemics of 1957 and 1968, or the British flu epidemics of the late 1990s. Of course, the United States and United Kingdom did not only not shut down for any of those epidemics, they received little attention outside the health care system.

 The New York Times, which haughtily claims it publishes “All the News That’s Fit to Print,” caved in to far-left political correctness Thursday. The paper decided it was wrong to publish an op-ed by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., that called for the military to be sent to U.S. cities to help local law enforcement deal with “rioters and looters.” In the op-ed, Cotton made a point of saying his comments were not directed against “law-abiding protesters” responding to “the wrongful death of George Floyd,” a black man who died when a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes as Floyd lay handcuffed on the ground May 25. That officer and three others have been fired and criminally charged in Floyd’s death. The death has sparked rioting in many cities.  The Times published an article online Thursday night saying the Cotton op-ed “fell short of the newspaper’s standards.” And it quoted its own spokeswoman, Eileen Murphy as stating: “We’ve examined the piece and the process leading up to its publication. This review made clear that a rushed editorial process led to the publication of an Op-Ed that did not meet our standards. As a result, we’re planning to examine both short-term and long-term changes, to include expanding our fact-checking operation and reducing the number of Op-Eds we publish.” NY TIMES ISSUES 'MEA CULPA,' SAYS TOM COTTON OP-ED ON GEORGE FLOYD RIOTS 'RUSHED,' FAILED TO MEET STANDARDS The stunning reversal by the newspaper of its decision to publish the Cotton op-ed was yet more evidence of the collapse of journalism at The New York Times. Times staffers let out a scream heard across social media when their employer had the nerve to publish the view of a Republican senator that they disagreed with. The Washington Post called it a “staff uproar” and Vanity Fair went with the headline “Times Employees Rebel.” Both CNN and The Daily Beast turned to the word “revolt.” The Daily Beast explained the reaction with the headline: “New York Times Staffers in Open Revolt Over Tom Cotton’s ‘Send in the Troops’ Column.” I would rephrase that to say the refusal to allow a free exchange of ideas in the newspaper was revolting. Will the Times now change its motto from “All the News That’s Fit to Print” to “All the News that Fits Our Far-Left Agenda?” Dozens of Times staffers vented their liberal spleens on Twitter when their newspaper dared allow Cotton to express his views in his well-reasoned op-ed. How do we know? Naturally, the Times wrote about how angry its self-important and aggrieved liberals were. They “responded to the Op-Ed on Twitter by tweeting the sentence (or variations on it): ‘Running this puts Black @NYTimes staff in danger.’” That wasn’t enough. The paper’s Hollywood reporter, Brooks Barnes, called the op-ed “fascist garbage” that “should have been rejected.” Nikole Hannah-Jones claimed that “I’ll probably get in trouble for this.” Hannah-Jones, a Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times Magazine writer, tweeted: “As a black woman, as a journalist, as an American, I am deeply ashamed that we ran this.” Hannah-Jones won that Pulitzer for her much-criticized faux history “1619 Project,” so she’s probably used to being ashamed of what the paper publishes. Now she’ll probably get commended for his criticism of her own employer before the Times flip-flopped. Of course, the paper’s leftist union, The NewsGuild of New York, chimed in with predictably radical rhetoric. It wrote that Cotton’s “message undermines the journalistic work of our members, puts our Black staff members in danger, promotes hate, and is likely to encourage further violence. Invariably, invoking state violence disproportionately hurts Black and brown people.” So much for the old-fashioned view that more speech is better speech. Instead, some of the most pampered voices in journalism are demanding a safe space. There were a few Times voices defending the idea of a free exchange of ideas – before the paper came out against such a free exchange. These included Publisher A.G. Sulzberger, who said the newspaper wanted to give “readers a diversity of perspectives.”  CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Editorial Page Editor James Bennet said “many readers find Senator Cotton's argument painful, even dangerous,” but still argued for it to be published. But that was before The Times made it clear that it no longer supported Bennet’s decision. In fact, before his employer abandoned all pretense of supporting the airing of divergent viewpoints, Bennet took the right position when he wrote on the newspaper’s website earlier Thursday: “We published Cotton’s argument in part because we’ve committed to Times readers to provide a debate on important questions like this. It would undermine the integrity and independence of The New York Times if we only published views that editors like me agreed with, and it would betray what I think of as our fundamental purpose – not to tell you what to think, but to help you think for yourself.” I couldn’t agree more with Bennet’s earlier view. And now The New York Times has, by his own account, “undermined the integrity and independence” of the newspaper. While Cotton didn’t get the last word, he blasted the “woke-progressive mob” for trying to silence opinions the left doesn’t like. He won the battle for a brief time, but now the woke progressives at the paper have won the war. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Whenever Times staffers freak out because their paper actually covered how the rest of America thinks on an issue, they make it less likely that will happen again. Now the thought police have won a victory that many journalists are cheering. And the New York Times has made it quite clear that the views of those who don’t embrace far-left orthodoxy are unfit to print.   CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY DAN GAINOR

 As New York City burned, Gov. Andy Cuomo said this Tuesday on Twitter: “There are those who want to intentionally blur the lines between peaceful, legitimate protesters and looters. The president is among them. They want you to watch the videos of the looting – not the video of Mr. Floyd being murdered. Don't fall for it." So, a governor whose citizens and taxpayers are under attack, claims the biggest problem is witnessing the attack. The mayhem. The looting. Attacks on cops. Because that "blurs the lines between peaceful protests and looters." GUTFELD ON THE MURDER OF MR. DORN I supposed he would prefer him joking around with his brother Chris on CNN again and again. So, who is blurring the lines between protesters and looters?  It’s not me.  It’s people like him.  Because every time you mention the rioters, they accuse you of smearing protesters.  CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER We do understand the difference. Does he? Do you remember when you condemned actions of jihadists, and suddenly they accused you of Islamophobia? That when you criticized beheadings that was the same as calling all Muslims "extremists?" That idiotic response revealed who does the blurring. And it’s that blurring that hurts the protest movement. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But by exposing the violent mob, you protect the future of legitimate protest. Not doing it, forever links it to destruction and death, while saying or implying that black grievance only matters if it's expressed violently. That’s nuts.

 Prosecutors in Minnesota have filed an amended complaint against Derek Chauvin for the killing of George Floyd, adding a second-degree “felony murder” charge. This dangerously flawed theory could be used to portray any police restraint of a resistant suspect as criminal assault. ANDREW McCARTHY: 'INSTITUTIONAL RACISM' AMONG POLICE? LET'S LOOK AT THE NUMBERS The amended complaint against Chauvin also re-alleges the two homicide charges originally filed last week: third-degree “depraved indifference” murder and second-degree manslaughter, both of which better fit the facts of the case while posing no risk of criminalizing the legitimate use of force by good cops. Separately, the other three fired Minneapolis police officers involved in the killing have been charged, after a week of demands by the Floyd family, as well as intense anti-police rhetoric (and worse) by Black Lives Matter activists and protesters. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Tou Thao, J. Alexander Kueng, and Thomas Lane are charged with aiding and abetting both second-degree murder (the new charge against Chauvin) and manslaughter. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Weirdly, under the circumstances, the three are not charged with the “depraved indifference” murder count; nor are they accused of committing manslaughter as principals — they are charged only as aiders and abettors, a theory that does not jibe with a negligence charge such as second-degree manslaughter (which is negligent homicide under Minnesota law).

 A deadly pandemic. A reactionary lockdown. An ensuing economic collapse. And then a senseless murder caught on video. Can 2020 gut-punch us anymore? Yes, violent and destructive riots in cities across the country and then a debate about using our military to stop them. Enter retired Marine Gen. James “Mad Dog” Mattis, the Trump administration’s first defense secretary, breaking his silence and self-imposed ethics of never speaking against a sitting president by writing a vicious op-ed rebuking President Trump’s threat to invoke the Insurrection Act if city and state leaders don’t get the unrest under control. ANDREW McCARTHY: 'INSTITUTIONAL RACISM' AMONG POLICE? LET'S LOOK AT THE NUMBERS Ironically, I’ve actually been punched in the gut by Mattis. I was stationed at Eglin Air Force Base in 2008 attending the Defense Department’s Explosive Ordnance Disposal school. Mattis, the supreme allied commander of NATO forces and commanding general of Joint Forces, accepted our invitation to speak at our annual memorial where we honor the bomb techs who’d fallen in the line of duty that year. I was tasked with helping coordinate his visit. True to form, Mattis arrived precisely at 10 p.m. and debarked his C-130 in his full service A uniform. He walked past the Air Force colonels saluting him — he’d requested they not be there — and went straight to the airman “on guard” at the extended wing of the plane. With the engines running I couldn’t hear him, but from the look of it he checked the rifle the airman was holding and gave him an approving slap on the arm. Mattis immediately turned and walked straight down the plane to me. He stopped in front of me, quickly looked me over, gut-punched me and shook my hand adding, “Well done, Marine, I was that hard when I was your age, too.” The general made his reputation on two things: the skill to surprise an enemy and his peers with swift and decisive action, and the audacity to speak his mind in nonconformist soundbites. He’s the general known for saying, “Be polite, be professional and have a plan to kill everyone you meet.” They each play, and have played, a pivotal role in voicing loudly the belief that Americans are proud, capable and special, in the world and on the battlefield. I appreciate each of them for it.   This outspokenness is what he has most in common with President Trump. Mattis had the tactical skill to win a battle, a region or even a moment in time, but his entire era of leadership in the Middle East conflict didn't win the war. In his world, and in his mind, you do things a certain way, a proven way, even when politics advise against it. He’s also the general who said, “If in order to kill an enemy you have to kill an innocent, don’t take the shot. Don’t create more enemies than you take out by some immoral act.” Trump, on the other hand, is less calculated and more reactive to populist sentiment and current events. Neither is necessarily right or wrong, but they were certain to clash. I admire James Mattis in a way I’ll never look at President Trump. In a foxhole, or by my hospital bed, I want the General. But it takes more than principled leadership and proven strategy to win over a country right now. It takes a bombastic personality, over-generalizations and pointed innuendo. That’s why I voted for Trump. He plays a role. In doing so, he backs up policies and fights political fights a well-balanced tactician wouldn’t dare engage in. For that reason, Trump is an effective disruptor, and for those same reasons, Mattis would never condone his tactics. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER It’ll be easy for Trump loyalists and fed-up Americans to “clap back” at Mattis. Let me be the first to tell you, he’s not listening to insults and he won’t respond in kind. I doubt he’ll respond at all. In his mind, he is no cultural icon, no legend and no hero. He’s simply a Marine, loyal to a nation, not a politician or party. Mattis has a set of ideals and he’s adhering to them — in my opinion, with this op-ed, to a fault. His words accomplish, with equal injury, the division he’s condemning. Though a stalwart general, he’s failed to see the simplest of truths on the battlefield of rhetoric: any stance you take will be used against you in the court of public opinion. For those of you struggling to balance your appreciation for a man who, while in uniform was a generation’s plainspoken voice on war, with your adoration for a POTUS seeming to do the same on politics, don’t. They each play, and have played, a pivotal role in voicing loudly the belief that Americans are proud, capable and special, in the world and on the battlefield. I appreciate each of them for it. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP I hate seeing Trump tweet about irrelevant things and spew personal insults. Likewise, I hate seeing Mattis take to politics. So, what’s the lesson for those of us who admire them both? It’s simple: Know what YOU believe, and WHY you believe it. Don’t let any one person overshadow it or represent it for you. After all, they’re just people. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY JOHNNY ‘JOEY’ JONES

 Protests have a purpose. People protest when they feel like they’re not being heard. For the last week, we’ve seen countless protests across our country, including several in my home state of South Dakota, because of what happened to George Floyd while in the custody of the Minneapolis police. Personally, I couldn’t even make it through the video of his death because it was so gut-wrenching. There is no one that thinks that what happened to George Floyd was OK. The protests in South Dakota have served their purpose. ANDREW McCARTHY: 'INSTITUTIONAL RACISM' AMONG POLICE? LET'S LOOK AT THE NUMBERS The question before us now is: What do we want policing to look like going forward? That’s at all levels – city, county and state. There’s no governor in America that has trusted their people to make the right choices more than I have these last several months. And there’s no governor in America more willing to work with her people to find solutions to our problems – be that policing or otherwise. It’s time to problem-solve. Policing is largely a state and local issue – the vast majority of police officers are local, not federal, and the laws they enforce are local, not federal. If we want to change the nature of policing, we must take the lead on that ourselves. In America, the street doesn’t settle or resolve this policing question, or any other public policy question. Rather, it’s the hard work of study, review, debate, negotiation and accommodation. Then, we decide what is the best action. One-liners on social media aren’t the answer. People need to ask themselves: What are the facts? What are the consequences? What can history teach us? Our American political system is deliberative, so we must take the time to do the hard work of looking at these things from all angles. Free speech is one of our most fundamental rights. I see legitimate protests raising important concerns, and I hear those concerns. One thing I have noticed about public discourse in America today is the immediacy of it all. Social media and the Internet have made it easy to communicate quickly – instantly, in fact. That’s a great tool, but it has also made it easy to communicate thoughtlessly. In the race to be heard, too many of us have given up trying to make an argument. Instead, we compete to see who can shout the loudest. America is a place where all voices can be heard. Free speech is one of our most fundamental rights. I see legitimate protests raising important concerns, and I hear those concerns. But I also see violent actors who are trying to do an end-run around public discourse. They want to intimidate and silence opposing views. They want to short-cut public debate through fear. They want to make people scared. This is un-American. The biggest lesson I’ve learned when tackling public policy issues is that there’s no institution more important than the family. We are blessed with great families in South Dakota and in America. Whatever your family looks like, make sure you’re a strong family. I say that because what’s been taking place across our country shows that some of our families need a lot more attention. Parents need to know if their kids are out throwing rocks at cops. Brothers and sisters need to know if their siblings are looting and vandalizing businesses. Grandparents need to know if their grandkids are intentionally trying to destroy our way of life.

 On Tuesday, Joe Biden gave a speech on the death of George Floyd that prompted many to sing his praises. But I couldn’t stop thinking about his record. To be fair, I can admit that Biden did say a lot of the right things. He was right, for example, to condemn “systemic racism” and to call for “real police reform.” What I can’t understand, though, is how he was able to do so without once acknowledging the role that he himself has played in making the criminal justice system something that so desperately does need reform in the first place, and how some simple words have seemed to — in a shocking number of minds — virtually erased his history on these issues. CURTIS HILL: MURDER CHARGES IN GEORGE FLOYD DEATH ARE A GOOD STEP BUT MORE NEEDED TO FIX BROKEN RACE RELATIONS The fact is, Joe Biden has a terrible record on criminal justice. For example, Biden helped to write the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 — the very law that played a major role in contributing to the mass incarceration (which, by the way, had a disparate impact on black men) we saw in the 1990s. Although he has since, of course, walked back his former tough-on-crime-approach, (saying "I haven't always been right. I know we haven't always gotten things right, but I've always tried,” at the National Action Network's Martin Luther King Jr. breakfast in January of 2019), it’s worth noting that he defended the law as recently as 2016. Worse, his dismal history on these issues extends far beyond a single law. Biden also co-sponsored the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, which instituted requirements for mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenders as well as the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine, which resulted in disproportionately longer sentences for minority offenders than it did for white offenders, for doing pretty much exactly the same thing. I do, of course, understand that people can change their minds on issues, and if Biden really, truly has changed his mind on this one, then that’s something that I cheer. At the same time, though, I can’t help but feel strange listening to someone rail against problems that he not only hadn’t railed on before, but also actually tangibly helped to create. If you are mad about the current state of affairs, then good. I am too! But please, for the love of logic, do some objective research. My intention is not to place the blame squarely on Biden, or even on the Democratic Party. That 1994 crime bill, after all, was a bipartisan effort. What’s more, you won’t find me saying that the current administration is without its own mistakes. For example, although President Trump and his administration have made major strides in reforming the criminal justice system, I was among the many Americans who were absolutely horrified at security forces’ use of “pepper balls” and “smoke canisters” to clear peaceful protesters so that Trump could secure a photo op. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Rather, my point is that I am upset to see people playing politics with this issue at all. For many Americans, “incarceration” is not just a word — it’s years of your life that you’ve lost. It’s the description of being torn apart from your career, from your family and from society. It is bigger than politics. If you are mad about the current state of affairs, then good. I am too! But please, for the love of logic, do some objective research. You can, for example, have loved Biden’s Tuesday speech, but you shouldn’t also forget how Biden once complained that George H.W. Bush wasn’t putting enough “violent thugs” in prison, or how he once bragged that, although some Democrats were too soft on criminal justice, he preferred to describe his own views on it as, simply, “Lock the S.O.B.s up.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP This issue is, quite simply, far too important to avoid having open-minded, truth-and-solutions-seeking, honest discussions about. The problems people are now protesting are not, after all, new. They are systemic, and both parties have played a role in creating that system. Uncomfortable or not, the only way to solve this mess is to make sure that we fully understand it — which we cannot do without fully acknowledging every part of us getting here. Oh, and if you refuse to examine all aspects of an issue because some of them may be politically inconvenient? Well, it’s your life — but please know that means you care far more about your politics than you do about actually solving the problem. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BYKAT TIMPF

 For many of us, this has been one of the saddest, most painful weeks in memory. Depressing doesn't even begin to describe it. We have watched as mobs of violent cretins have burned our cities, defaced our monuments, beaten old women in the street, shot police officers and stolen everything in sight -- stealing everything. BAIL REFORM LAWS LET ALLEGED CRIMINALS BACK ON THE STREETS WITHIN HOURS, THREATENING PUBLIC SECURITY How many innocent Americans have these people hurt? How many have they murdered? We don't know that number. But it's the country itself that so many of us worry about at this point. After we've watched what's happened over the last week, how do we put the society back together? Can we? We don't know that, either. If you're grieving for America right now, you are not alone. Millions feel the same way you do. So many of our leaders, by contrast, are not grieving. They seem exhilarated. They feel nothing as our nation descends into anarchy. They see chaos, instead, as an opportunity, a chance to solidify their control, to increase their market share to win elections. They have no interest in talking about the details of what is actually happening out there on our streets. In fact, they're hiding those details. They're demanding that you forget what you saw. Don't forget it. Remember all of it -- every bit -- because it's proof of who they are. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER What they're defending and encouraging has nothing to do with civil rights. It is violence, and the criminals you see on the screen are not protesters. The people cheering them on from their TV studios have no patience for real protests or real protesters. Just in April, Democrats in New Jersey arrested a woman for trying to plan a rally, a protest at the state capitol. The New York Times said nothing when they did that because they approve. That's how they really feel about any political expression they can't control -- they crush it. What they support is more power for themselves and they're willing to use gangs of thugs to get it. Here is one of their protesters chanting "no justice, no peace" as a man tortures a dog. NBC News wouldn't show you that video ever. Neither would CNN under any circumstances. These are the worst people in America, and our leaders have let them do whatever they want. So, of course, they want more. Their latest demand is that we eliminate the police entirely. No more law enforcement in this country. That would mean more power for the mob. They could do anything. It would mean never-ending terror for you and for your family. That's why they want it. Unidentified male: I am now calling on all and our city council members and all of our elected officials to defund the police. Crowd: Defund the police. Unidentified male: Defund the police. Crowd: Defund the police. "Defund the police." No sane person would dare to have said something like that in public just a week and a half ago. Now, a member of Congress has endorsed the idea -- Rashida Tlaib. So, what would happen to our country if we eliminated law enforcement? Eric Garcetti is the mayor of Los Angeles, the second biggest city in America. His city would devolve into a murderous hellscape within hours if the police left. But Garcetti, who is in charge of the city, won't push back against this idea. Instead, he kneeled in subservience before the people demanding it. Jake Tapper, CNN anchor: LA Mayor Eric Garcetti joined protesters moments ago, what did he have to say? Stephanie Elam, CNN correspondent: Yes, he came out this morning, Jake, and he took the time to come out and come out among the protesters. He knelt while he was out there, saying -- and showing -- his solidarity for the movement, for the protesters here today. And I can tell you that today, this daytime protest has been very peaceful, very calm. Lots of chanting, singing. He kneeled. Our leaders are kneeling before the mob, the atavistic ritual of self-abasement of defeat. Suddenly, many are performing this ritual, including police around the country. The mob wants victory. But more than that, it wants the total humiliation of its enemies. Unidentified male: I work for Black Lives Matter. I'm sorry that I scared you. But since I work for that company, my CEO has told me to come out today and to bring you on your knees because you have white privilege. So if they see that a white person is getting on their knees that show solidarity for the situation. The situation and could you just please apologize for -- you know for your white privilege. Just apologize. Unidentified female: I have -- I am trying to think of the right words to say. What's a good thing to say? Unidentified male: It's big. Unidentified female: That comes from -- Unidentified male: It's so -- it's large in this country. Unidentified female: I am terribly sorry. Why do we kneel? We kneel because we've lost. We kneel before our victors because they have won. We put down our resistance. We beg for their mercy. But mobs rarely forgive. "We're on your side!" we shout. We're in solidarity, spare us. But they never do. "We're on your side" as the rock comes through the window. You think the mob cares? No. What's happening to this country? Why are Americans surrendering to violent mobs? Well, because they've been told they have to. Everything we're now watching -- the looting, the arson, the killing -- has a purpose. The purpose we're told again and again is to end racist police violence against African-Americans. We are told that that is the single greatest scourge in this country. Demonstrators say repeatedly, "Stop killing us." Stop killing us -- it's chilling. And if you believe it, and you're a decent person, you will be moved by it -- because it's awful. No American should ever be mistreated by those in authority, much less killed. The abuse of power is always and everywhere a sin, and it's increasingly common here. We should always work to end it. So many of our leaders, by contrast, are not grieving. They seem exhilarated. They feel nothing as our nation descends into anarchy. They see chaos, instead, as an opportunity In this case, the death of a man at the hands of police in Minneapolis turned out to be a metaphor for abuse of power. That death has led to demands that we fire the nearly 700,000 police officers who work in the United States and that we free the million and a half criminals who are now behind bars. In America, Joe Biden told us recently: "Just the color of your skin puts your life at risk." Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey strongly agreed with that. "We have so many people in our country," Booker said Tuesday, "African-American men mostly unarmed, being murdered by police officers and no way of holding them accountable." So many people murdered by police officers, unarmed, says Cory Booker. You're hearing a lot of people in authority tell you that, every day, every hour. One group of pro athletes just announced that, "It seems like every week, a new tragedy unfolds before our very eyes where people are being killed by police violence. Each time we tweet, we pray, we mourn, only to repeat the cycle a few days later." In the words of Ben Crump, who is the lawyer representing George Floyd's family in Minneapolis, what we're witnessing here in America is "genocide." Genocide? If you believe we were seeing genocide, then you might understand the riots now in progress. There's nothing worse than genocide. But is it happening? Is any of this true? We should find out. Facts matter. What exactly are the numbers? We found the numbers and we're going to go through them with you in some detail because it's worth it. Since 2015, The Washington Post has maintained a comprehensive database of fatal police shootings in this country. Last year, The Post logged a total of 1,004 killings. Of the 802 shootings in which the race of the police officer and the suspect was noted, 371 of those killed were white, 236 were black. The vast majority of those killed were not, in fact, unarmed; the vast majority were armed. And African-American suspects were significantly more likely to have a deadly weapon than white suspects, yet more white suspects were killed. This is not genocide. It's not even close to genocide. It is laughable to suggest it is. Overall, there were a total of precisely 10 cases in the United States last year, according to The Washington Post, in which unarmed African- Americans were fatally shot by the police. There were nine men and one woman. Now, as we said, a lot is at stake. The country is at stake. So we want to take the time now to go through these case by case, into the specifics. The first was a man called Channara Pheap. He was killed by a Knoxville police officer called Dylan Williams. According to Williams, Pheap attacked him, choked him and then used a taser on him -- the suspect on the police officer before the officer shot him. Five eyewitnesses corroborated the officer's claim, and the officer was not charged. The second case concerns a man called Marcus McVeigh. He was by any description a career criminal from San Angelo, Texas. He had been convicted of aggravated assault, assault on a public servant and organized criminal activity. At the time he was killed, he was wanted on drug dealing charges. The Texas State trooper pulled him over. McVeigh fled in his car, then he fled on foot into the woods. There he fought with the trooper and was shot and killed. The officer was not charged in that case. Marzua Scott assaulted a shop employee. When a female police officer arrived and ordered the suspect toward her car, he instead charged her and knocked her to the ground. At that point, she shot and killed him. The entire incident was caught on body camera. The officer was not charged. Ryan Twyman was being approached by two LA County deputies when he backed into one of them with his vehicle. The deputy was caught in the car door. He and his partner opened fire. The deputies were not charged in that case. Melvin Watkins of East Baton Rouge, La. shot by a deputy after he allegedly drove his car toward the deputy at high speed. The deputy was not charged. Isaiah Lewis, meanwhile, wasn't just unarmed, he was completely naked. Williams broke into a house and then attacked a police officer. The police tased Williams, but he kept coming at them and attacking. The officer shot him. They were not charged. Atatiana Jefferson was shot by a Fort Worth deputy called Aaron Dean. A neighbor had called a non-emergency number after seeing Jefferson's door open, thinking something might be wrong. Police arrived. Jefferson saw them approach from a window and was holding a gun at the time. According to body camera footage, the officer shot Jefferson within seconds. That officer has been charged with homicide. Is our nation being ripped apart by a total and complete lie, a provable lie? A lie used by cynical media manipulators and unscrupulous politicians who understand that racial strife -- race hatred -- is their path to power, even if it destroys the country. Christopher Whitfield was shot and killed in a place called Ethel, La. He had robbed a gas station. Deputy Glenn Sims said his gun discharged accidentally while grappling with Whitfield. Sims, who is black himself, was not charged in that killing. Kevin Mason was shot by police during a multi-hour standoff. Well, Mason turned out not to have a gun. Mason claimed to have a gun, claimed to be armed and vowed to kill police with it. They believed him. Mason had been in a shootout with police years before. And finally, the tenth case concerns Gregory Griffin. He was shot during a car chase. An officer called Giovanni Crespo claimed he saw someone pointing a gun at him. Later, a gun was in fact found inside the vehicle, and yet Officer Crespo was charged anyway with aggravated manslaughter. Those are the facts. That is the entire list from 2019, last year -- 10 deaths. In five deaths, an officer was attacked just before the shooting occurred. That is not disputed. One allegedly was an accident. That leaves a total of four deaths during a pursuit or in a standoff. So out of four, in two of those cases -- and fully half -- the officer was criminally charged. Is it possible that more of these officers should have been charged? Of course, it's possible. Justice is not always served, that's for sure. But either way, this is a very small number in a country of 325 million people. This is not genocide. It's not even close to genocide. It is laughable to suggest it is. In fact, the number of police killings is dropping. In 2015, during Barack Obama's presidency, 38 unarmed black Americans and 32 whites were slain by police. Overall totals have fallen since then, and they have fallen far more dramatically for African-American men. Last year was the safest year for unarmed suspects since The Washington Post begin tracking police shootings. It was the safest year for both white and black suspects. At the same time, this country remains a dangerous place for police officers. Forty-eight of them were murdered in 2019 according to FBI data. That's more than the number of unarmed suspects killed of all races. One final number for you, because it matters: In 2018, 7,407 African-Americans were murdered in the United States. If 2019 continues on a similar trajectory, -- and we hope it doesn't, but if it does -- that would mean that for every unarmed African-American shot to death in the United States by police, more than 700 were murdered by someone else, usually by someone they know. Again, those are the facts. They are not in dispute. Are African-Americans being "hunted" as Joy Reid recklessly claimed on MSNBC recently? Or something else happening?

 About twice as many white people as black people are killed by police. In fact, in about 75 percent of police shootings, the decedent is not black. Of course, that is not what you would grasp from consuming media. CURTIS HILL: MURDER CHARGES IN GEORGE FLOYD DEATH ARE A GOOD STEP BUT MORE NEEDED TO FIX BROKEN RACE RELATIONS Take the website statista.com, specifically its breathless focus on “Hate crime in the United States” — counterfactually insinuating that any shooting involving a black victim must be a “hate crime.” Here’s their big headline from Tuesday: “Black Americans 2.5X More Likely Than Whites to Be Killed By Police.” It is fiction. It is sheer demagoguery, peddled as American cities are besieged by rioters in the wake of George Floyd’s killing by Minneapolis police.

 “These are the times that try men’s souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country, but he that stands by it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.”  -- Thomas Paine (1737-1809) Colonial America was filled with summer soldiers and sunshine patriots who wanted triumph over tyranny but were afraid to fight for it. Of course, enough did fight. They won the Revolutionary War and they enacted a Constitution intended to prevent both anarchy and tyranny. Today, we have both. REP. ANDY BIGGS: END RIOTS, RESTORE FREEDOM – TOO MANY AIDING BAD BEHAVIOR America is under attack by three deadly viruses. COVID-19 has killed more than 107,000 Americans since March. Yet, it pales in comparison to the virus it provoked -- hubris. And that, in turn, provoked the virus that has bedeviled America since the 17th century -- racism. Right now, the largest U.S. cities in at least 28 states are under curfew and many are patrolled by National Guard troops as the cities have been beset by violence. We all watched the gut-wrenching video of a white Minneapolis police officer torturing and murdering a handcuffed black man on a public street. Late Wednesday the officer was charged with the more severe crime of second-degree murder and three other officers who were at the scene but did not interfere in the killing were charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder. If convicted, all could face sentences of up to 50 years in prison. Were the killer not wearing a police uniform, he’d have been charged with first-degree murder. First-degree murder requires proof of intent to kill plus planning or premeditation. Yet, that premeditation can arise during the commission of the crime itself. For example, when the time consumed by the commission of the murder is far longer than was necessary to consummate it. In my view, the premeditation occurred in the killer’s mind as he continued the slow choking -- planning its continuance and its consummation, even rejecting the plea of a fellow officer to let go of the victim. Hence, by choking George Floyd for eight and a half minutes, former officer Derek Chauvin planned to kill and carried out his plan. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER The killing was an act of racism or hubris or both. Racism is hatred of another because of skin color. It is legally prohibited to all governments. You can choose a friend based on skin color, but you cannot lawfully perform a single government act based on it. Hubris was the Greek goddess of unpunished arrogant behavior. Hubris rejects the applicability of laws to oneself because of a false belief in one’s invincibility. At its essence, hubris is the lust to dominate. We saw this, too, in Floyd’s murderer. We have also seen hubris in the slow death of personal liberty this spring -- as all 50 governors and the mayors of many of the same cities now beset by rioters have crafted standards of behavior never legislated into law, and used police to enforce those standards as if they were law. Believing they will suffer no consequences for their destruction of constitutionally guaranteed liberties and economic prosperity, these governors have become infected with hubris. Government racism and hubris has led to violence in our streets. Yet, protests, that were once the manifestation of natural grief and lawfully protected assembly for the redress of known government failures and excesses, have been captured by those with sinister motives. Some of these fomenters of violence -- white and black -- seek to restructure our culture through violence. That violence will destroy what little freedom remains. What is it about those in government who believe they are above the law and are invincible -- whether cops using deadly force unlawfully or governors commanding cops unlawfully to enforce their whims? Add to this the lives, liberties and property lost by the hubris of governors shutting down businesses and putting 40 million folks out of work -- and you have the perfect storm that is trying our souls today. Do we have the moral leadership to address this deadly mess? Is the president’s harsh rhetoric -- “looting brings shooting”; “we will unleash vicious dogs”; “get control of the battle space” -- making things better or worse? Was it just for him to break his own curfew and use tear gas to move peaceful protesters, who were lawfully present, out of a park near the White House so he could walk through it to a nearby church? Should the president be a tough guy or a peacemaker? Do violent words and deeds beget violence? Can the same governors who unconstitutionally shut down society now employ lawful force against rioters who want to destroy and remake society? Their police can’t protect private property and can barely protect private citizens -- which is why we have a Second Amendment. Now you know why we need large magazines and much ammo. Why can New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy -- the prince of hubris -- permit 2,500 people in Newark to demonstrate over Floyd’s death but deny 25 people in the small town of Newton the right to demonstrate against his lockdowns? Because -- in his own words -- he agrees with the Newark demonstrators and has no use for the Bill of Rights. We have no use for him. All political dissent, even civil disobedience, is legitimate when it is peaceful. But violence is not legitimate unless in self-defense or toppling a tyrant. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The police have a duty to neutralize violence. That means for them proceeding into the face of known danger  -- not watching their buddy murder someone or deserting their own police stations, as Chauvin’s colleagues did. The late historian Chalmers Johnson observed that if we fail to eliminate racism and hubris in the government, we will pay dearly. He argued metaphorically that Nemesis -- the Greek goddess of retribution -- awaits her time with us. Perhaps she is here already. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO

 Our current lockdown strategy may or may not defeat the coronavirus. But the Chinese clearly see it as a big win for them. China already feels it’s stolen a march on us by getting its economy back up and running as early as March. The truth is, the longer America’s lockdown drags on, the better it gets for China. Our blue-state governors and the Trump-hating media have propelled the perception that we are socially and economically paralyzed by COVID-19. That has clearly emboldened Beijing to aggressively push its agenda for becoming the new superpower Colossus bestriding the world. One obvious sign of this has been Beijing’s renewal of its effort to bring Hong Kong to heel with the security law that prompted demonstrations in the streets and international outrage just a year ago. President Xi Jinping and his Communist cohorts are counting on our distraction with the COVID pandemic to prevent us from lending effective support for the protesters fighting Beijing’s ever-increasing iron grip. HELEN RALEIGH: WELCOME HONG KONG POLITICAL REFUGEES – 3 REASONS US SHOULD ACT NOW Beijing has also been stepping up pressure on nearby Taiwan, with bombers buzzing the median line between the two countries in the Taiwan Straits, while its catspaw the WHO has blocked Taiwan’s effort to share its successful anti-COVID best practices with the rest of the world. In the South China Sea, we’ve seen a bold increase in Chinese intimidation tactics against the other countries who have claims to that strategically important seaway. A Chinese military vessel recently rammed and sank a Vietnamese fishing boat, while other Chinese ships have harassed our destroyers USS Barry and Bunker Hill. The fact that the USS Theodore Roosevelt had to cut short its presence there due to the coronavirus outbreak has also played into Beijing’s hands (although Pentagon officials say the aircraft carrier will return to the South China Sea very soon). Meanwhile, Huawei, China’s stalking horse for control of the future of 5G wireless technology, has launched a charm offensive in the wake of the COVID-19, by associating itself with efforts to ship medical supplies to countries stricken by the deadly virus — the virus China let spread beyond its borders without warning, killing more than 100,000 Americans. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER What’s going on here? Clearly China is taking advantage of America’s COVID distraction and lockdown, especially as it unfolds in economically significant states like California, New York, New Jersey and Illinois. Their governors’ determination to drag out the lockdown and the loss of jobs and economic opportunity as long as possible, is only grist for Beijing’s effort to portray America as a declining power. The protracted week of riots and looting has played directly into China’s hands, as well.  It helps China to portray America as a country in decline, and to fan anti-American feeling.  The Global Times asked on Twitter if American police are “Peacekeepers or mass murderers?”  The state-controlled news Xinhua republished a New York Times article supporting the rioters—while the government in Beijing is using the disorder here to rationalize its crackdown on Hong Kong’s democracy movement. Between lockdown and riots, the liberal media and social media haven’t helped. For 10 straight weeks, they have pushed the narrative that America is on the brink of societal and economic chaos; that we are trapped with an unemployment rate higher than during the Great Depression;  and that lockdown is the only alternative to massive illness and death — even that we have to brace ourselves for a “second wave” this autumn. Chinese state media organ The Global Times has even circulated a story that Harvard researchers claim the lockdown needs to continue until 2022. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP From Hong Kong to the WHO and the South China Sea, Chinese leaders clearly feel like winners in the geopolitical competition with the United States. They would love to see the world perceive the COVID-19 crisis as a grim benchmark in America’s eclipse as a superpower. Whether they are right or not, depends on how quickly we get our economy back on its feet — and how robustly we respond to Beijing’s macroaggressions around the world. Right now, getting America back to work isn’t just good economics; it’s going to be vital to the survival of freedom around the world.

 The terrifying death of George Floyd while in the custody of Minneapolis police last week has caused mass protests around the country as people express their outrage. The hideous images captured on video for all to see will have a lasting impact on America, I pray for the better. The country is unified – regardless of skin color or political party – around the truth that Floyd’s killing and others like it are totally unacceptable in our society and we must all work together to end racially charged violence against African-Americans. Peaceful protests are constitutionally protected and must be respected. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was correct when he taught us that nonviolent gatherings send a powerful message that change is possible. The American people are in agreement that the senseless killing of Floyd, who’s been described by his brother as a gentle giant, must be protested loudly, clearly – and peacefully.  REP. ANDY BIGGS: END RIOTS, RESTORE FREEDOM – TOO MANY AIDING BAD BEHAVIOR  However, violent anarchists and America haters have upended the peaceful protests to wreak havoc on our cities from coast to coast and desecrate the memory of George Floyd. They call themselves Antifa, short for “anti-fascists,” but nothing could be further from the truth. They are misusing Floyd’s tragic death to further their goals of destruction and division in America.   As we’re all finding out, if you don’t comply with the demands of these anarchists, they’ll beat you up and burn your neighborhood to the ground. Antifa doesn’t care about Floyd; they only care about chaos, destruction and overthrowing our constitutional republic in favor of a system that only allows for the deranged freedom of expression that Antifa agrees with. In short, Antifa extremists come out of the shadows to turn peaceful protests into riots. This week President Trump showed true leadership by announcing that he was designating Antifa a terror organization.  The vast majority of Americans want this violence to stop and believe we are a compassionate nation that believes deeply in treating others how we wish to be treated, regardless of the color of our skin.   The American people deserve the facts about this terror group and the government must deliver. The peaceful message coming from Floyd’s family in the midst of their tragedy can have a calming effect on Americans and should be used as a road map forward. We can all best respect Floyd’s legacy by working harder as a people to end racism in America once and for all. It must be a priority inside police stations as well as at family dinner tables. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER There’s bipartisan agreement that there’s no place in our society for Antifa and the violence they specialize in bringing to the neighborhoods where our children live. In addition to the president’s strong actions, in 2017, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., spoke out against the “violent actions of people calling themselves Antifa.” And last year former Vice President Joe Biden condemned Antifa’s assault on a journalist by saying, “freedom of expression is fundamental to who we are as Americans, and that Andy Ngo’s attackers should be identified and investigated.” In these times of rigid partisanship, when both political parties agree on something it’s time to take bold action. The American people deserve the facts about this terror group and the government must deliver. What is its leadership structure? How do they communicate with one another to implement their violent operations? Where do they get their tools and equipment? And perhaps most importantly, who is funding their violence? Congress needs to conduct a thorough investigation, accompanied by public hearings, to shine a light on how these extremists conduct their business of terror.  Call FBI Director Christopher Wray and Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf to testify immediately about what their agencies know about Antifa.

 As violent protests sweep the nation and fury fills city streets in the wake of the murder of George Floyd, the 2020 presidential election is shaping up to be eerily similar to the 1968 campaign. In 1968, the country was grieving from the assassinations of civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, who was on the path to claiming the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination. The period preceding the 1968 election was a time of great civil unrest. There were riots across the country following Dr. King’s assassination, and the August 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago became a venue for protests against the Vietnam War — led by left-wing activist groups like Students for a Democratic Society — and culminated in a televised riot where police clashed with protesters. LIZ PEEK: GEORGE FLOYD RIOTING – BIDEN DOESN'T GET IT. IT'S THE SAFETY, STUPID As a result of that year’s civil unrest, which was also accompanied by inner Democratic Party division between the moderates and far left, Democrats embraced a more liberal foreign policy perspective while focusing mainly on social and racial justice issues, largely at the expense of economic issues. Taken together, the party’s leftward movement and the accompanying civil unrest, which was associated with the far left, helped Richard Nixon’s “Southern Strategy” prevail in the 1968 election and in 1972, when he won by a 49-state landslide. Nixon’s approach appealed to the silent majority with a promise to restore “law and order,” while the Democratic Party was viewed as too far left. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Fast forward to 2020. The year began with a presidential impeachment, followed by a pandemic that has taken over 100,000 American lives and cratered the economy, and now is undergoing widespread civil unrest and violence that many are attributing to radical left-wing groups. In the midst of these tragic riots and uncertain times, a similar hidden political opportunity exists for Trump as Nixon. On Monday, Trump described himself as the president of “law and order,” and said he was mobilizing the U.S. military to end “riots and lawlessness,” while calling the violent protests “acts of domestic terror.” Further, it is clear that Trump is taking a page out of Nixon's book to deflect attention from our economic woes and the tragedy of the pandemic, while shifting blame to Democratic states, governors and mayors for not controlling the riots and unrest. On Monday, Trump told governors on a call that they were “weak” if they did not use force against the protesters. “If you don’t dominate, you’re wasting your time,” Trump said. While the latest ABC News poll shows Biden with a 10-point lead over Trump nationally, the current unrest poses a hidden risk for Democrats of undermining their chances at the White House, especially if they fall into the trap that they did in 1968 and 1972 of not speaking out harshly enough against the disobedience, moving too far left and failing to deliver a unified economic message. Further, any attempt by Democrats to attack Trump for the human toll of his failed response to COVID-19 will ring hollow, so long as our cities are burning. The political risk to Democrats is becoming associated with the riots that have erupted in the wake of these tragedies and moving too far left in response, which would result in the party losing the White House and risking their House majority.  Make no mistake, there is no clear-minded American who was not horrified and heartbroken by the murders of George Floyd in Minnesota and Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia. However, the political risk to Democrats is becoming associated with the riots that have erupted in the wake of these tragedies and moving too far left in response, which would result in the party losing the White House and risking their House majority. In order to mitigate this risk, I propose the party follow a three-point plan. First, Democrats must emphasize unity, which involves both parties working together, not polarization and division. Second, Democrats must put forth legislation that is focused on underserved communities of color, which should be accomplished through a bold fourth stimulus bill that will get the economy moving by emphasizing business assistance and job creation. Yet, Senate Republicans have deemed the Heroes Act — a $3 trillion stimulus package that passed the House — as “dead on arrival,” given the cost and the fact that it contains what Republicans are calling a “liberal wish list.” Thus, Democrats should work to revise their fourth stimulus bill to be more moderate in cost and specifically focused on helping underserved communities and businesses. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Third, while Democrats can and should stand up for peaceful protests, they must draw a clear line at violence and civil disobedience, as well as looting, which we are seeing night after night. Further, Democrats must emphasize that violent protesters should and will be punished, and the party needs to mediate far-left voices that say otherwise. With this three-point plan, Democrats can avoid a defeat similar to 1968 and 1972. However, if Democrats move too far left while allowing riots and violence to define their party, Trump and the Republicans will, like Nixon, emerge victorious. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY DOUG SCHOEN

 The filing of charges Wednesday against four fired Minneapolis police officers indicates the wheels of justice are turning quickly to hold accountable the individuals accused of responsibility for the death of George Floyd, a black man who was handcuffed on the ground and not resisting arrest. The charges are good news for Floyd’s family and good news for our nation, though tragically nothing can bring Floyd back to life or ease the pain of his loved ones and millions of people who never knew him but have been deeply affected by his death. Americans of good faith all welcome clear signals that police brutality is being taken seriously and addressed in a productive way. ROB SMITH: GEORGE FLOYD PROTESTS AND AMERICA'S LOST BLACK BOYS AND YOUNG MEN The announcement that former officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with second-degree murder (up from an original charge of third-degree murder) and that charges of aiding and abetting second-degree murder have been filed against fired officers Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao sends such a signal. All four officers could face maximum sentences of 50 years in prison if convicted. But don’t hold your breath that these new developments in the Floyd murder case will quickly fix our broken race relations in the United States. The torturous death of Floyd has exposed a festering wound that has been lingering for some time. We must resist the temptation to put a disproportionate emphasis on a positive development in a single case. In terms of quelling the violent riots, we must remember that the perpetrators of the shameful crimes across U.S. cities in recent days were almost certainly not motivated by any sincere quest for justice in Floyd’s death. The reasons for the behavior of these lawbreakers – and their disregard for life and property – stem from far less noble impulses. Beyond that, however, the challenges of race relations on our continent have been 400 years in the making, and only through achieving long-term, consistent patterns of equal justice and opportunity can we make continued progress. On a positive note, our nation’s journey toward ensuring civil rights for all has trended in the right direction for a long time. Not long ago, many found it unimaginable that Americans would ever choose a person of color for president. And yet, in two consecutive elections we witnessed the election of a black president in a nation where three-quarters of the population is white. That can’t happen if America is a racist nation. We need to keep maturing morally and spiritually in the ways that we regard our neighbors of every racial and ethnic background. I believe that, to an overwhelming extent, most police actions involving the use of force are justified by the circumstances encountered by officers As long as there exists violent crime, however, we had best be prepared for difficult discussions anytime our police officers use lethal force – especially when that lethal force is directed against a black person. Before I became Indiana’s attorney general, I served as a county prosecutor for more than a decade. I know from experience that these incidents always prove challenging to communities. Unlike what we have seen in Minnesota, such incidents most often involve shootings. I believe that, to an overwhelming extent, most police actions involving the use of force are justified by the circumstances encountered by officers. Usually, investigations reveal that officers acted to protect themselves or others from legitimate threats to their lives. In a free society that promotes justice and accountability, police are necessary. We train our police in the reasonable use of force. We provide each officer with a badge and a gun and expect them to keep us safe even if it costs them their lives. And sometimes it does. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER When officers must use lethal force, we presume they are justified because that is the job we have asked them to do. At the same time, we always must conduct thorough investigations to confirm proper policies were followed. And whenever investigations prove officers were not justified, then they must face consequences – including arrest and prosecution when warranted. The reason that many black people harbor suspicions regarding law enforcement actions is that black lives historically have not always seemed to matter. Going back to colonial times in the 1600s, America has a long legacy of racial injustice – from the horrors of slavery to the harsh discrimination that persisted over the years that followed, including mob lynchings and other unspeakable crimes that the justice system too often ignored. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The dehumanizing segregation of Jim Crow defined the lives of black people even in the 20th century. Fairness and justice were all but absent, and the distrust that exists between blacks and “the system” in America will still take a while to overcome. Going forward, let us hope that we all can stand together as unhyphenated Americans and muster the courage to face our demons at this moment in time. The horrific death of George Floyd should never be forgotten as we continue working toward that more perfect union. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY CURTIS HILL

The White House was non-committal about Joe Biden's vow to set up a police oversight board if elected; Doug McKelway reports. George Floyd’s murder is a wakeup call to America. And now young black men are screaming the loudest that police misconduct must come to an end. The decision Wednesday to upgrade charges against fired Minneapolis policeman Derek Chauvin to second-degree murder and to charge three other officers in the murder of Floyd was a positive step forward, but much more needs to be done. Chauvin is now charged with second-degree murder, while the three other officers are charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder. All four officers could face a maximum sentence of 50 years in prison if convicted. DEROY MURDOCK: TRUMP SHOULD DELIVER OVAL OFFICE ADDRESS ON RIOTING TEARING AMERICA APART My heart breaks for the family of George Floyd. And the family of Tamir Rice. And the family of Eric Garner. And the families for all of the other unarmed black men and women whose lives have been taken by police officers. My heart also breaks for the families of the dozens of people shot and killed in Chicago and other cities every weekend in America. It also breaks for the millions of African-American babies killed every year at the hands of Planned Parenthood. And it breaks for black police officers whose lives were lost in the riots, like retired St. Louis Police Capt. David Dorn. His black life mattered, too. My heart also breaks for the lost angry, and aimless young black men who commit violent crimes. And for the lives they’ve claimed, the bones they’ve broken, and the businesses and livelihoods they’ve destroyed. The rioting, looting and violence that have convulsed cities across America over the past few days are the culmination of years of failures on all sides of the political aisle to address the issues that have now broken America in ways that seemed impossible just months ago.  Black people killed or injured by other black people are no better off than black people victimized by police officers. A black business owner whose store is destroyed by a black mob is no better off than a black business owner whose store is destroyed by the Ku Klux Klan. The images of the looting, rioting, and awful violence that have permeated our airwaves and filled our social media feeds since Floyd was killed have sickened me as well. This is simply not sustainable as a country. Contrary to popular belief, there was no talk of “both sides” when it comes to conservative and liberal perspectives on Floyd’s murder. There was no “on the one hand” and “on the other hand.” Both sides seem to agree that Floyd’s senseless killing was a gross miscarriage of justice and that the officers involved should be punished. For a brief moment after the shocking video of Floyd’s murder came to light, law-and-order conservatives and Black Lives Matter leftists agreed on something, and it looked as if some sort of reconciliation was on the horizon. Then all hell broke loose. The rioting, looting and violence that have convulsed cities across America over the past few days are the culmination of years of failures on all sides of the political aisle to address the issues that have now broken America in ways that seemed impossible just months ago. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Conservatives declare themselves the law-and-order party while turning a blind eye to the ways in which the American criminal justice system is set up to disproportionately imprison young black men. Liberals wave the specter of “white racism” as a catch-all response for the ills of the African-American community. To them racism is the only explanation that has caused so many lost young black men to lash out in society in the ways we’ve seen on our screens. The explanation of liberals is never fatherlessness. It is never the toxicity of black-oriented pop culture. It is never the near-complete destruction of the African-American family. It is only racism. Always, racism. As I put it in my forthcoming book – “Always a Soldier: Service, Sacrifice, and Coming Out as America’s Favorite Black, Gay Republican” –  “our very modern social media and entertainment culture has managed to enslave the minds of young black people all over again. Liberal gatekeepers in our entertainment and journalism fields stoke the omnipresence of white racism to keep them from achieving their fullest potential. Ultra-wealthy and successful rappers and actors feed blacks a near-constant buffet of oppression to stay relevant and line their own pockets. The constant onslaught of the message of black victimhood in the social media era keeps young blacks locked in constant struggle with their ever-present white oppressors.” Young black people are angry, hurt and afraid. They’re kept that way by a chattering class who was just weeks ago advocating for extended COVID-19 lockdowns and is now crowdfunding to bail out rioters. We have seen this country descend into record levels of unemployment due to the coronavirus lockdown. We will only be able to douse the fire when we show up for these young black men, speak to them and convince them that the only change that will truly save them will start from within. Mental health issues are skyrocketing. A therapist I spoke with says his practice is at capacity with people trying to deal with post-lockdown depression. To dismiss the effects of the months of lockdown on what is happening right now would be foolish. The young black people who are now terrorizing American cities (with more than a little help from Antifa and members of other races) are lashing out because of fear and anger, but also because every societal safeguard against the kind of sustained violence we’re now seeing was taken away during the lockdown. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Face masks are now normalized. Parks and outdoor recreational activities were closed. Almost 40 million people in our country have lost their jobs, throwing many into dire financial straits. Millions of children and young people are out of school.  To me, the defining image of this moment in history is not any of the violence, the looting, or the overall insanity. It is a short video of a black teenager so overwhelmed with emotion at a protest that he sobs as a white police officer comforts him. As I said on Twitter, multiply the pain that young man is feeling right now times one million, and that is why America is burning.

It will start when they make genuine moves to break the cycle of poverty that causes so much of their anger, pain and frustration.

 David Dorn spent his last moments on Earth bleeding to death on a sidewalk in front of a looted shop early Tuesday. He was a retired police captain in St. Louis and he was protecting a store. Dorn was 77. His death was shown on Facebook Live. He was a black man. A family man. A good man.  Black lives matter. But not to looters, rioters and agitators. Shall we blame this on systemic racism? Who shot David Dorn? Who knows? A stranger? Maybe Seth Rogan or Patton Oswalt already bailed him out. ST. LOUIS POLICE CAPTAIN KILLED BY LOOTERS AT PAWN SHOP: REPORT Dorn’s son, Brian Powell said of his father’s death: “It was senseless – over TVs, over stuff that’s replaceable. They’re forgetting the real message for the protest and the positiveness that's supposed to come out of it and we get this negative light that’s shown on a situation that really needed light to be brought to it.” Dorn’s daughter-in-law, Vanessa Powell, said: “I just hope that the person that did this that they come forth or whatever because this is just so senseless, and I’m just I’m tired of it, I’m tired.” The fact is, fealty to the mob begets only more of the mob. Redefining bloodlust as justified leads to death. And not just David Dorn's, but a country's too. A day ago was Blackout Tuesday, when virtue-signalers set their Instagrams to all black to support the protests going on around the country. What an analogy for the media. The media blacks the violence to hide their culpability. Which protects incompetent leaders, criminals and an army of cowardly journalists. Their job: keep the chaos on endless repeat.

On CNN, Chris Cuomo said: “Please, show me where it says protesters are supposed to be polite and peaceful.

 This column originally appeared in the Washington Times. Courtesy of our educational infrastructure having been transformed into leftist indoctrination centers, the result is politicians who care only about ideology where citizens are collateral damage in their march toward a leftist utopia. Our media is populated with news-actors who are similarly bound to their teachers’ idols of social justice, political correctness and identity politics. All of our institutions are suffering from the twin masters of identity politics and woke philosophy. In New York City during the riots, two individuals were arrested for attempting to bomb a marked New York Police Department cruiser with a Molotov cocktail. Upon arrest, police found additional material in the car to make more Molotov cocktails, and the booking complaint alleges they intended to hand out the bombs to other rioters. BEN SHAPIRO: GEORGE FLOYD'S DEATH, RIOTS AND THE LIBERAL MEDIA'S NONSENSICAL, DANGEROUS GAME The kicker? Both of the suspects are lawyers. One, Colinford Mattis, a 32-year-old man had been working with a corporate law firm in New York City, and is a graduate of Princeton University. The other, Urooj Rahman, a 31-year old woman, is a graduate of Fordham Law School and was admitted to the bar in 2019. On her Facebook page, she fashions herself a “human rights lawyer.” His background as an “anti-poverty intern” for a mayor of San Francisco was listed on LinkedIn, as well as being president of the Princeton Black Student Union. With such promising backgrounds and illustrious educations, we must ask, what went wrong? Education went wrong, which is a dangerous realization, considering its importance not just as a conveyer of information, but as an important and formidable influence on character and values. With the breakdown of the American family, for many, the leftist indoctrination at the academy is the only instruction on life and principles to which they’ve been exposed. On Twitter, the Federalist’s Molly Hemingway noted, “Battle lines are more clearly being drawn these days, between those who clearly believe America is irredeemably evil and must be violently overthrown and those who believe America remains greatest country on earth, based on rule of law, individual liberty, inalienable rights. Decades of public education have given former group a *huge* advantage, reinforced by media that awards itself prizes to indoctrinate message. Seriousness of that side now being impossible to ignore, however, finally forces rule of law side to realize fight must be engaged.”

       As leftists consumed public education, they accepted open-minded young people into their realm and are now vomiting them back up as heartless anarchists. The issue is not just at Ivy League institutions, it is a systemwide problem. Case in point is brought to us by the University of Alabama Birmingham (UAB). In the midst of violent rioting in dozens of cities across the United States, and on the same night rioters set fire to Washington, D.C.’s historic St. John’s Episcopal Church, Sarah Parcak, a faculty member of UAB went to Twitter encouraging people to topple a local monument she deemed a racist insult. “Ms. Parcak began coaching rioters about how to tear down monuments as networks covered the unrest in Washington on Sunday night. ‘PSA for ANYONE who might be interested in how to pull down an obelisk* safely from an Egyptologist who never ever in a million years thought this advice might come in handy,’ Ms. Parcak tweeted. She went on to fire off more than a dozen tweets demonstrating how protesters could topple obelisks …,” The Washington Times reported. As leftists consumed public education, they accepted open-minded young people into their realm and are now vomiting them back up as heartless anarchists. On Parcak’s bizarre tweet frenzy encouraging mayhem, Mark Bauerlein, the editor of First Things Magazine, a journal on religion and public life, said, “The crucial point in this maniacal tweet is that this professor has been honored by TED, the Smithsonian, and the Guggenheim,” and asked, “Many advocates of disorder now occupy elite institutions that have in the past been the guarantors of order. Who let them in?” CLICK HERE FOR THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Kyle Shideler, the director/senior analyst for homeland security and counterterrorism at the Center for Security Policy, has the most direct answer: “They took over the academy and all credentialing. The middle and lower-middle-class families in this country paid millions to let the Weather Underground raise their kids in hopes they would climb the social ladder,” as he responded on social media. A Fox News producer inquired with UAB if it had any comment about a faculty member encouraging the destruction of property and mayhem on a night when the nation was aflame in violence. UAB responded, “These are not the opinions of the university. Our 45,000+ students, faculty and staff often use social media to express thoughts that do not necessarily reflect the voice of the university. If a public comment by a member of the campus community needs to be addressed by Student Affairs or Human Resources, it would be. However, personnel and student conduct matters are addressed privately between the individual and the institution.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Whoever Mattis’ and Rahman’s professors were, they weren’t out fixing up Molotov cocktails Sunday night, but for some reason their young charges allegedly were. And Parcak was no doubt comfortable in a chair during the 10 p.m. hour on a Sunday as she was tweet-inciting others to put themselves and their futures at great risk.

 There is a big debate about designating Antifa a terrorist group and what if any steps the federal government can take to stop the rioting. But we all know who the real culprits are for turning America’s streets into a war zone: progressives and liberals. They have filled the mind of America’s youth with ideological nitroglycerine that is now exploding in our streets, while also setting the conditions that make it almost impossible to stop it. The terrible events that have unfolded in the wake of the death of George Floyd represent the systematic failure of five decades of progressivism and liberalism. The end of the progressive dream has now brought us all to the brink in three ways. DEROY MURDOCK: TRUMP SHOULD DELIVER OVAL OFFICE ADDRESS ON RIOTING TEARING AMERICA APART First, we have too many progressive mayors and governors who can’t and won’t protect their own citizens and their property and businesses — or in the case of Mayor Bill De Blasio whose own children join in the rioting. This compounds their failed COVID-19 lockdown, aka the Great Confinement, which only precipitated a severe economic contraction — a contraction the riots now threaten to plunge into economic collapse. Second, since the 1960s, progressives have foisted on us a series of social policies that they promised would give us utopia but which have turned into a perpetual nightmare for America’s inner-city residents and poorest and most vulnerable. From welfare and community policing to abortion rights and racial preferences, these policies were supposed to bring a new America based on racial harmony and equality. When that failed, progressives blamed capitalism and white privilege instead of their own incompetence and malfeasance. These progressive social experiments have been especially bad for black America. Ironically, it turns out Donald Trump has been the best friend African-Americans have had in a generation. His policies pushed black unemployment to historic lows, and even set black wages on a track to rise faster than white wages — that is, until the lockdown and riots hit. Progressives may look at the broken glass, burning businesses and desecrated churches with a desperate satisfaction. They think this will finally spell the end of Trump.  The third failure has been the constant vilification of our police and law enforcement, to the point that they became targets for assassination. Worse, progressive policies have neutered urban police departments to the point they have been rendered impotent just when they are most needed. For four decades, from "Serpico" to "Law and Order," progressives in Hollywood and the liberal media have portrayed cops as corrupt, racist and sexist brutal thugs. So the public sees incidents like the death of George Floyd as characteristic of police tactics instead of an aberration. No society can survive when its defenders are attacked as the villains and its violent enemies are treated as heroes and victims. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER All these failures have come to a head in the past week. Progressives may look at the broken glass, burning businesses and desecrated churches with a desperate satisfaction. They think this will finally spell the end of Trump. History shows they’re wrong. The radicals and progressives who sparked the riots in 1968 also thought runaway violence would topple the establishment and sweep them into power. Instead, America defended itself from anarchy by giving its vote to the declared law and order candidates in the 1968 presidential election. Together Richard Nixon and George Wallace took a total of 57 percent of the popular vote. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP America doesn’t commit suicide so easily, then or now. Our progressive politicians and ideologues have sowed the seeds of what’s happening in our streets. If they aren’t willing to help solve the problem, then they must reap the whirlwind.

 Joe Biden launched his campaign by declaring the 2020 election would be “a battle for the soul of our nation.” As bad slogans go, I gave it at a NINE on a scale of, “One to I’m With Her.” It was a straw man argument meant to characterize his opponent as a comic book villain hell-bent on destroying the nation. Hardly the stuff that woos voters who prefer substance over an imaginary job as a Marvel Avenger. But if Biden had a bad slogan then, it’s a worse slogan now when the country is literally on fire and much of the destruction has been caused by far-left groups like Antifa. LIZ PEEK: GEORGE FLOYD RIOTING – BIDEN DOESN'T GET IT. IT'S THE SAFETY, STUPID Does anyone really think the “Soul of Our Nation” belongs anywhere near a group who claims to be fighting racism by burning down minority-owned businesses? The same organized protesters who’ve looted stores, beaten owners, torched a police station, and countless police cars to go with it? St. John’s Church was founded in 1816 and played host to every president since James Madison before it was set on fire Sunday night. If you think the soul of our nation should reside with that mindset, I don’t want a hit of your smoking because chances are it’s way too strong for me. To be clear, I’m not accusing Democratic leadership of endorsing violence, nor am I saying that every Republican voter is a choir boy. But when members of the Biden campaign are bailing out protesters arrested in the Minneapolis riots, it’s hardly a show of support for the fireman who invested his life savings to open a bar only to watch it get burnt to the ground by those same “protesters.” Nor is it an economic pick me up for dozens of local businesses who were already reeling from the distress brought on by the coronavirus lockdowns. The thing that makes this moment so frustrating is that the whole country agreed on the need to bring justice for George Floyd’s death. There was no additional video context needed and zero room for debate. We were all on board with peaceful protests although I should point out that if you’re peacefully holding up a sign that says “Defund the Police,” you’re also doing so idiotically. Yes, we’re all heartbroken by what happened to George Floyd, no, we’re not all dumb enough to think we can have a society without police. Nor are we okay with seeing them attacked and killed the way we have. President Trump vowed to restore order during Monday’s address in the Rose Garden and floated the idea of invoking the 200-year-old Insurrection Act, which would allow him to mobilize the military to combat the violence. You can argue with the idea of using troops but you cannot argue with the need to maintain the rule of law after a week in which the images beamed into our living rooms have often looked less like a protest and more like a full-on societal collapse. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER For his part, Joe Biden trashed the move during Tuesday’s speech in Philadelphia and urged Congress to get to work right away on excising systemic racism. Which begs the question: if America has been plagued by decades of systemic bias, what was he doing during his 40 years in government, eight of which were spent as Vice President under our nation’s first black president? Talk about finding Jesus a little late in the service. We live in the greatest country in the world. Yet Democrats love to depict it as a giant racist hellhole, which completely ignores the enormous amount of racial progress we’ve made in the past 50 years. We’re clearly not perfect, far from It. But we’re never going to get there if we can’t even acknowledge the people who sacrificed so much to get us here. I won’t ask the Democratic Party why they continue to put the need to score political points ahead of the need to have an honest conversation. Nor will I ask why all of this chaos seems to be happening exclusively in Democratically-run cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, New York, and Minneapolis, which has been plagued by poor relations between police and black citizens for 50 years, the vast majority of which occurred under Democratic rule. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP What I will ask you, my fellow voter, is this: If the 2020 election is truly a referendum on whether or not the Democrats get to “own our soul,” shouldn’t we at least solicit a bid from the devil? Surely he’s offering a better deal than this. CLICK HERE TO GET MORE FROM JIMMY FAILLA

 In the wake of riots that have spread across America, leaving shattered businesses and wounded communities in their wake, it feels as though our nation is collapsing around us. That's bizarre, considering that virtually all Americans agree with the following two propositions: first, that it is evil for a police officer to place his knee on the neck of a prone suspect struggling to breathe for eight long minutes. Second, that breaking store windows; stealing televisions and shoes; beating business owners; attacking police officers is wrong. DEROY MURDOCK: TRUMP SHOULD DELIVER OVAL OFFICE ADDRESS ON RIOTING TEARING AMERICA APART That seeming unanimity should mean unity in the face of police brutality and rioting and looting. It doesn't. It doesn't because members of our political class have decided that instead of rallying against obvious evil, Americans must be categorized as enlightened or benighted based on their answer to one question: Was America and is America rooted in racism and bigotry? If you answer in the negative, you are complicit in racism and bigotry, say our media, academic leaders and high-ranking members of the Democratic Party. If you answer in the affirmative, you may be categorized among the woke, the aware, the sensitive and the decent. This is a nonsensical and dangerous game. But it's a game pressed forward by the most powerful messaging institutions in our society: our media, who award Pulitzer Prizes to faux history like The 1619 Project, which argues that every American institution has been fatally corrupted by America's original sin, slavery, and that every inequality of today can find its root in inequities of the past; our celebrities, who proudly proclaim that rights to free speech, property ownership and due process are merely facades for the continuing and malign maintenance of structural inequalities; and too many of our politicians, who casually attribute every instance of police brutality to deep-seated American racism. Members of our political class have decided that instead of rallying against obvious evil, Americans must be categorized as enlightened or benighted based on their answer to one question: Was America and is America rooted in racism and bigotry? These are lies. America's history is replete with racism and oppression, but that's because America didn't hold true to her founding ideals; America's philosophy is good and true, and her flaws are thanks to her failures to follow that philosophy. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER It is a lie to attack Americans' fundamental rights as outgrowths of persecution. And it's a damnable calumny to liken the treatment of black Americans in 2020 to the treatment of black Americans in 1960, let alone 1860. Yet we are told by our institutional elites that to point out these lies is to refuse responsibility, to provide cover for racism. Declaring America's most fundamental structures corrupt and cancer-ridden is deeply dangerous. Once a structure has been condemned, its foundations declared unstable, it can only be destroyed. There is no way to argue that fealty to a particular political program inside that supposedly corrupt structure can fix the problem. Former President Barack Obama, who declares that discrimination exists in "almost every institution of our lives," and that "the legacy of slavery, Jim Crow ... that's still part of our DNA that's passed on," says that voting for local officials is the solution to police brutality and individual instances of racism. Somehow, so long as we vote for the same Democratic politicians who have governed nearly every major American city for decades, America's founding sins can be extirpated. Is anyone expected to believe this? Our elites cannot set fire to the fundamentals of America and then hope to contain that fire to occasional trips to the voting booth. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP So Americans are left with a choice. We can either think of one another with charity and accuracy, acknowledging the sins of America's past while recognizing that America remains a beacon of freedom and decency. Or we can continue to follow the path of those who would tear us apart. To follow the latter course isn't sensitive or moral. It places the very existence of our common republic at risk.

 Peaceful protests in the wake of the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis have been highjacked by people with malevolent intentions. Protests are acceptable, violent attacks on people and property are not. Like me, you may be wondering why so many people are justifying rioting and looting by mobs of Marxists and anarchists intent on burning America. Many media outlets and political leaders are conflating criminally violent behavior with constitutionally protected expression. When people around the country grew increasingly frustrated with the tyrannical lockdowns imposed on America by peacefully gathering throughout the country, Leftist politicians and journalists were highly critical. They castigated people who felt victimized by government action. TOM HOMAN: MESSAGE TO ALL THE GOOD COPS OUT THERE – AMERICANS STAND WITH YOU But those who carried signs protesting the lockdowns and spoke out to try and influence their political leaders, did so in peaceful and lawful ways. Did you see any of them bashing windows of stores with bats, brutally beating people or lighting buildings on fire? No. What you might have noticed was the mainstream media failing to address the issues claimed by the COVID protesters but attacking them for not universally wearing facemasks or adequately socially distancing, or for even having the temerity to protest at all. The tragic death of George Floyd sparked concerns about race throughout the country. Many were moved to speak out and march in sympathetic protest. Those who were protesting had a legitimate cause and were exercising rights to assemble and to speak. Unfortunately, the focus of America is no longer on how to correct very real problems in our country; our focus is on whether we will continue as ”one nation under God.” Leftists and anarchists, such as Antifa, have highjacked the protests and incited rioting, wreaking murderous havoc around the country. These evil people seek the destruction of America. The crazy criminals who are attacking order, police and Americans are motivated by a philosophy that the world would be better off without the United States. The thin blue line tries to protect every person’s rights. They need to show force. They need to make arrests. They need the support of the National Guard. They need the support of political leaders.   These people are a small number of the violent mobs. They effectively use social media and Alinsky-like tactics. Saul Alinsky once said, “Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it and polarize it. Cut off the support network and isolate the target from sympathy. Go after people and not institutions. (This is cruel, but very effective. Direct, personalized criticism and ridicule works.)” At the same time, you have these Alinsky anarchists targeting police and business owners, you also have those who are simply criminals. They view these attacks on Americans as an opportunity to steal private property and greedily enrich themselves. A recent interview of a Southern California looter captured by police included an admission by the criminal that he wasn’t there to protest; he had come only to get money and stuff. We have also seen organizations put together to systematically rob stores. Then you have those who are racing out simply to be one of the “mob.” Mob activity is almost always out of control. It is people who are not restraining their emotions and allowing their adrenaline to take over. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Outrageous acts by so-called “leaders” in this country added fuel to the fire over the last week. For example, there was a directive to abandon the Minneapolis police precinct. This was the match that lit the fire of national rioting. It emboldened those with malevolent intentions to burn down that police station and carry their violence to the streets. That failure of leadership allowed meaningful protests to be rerouted to the national anarchy we see today. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Why are our political leaders acting like we have never seen this type of activity before? We need to regain control of our freedoms. The thin blue line tries to protect every person’s rights. They need to show force. They need to make arrests. They need the support of the National Guard. They need the support of political leaders. Once we have restored order, then peaceful protests and discussions can proceed. All Americans deserve to have their rights protected. But those who seek to destroy human lives and property, or loot Americans, must be caught, arrested and prosecuted. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY REP. ANDY BIGGS

 Like the rest of the nation, I was deeply disturbed by the video that captured George Floyd’s final moments. It was a terrible thing that happened. Those responsible will be held accountable based on the facts presented through a criminal justice system that is one of the best in the world. Like the rest of the nation, I have been watching television and seeing what this country is going through since that day in Minneapolis. Many people in America are making their voices heard by peaceful protests and demanding attention and change. That is just one of the things that make this country one of the greatest in the world.   However, when peaceful protests turn violent the message is lost. When protesters turn into criminals or are overshadowed by the rampant criminal activity of rioters, it is just plain wrong. LIZ PEEK: GEORGE FLOYD RIOTING – BIDEN DOESN'T GET IT. IT'S THE SAFETY, STUPID I know protesters well. When I was with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), there were many protests in front of our building in Washington, D.C.  I was third in command at one point and professionally insulted when the director issued a shelter-in-place order. I could not believe that federal law enforcement officers were expected to hide inside the building during a legal protest. What were we afraid of? In my first week as acting ICE director, appointed by President Trump, I changed that policy. I didn’t want our law enforcement officers to fear any peaceful protest. We will not hide and we will not be victimized by such demonstrations. It is America in action. I once had about 80 protesters at my home on a Sunday morning, yelling and chanting what a terrible person I was and calling for ICE and Customs and Border Protection to be abolished. I was being called a Nazi, a racist and a bigot.  Of course, I was offended because I am not any of these things, but I knew they had the right to their opinion and a right to protest. I also thought they were directing their protest at the wrong person and institutions. If they didn’t like the fact that CBP and ICE were enforcing the laws enacted by Congress, they should have been on Capitol Hill urging their elected representatives to change the laws. I have had similar feelings over the past week. Americans have the right to protest but the hate they are showing to the law enforcement officers monitoring the protests is uncalled for. Spitting on them, calling them names, shoving them, or worse, is not peaceful protest and detracts from any meaning the protest may have had. These officers were not involved in the incident in Minneapolis. They are standing there trying to keep the peace and do their jobs. They see you trying to defend our communities, our lives and our property, and they stand shoulder to shoulder with you in spirit.    Those who are using this tragedy to riot are not protesters, they are criminals. They are assaulting people, destroying property, stealing merchandise by looting and ruining the lives of innocent business owners who are trying to recover and survive after COVID-19 lockdowns pretty much devastated their businesses. There is absolutely NO JUSTIFICATION for rioting and these criminals need to be held accountable. They need to be arrested and charged. There should be zero tolerance for rioting. I agree with President Trump that we must restore law and order now with all legal means available. To the police officers around the country who are being attacked, I say, America stands with you. There may be thousands of rioters out there but there are millions of Americans who are disgusted by that behavior. They see you trying to defend our communities, our lives and our property, and they stand shoulder to shoulder with you in spirit.

Too many politicians are tying the hands of law enforcement, and not providing the resources these patriots need to do the job they have sworn to do. Some remained silent during the rioting and only spoke out when the president walked across the street from the White House to a church, which had been burned by rioters. Where is their leadership on this issue? They seem to want chaos because they think it hurts our president. I have said it many times and I will continue to say it: They hate this president more than they love this country.

At your job you strive to succeed, at their job they strive to survive.  
When you are scared you call them.   
When they are scared, they carry on.

 First they smashed the windows of police cars, and our elected leaders said nothing. It's a political protest, they told us. We stand with the protesters. Before long it grew. Mobs of menacing young men formed in the streets. They were clearly intent on violence, but no one in authority dared criticize them. DE BLASIO CALLS ON CUOMO TO APOLOGIZE TO NYPD AS PETTY FEUD CONTINUES DESPITE RIOTS We understand their frustration, our leaders told us. America is a sinful country. Their grievances are legitimate. And so the mobs grew larger, and they grew emboldened. Last Thursday, they came right to the front door of a police precinct in Minneapolis. The cops inside fled under orders from their mayor. The mob burned the building. But before they did, they looted the evidence room, and that ensured that many violent crimes will never be solved. They did this in the name of justice. Still, our leaders did nothing. Most of them never even mentioned it, like it never happened. Instead, they issued yet more statements in solidarity with the mob. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Politicians, celebrities, corporate leaders, clergy, news anchors, professional athletes -- almost every person in this country that we were raised from childhood to look up to, to respect, to listen to -- all of them sided with the people burning police stations. The mob saw this and grew stronger. On Monday night, they began shooting cops. For 38 years, David Dorn was a police officer in the City of St. Louis. No one ever accused Dorn of racism. He was black. He is dead now. He was murdered Monday night by the mob. His killing was streamed live on Facebook, and then the violence accelerated from there. In St. Louis alone, four other active duty police officers were shot Monday night. In Las Vegas, an officer took a bullet in the head. He is still in critical condition. Once the sun went down, cops all around this country found themselves under attack. How many more nights like this can we take? How many more nights like this before no one in America will serve as a police officer? It's not worth it. The people in charge hate you. The job doesn't pay enough. At that point, who will enforce the laws? Who will be in charge? Well, violent young men with guns will be in charge. They will make the rules, including the rules in your neighborhood. They will do what they want. You will do what they say. No one will stop them. You will not want to live here when that happens. Chaos is the worst thing always, and wise leaders understand that. It's obvious. But it's not obvious to Joe Biden. Biden gave a speech in Philadelphia Tuesday and was very different from the Biden of old. For years, Biden styled himself a patriot, a champion of ordinary people, but no longer. In Tuesday's speech, Biden said nothing to defend police officers being murdered. Instead, he attacked them as instruments of "systemic racism." Joe Biden, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee: The moment has come for our nation to deal with systemic racism, to deal with the growing economic inequity that exists in our nation, to deal with the denial of the promise of this nation made to so many. Our country is crying out for leadership, leadership that can unite us, leadership that brings us together. Leadership that can recognize pain and deep grief of communities that have had a knee on their neck for a long time. "The moment has come," says Joe Biden. This is the moment. So the question is, how did murdering David Dorn advance the cause of racial justice exactly? No one explains; Biden didn't. Meanwhile, Biden's staff continues to send money to the rioters. Other Democrats followed in perfect sync. How many more nights like this can we take? How many more nights like this before no one in America will serve as a police officer? It's not worth it. The people in charge hate you. The job doesn't pay enough. In the city of Seattle, Councilwoman Tammy Morales all but endorsed the destruction of her own city. Tammy Morales, Seattle councilwoman: What I don't want to hear is for our constituents to be told to be civil, not to be reactionary, to be told that looting doesn't solve anything. And you know, it does make me wonder and ask the question why looting bothers people so much more than knowing that across the country, black men and women are dying every day, and far too often at the hands of those who are sworn to protect and serve. Looting does solve things, says Tammy Morales. How dare you criticize it? Prosecutors exist to push back against violations of the law. But across the country, many prosecutors seem on board with Tammy Morales and Joe Biden. In the city of Dallas, a local report says the District Attorney John Creuzot is refusing to process rioters. That means they will automatically be freed to riot again. In Massachusetts, the state attorney general, Maura Healey, applauded the riots and did it explicitly. She described the killing and looting underway as "a once in a lifetime opportunity. Yes, America is burning, but that's how forests grow." This is the only revolution in history that's being waged not on behalf of the working class, but against them. That's a verbatim quote from the chief law enforcement officer of Massachusetts. Maura Healey is happy to see American society become mulch. It makes good fertilizer. The press isn't simply covering the riots, meanwhile, but assisting the riots. At The New York Times, the most recent Pulitzer Prize winner, 2020 winner Nikole Hannah Jones, said that words you thought you knew the meaning of now have completely different meanings. Violence, for example, when she supports it, isn't really violence. Nikole Hannah-Jones, The New York Times: Violence is when an agent of the state kneels on a man's neck until all of the life is leached out of his body. Destroying property which can be replaced is not violence and to put those things -- to use the exact same language to describe those two things, I think, really -- it's not moral. Violence is not violence if I approve of it. The person you were just listening to won the Pulitzer Prize. There's something wrong with our system if that's the person who gets the biggest merit badge. BuzzFeed, meanwhile, published a guide for rioters. It included helpful tips like this: Wear nondescript clothing, cover up tattoos, don't take photographs. CNN didn't criticize it. Needless to say, they're on board. Jim Acosta, CNN chief White House correspondent: It's so remarkable to see military-style vehicles rolling through the White House complex, you know, I mean? It's just not something that you normally see in the United States of America. It's something that you see in more authoritarian countries. Don Lemon, CNN anchor: Open your eyes, America. Open your eyes. We are teetering on a dictatorship. We are -- this is chaos. Has the president -- I am listening -- is the president declaring war on Americans? I hope that they stand up and fight for their rights. Now the entire country, according to his orders, we're living under a militarized country. He is playing a very dangerous game because this will backfire. Uh-huh.  It's dangerous when we try and stop looting and burning and killing, says Don Lemon. I hope they stand up and fight, he says from the safety of his television studio. But what exactly are they fighting for? They certainly are fighting. But why? Don't ask Don Lemon. He doesn't know -- not a reader. Something about Trump probably. What does Black Lives Matter say? Much of the rioting is being committed in their name. Go to their website if you have a minute. Here's a post from three days ago: "Defund the police." That's the position of Black Lives Matter, the most popular group in America among corporate leaders. Defund the police. No more cops. That's what they're fighting for. That seems like a fringe position, but in the Democratic Party, it isn't anymore. Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib has endorsed it as a sitting member. So has Jane Fonda, and so have many other celebrities. They said so in a recent open letter. Then three days ago, The New York Times published a piece making the same demand: "No more money for the police." No police. That's right, the article calls for the elimination of all cops and all prisons in the United States. So, if we did that, who would keep order? Well, The New York Times has an answer to that: "Rapid response, social workers would keep the peace." Alternative emergency response programs -- that's their plan. If you live in a gated community, it might sound like a good idea. You've got your own police force. You have no plans to replace them with rapid response social workers. So, you're set, no matter what happens. There aren't going to be any rapes on your street. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But what about everyone else? What's going to happen to them? Don Lemon and Rashida Tlaib don't care at all. Your neighborhood is not their problem. They're in it for the revolution, and make no mistake, it is a revolution from above, aimed downward. This is the only revolution in history that's being waged not on behalf of the working class, but against them. Adapted from Tucker Carlson's monologue from "Tucker Carlson Tonight" on June 2, 2020.

 Former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will find few allies when he testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday regarding the origins of the investigation of alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in the 2016 presidential election. Republicans will blame Rosenstein for Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) abuses and an aggressive investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller that yielded nothing of substance concerning President Trump or his campaign. Democrats will attack Rosenstein for his role in concluding that President Trump did not commit obstruction of justice and ending their dream of an indictment. ROD ROSENSTEIN TESTIFYING ON CAPITOL HILL WEDNESDAY ABOUT RUSSIA PROBE: WHAT TO KNOW Neither of these two views captures the complex reality of Rosenstein’s tenure. In reality, Rosenstein’s decisions helped preserve the integrity of the Justice Department while protecting President Trump from FBI leadership gone rogue and Democrats hell-bent on removing the president from office. Upon Rosenstein’s confirmation in April 2017, the Justice Department was at the center of a storm unprecedented in its history. Since Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself the previous month from the Russia collusion investigation, upon confirmation Rosenstein became acting attorney general for a federal investigation that received enormous news coverage. At that point, the investigation itself was being conducted by the FBI under the leadership of Director James Comey, who repeatedly kept Obama administration Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Acting Attorney General Sally Yates in the dark about his machinations. To make matters worse, the Justice Department was largely devoid of political appointees in the early days of the Trump administration. Interviews with potential new U.S. attorneys had not begun and the assistant attorney general for the National Security Division was a year away from confirmation. This latter point is key. The lack of a Senate-confirmed assistant attorney general for the National Security Division meant that Rosenstein was approving FISA applications in addition to his job of managing the Justice Department. As does everyone in senior management positions, Rosenstein relied on supposedly competent and trustworthy people to brief him – and that is likely one of the reasons why he agreed to approve the extension of the FISA warrant on Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page. It didn’t take Rosenstein long to learn that Comey’s insubordinate behavior would not be limited to Lynch and Yates. When Comey testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 3, 2017, senior staff at the Justice Department were floored by his unwillingness to admit that his decisions in 2016 were misguided. The next week Comey was fired, and Rosenstein’s views were clearly laid out in a memo to Attorney General Sessions. Things did not improve with Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe. Following the termination of Comey, McCabe opened an investigation into Trump without Rosenstein’s input. In fact, it appeared that McCabe and others at the FBI were of the opinion that Rosenstein was complicit in obstruction of justice. With the Russia investigation now spiraling out of control, Rosenstein had to make a decision. He could shut down an investigation that, at that point, he had no basis to think might not be fully on the level. Had he done that, when Democrats took control of the House in 2018 they would have had all the ammunition to cook up the kind of impeachment that would actually have had a chance for bipartisan support and possible removal of the president. Another option was to let McCabe and friends use the power of the FBI to get a president removed. That was a non-starter. The third option would have been to assign a U.S. attorney to supervise the investigation, but with no Trump-nominated U.S. attorneys on board, Rosenstein clearly wasn’t comfortable with this option, nor should he have been. Therefore, Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller as special counsel to take over the investigation, which was completed far quicker than other high-profile independent investigations. This was probably Rosenstein’s best option, yet it was obviously not without its own problems. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER As we learned later, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, and Andrew Weissman should not have been on the Mueller team. Aggressive tactics to flip the likes of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos – though standard fare for prosecutors in all manner of cases – upended lives to investigate a president who turned out to be innocent. And of course, President Trump had to deal with close to two years of leaks, fake news and Democrats salivating for his removal. Rosenstein’s legacy is far more complex than what his detractors will claim. His motivation was to preserve the integrity of the Justice Department, part of which included protecting the president by taking the investigation out of the hands of a severely compromised Andrew McCabe. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP This also had the effect of House Democrats putting all their faith in the Mueller investigation, which completely backfired and ended their drive to remove President Trump from office over their collusion fantasies. While Trump was impeached by the House, he was acquitted in his trial in the Senate. Faced with limited options and the world watching, Rosenstein made the best decisions he could. Those decisions may not have made Republicans or Democrats happy, but that was never his job. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY IAN PRIOR

 With the invisible threat of a virus and the all-too-visible scar of urban riots, there is little bandwidth among the commentariat to report on the precarious state of a key part of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). This is understandable, but unfortunate. Long after we have a coronavirus vaccine and our cities are once again at peace, the potential for the misuse of this law could still shadow the freedoms of every American. Why does FISA have the potential to unravel? It primarily stems from over six months of continued revelations about misconduct by the FBI, Justice Department and associated political actors. ROD ROSENSTEIN TESTIFYING ON CAPITOL HILL WEDNESDAY ABOUT RUSSIA PROBE: WHAT TO KNOW Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s report detailed the FBI’s errors of omission and commission (including a doctored document in sworn testimony to the FISA Court denying my assistance to the CIA). Horowitz next documented that 29 FISA applications out of a sample of 29 were flawed. Finally, came the revelations that the FBI invented a criminal predicate to lure National Security Adviser Michael Flynn into a meaningless legal trap. In doing so, the FBI greatly exceeded its authority while second-guessing President Trump about the fitness of Flynn to serve in his position. Former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who helped lead the charge on much of what has happened during these fateful years that followed, will testify Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, chaired by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. No doubt Graham will have many questions for Rosenstein. Many other Americans, including me, have countless questions as well. What was Rosenstein thinking when he approved the fourth and final of my FISA warrants, after so many of the lies that precipitated this fiasco had already been debunked? How did that application manage to elide all the exculpatory evidence the FBI held about me and other supporters of President Trump? Did the bureau lie to Rosenstein as well, or was he somehow complicit? When Rosenstein faces tough questioning in the committee room, he will have to think quickly on his feet as many members of the Senate express their outrage and concern. Thanks to Rosenstein, I know what that feels like. I have little doubt, however, that Rosenstein – accomplished lawyer that he is – will manage to once again say a lot and nothing at the same time. I expect no bombshell revelations. These continued realities underscore the wisdom of President Trump’s recent tweet that stopped the reauthorization of a major FISA provision cold. Section 215, known as the business record provision, allows the FBI to snoop without a warrant on any information we give to businesses – from video on a doorbell camera, to your search history and web-browsing data. In recent months, an odd-fellows coalition of progressives and conservatives rebelled against this state of affairs. When the leadership of both houses of Congress initially tried to tamp down debate, it sparked a revolt by these reformers. Conservative and liberal stalwarts – Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah and Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont – enlisted a legal expert in privacy law with a high-level security clearance to examine applications to surveil political campaigns, officeholders, religious and media organizations. That measure passed 77 to 19 in the Senate. The House was on the verge of passing another measure, favored by a similar left-right coalition, to protect Americans’ online search histories and web browsing data when President Trump upended the whole thing with a tweet that promised to veto this reauthorization altogether. The president’s calculation seems to be precisely the crowbar needed here, rather than a scalpel. Those who support the U.S. Constitution and the civil liberties of all Americans are right to demand that Washington should wait until there is a full accounting of the abuse of FISA from 2016 to 2017 before even considering the reauthorization of any part of FISA. With a large number of progressive critics of the surveillance state finding common ground with both the White House and many Republicans, there is an appetite now to allow FISA authorities to continue to expire. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Building upon the brave moves by former acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell, a few guardians of civil liberties within the federal bureaucracy have begun taking further important steps to declassify a range of essential documents. After countless decades of limited accountability, these important measures have sparked a new movement toward unprecedented levels of transparency in the national security state. The reformers’ strategic goal is clear. Before any FISA authority can be reauthorized, we must document how the law was used to foment a soft coup against an American president, radically disrupting the smooth transition of power for the first time in our nation’s history. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Having signed that final false warrant against me in June 2017, Rosenstein has a chance to serve his country by finally coming clean. Over the coming months, federal prosecutor John Durham and other authorities in the Justice Department can follow up with the ongoing investigations. By answering many unanswered questions about this FBI and DOJ abuse, this will mark an essential next step towards bringing any perpetrators to justice. Only then can we think about restoring confidence in a broken system, rebuilding FISA from the ground up, including with sensible provisions like those back by Sens. Lee and Leahy and the online privacy reforms.

 President Trump has promised to quell the violent attack on our country, and said: “Where there is no safety, there is no future.” He is correct. Never before in our country’s history have our elected officials – officials who have taken an oath to uphold our laws and pledged to keep us safe – stood aside and let rioters destroy our communities. It is unconscionable, it is reckless and it will be very, very costly to repair. In a “virtual roundtable” with several Democrat mayors of cities under siege, Joe Biden said he believed the terrible death of George Floyd, captured on a video seen by millions, was a turning point for the nation. “The blinders have been taken off”, the presumptive Democrat nominee said, “People are ready for real institutional change.” BISHOP T.D. JAKES: RACE AND POLICING – CHURCH LEADERS MUST DRIVE NATIONAL CONVERSATION, ACTION PLAN The former vice president, somewhat scrambled by his habitual word salad, appeared to suggest that tackling “systemic racism” would require that, among other things, minority communities be given better access to capital with which to start businesses; further on in his comments he stressed the importance of small businesses. Yes, investment in minority communities is essential to their prosperity; it is also impossible without firm law enforcement. History tells us so. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER That’s why the tragedy is not that luxury stores on Rodeo Drive or Madison Avenue are being vandalized and Louis Vuitton handbags carried off by greedy criminals, though those acts are despicable. The tragedy is that poor black neighborhoods, already ravaged by COVID-19, have been ransacked, destroying stores, livelihoods and dreams. The former can and will be rebuilt; the latter may never recover. A look back at Ferguson, Mo., where riots broke out in 2014 because of the fatal cop shooting of Michael Brown, suggests just how tough rebuilding can be. The Wall Street Journal reported last summer on the fifth anniversary of those protests that unemployment in the St. Louis suburb was 5.5 percent compared to 3.3 percent in St. Louis County, while the poverty rate was 23 percent, compared to 10 percent in the region. Crime in the city is higher than in most neighboring towns and worse than in 90 percent of other U.S. cities.  Small-business revenue in the community, five years out, was down by roughly 50 percent. And that is in spite of considerable new investment in Ferguson. A devastated block of West Florissant Avenue, where the unarmed teen was shot, now hosts a new $12 million Boys and Girls Club, and the Urban League built a job training center on another burned-out block. But the bulk of new investment has gone into wealthier white neighborhoods. The Washington Post reported in 2018, “Of the more than $36 million in bricks-and-mortar development that poured into the city after 2014, only $2.4 million … has directly benefited this isolated [poor] pocket of Ferguson …” Nobody will invest in neighborhoods, or cities for that matter, unless local authorities can guarantee protection from the kind of wanton destruction we have seen in recent days. And people will not move into those areas unless they feel safe.  The Post claimed this was the result of a “corporate mindset willing to take on only so much risk.” Yes, investors will not build in a community still viewed as unsafe. The Watts area of Los Angeles has a similar history. The 1965 riots that took place in that California neighborhood over six days claimed 34 lives, injured over 1,000 people and destroyed $40 million in property. The mostly black community is now mostly Hispanic, but the stats some 50 years later, stayed depressingly constant. According to the Los Angeles Daily News, writing in 2015, “The median household income is about $28,700 versus $56,266 for L.A. County households … Less than half of Watts residents over 25 graduated from high school versus 76 percent in L.A. County. And while nearly 60 percent of the neighborhood’s population is eligible to be in the labor force, only half that is participating in it ...” Like Ferguson, Watts saw a sizable inflow of capital and building after the riots devastated the city. Numerous organizations, including Bank of America and Charles Drew University, invested in Watts, but “urban renewal did not materialize,” as one local authority noted. Ongoing gang and street violence have stifled progress. Nobody will invest in neighborhoods, or cities for that matter, unless local authorities can guarantee protection from the kind of wanton destruction we have seen in recent days. And people will not move into those areas unless they feel safe. The task ahead is momentous. Poor and rich neighborhoods across the country have been destroyed; the damage will cost billions of dollars to repair. This wreckage comes on top of the calamity of COVID-19, which had already pummeled economic activity and crushed job growth. Our cities, just recently thought to hold the future, could be in trouble. Many have started to question the assumption that young people will inevitably choose urban living. That trend had been underway, denoted by data points like fewer college graduates learning to drive and sinking suburban real estate prices. But now, young people are witnessing the downside of city living: because of the coronavirus, cities appear less healthy and the George Floyd riots have made them appear less safe. Mayors will inevitably raise taxes to plug deficits and to begin the clean-up, boosting the already high cost of living. These are dangerous trends, which could bring cities to their knees overnight. The hardship will not be evenly distributed. Most likely, the prosperous sections of Manhattan and Beverly Hills will be cleaned up within months. But minority communities in Minneapolis or Los Angeles may never fully recover, and especially if the Democrat leaders in those cities continue to dumb down law enforcement and refuse to guarantee safety.

 President Trump should wield one of the biggest wrenches in his toolbox and do so with all deliberate speed. He should address his fellow Americans from the Oval Office on the burning and looting that are tearing this republic to pieces. The president spoke Monday evening from the Rose Garden. “The biggest victims of the rioting are peace-loving citizens in our poorest communities, and as their president, I will fight to keep them safe,” Trump said. “I will fight to protect you. I am your president of law and order, and an ally of all peaceful protesters.” His welcome comments offered much of the strength that has been scarce in this emergency. But he should speak in greater depth and for more than seven minutes from the pilot’s seat of the presidency: the commander-in-chief’s chair behind the Resolute Desk in the cockpit that is the Oval Office. HANNITY CALLS OUT CUOMO, DE BLASIO OVER RIOTS: 'YOUR POLICE ARE UNDER ATTACK IN YOUR STATE AND YOUR CITY' The president should ask the major broadcast networks and the major news channels for time to speak before the East Coast goes dark. Dusk unleashes the thieves and thugs who have converted legitimate protests into a devastating free-for-all. If these major media organizations – many of which earlier accused the president of staying silent throughout this crisis – air his remarks, he can rally the entire American people, who seek his guidance. Conversely, if liberal media outlets silence the president as he works to unify this country, they will deserve scorn for censoring America’s leader exactly when his leadership is most needed. Trump’s remarks Monday centered on his potential deployment of the U.S. military to help squelch the mayhem taking place across the country under the Insurrection Act of 1807. As Washington Post columnist Marc Thiessen exquisitely detailed on Fox News’ “America’s Newsroom” Tuesday, 11 presidents have harnessed this power, including Republican Ulysses S. Grant to suppress the KKK, and Democrats FDR, JFK and LBJ to quell riots in, respectively, Detroit; Oxford, Miss.; and Washington. Beyond that realm, the president should echo his beautiful and appropriate words from Cape Canaveral on Saturday, after SpaceX’s successful, private, manned rocket launch. Trump’s moving remarks remain disturbingly underreported by journalists who accuse him of not speaking up and then ignore him when he talks. Here is a portion of the president’s observations Saturday: “The death of George Floyd on the streets of Minneapolis was a grave tragedy. It should never have happened. It has filled Americans all over the country with horror, anger and grief. “Yesterday, I spoke to George’s family and expressed the sorrow of our entire nation for their loss. I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace. And I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace. Healing, not hatred; justice, not chaos are the mission at hand. “The police officers involved in this incident have been fired from their jobs. One officer has already been arrested and charged with murder. State and federal authorities are carrying out an investigation to see what further charges may be warranted, including against, sadly, the other three. “In addition, my administration has opened a civil rights investigation, and I have asked the attorney general and the Justice Department to expedite it. “I understand the pain that people are feeling. We support the right of peaceful protesters, and we hear their pleas. But what we are now seeing on the streets of our cities has nothing to do with justice or with peace. “The memory of George Floyd is being dishonored by rioters, looters and anarchists. The violence and vandalism is being led by Antifa and other radical left-wing groups who are terrorizing the innocent, destroying jobs, hurting businesses and burning down buildings. “The main victims of this horrible, horrible situation are the citizens who live in these once lovely communities. The mobs are devastating the life’s work of good people and destroying their dreams. Right now, America needs creation, not destruction; cooperation, not contempt; security, not anarchy. “And there will be no anarchy. Civilization must be cherished, defended, and protected. The voices of law-abiding citizens must be heard, and heard very loudly. “We cannot and must not allow a small group of criminals and vandals to wreck our cities and lay waste to our communities. We must defend the rights of every citizen to live without violence, prejudice or fear. “It does not serve the interests of justice or any citizen of any race, color, or creed for the government to give into anarchy, abandon police precincts, or allow communities to be burned to the ground. It won’t happen. “Those making excuses or justifications for violence are not helping the downtrodden, but delivering new anguish and new pain.” President Trump also should honor Americans for their exemplary responses to this catastrophe. He should highlight the scrubs-clad nurse in Brooklyn who stood between cops and protesters and pleaded for peace. Trump should celebrate the Minneapolis residents who swept up the rubble of their ruined city – Step One in rebuilding. The president should spotlight the more than 36,000 individuals who, as of early Wednesday morning, donated nearly $1.1 million to Korboi Balla via GoFundMe. This black Minneapolis firefighter, husband and father of four plowed his life savings into Scores Sports Bar. Rather than enjoy its grand opening on Monday, looters on Friday broke in, stole everything, and then turned the unborn establishment into ashes. Balla sought $100,000. He now has almost 11 times that to resurrect his American Dream, thanks to the love, good wishes and generosity of total strangers. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER President Trump also should present evidence of Antifa’s role in this bedlam. He should expose this hideous drama’s villains. Trump should cleave these domestic terrorists from George Floyd, whose lifeless body they defile as a human shield to perpetrate their nihilistic, far-left evil. The president should remind Americans of the relevant actions by the Justice Department and FBI to reduce police brutality and promote respectful policing. He should ask Americans to nominate outstanding cops and police departments for a new Presidential Medal of Law and Justice. Likewise, Trump should make the rogue cops who tarnish their badges infamous. The president should discuss Opportunity Zones, school choice, his stalwart support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and the all-time-low black unemployment on his watch before the coronavirus pandemic. He should state that black progress, along with the overall post-COVID-19 recovery, is an objective that all Americans proudly should share.

 New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio are among President Trump’s harshest critics. But their long-running feud with each other erupted with volcanic force Tuesday over the rioting that is tearing apart the city. Elected officials need to work together to quell the violence and looting that have broken out around the nation in response to the horrific killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis May 25. But Cuomo and de Blasio seem unable to stop quarreling with each other long enough to concentrate on protecting the residents of America’s most populous city. Cuomo – with justification – on Tuesday blasted de Blasio‘s ineffective response to securing Gotham. Yet at the same time, Cuomo declined an earnest offer by President Trump to provide federal assistance to deal with rioting sparked by the killing of Floyd, a black man who died as white police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on top of him for over eight minutes, ignoring Floyd’s desperate cries that he couldn’t breathe. NYPD COMMISSIONER BLASTS CUOMO'S 'DISGRACEFUL COMMENT' ABOUT RIOTS, SAYS POLICE NEED 'FEWER PRESS CONFERENCES' Chauvin has been arrested and charged with manslaughter and third-degree murder. Peaceful demonstrations against police killings of unarmed black Americans have been held in many cities around the nation since Floyd’s death, but many have devolved into rioting after dark, including in New York City. "The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night," Cuomo said Tuesday. "You have 38,000 NYPD people, it is the largest police department in the United States of America," Cuomo said. "Use 38,000 people and protect property. Use the police, protect property and people. Look at the videos, it was a disgrace." New York City Police Commissioner Dermot Shea – a member of the de Blasio administration – attacked Cuomo’s comments later in the day in an interview with Neil Cavuto of Fox News. "Any comments placing the blame for where we are, on the situation, on the backs of the men and women of this police department that are putting their lives on the line, Neil, I think is disgraceful and [they] should be ashamed of themselves," Shea told "Your World.” "There is politics and there is what is right and that is a disgraceful comment."  Then Cuomo senior adviser Richard Azzopardi responded with a statement that said: "The Governor has always said he has respect and confidence in the NYPD and he knows they can handle this situation because he has seen them do it in the past. It's not the men and women of the NYPD – he questions the management and deployment of the NYPD and believes the Mayor should put more NYPD officers on the streets to do their job.” At this point, no one cares whether de Blasio or Cuomo comes out looking better and having a better shot a running for president in four or eight years In his comments earlier in the day, Cuomo discussed his “option is to displace the mayor ... bring in the National Guard" and essentially "take over." However, he said, "I don't think we're at that point." The governor also said: “You know how you stopped looting and rioting in the past? Do that again.” Actually, it was only Rudy Giuliani, who was mayor of New York City from 1994 to 2001, who knew how to control riots. He made it clear that he would not tolerate lawbreaking and violence. Other mayors have failed to do what Giuliani did. I know through personal experience. My father was a hardworking owner of a small appliance store in Brooklyn. His store – his life’s work – was torched to the ground in the blackout of 1977. It was the first and only time I ever saw my father cry. His life was never the same and he died a few years later from what I believe was the stress of the traumatic destruction of his livelihood. The 1977 rioting wasn’t a reaction to police brutality or any other ideological motivation. It was greed, pure and simple. The lights went out in a massive blackout and it was an opportunity for the criminal element to start looting to get free stuff.  The looters pounced. The cops watched. The same thing has happened in numerous cities throughout the nation since Floyd was killed.  In one disgraceful situation in Minneapolis, the police – under orders of the mayor – actually abandoned their precinct to the mob, thereby sending a message that law enforcement simply could not provide an adequate level of safety to the public. The chaos in New York state is not confined to New York City. It was exemplified by a woman in Rochester trying to prevent looters from ransacking the store located below her apartment. She was severely beaten with two-by-fours and metal clubs by eight looters. Her husband was beaten when he tried to come to her aid, armed with only a golf club. If Cuomo can’t stop violent attacks in Rochester, and if de Blasio can’t stop police getting hit in the head with bricks in New York City, then why not seek the help of the federal government? There is no justification for refusing President Trump’s offer of federal assistance. Wouldn’t it be marvelous if these two feuding Democrats teamed together to reach out to a Republican president and in unison to helped put down the anarchy taking over New York City? Tensions between Cuomo and de Blasio have been simmering since de Blasio took office in 2014. They’ve fought over issues dealing with schools, the minimum wage, repairing the city’s subway system, and most recently responding to the coronavirus pandemic. Both Democrats are eager to promote themselves. De Blasio made a short-lived run for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination that never got any traction, and Cuomo is seen by many as a possible presidential contender in the future. Some Republicans might want to just sit back and eat popcorn as these two Democratic behemoths destroy each other. But as we’ve seen over the last few months as they’ve quarreled over the right response to the coronavirus pandemic, their battle with each other can have enormous consequences. Now the riots in New York City are making it more important than ever for Cuomo and de Blasio to stop fighting with each and work together to protect the safety of the people they were elected to serve.  No one is amused by this feud any longer. One day the mayor is rhetorically backing the police and the next day he is disciplining them for understandably using their tasers or pulling out their guns as they get attacked with bricks that could prove fatal. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER The governor criticizes the mayor for allowing things to get out of hand without providing any leadership on his end. But would Cuomo really support Giuliani‘s style of overwhelming force to subdue anarchists? Hard to believe when he just criticized the cops’ defensive actions as “exacerbating the anger” of the protesters. Cuomo’s only answer was to shoo away an offer by President Trump to provide additional security. This wasn’t “New York tough” – a phrase Cuomo loves to use. It ought to be called “New York dumb.”  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP At this point, no one cares whether de Blasio or Cuomo comes out looking better and having a better shot a running for president in four or eight years. We’re just tired of them playing politics. New Yorkers simply want Cuomo and de Blasio to do their jobs and work together to stop the destruction of our city and the violence that’s been perpetrated against police and business owners throughout the state.

 There was another night of looting Monday. But what’s the media’s priority? Criticizing President Trump, of course. CNN anchors and reporters had plenty to say about the president. Anderson Cooper said of Trump: “He calls them [rioters] thugs? Who is the thug here? Hiding in a bunker, hiding behind a suit?” Don Lemon said: “We are teetering on a dictatorship. Is the president declaring war on Americans? What is happening here?” NYPD COMMISSIONER BLASTS CUOMO'S 'DISGRACEFUL COMMENT' ABOUT RIOTS, SAYS POLICE NEED 'FEWER PRESS CONFERENCES'  Chris Cuomo said: “The president had been saying incendiary things, certainly if you've been listening with any kind of open-mindedness, certainly not helpful things.” And CNN White House reporter Jim Acosta said of the president: “He's all but calling on authorities to crack skulls at these protests. It's not something you normally see in the United States of America. It’s something you see in more authoritarian countries.” Amazing. Meanwhile, the headline on an editorial in The New York Times reads: "America's Protests Won't Stop Until Police Brutality Does." Meaning, they hope this could go on forever. One of The New York Times scribes chides New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio for being too pro-police. Meanwhile, New York City burns. Stores are looted. Cops are beaten and people are beaten too. The New York media, by sticking to their narrative that we deserve punishment, reject protecting our citizens. They mock the need for military intervention. People have families, relatives and spouses who work at night. When our leaders believe this mayhem is inevitable, even necessary, then who protects us now? CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Still, others blame President Trump. Now, I watched the streets of my home destroyed. It wasn't done by Trump. It was criminals who knew the "light touch" of impotent leaders allows for ruin. And how is it Trump’s fault that a cop killed a defenseless man in a liberal town helmed by liberal politicians? It’s not, but the media says the opposite. Its why, when you say that everyone is in agreement over the death of George Floyd – including Trump – they say that’s not enough. Which tells you, again, that they want no end to the violence. They want to burn it all down. "They" being radicals on the street, in faculty lounges, in government. And the minority shopkeepers are paying the price. The minority owners of restaurants are paying the price. Minorities, in general, always pay the price. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The only ones not paying any price are the media.

 Six nights of violent riots and looting in America's major cities, following the horrific death of George Floyd last week, have gripped the nation. The liberal news media wants to ignore the depth of the violence and the forces causing the violence. They want to simply rerun their permanent refrain that this is all about racism (see the Washington Post story that “Racial inequality in Minneapolis is Among the Worst in the Nation” as an example). The news media will resist deeply the idea that Antifa is a factor and that the violence is designed to hurt America. JIM HANSON: TRUMP'S ANTIFA DECLARATION – THIS IS HOW IT HELPS US FIGHT BACK The depth of hostility to President Trump was never clearer than in the hostile media coverage of Monday’s Rose Garden speech and the subsequent visit to St. John’s Episcopal Church. Here was the president of the United States speaking after six nights of riots, which had spread across the country and were becoming increasingly violent. In any past crisis that I am aware of, the news media would have covered the speech and allowed the American people to judge its meaning. CNN, the ultimate anti-Trump network, set a new standard for hostile coverage by running a split-screen showing the Secret Service clearing Lafayette Square ahead of the president. What we are witnessing is part of a continuing war against America. Whatever the president was trying to accomplish in what was a serious, powerful speech announcing a substantial increase in response to the attacks on America, CNN guaranteed that its viewers would be more unnerved by the action in the park rather than reassured by the tough decisions the president was making. Then, the president’s visit to the historic 1816 church, which had been partly set on fire by looters the night before and has been visited by every president since Madison, became another media controversy. The war between the media and President Trump is weakening America almost as much as the war of Antifa and its allies against America. For America to succeed, we must win this argument. What we are witnessing is part of a continuing war against America. First, demonstrators have every right to peacefully protest Floyd's death. His death was horrifying, and the policemen involved will have to stand trial for his death. However, people engaged in violence are not demonstrators – and given the scale of their violence and destruction, they are not just angry people expressing their frustration. The scale of violence and the number of cities being attacked is a war against America. If we saw this level of violence by an attack from ISIS or Al Qaeda, we would understand that we are engaged in an act of war. This is an act of civil war, and the enemies of American civilization have to be defeated decisively and permanently. Furthermore, every American of every political belief must be protected by the government against this kind of violence and destruction. We need a decisive engagement to enforce safety on the streets, and then we need a deep commitment to track down the funders, organizers, and activists who fomented violence against America. Every person will have to choose between defending America and defending those who would destroy America. Author and legal expert Andrew McCarthy captured it well when he wrote: “Anti-America must be made to understand that America has had enough.” McCarthy noted that the federal government has had the power to step in against insurrection and sedition since, “the Insurrection Act of 1807, which empowers the president ‘to suppress, in any State, any insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination, or conspiracy.’” That Insurrection Act was strengthened during the Civil War and again after 9/11. Mark Halperin captured the depth of this war against America today when he wrote in his newsletter: “America’s Second Civil War started way before the death of George Floyd, way before the start of the pandemic, and way before the election of Donald Trump. “About the biggest mistake we can make is to think that what is happening now represents the outbreak of America’s Second Civil War. This is in fact simply the bloodiest battle to date in a long-running, existential conflict.” Halperin is right about the present but wrong about its size compared to past attacks on America. The battles from 1967-1972 were much bigger and more savage than anything we have seen so far. In an 18-month period from 1971 to 1972, there were an estimated 2,500 bombings, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The anti-Americans of that era were only defeated by the systematic application of the FBI and other organizations dedicated to defending civilization against its enemies. Now we face a similar challenge in a somewhat different form. Here are some questions and suggestions for dealing with the current generation of violent anti-Americans. 1. What are all the organizations involved in advocating violence? Antifa is the top of a network of activist groups engaged in sedition, but there are a lot of other seemingly random groups. 2. Who is funding all this activity? Antifa has a real network. We know the Soviets funded the peace movement in the 1980s and the terrorist groups in Western Europe in the 1970s and 1980s. What online efforts and other activities are our foreign opponents using to help spread and sustain the internal war against America? What about those on the left who believe Antifa is innocent? Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison’s son, who is a Minneapolis city councilman, just endorsed Antifa in response to President Trump declaring it a terrorist organization. He said white supremacists were causing all the trouble – that charge must be totally explored. 3. Given the sheer volume of video and other photographs, it should be possible to hunt down a wide number of people who committed acts of violence. They should be arrested and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. 4. During a period of mass violence, there should be no bail allowed for those arrested for participating in the violence. The first goal is to dry up the number of people who are committed to violence. Arresting and releasing them actually increases the confidence of the violent offenders, because it leads them to believe they can get away with it. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER 5. Every decision must have a public information component at its core. It is impossible to understand how Minneapolis could have allowed a police station to be abandoned. How did officials not understand it would be a signal to the anti-Americans that they were winning and the defenders of civilization were losing their nerve. 6. Since the government failed to protect the innocent and their property, there should be an immediate announcement that damage from the terrorists will be treated as a national emergency comparable to a hurricane, earthquake, forest fire, or flood. The Federal Emergency Management Agency should immediately move to help reopen stores, rebuild homes, and reestablish community buildings. With many small businesses already weakened by the COVID-driven shutdown, they simply don’t have the resources to rebuild. If entire neighborhoods collapse with no stores and no jobs, then the anti-Americans will have planted the seeds for even more disillusioned people to join their movement. 7. When faced with a threatened anti-American mob with a high potential for violence and property destruction, the streets should be flooded with the forces of civilization. If on the first night, the city of Minneapolis and the state of Minnesota had fielded the 13,000-member National Guard there would have been no violence. When you don’t know how effective, prepared, or numerous your enemy may be, you take your best guess about how much force you will need – and then multiply by three to five, so you can overwhelm the opposition. 8. Massive strength leads to the smallest loss of life and the least property damage. It also discourages others from joining the violent faction. It is astonishing that people have been violent with impunity in New York City, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, and elsewhere without being met with overwhelming force. If the city can’t cope, the state has to step in. If the state can’t cope, the federal government has to step in. Every day this violence continues further weakens America at home and around the world. 9. Modern technologies must be brought to bear. Because these are acts of violence against our civilization and are being classed as terrorism, there ought to be an ability to track cell phones belonging to radical elements and see how many of them have crossed state lines and moved from violent outburst to violent outburst. Much more must be done to communicate the scale of the violence that is occurring. Local media is vivid but national media simply isn’t capable of gathering and organizing the information. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP An important step is to have a briefing in which the secretary of homeland security or someone comparable simply outlines city-by-city how much damage the anti-American effort has caused in less than a week.

 A bevy of bloggers on the right have highlighted one of the most dramatic examples of comparative coronavirus bias: those reckless Southern Republican governors in Georgia or Florida, who allegedly love commerce more than human lives, versus New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, our apparent national lodestar of competence. The Republicans get the heat; Cuomo gets press conferences broadcast live across the country as celebrities confess their Cuomo crushes. The Republicans are "dangerous," and Cuomo gets to joke around with his brother, the CNN host. This tilt is not only in the "objective" press but also in the prestige brands in opinion journalism. Take The Atlantic, which made a dramatic turn by endorsing Hillary Clinton in 2016. In a big NPR story, this was celebrated as rare and historic. Their loathing of Donald Trump never fades. VAN GORDON SAUTER, EX-CBS NEWS PRESIDENT: 'LIBERAL LEANING' MEDIA PASSES ITS TIPPING POINT The Atlantic drew major heat for an April 29 article written by Amanda Mull that trashed Gov. Brian Kemp, titled "Georgia's Experiment in Human Sacrifice: The state is about to find out how many people need to lose their lives to shore up the economy." This article was also celebrated with a story on NPR. Mull took credit for the headline and insisted it was accurate. "I think that working-class Georgians, a group that is largely people of color, are being sacrificed to the state's economy, largely," she says. But Georgia's reopening made The Atlantic look foolish. Coronavirus cases and deaths didn't surge. They declined. Mull wrote another article, headlined "The Horror of the Coronavirus Data Lag: Some reopening states are already claiming victory over the coronavirus. But the real consequences won't be clear for weeks," in which she insisted it was too early for apologies. Keep hope alive, Amanda. Just look at the numbers. As of May 26, Georgia's death count was 1,853. By contrast, New York's was 29,241. So is it science or politics that causes Brooklyn-based Amanda Mull and all her New York media brethren to kvetch at Kemp and coddle Cuomo? Facts aren't first? Now try to find an example of The Atlantic holding Cuomo accountable for anything. Molly Jong-Fast wrote an article headlined "The New New York Will Be Better." There's no hot talk of "Experiments in Human Sacrifice," just more trashing of Republicans. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER "As anyone who listens to Gov. Andrew Cuomo's daily updates knows, the state's finances are in bad shape, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell seems disinclined to help," Jong-Fast declared. "It's possible that the deadbeat federal government will not support the Wuhan of America and that New York will have to endure rounds and rounds of devastating budget cuts, of the kind we haven't seen in decades." The Atlantic political writer Russell Berman had the longest take on Cuomo, but the headline was "How New York Explains the Other 49 States." Cuomo was evaluated for managing the tricky upstate-versus-downstate politics but was in no way held accountable for governing the "Wuhan of America." Ed Yong's story "America's Patchwork Pandemic Is Fraying Even Further" barely mentions Cuomo. There's this half a sentence, which appears deep into the article: "Gov. Andrew Cuomo, for example, is turning 24 churches in low-income areas into testing centers ..." CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP CNN's Brian Stelter put Yong on his show, "Reliable Sources." Did Stelter ask about the "Patchwork Pandemic" piece? No. He asked, "As a science writer, you know, you're studying this every day. Where are you on the optimism/pessimism scale?" Conservatives should be robustly pessimistic that our elite media will ever assume a dispassionate, nonpartisan approach that holds both Democrats and Republicans accountable in the public debate. These political referees are always rigging the game. CLICK HERE FOR MORE BY TIM GRAHAM

 Since the revolution in policing that began in the early 1990s, we have had a generation of peace and prosperity. Without the rule of law — i.e., without order, without the presumption that the laws will be enforced — that kind of societal flourishing is not possible.

Our enemies did not present as traditional armed forces, but melded into the civilian populations that they attacked. While there were domestic attacks, the most catastrophic one on 9/11, the courts always remained open and functioning. There was no cessation of domestic law enforcement. Yet it wasn’t truly peacetime, either. Our enemies were projecting force on the scale of a nation-state and were backed by hostile foreign regimes. Congress authorized combat operations, and our military was dispatched. The laws of war were invoked to justify detaining enemy combatants and even trying them by military commission — though few such trials actually took place.

 The death of George Floyd, his plea for help, for air, and for his mother will be etched in the consciousness of an entire generation of Americans. As the viral footage of George Floyd’s death surfaced, it seemed, for a brief moment in time, America’s indignation was united over the unjust death of another black man. Tragically, as anger boiled into action, our nation witnessed peaceful protests grow into violent riots that were hijacked by anarchists and have cost our nation more innocent lives, billions in damages, and wounds of divisions that will not be easily healed. BISHOP T.D. JAKES: RACE AND POLICING – CHURCH LEADERS MUST DRIVE NATIONAL CONVERSATION, ACTION PLAN But beyond the smoke and ash, lies hope, and it is in this trying time we as Americans must unite to seek justice and find actionable solutions that no longer pit race against race, or prejudice against prejudice, but seek to uphold the principles of our great nation. To start, Congress can pass the Walter Scott Act, a bill Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., previously introduced to honor a black South Carolina man shot in the back during a daytime traffic stop for a non-functioning brake light. This bill would require states that receive federal funds for law enforcement to document when an officer is involved in a use of force situation that results in a civilian casualty. Additionally, in a recent conversation with President Trump, Scott urged the president to establish a Federal Race and Justice Commission to address the root causes of, and find solutions to, unjustified police violence against black and brown folks. George Floyd was the unheard voice, his cry for help was ignored, his plea for breath was silenced under the pressure of a knee.  Such a commission would include voices from law enforcement (almost all of which are committed to protecting all citizens), the black and brown communities, civil rights groups, state and local government, and the faith community. President Trump’s involvement here is critical. He is respected by law enforcement and was the key to securing law enforcement support for the First Step Act. This is President Trump’s moment for leadership and he will be the difference-maker. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER As someone who worked on Capitol Hill and is seeking to become a policymaker, I believe the immediate adoption of these two straightforward, concrete policies will send a clear message to a frustrated, nearly fed-up black America. “We hear you!” The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr has been often cited over the past four days as saying “a riot is the language of the unheard,” but there is more to his message. Dr. King emphasized that “we must always work with an effective, powerful weapon and method that brings about tangible results. But it is not enough for me to stand before you tonight and condemn riots. It would be morally irresponsible for me to do that without, at the same time, condemning the contingent, intolerable conditions that exist in our society.” The looting, the riots, the chants cursing the police, this will not bring positive change and it fails to honor George Floyd. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP George Floyd was the unheard voice, his cry for help was ignored, his plea for breath was silenced under the pressure of a knee. We, as united Americans, should cry over the death of George Floyd – we should decry the riots without exception, and we should move to bring about actionable change that will ensure justice for all. George Floyd’s voice should be unheard no more. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY SHAY HAWKINS

 When Alveda King reminded me that Martin Luther King Jr. and his fellow leaders brought their Bibles when they marched for our civil rights in the ’60s, the light turned on. The root cause of our current issues in America is much bigger than the evils of police brutality; we have allowed a widespread progressive culture to take hold that has abandoned the fear of God. That culture caused Minnesota leaders to ignore the actions of a rogue cop for over a decade. That, in turn, led to a police officer's actions, caught on video, which resulted in the death of an innocent man in broad daylight. BISHOP T.D. JAKES: RACE AND POLICING – CHURCH LEADERS MUST DRIVE NATIONAL CONVERSATION, ACTION PLAN Now, this same evil is causing some of America’s most admirable influencers to support and justify looting and rioting. It’s shameful. It’s shocking to me that our nation is on fire, and people are demanding change to police culture while ignoring the incompetence of the elected officials who oversee them. We are watching cities run by progressive mayors and state officials who have blatantly refused to enforce common-sense laws when it comes to police officers. It should infuriate all of America that Minnesota’s progressive state and local officials – including Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Attorney General Keith Ellison and Mayor Jacob Frey – allowed Derek Cauvin to remain on the police force after 17 complaints were filed against him. No job in America would allow an employee to remain on duty under such circumstances, let alone in a job as important as policing a diverse community. Progressives are quick to call conservatives racist but they have allowed this very racism to exist in the communities they’ve been elected to serve. The reality is that progressives prefer personality over policy, and support leaders who say the right words while pushing oppressive and ungodly policies. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey allowed a historic American city to burn and let a police station be overtaken by rioters. Gov. Tim Waltz said the majority of the offenders came from out of state but police reports show that a majority of those arrested were actually residents of Minnesota. This misguided governance is the result of a new age of leaders in many American inner cities who do not display a fear of God. It has become culturally acceptable to embrace and promote policies that condemn godly principles. This causes confusion among citizens and results in leaders who are not bold enough to make tough decisions out of fear of angering their ungodly base of voters. This is much different from when MLK marched for civil rights with his Bible. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER In recent days we have seen youngsters posing in front of a burning building or inflamed police vehicle for a selfie. We've watched precious historic churches being vandalized and set on fire. These violent acts let you know that we have embraced a culture that has completely lost its fear of God. Terrorizing the same communities you claim to be standing up for is pure evil. Justifying it as a payback for past sins is an insult to the word of God and further delays our nation's much-needed focus on reconciliation. Look no further than the progressive leaders and influencers who are now donating money to an organization that is helping Minneapolis protesters get out of jail. Sadly, according to reports, this includes many staff members of former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign, as well as well-known entertainers, musicians and athletes. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The reality is that progressives prefer personality over policy, and support leaders who say the right words while pushing oppressive and ungodly policies. This incubates the culture that feeds the souls of our youth. They continuously fight to remove the presence of God from our public schools, never asking for more spirituality. They support policies that discourage fatherhood, never entitlement programs that reward it. They never mention spiritual reconciliation, instead focusing on dividing people based on identity. They push for bigger government, but there is never a bigger focus on serving God. I pray we can wake up as a nation and identify our real enemy. Hopefully, these protests ignite a movement to focus on feeding our spirits through reconciliation in order to heal our land. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JACK BREWER

 In recent days, all America has watched in horror as violent rioters have assaulted bystanders, smashed store windows and set vehicles ablaze in their sick quest to destroy all sense of peace and safety in our nation’s cities. These criminals have killed several of our fellow citizens and injured scores of others. When you look in their faces and listen to their verbal tirades, you detect a cocky and cruel disregard for human life among these marauding miscreants. You might recall seeing that same smirking snarl somewhere else — in the expression of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the death of George Floyd. That’s because the menaces terrorizing our cities right now share much in common with the bad cops they claim to despise. EX-CINCINNATI MAYOR KEN BLACKWELL: LEADERS IN OUR CITIES HAVE A DUTY TO DO THIS Peaceful protesters and even those practicing nonviolent civil disobedience can lay rightful claim to standing in the time-honored tradition of change agents working to make American society better. But that’s not the case for the out-of-control mobs rampaging through our streets, looting, pillaging and injuring their neighbors. By their blatant disregard for life and property, they have cast aside any right to be taken seriously. And if these rioters don’t quickly and willingly come down off their moral high horses — and cease and desist their illegal activities as their crimes are investigated and prosecuted — then we as a nation must use all appropriate force at our disposal to yank them from their proverbial saddles. Once we re-establish law and order in our cities, then we can tend to the rightful business of addressing the legitimate issues that have prompted the much-justified concerns of not only peaceful protesters but indeed of all Americans of goodwill. We still need to move beyond the most troubling aspects of our history and embrace a new and brighter future.   Black Americans have many legitimate grievances. After all these years, overcoming the legacy of slavery and discrimination remains a great challenge for America. We still need to move beyond the most troubling aspects of our history and embrace a new and brighter future. “We may have all come on different ships, but we're in the same boat now," said the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Rather than living as part of “the black community” or “the white community,” we need someday — if race relations are ever to reach the place we want them to be — to all truly feel part of the same American community, where there is the same justice, the same opportunity and the same rights for all. Very soon, we need to hold a deeper discussion about these aspirations and the obstacles lying in our path. That’s why I am working to organize a “Forum on Race and Justice” here in Indiana and reaching out to partners nationwide to help coordinate an even broader conversation. For now, though, first things first. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP We must take back our streets from the opportunistic predators hell-bent on diverting our attention from the kind of constructive dialogue that could lead to real progress. Just as we cannot let bad cops define law enforcement, neither can we let violent rioters define the crusade for racial justice. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY CURTIS HILL

 Lately, it seems, each week produces a new account of a black person being slaughtered by police officers or individuals with ties to law enforcement. In March, it was Breonna Taylor, a hardworking Louisville EMT who was shot dead in her own apartment by police officers who said they were looking for two people suspected of selling drugs – neither of whom lived in her apartment. The previous month it was jogger Ahmaud Arbery, an unarmed black man gunned down on a street in Brunswick, Ga., after being chased down by a father and son who claimed they suspected him in a rash of break-ins in the neighborhood. Prosecutors practically sat on the case until a video of Ahmaud’s extra-judicial execution surfaced online. JASON NICHOLS: GEORGE FLOYD PROTESTS – A LONG TIME COMING. WHY THEY WON'T END SOON And just a few days ago we watched the horrifying video online of a white Minneapolis police officer with his knee on the neck of a moaning, handcuffed black man by the name of George Floyd.  Floyd’s pleas that he couldn’t breathe and appeals to the officer from bystanders, who pointed out that Floyd’s nose was bleeding and his breathing impaired, went unheeded. Minutes later, Floyd, a 46-year-old man who was had been detained on a nonviolent charge, was dead. The use of a knee to subdue Mr. Floyd was not consistent with police protocol, nor were any commonly taught de-escalation procedures used. But for this video, these officers likely would have gotten away with murder. Thank God for this bystander who shot the footage of the killing. It would be nice if the voices that ask us not to rush to judgment whenever we call out racial bias in law enforcement would apply that same barometer each time police rush to execute an unarmed black man. I applaud the swiftness with which Minneapolis officials moved to fire the four police officers involved in this inhumane act which they then tried to cover up (The police report bore no resemblance whatsoever to what actually happened on the street.)  And I am delighted that the prosecutor has moved quickly to charge one officer with third-degree murder and manslaughter. It’s time for a national conversation on policing and race. Now. It is a national conversation that needs to be followed by an action plan and buy-in from an array of parties, including clergy, community leaders, police unions, the U.S. Justice Department, the White House, Congress, state legislatures and municipal and county officials. Such a plan must address issues like the absence of national standardized hiring and training practices for police officers and the implementation of more de-escalation training. It must lay out a process for expeditiously ridding police departments of troublesome officers. Americans – and Christians in particular – have a moral imperative to tackle this problem.  “Learn to do good: seek justice, correct oppression,” the prophet wrote in the first chapter of Isaiah.   The plan must provide for accountability and transparency in the policing of police departments and set forth stringent penalties that include cutting or eliminating the funding of troubled departments. Those in power cannot afford to do nothing for those without power. In the days since Floyd’s senseless killing, unrest has raged on the streets of Minneapolis. Thursday night, rioters set fire to a police station. There’s chatter about some criminal gangs wanting to avenge Floyd’s death by killing police officers. That’s wrong. I support peaceful protests. Doing otherwise will distract from the goal of badly needed police reform. But doing nothing will destroy our society. The unrest in Minneapolis offers a glimpse into what the future looks like if we do nothing. You can’t sustain law and order in a society in which there is all out enmity between law enforcement and a significant segment of the population. Mutual antipathy between police and the black community further exacerbates racial tensions in the community at large. It generates outrage not only domestically but also internationally, making a mockery of our professed commitment to stated ideals of liberty and justice. Further, it gives comfort to our enemies abroad who are eagerly awaiting opportunities to exploit our nation’s biggest Achilles heel: racial strife. But self-interest aside, Americans – and Christians in particular – have a moral imperative to tackle this problem. “Learn to do good: seek justice, correct oppression,” the prophet wrote in the first chapter of Isaiah. And as the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. aptly put it, “The ultimate tragedy is not the oppression and cruelty by the bad people but the silence over that by the good people.” You cannot be a Christian and stay silent. So I am calling on the nation’s Christian leaders – Catholic, Protestant, Orthodox, black, white, Latino, Asian-American and Native American – to come together and lean on policymakers to effect real change in policing in America. For much of American history, African-American clergy have taken the lead in bringing this nation closer to its ideals of equality, but we need more clergy from all races to raise their voices loud. Many are listening and now I am asking them all to take action. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Being a Christian means speaking out against injustice – even if you are not directly affected by it. Christian leaders need to work toward demonstrating to the public at large that they recognize that all humans are precious in God’s sight. Staying silent would only continue this week’s tragedy. We must turn this week’s events into a triumph on effecting real change in America. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

 The nation went up in flames this weekend. No one in charge stood up to save America. Our leaders dithered. They cowered. They openly sided with the destroyers. In many cases, they egged them on. Later, they will deny doing any of this. They are denying it now. But you know the truth because you saw it happen. This is how nations collapse. When no one in authority keeps the order, and when someone in our professional class encourage violence, American citizens are forced to defend themselves. They have no choice. No one else is going to defend them -- they know that now. GEORGE FLOYD UNREST: CITIES FACE NEW LOOTING AMID STRONGER NATIONAL GUARD RESPONSE, CURFEWS It's possible that more people will be hurt in coming days -- that would be a tragedy. But in an environment like this, more violence could very well lead to a cascade of new tragedies, to something far bigger and more destructive than anything we have seen so far. So, this isn't over. It might simply be the beginning. We pray it isn't. It's hard to think clearly about anything that's going on right now. The chaos, the destruction, the relentless lying from above -- it's all too much. Americans are bewildered, and they are afraid. But most of all, they are filled with rage, angrier than they have ever been. The worst people in our society have taken control. They did nothing to build this country. Now, they are tearing it down. They are rushing us toward mass suicide. So, how do we respond? We must protect ourselves and our families. Once again, we have no choice, but to do that. But we cannot allow ourselves to become like they are. We are not animals, we are Americans. In the face of such indecency, we must resolve to be decent. We believe this country has a future. We intend for our children to live and thrive here. That is what we are defending. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER All our leaders do is set us against each other. They stage a never-ending national cockfight for their profit and amusement. But we're not going to play along. We will love our neighbors relentlessly in spite of all of it, not because they look like us or share our political views. But we love them because they are human beings, and they are Americans. Those are the bonds that tie us together -- the bonds our leaders seek to destroy. We can't let them. We should start by being unsparingly honest about what is happening right now. Truth is our defense, and it's our country's last hope. We plan to use this hour to create a record of this moment right now, to show you what's really going on in your country. We feel an obligation to do that before the facts are spun into propaganda by the liars or the images are pulled off the internet forever, as many of them inevitably will be. All our leaders do is set us against each other. They stage a never-ending national cockfight for their profit and amusement. But we're not going to play along. We're going to begin with where my family lives and has lived for 35 years, in the northwest quadrant of Washington, D.C. This is called Mac Market. It's on MacArthur Boulevard, which is named after General MacArthur during the war. It's our neighborhood store; it's walking distance from my house. People meet there every morning for coffee. Kids come after school for candy. It's as close to a community gathering spot as we have. The market is run by the Kim family. The Kims are immigrants from Korea. They are revered in our neighborhood for their decency and their hard work. When they lost their son several years ago, the neighbors grieved for them. The Kims are not political. They've never hurt anyone. They only make things better. But last night, the mob came for their store. At 1 a.m. Monday morning, Mr. Kim was kneeling alone on the sidewalk trying to salvage what he has spent his life building. Scenes like this played out in hundreds of neighborhoods across this country, maybe yours. Here are a few. In Columbia, S.C., a man called the police when things began to fall apart. Rioters saw him call. They surrounded that man, and they beat him. Onlookers laughed as he was pummeled. This is a national emergency. It's a profound national emergency. But you would never know that from listening to our elected leaders. Almost all of them pretend this is not really happening or if it is happening, it is just part of America's long tradition of vigorous political discourse. In Rochester, N.Y., a group of eight men smashed the windows of a jewelry store. The couple who lived above the shop emerged to confront them. Both of them were viciously beaten with a ladder and a two-by-four. In Dallas, a man armed with what appeared to be a sword did his best to defend a business from looters. The mob bashed him in the head with a rock and a skateboard. It's hard to watch. In San Jose, riders with crowbar stormed the highway and attacked vehicles, trying to pull drivers from their cars. In Birmingham, Ala., a local reporter called Stephen Quinn was beaten, and then he was robbed on live television as he tried to cover the looting. In Portland, Ore., a man was beaten apparently for daring to carry an American flag in public. He never released the flag, by the way. How many of these people died? How many were murdered by the rioters? We don't know yet. At the least, some are likely disabled for life. They were beaten that badly. And then there was the mass stealing. It seemed to be everywhere over the weekend. In Buckhead, an upscale part of Atlanta, rioters stole a Tesla from a dealership and drove it through an indoor mall just to underscore how completely out of control things were. In Portland, Oregon, mobs looted Louis Vuitton, Apple and Chase Bank among many others. They often set fires as they left. In Chicago, protesters fought systemic racism by running through a Nike store stealing shoes. And in Washington, D.C., a federal city surrounded by military bases and protected at all times by the single highest concentration of law enforcement in the world, criminals operated with apparent impunity in the streets. They looted Georgetown. They smashed the windows in federal buildings. They desecrated virtually every war memorial in the city a week after Memorial Day. You've got to wonder how many of them have ever even heard of George Floyd. And if they have heard of him, what difference would it make? Violence and looting are not forms of political expression. And then, as you likely know, Sunday night they set fire to St. John's Episcopal Church, a 200-year-old building that has welcomed every American president since James Madison. It is right across the street from the White House. For people stuck inside anywhere during this insanity -- the sick, the elderly, the powerless -- the experience was terrifying. Listen to this woman from Minneapolis. Reporter: How was last night? Unidentified woman: Scary. They went straight to Office Max, the Dollar Store and every store over here that I go to. I have nowhere to go now. I have no way to get there because the buses aren't running. So, that's what's happening in America right now. We didn't play all of the tape we have. There's a lot of it. Some of the tape is too shocking, and honestly, it's too incendiary. We understand that television is an emotional medium, and we don't want to make things worse. We're not going to, but you get the point. The point is, this is a national emergency. It's a profound national emergency. But you would never know that from listening to our elected leaders. Almost all of them pretend this is not really happening or if it is happening, it is just part of America's long tradition of vigorous political discourse. Politicians on both sides tell us that this is all about the death of a man in police custody in Minneapolis last week. The people burning down our country are "protesters". They're engaged in a legitimate "protest." Okay, what exactly are those protesters' demands? What are they asking for? If Congress agreed to enact their program, what would the program be? Not a single person even hints the answer because there is not an answer. No one has bothered to pull the guys beating up old ladies on the street or looting Gucci, but you've got to wonder how many of them have ever even heard of George Floyd. And if they have heard of him, what difference would it make? Violence and looting are not forms of political expression. If you were killed tomorrow, how many buildings would you want burned to the ground in your memory? How many old women smashed in the face on the street in your name? None, we hope, because you're not a vicious psychopath, like the people you've just watched. In fact, what we're watching is not a political protest. It's the opposite of a political protest. It is an attack on the idea of politics. The rioters you have seen are trying to topple our political system. That system is how we resolve our differences without using violence. But these people want a new system, one that is governed by force. Do what we say or we will hurt you. You know this. You can see it for yourself on television; you have. But our leaders continue to lie. They tell us that's not true. This isn't happening. It's just a protest. When the violence began, what we needed more than anything was clarity in the middle of this ...  Instead, almost all of our so-called conservative leaders joined the left's chorus, as if on cue. Some Democrats have openly embraced what is happening. Really they don't have much of a choice. These are their voters cleaning out the Rolex store. These riots effectively are the largest Joe Biden for President rally on record. In gratitude for that, more than a dozen Joe Biden for President campaign staffers donated money to the rioters in Minneapolis, and then they bragged about it on Twitter. No Democratic leader can directly criticize what is happening right now. And in fact, some have joined in. Over the weekend, the Democratic Party of Fairfax, Virginia, which is an important Democratic organization, released the following statement on Twitter: "Riots are an integral part of this country's march towards progress." Progress. Burning buildings, teargas, dead bodies, the screaming injured, criminal anarchy -- to the Democratic Party of Fairfax, that is called progress. Celebrity after celebrity has weighed in to agree on social media. From his fortified compound, basketball star LeBron James has used his accounts to encourage more rioting. Bernie Sanders surrogate Shaun King has done the same. So has Black Lives Matter leader, DeRay Mckesson. Colin Kaepernick openly calls for violence. Here's a quote: "The cries for peace will rain down and when they do, they will land on deaf ears," he says approvingly. Imagine shouting fire in a crowded theater, a theater with 325 million people in it called our country. That's what they've been doing and have been doing for days. When the violence began, what we needed more than anything was clarity in the middle of this. It's hard to see when the tear gas starts. Someone in America needed to tell the truth to the country. Instead, almost all of our so-called conservative leaders joined the left's chorus, as if on cue. On Friday, as American cities were being destroyed by mobs, the vice president United States refused to say anything specific about the riots we were watching on television. Instead, Mike Pence scolded America for its racism. Carly Fiorina, once a leading Republican presidential candidate tweeted that -- and we're quoting, "It's white America that now must see the truth, speak the truth and act on the truth." Meanwhile, Kay Coles James, who is the president of the Heritage Foundation -- that's the largest conservative think tank in the country. You may have sent them money, hopefully for the last time. Kay Coles James wrote a long scream denouncing America as an irredeemably racist nation: "How many times will protests have to occur?" Got that? "Have to occur." Like the rest of us caused this by our sinfulness. The message from our leaders on the right, as on the left, was unambiguous: Don't complain. You deserve what's happening to you. No one jumped in more forcefully or seemed angrier in America than former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley. "Tonight I turned on the news and I am heartbroken," Haley wrote. "It's important to understand that the death of George Ford was personal and painful for many. In order to heal, it needs to be personal and painful for everyone." Imagine shouting fire in a crowded theater, a theater with 325 million people in it called our country. That's what they've been doing and have been doing for days. But wait a second, you may be wondering, how am I "personally responsible" for the behavior of a Minneapolis police officer? I've never even been to Minneapolis, you may think to yourself. And why is some politician telling me I'm required to be upset about it? Those are all good questions. Nikki Haley did not answer those questions explaining. It is not her strong suit -- that would require thinking. What Nikki Haley does best is moral blackmail. During the 2016 campaign, she compared Donald Trump to the racist mass murderer, Dylann Roof. How is Donald Trump similar to a serial killer? Nikki Haley never explained that. She wasn't trying to educate anyone. Her only goal was political advantage. Nikki Haley is exceptionally good at getting what she wants. She is happy to denounce you as a racist in order to get it. She just did. In this case, Nikki Haley's wish came true. The riots were indeed "personal and painful" for everyone. And then the pain kept increasing. Two days after she wrote that, dozens of American cities had been thoroughly trashed, some destroyed. A country already on the brink of recession suddenly faced economic collapse. An already fearful population locked down for months because of the coronavirus had been thoroughly and completely terrorized. Mission accomplished. Let's hope Nikki Haley is pleased. We've now atoned. How did the Trump administration respond to the horrors going on around us? Well, Sunday morning, the country's national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, did a live interview from the White House lawn. Here's how it began: Robert O'Brien, U.S. National Security Adviser: First thing I want to say, on behalf of the president --he said this to the family -- but our hearts and prayers are going out to the Floyd family. We mourn with them and we grieve with them and what happened there was horrific and I can't even imagine what that poor family is going through as his videos are played over and over again. That should have never happened in America and it's a tragic thing. The president said that from the start, and we're with the family and as the President said, we're with the peaceful protesters. "We're with the peaceful protesters," O'Brien announced. Really? Can you be more specific about that? Who are you talking about exactly? Is it the people spitting foam as they scream, "F the police"? Is it the one standing next to the arsonist doing nothing as they set fire to buildings? Is it the kids laughing as they film the looting and the beatings on their iPhones? The first requirement of leadership is that you watch over the people in your care. That's what soldiers want from their officers. It's what families need from their fathers. It's what voters demand from their presidents. Maybe it's the famous people in L.A. who are raising money online to support the rioters? They're all just peaceful protesters. Yes, we support that. It's who we are. What about the president? Where is he during all of this? Well, on Friday night, after the show, Leland Vitter and a cameraman headed to Lafayette Square in Washington to cover what was happening outside the White House. Here's what happened next. Reporter: A Fox News reporter is getting chased out by these -- by the George Floyd protesters here in front of -- at Lafayette Park. Look, there's water being thrown on the reporter here. This is just -- they took his mic. The just threw the mic at the reporter here. As you see guys, things are spiraling here quick at the protest. That was in Lafayette Square in the center of our capital city. The tape raised a troubling question: If you can't keep a Fox News correspondent from getting attacked directly across the street from your house, how can you protect my family? How are you going to protect the country? How hard are you trying? On Twitter the next morning, the president reassured America that he and his family were just fine. The federally funded bodyguards had kept them safe. He did not mention protecting the rest of the nation, much of which was then on fire. He seemed aware only of himself. For people who like Donald Trump, who voted for Donald Trump, who support his policies, who have defended him for years and years against the most absurd kinds of slander, this was a distressing moment. The first requirement of leadership is that you watch over the people in your care. That's what soldiers want from their officers. It's what families need from their fathers. It's what voters demand from their presidents. People will put up with almost anything if you do that. You can regularly say embarrassing things on television. You can hire Omarosa to work at the White House. All of that will be forgiven if you protect your people. But if you do not protect them -- or worse than that, if you seem like you can't be bothered to protect them -- then you're done. It's over. People will not forgive weakness. That's the one thing, by the way, that is not a partisan point. It is human nature. Nero is the only Roman emperor whose name most people still remember. Why? Because he abandoned his nation in a time of crisis. And 2,000 years later, we still don't forgive him. Donald Trump's response to these riots, which is ongoing, is the singular test of his presidency. About an hour ago, the president announced that he's going to marshal all available forces -- military and civilian -- to stop these riots. President Donald Trump: If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them. Good for him. Immediately after that address, the president walked over to St. John's, which, we just told you, was burning fewer than 24 hours ago, and that provided a powerful symbolic gesture. It was a declaration that this country -- our national symbols, our oldest institutions -- will not be desecrated and defeated by nihilistic destruction. We fervently hope this all works. What Americans want most right now is an end to this chaos. They want their cities to be saved. They want this to stop immediately. If the commander-in-chief cannot stop it, he will lose in November. The left will blame him for the atrocities they encouraged, and some voters will agree. Donald Trump is the president. Presidents save countries. That's their job. That's why we hire them. It's that simple. Some key advisers around the president don't seem to understand this or the gravity of the moment. No matter what happens, they'll tell you, our voters aren't going anywhere. "The trailer parks are rock solid. What choice do they have? They've got to vote for us." Jared Kushner, for one, has made that point out loud. No one has more contempt for Donald Trump's voters than Jared Kushner does, and no one expresses it more frequently. In 2016, Donald Trump ran as a law and order candidate because he meant it, and his views remain fundamentally unchanged today. But the president's famously sharp instincts, the ones that won him the presidency almost four years ago, have been since subverted at every level by Jared Kushner. This is true on immigration, on foreign policy, and especially on law enforcement. As crime in this country continues to rise, Jared Kushner has led a highly aggressive effort to let more criminals out of prison and back on to the streets. This is reckless. At this moment in time, it is insane. It continues to happen. What Americans want most right now is an end to this chaos. They want their cities to be saved. They want this to stop immediately. If the commander-in-chief cannot stop it, he will lose in November. The left will blame him for the atrocities they encouraged, and some voters will agree. The president seems to sense this. At times he seems aware he is being led in the wrong direction. He often derides Kushner as a liberal and that's correct, Kushner is. But Kushner has convinced the president that throwing open the prisons is the key to winning African-American votes in the fall and that those votes are essential to his reelection. Several times over the past few days, the president has signaled that he would very much like to crack down on rioters -- that is his instinct. If you've watched him, you'll believe it. But every time he has been talked out of it by Jared Kushner and by aides that Kushner has hired and controls. Kushner's assumption, apparently, is that African-American voters like looting. That is wrong. Normal Americans of all colors hate looting, obviously. Why wouldn't they hate looting? They are decent people. So one of the lessons of all that we have seen and we've seen so much over the past five days is America is going to change because of this -- that is certain. What can we learn from it? What should we demand going forward? The first thing to know is that we can no longer accept race-baiting from our leaders. Never. That has become so common now that we barely notice it. But it is dividing and destroying this country. We should make them stop. On Sunday, for example, Mayor Jenny Durkan of Seattle tweeted this: "I want to acknowledge that much of the violence and destruction both here in Seattle and across the country has been instigated and perpetrated by white men." Is that factually true? Who knows? Who cares? The skin color of criminals is totally irrelevant to how we prosecute them for the crimes they commit. It must be irrelevant. Otherwise, we're committing the bigotry we claim to abhor. Weakness invites aggression. That is true in nature and it's every bit as true in human society. Our leaders are weak. Predators know it. That's why this is happening. Yet everywhere on television and social media, prominent people are now talking exactly like this. Not just a few crackpots -- thousands of people, well-known people. They are amplifying race hatred at exactly the moment that we need at least at the moment when it's the most dangerous. This is Art Acevedo. Acevedo with the police chief of Houston. Houston is the fourth biggest city in this country. Acevedo's job, his sworn duty, is to enforce the law fairly and evenly regardless of the ethnicity of the suspect. Watch this and tell us if you think he is capable of doing that. Do you think he's even interested? Art Acevedo, chief of the Houston Police department: My people for -- as an immigrant, we are raised like this. But you know what? We built this country ... We have got news for them. We ain't going nowhere. We ain't going nowhere. I think the ship has sailed. So if you've got hate in your heart for people of color, get over it, because this city is a minority-majority city. "My people." If a police chief of any color -- any color -- said that, we would attack him instantly, and we would mean it. It is wrong. When you run a law enforcement agency, you don't get to consider "my people" much less claim your people deserve some kind of special consideration because they "built this country." No. Your obligation is not to consider your people, but all people and consider them equally. Period. Art Acevedo is not even trying to do that. Imagine being arrested by this creep. Think you'd get a fair shake? There's almost nothing that hurts America more than this. If you are worried about the rise of extremism here -- and honestly, you should be worried -- this kind of insanity is absolutely certain to cause it. And let's be clear, when we say extremism, we're not talking about unconventional views that get you bounced off Twitter or scolded by the corporate HR department. We mean actual extremism where people espouse violence against other people, where large groups come to believe their racial identity is the most important thing about them. Now, at this moment, no matter what they're telling you, no matter what they claim for political advantage, there's not a huge amount of that in this country, thank God. Most people still think of themselves as Americans and want to. But if the left keeps talking like this, there definitely will be and very soon. And you don't want to live here when that happens. We should demand they stop immediately. Enforcing the law is not white supremacy. Insisting that everyone in the country follow the same rules is not racism. In fact, it's the answer to racism. It is equality -- equality under the law. It is the one thing we must defend, and if we don't, it's over. Things fall apart. Weakness invites aggression. That is true in nature and it's every bit as true in human society. Our leaders are weak. Predators know it. That's why this is happening. If you let people spray paint obscenities in City Hall, pretty soon they are overturning cop cars. If you put up with that, they'll come right to the front door of the police precinct, and they will burn it down.

My senior year at West Point I decided to go after one of the items on my bucket list: Climb Mount Everest. Some would call it crazy to juggle a demanding school like West Point and pursue such an aspirational goal, and it probably was. With the support of my then fiancé and now wife Rachel, I decided I was going to do everything it took to make it happen. The thing is, I had no real mountain climbing experience. I’m from the great state of Georgia, where our tallest mountain stands fewer than five thousand feet. SEN. MARTHA McSALLY: IN CORONAVIRUS FIGHT TO WIN AGAINST COVID-19 WE MUST DO THINGS AFRAID Even so, I gathered the support of a lot of people who helped me form U.S. Expeditions and Explorations (USX). And in 2016, I had the honor of helping lead the first active-duty team and combat-wounded veteran expedition to the summit of Mount Everest as a means to bring attention to PTSD and veteran suicide. At the time, I didn’t fully comprehend the risk I was taking after just getting married and what it would mean for my wife Rachel and our dream of starting a family. We share our story in the book "A Higher Calling: Pursuing Love, Faith and Mount Everest For a Greater Purpose." The ascent was harder than I ever could have imagined but the descent was a story all its own. Looking back, I think we’re all going through a similar descent as we slowly return to our pre-COVID-19 lives. None of us had experience going into this crisis, and we don’t know what we’re facing as we return to normal. So how do we keep our focus, deal with what’s not in our control and fight for our future? I think coming down the world’s highest mountain taught me some lessons I’ll never forget. On my descent from Everest, I found myself fighting for every step. My Sherpa gave a thumbs-up and a nod. “I’m good to go.” It was time to get moving. Every step was agony. I tried to block from my thoughts any factor that was not in my personal control. The vicious gusts of wind that were shoving me off balance and making my bones ache with cold. Not in my control.   The drunken zombie effect caused by the altitude that was sapping my strength and breath and draining the life from my blood. Not in my control.  The burning pain in my toes that was giving way to numbness. Not in my control.   The need to keep moving down the mountain at all costs, no matter how agonizing ... that was something I could control. So I focused every ounce of concentration I had on my feet. Everything else fell away as my life narrowed into a single repeated objective: Take a step. Take another step. Take another step. I thought about Rachel, 9,487 miles away and at this very moment likely worried out of her mind about me. I had passed along a request earlier to some Sherpas heading down from Camp Three for our team’s camp manager to get word to my family that we had safely arrived at the final camp and were going to make the push to the summit. I was not sure if my message ever made it there. I learned that communication can be the difference between life and death; that when you are in pivotal moments, you must clearly communicate and keep things simple to understand. The unthinkable reality was that I didn’t know for certain if I was going to make it back. But I viewed that outcome as simply unacceptable. No force in the world was going to keep me from Rachel. Despite the year I’d spent training for this trip, I was completely unprepared for the reality of being on Everest and the toll it would take on me physically and emotionally. I knew I had to harness every weapon in my physical and spiritual arsenal now. I added a silent mantra with each footstep. Focus. Step. Pray. Every inch of progress was a step closer to Rachel and to our future together. For me, that future was worth climbing every massive peak in the Himalayas. Our team slowly worked our way off the mountain. We had more than a weeklong journey back to our families. I was heading home to the love of my life, who was waiting for me. She was all I could think about. I’d had a dangerous love affair with a mountain that almost took me away from my wife, and coming out on the other side, I just wanted to see her warm smile and wrap her in my arms. I learned so many things on that mountain. I learned that communication can be the difference between life and death; that when you are in pivotal moments, you must clearly communicate and keep things simple to understand. Even if you are right next to someone, it doesn’t mean that communication is actually taking place. I learned that when I am tired, I am vulnerable to mishaps. Which means I need to take a tactical pause, rest, and then recenter and reengage. I learned that although our mission comes first (raising awareness for PTSD), it shouldn’t be at the expense of the team or my family. I learned that as the youngest and least experienced member of my seasoned team, I can always use common sense to help bridge the gap left by the experience I don’t have. I learned that it is harder to sit and wait helplessly to find out if your loved one is alive or dead than it is to climb the highest mountain in the world. I also learned, as Rachel told me later, that you can’t just ask God to save the person you love most and leave it at that. This kind of prayer relies only on one-way communication. Instead, Rachel taught me through her own example that you must fully put your faith in God to carry you through the worst, no matter the outcome. That is the essence of true communication with God. It’s the definition of faith in its purest form. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER I will carry these lessons with me and rely on them as I continue to grow as a leader, husband and person. Just as I began my journey with no prior mountain climbing experience, few of us have experienced a pandemic of this magnitude before. But that doesn’t mean we aren’t capable of climbing and descending this unexpected mountain. As we make our way out of COVID-19 together, I encourage us all to remain focused, let go of what’s not in our control, and continue to put one foot in front of the other until we’re safely on the other side.

 With all that our nation is experiencing, I believe what it really needs right now is leadership from each other. We can’t pass the buck to the president or lawmakers. It is up to us as American citizens to help implement change and truly come together as a nation. Looting and rioting do not help the cause; they just create opportunities for criminals. War without strategy is suicide. You can be upset, but you must have a plan. DONNA BRAZILE: GEORGE FLOYD AFTERMATH – WHEN WILL IT END? We all agree that the killing of George Floyd was wrong. We might also agree it is time for real change and you don’t accomplish that by tearing up our cities. As Atlanta Mayor Keisha Bottoms says, “This is not a protest. … This is chaos.” Too often our many black leaders have gotten complacent with their power, their status as elected officials and all that comes with being a celebrity. They tend to go with what the markets say or what is politically correct. When you have organizations such as Black Lives Matter, which was created when we had a black president and a black attorney general and they were not able to deliver, it is even more cause for concern. It is time for direction! It is time for leadership. It is time for change. But what does change look like? Change its not throwing Molatov cocktails at police cars and hurting the very officers that help defend and keep our country safe. Going to the White House to climb fences and play tug-of-war with the Secret Service does not change anything. We need Americans and young people to know that, instead of tearing the streets up, it is more effective to come to our nation’s capital with a list of ideas for legislation and action, and to stand before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to get a bill passed. By lead, I don’t mean talk or rant on social media or simply say that both sides need to stop. I am talking about LEADING. In 2018, I spearheaded and developed, alongside then-U.S. Rep. Scott Taylor, R-Va., a resolution designed to help create alliances to enhance and improve communication and collaboration between members of the law enforcement community and the public they serve. This resolution was specifically designed to help enhance relationships so that law enforcement and the public could truly understand each other. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Specifically, the idea was to acknowledge legitimate concerns of citizens and the strain and mistrust that often clouded their relationship with local police. It would foster constructive and mutually respectful dialogue meant to address legitimate concerns, which can undermine effective policing strategy and public safety. It is up to us all, citizens and leaders, to take this idea and lead. It is lawmakers like former Congressman Taylor, who believed in what I was saying and teamed up with me for action, and resolutions like this that can guide us in working together in difficult times like these. So, if no one in our communities is going to lead, then who will? By lead, I don’t mean talk or rant on social media or simply say that both sides need to stop. I am talking about LEADING. Pushing and challenging the civil protesters who want real change and the law enforcement officers who want to work more with communities for a better relationship. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP I will commit to LEADING the charge and creating what Congressman Taylor and I envisioned in House Resolution 285:  a greater sense of trust and cohesiveness in our communities. We cannot accomplish greatness by tearing down or taking apart our great land. We are one, we are America and together we must continue to focus on further building a great nation. A nation that is built on freedom, life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY CHRIS PRUDHOME

 Cities across the country are in ruin, and the fear that took root when stay-at-home orders went into effect is being compounded by violent protesters who’ve abandoned reason and justice in the wake of George Floyd’s wanton death allegedly at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer. People’s livelihoods are up in flames. Others are afraid to leave their homes and many who depend on public transportation no longer have a community pharmacy or convenience store for essentials, like food and medicine. Rioters all but guaranteed many of the businesses in their own communities will never reopen again. Meanwhile, local leaders have a chance to stop the lawlessness instead of watching as rioters in their grief and anger destroy neighborhoods. Mayors have a duty to restore order. JIM HANSON: TRUMP'S ANTIFA DECLARATION – THIS IS HOW IT HELPS US FIGHT BACK President Trump has taken this matter seriously and directed the Department of Justice to conduct a civil-rights investigation into the death of George Floyd. But mayors are the ones whose leadership matters the most right now. How they respond to the crisis is what has the power to build up or tear down public confidence. In order to build confidence in their constituents, mayors must operate on the age-old wisdom that “Without peace, justice can’t take root.” In their anger and grief over the needless loss of George Floyd, folks cannot torch their own communities — hurt their neighbors and friends — in the name of justice. Local leaders must harness peoples’ grief and anger and channel it in a constructive direction. Otherwise, the violent rioting could prove the final straw for businessmen and women hanging on by a thread as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and serve to undermine the very change rioters and protesters seek to effect in their communities. We cannot let provocateurs and rioters co-opt our legitimate desire for justice and use it to wreak havoc on our country. This is common sense — not a “right” or “left” issue. Rioting is no way to honor the memory of George Floyd. As the former mayor of Cincinnati and former ambassador to the U.N. Human Rights Council, I witnessed first-hand the truth of Martin Luther King Jr.,’s immortal words: “The chain reaction of evil — hate begetting hate, wars producing more wars — must be broken, or we shall be plunged in the dark abyss of annihilation.” We cannot let provocateurs and rioters co-opt our legitimate desire for justice and use it to wreak havoc on our country. This is common sense — not a “right” or “left” issue; this is about coming together as Americans and ensuring justice is done. Those of us in positions of authority and influence have a duty to restore and unite for justice. Chaos and wanton destruction will destroy our communities. We cannot let our grief and desire for justice over the unnecessary death of George Floyd get lost in this chaos. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Frustration and anger are understandably high. What happened in Minneapolis is shocking and tragic, and George Floyd should still be with us today. The violence and destruction that followed, however, dishonor the pursuit of justice for a man widely remembered by his friends and family members as a “gentle giant." People are losing their life’s work, the businesses they built with their own two hands and their own sweat and hard work. In many cases, those businesses have been closed because of the virus, and now they are being physically destroyed or burned to the ground. Local officials must restore order, end the riots and preserve communities — this is a time for peace, for calm and for unity. We must always remember that what unites us outweighs what divides us — as Americans, we must come together. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP We can only achieve our desired goals, however, if we work together. With our spirit, our passion and our love of country, we can ensure justice is achieved and peace restored. If we do this our communities will be the stronger for it, and the thing that will stand out at this moment in history will not be the violent, Antifa-fueled rioters, but the strength of the human spirit.

 The thug disguised as a Minneapolis police officer who is charged with third-degree murder in the death of George Floyd does not speak for me. The rioters on the streets of dozens of American cities, destroying valuable property, from shopping malls to synagogues, also do not speak for me. So who does? JASON NICHOLS: GEORGE FLOYD PROTESTS – A LONG TIME COMING. WHY THEY WON'T END SOON I am not a racist and neither are most Americans or most police officers. I am not a destroyer of property and neither are most Americans. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Chances are, you are just as appalled by what happened in Minneapolis, and what has happened in American cities and in some other places around the world, as I am. So who speaks for us? I resent the implication that if I’m not torching police cars, I am condoning the actions of a bad cop. I equally resent the implication that my attitudes toward race can be divined simply by looking at the color of my skin. When it comes to race, it seems that we Americans have lost the plot. There was a time, not that long ago, when we had begun to move toward a society where people judged each other as individuals, by the content of their character, in Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s words. And somehow that morphed into a new kind of racism, where assumptions are made that if you’re white, you think this way, if you’re black, you think that way, if you’re straight, if you’re gay, and so on. What happened? When did we move from striving for color-blindness to living in a world where color and other forms of identity trump individual thinking? The academy and social media deserve much of the blame. College students are being taught to see life through a prism of race, gender and sexuality, as if you could define a human being in all of his or her complexity by a few key tests. You can’t. You can’t shorthand people. And yet, my visits to college campuses over the last 10 years have indicated that the progressive movement has taught the young to view themselves and others almost entirely in terms of race, sexual identity, and so on. We used to be people. Now we’re categories. And then what kids learn in college makes its way into the workplace, as they graduate and get jobs, and then into the culture, through the shorthanding of ideas that occurs in social media. In the musical "South Pacific," there was a groundbreaking song about racism called “You’ve Got To Be Carefully Taught.” In other words, racism and hatred are not built into us from birth.   All that gets amplified by progressive politicians who play the shame and blame game to accumulate more power and prestige. And now we live in a world where interactions between people of different opinions, colors, religions or lack thereof, and sexual identity are rooted in distrust, cynicism and outright hatred. In the musical "South Pacific," there was a groundbreaking song about racism called “You’ve Got To Be Carefully Taught.” In other words, racism and hatred are not built into us from birth. They are learned behaviors. And in my lifetime, we recognized the folly of such bigoted thinking and we began to move toward a society where people were accepted as individuals and not judged as members of groups. A far-from-perfect society, but a better society. As Dr. King said, the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice. And then things went the other way. The thug in a cop’s uniform who has been charged with murder was likely taught to believe certain things about race. The thugs in expensive jeans and designer tops rampaging through our cities and destroying parts of an already fragile economy were carefully taught that annihilation and rage are appropriate responses to behavior of which they disapprove. Neither of those kinds of people speaks for me. Or, I would think, for you. Or for who we are trying to be, fitfully, agonizingly, as a just society. I am not a racist, or one who condones rogue cops or rioters. They are not America. This is not a society of blind hate. We have come too far. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP We took a wrong turn. We sent our children to college, and the progressive movement that controls thought on college campuses carefully taught our children to hate. And now we are reaping that whirlwind.

 George Floyd is a martyr. His death is more than a tragic incident on the streets of Minneapolis, it is emblematic of a traumatic and abusive 401-year relationship. When former Police Officer Derek Chauvin drove his knee into the neck of Floyd – the latter bound by handcuffs, face pressed against hard concrete, his cries for mercy falling on deaf ears from men in uniform who were sworn to protect him – the pain and suffering of so many was on full display and could not be ignored. Since 1619, America has placed its knee on the necks of black people, while others who had the opportunity to intervene stood idly by and watched. DONNA BRAZILE: GEORGE FLOYD AFTERMATH – WHEN WILL THIS END? We saw our country explode this weekend. It is true that some of the people involved in the wreckage and destruction of property had different agendas. However, you witnessed a generation of young people who are angry and frightened that someone they know or love could be next. They are resentful of their countrymen who, just five years earlier, ignored or worse, opposed their pleas that their lives and the lives of those in their communities simply mattered. In 2015, with the exception of a few cities, most of the marching was done peacefully. The media vilified the protesters, their cause, their means of protest, and even the victims of violence themselves by impugning their character. Colin Kaepernick and other NFL players knelt in solidarity with the fallen and in a silent call for justice. They were called "sons of bitches." I wish I could say George Floyd’s death was exceptionally different or more egregious than the others before him. The truth is, it wasn’t. The protesters rightly feel patronized by those who feign expressions of grief and then instruct them on the right way to protest. The question is, where were you? Where were you when Eric Garner begged for mercy, screaming the very same words as Floyd that haunt so many of our nightmares: "I can't breathe“? Where were you when Aiyana Stanley-Jones, a 7-year-old girl, was shot in the head by a police officer during a raid? When 12-year-old Tamir Rice was gunned down while playing with a toy? When Philando Castile was killed while a child watched from the backseat of his vehicle only a few miles from where George Floyd took his final breath? When Atatiana Jefferson was shot through a window in her own home during a wellness check? What occurred on May 30, 2020, will live in infamy like many days before it. It is like Aug. 11, 1965, and April 29, 1992, and April 25, 2015. We have seen images of police brutality and unjust killings on film since at least the early 1960s. What we are seeing is nothing new, except now the images no longer go through a newsroom filter, where often an older white man gets to decide whether or for how long it is newsworthy. America has allowed police brutality and other related issues to go unchecked, and today every major city in the country is smoldering. This country needs to have a spiritual, social, cultural and political reckoning. Systemic racism is cancer. For too long we have been told to ignore the symptoms or given temporary pain relievers, like an uplifting speech from a well-respected politician or an encouraging word from a celebrity. Like all cancers, when you fail to address the underlying issue, it grows and metastasizes until the body is in full-blown crisis. America has allowed police brutality and other related issues to go unchecked, and today every major city in the country is smoldering. The knee of America has been on the necks of black people for so long, despite their fealty to the principles enshrined in our Constitution. Any cancer survivor will tell you that the treatment and healing process is arduous, painful and prolonged. It is not comfortable but it is necessary for survival. The need in this country is for peace, justice, progress, unity. As we can see, there will be no peace without justice, no justice without progress, no progress without unity. Until we can show that peaceful protests yield tangible, lasting results, we will continue to have these explosions every few years. We are a leaderless nation. There is no one at the helm whom the public can trust to usher change and progress, who fights to unify us with words and in action. There is no political or spiritual leader who can reset our ailing country. That leaves the responsibility on us. Some are saying that the protesters who are destroying property don’t respect the law. That is true.  And it's because the law has shown repeatedly that it doesn’t respect black and brown people. In a cathartic rage, they feel as though they are fighting back, disrupting the repressive status quo and placing their knee upon America’s economic and social neck, even if only for a few hours. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER It is incumbent upon us to show them they are wrong, that their grievances will be heard and taken seriously, and that true structural change can be achieved through nonviolent means. George Floyd was a martyr and symbol of something much larger. Officer Chauvin’s arrest and conviction are only the first steps. The color of Chauvin’s skin is not the primary issue, the color of his uniform is. I want to know that if I am having a medical emergency, I will be aided by the institutions I help to support, not ignored or hurt worse. There are police reforms that must occur. Stephen Jackson, a former NBA player who knew George Floyd personally, was asked by rap legend Fat Joe about watching Floyd’s death. Jackson responded, “I saw myself.” Fat Joe, who has referred to himself in the past as a “black Latino” appeared emotionally moved. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP I am a 6-foot-2 black man. I saw myself. Black wives saw their husbands. Black young people saw their fathers. Black mothers saw their sons. When President Obama saw himself in a black boy who was stalked and killed by a vigilante, he was roundly criticized. Until society fully recognizes our humanity and white men see themselves in Floyd – white women see themselves in Breonna Taylor – white parents see their children in Tamir Rice – white advocates of the Second Amendment see themselves in Atatiana Jefferson or Philando Castile – we will return to this very position with business and communities in ashes.

 The statement by President Trump that the United States will designate Antifa as a terrorist group is an important one. The biggest reason is they are one, so we can now properly frame their actions. But there are other advantages both in preventing more attacks and catching and punishing the perpetrators. Their actions fit the definition of terrorism as I pointed out in this piece calling for this designation: “The president’s accurate description of Antifa fits the definition under federal law of a domestic terror group. Under that definition, such a group breaks laws ‘to intimidate or coerce a civilian population’ or to ‘influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion.’” DONNA BRAZILE: GEORGE FLOYD AFTERMATH – WHEN WILL THIS END? Most of the hardcore activists wouldn’t even argue with the description or the goals, but previously they were dealing with a much smaller potential downside. Now the array and severity of crimes and especially punishments just jumped exponentially. Many of these wannabe revolutionaries are willing to spend a night in jail, but how many are willing to do 20 years in prison. The immediate effect will be to change the dynamic for the radical Left and their “Burn it all down” wing and create a real deterrent. They have been free to commit vandalism escalating up to violent acts and turn their protests into riots because even if they were caught the local charges were usually minor. This will help slow their ability to grow a pack of angry activists into a howling mob burning buildings, beating bystanders and even killing people. They rely on riding along with the other radical Left activist groups who are all too happy to have them do the dirty work. But if those groups risk being swept up for supporting terror, they are much less likely to tolerate Antifa & friends in their midst. It will also make the college student adventure activists wary and the folks just out for a quick looting consider whether a flat-screen is worth doing real time. Those are real benefits and should not stop anyone who wants to peaceably assemble and petition their government for a redress of grievances. But it will serve as a reminder the word “peaceably” is in there for a reason. Another major damage the designation has on their efforts is the prohibition of financing and material support for terrorism. This won’t deter the diehards who believe rioting is just a warm-up. They will be targets of the increased law enforcement and surveillance powers enabled by the terror designation. This is important due to the very nature of an anarchistic movement like Antifa. They don’t organize as much as they flock together in common cause. That makes identifying, tracking and catching them difficult. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER A whole array of online surveillance and nationwide warrant capabilities allow our federal law enforcement agencies to watch and identify their members and plans as well as gather evidence if crimes have already been committed. Without the designation the diffuse nature of Antifa makes it very tough to jump through all the hoops needed to make this happen. Another major damage the designation has on their efforts is the prohibition of financing and material support for terrorism. While Antifa operations are not particularly high budget, they do cost money and require some types of expertise. Anyone providing that type of support will now find themselves in jeopardy. Antifa and other radical left organizers often pay protesters. Drying up that funding stream and ensuring other groups sympathetic to their cause can’t financially support them will severely hamper their efforts. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP One more positive aspect of this action is to show the vast majority of people in this country that this type of terror against them and their livelihoods will not be tolerated. The avowed goal of Antifa and the other radicals with these riots is to create fear and force changes that will appease the attackers. The governors and mayors have the still difficult task of reining in the current violence. This action by the president will make it less likely another one will happen, or if it does, that those responsible pay a heavy price. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY JIM HANSON

 Just a week ago, newspapers all across our country listed the names on their front pages of thousands of Americans killed by COVID-19. More than 100,000 Americans have perished from the coronavirus. And, as I have repeatedly pointed out, nearly 23 percent of these deaths are African-Americans, even though we black people make up only 13 percent of the U.S. population. WHEN WILL THIS END? There is another invisible disease afflicting our country, and that disproportionally impacts African-Americans. This disease is the insidious systemic racism that killed George Floyd on Memorial Day. JUAN WILLIAMS: GEORGE FLOYD DEATH – NO MORE US VS. THEM POLICING. THESE CHANGES WILL BRING HEALING As primarily peaceful protests spread across our country, at the same time as the death toll from the pandemic finally begins to drop, I urge newspapers to list three more names on their front pages: George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery. These three African-Americans were killed in the past months. Not by the coronavirus. But by racism. WHEN WILL THIS END? If I had it my way, I would urge newspapers to list on their front pages the names of all African-Americans killed by racism. But, sadly, newspapers don’t have enough print to do so. I hope that you already know the facts of the tragic killings of Mr. Floyd, Ms. Taylor and Mr. Arbery, all slain since February. But, if not, here is a brief summary. On May 25, George Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American man, was killed while being arrested by a white police officer in Minneapolis, Minn. As shown in video footage, Floyd was handcuffed and pinned to the ground for several minutes by the officer’s knee on his neck. Even as Floyd repeatedly pleaded, “I can’t breathe,” the officer continued to pin Floyd to the ground until he stopped breathing. Floyd was pronounced dead at a local hospital less than an hour later. On Friday, May 29, the police officer, Derek Chauvin, was charged with murder and manslaughter. On March 13, Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old African-American woman, was shot eight times and killed by three police officers inside her home in Louisville, Ky. Taylor was an emergency medical technician and an aspiring nurse. The police were executing a “no-knock” search warrant for narcotics in Taylor’s home, but no drugs were reportedly found. Remarkably, to date, none of the police officers has been identified, arrested or charged in Taylor’s murder.

       On Feb. 23, Ahmaud Arbery, a 26-year-old African-American man who was jogging in Satilla Shores, Ga., was chased by two white men and killed. As shown, yet again in video footage, one of the white men had a shotgun and three shots were fired. Arbery tried to run away, staggered, fell to the ground and died. Shockingly, it wasn’t until May 7, two and a half months after Arbery died, that the two men, Gregory McMichael, a former police officer, and his son Travis McMichael, were arrested and charged with murder. And it took nearly three months for the white man who took the video while Arbery was being chased, William Bryan Jr., to also be charged with murder. WHEN WILL THIS END? Why do innocent African-Americans keep getting killed by the police? And why are these murders even more horrific, in that they occurred in the middle of one of the deadliest pandemics in American history? Why do innocent African-Americans keep getting killed by the police? And why are these murders even more horrific, in that they occurred in the middle of one of the deadliest pandemics in American history?  Because the current president of the United States has shown no leadership outside of his twitter rantings. Days after Floyd’s murder the president tweeted, at 1 a.m., in response to growing protests of Mr. Floyd’s murder, "These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won't let that happen. ... Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!" Rather than leading our country and bringing the country together by calling for calm and unity, Trump instead ratchets up the rhetoric of violence and division. In doing so, as many have pointed out, the president’s use of the phrase "when the looting starts, the shooting starts," was the exact same phrase used by a racist police chief in Miami in 1967 during his department’s violent policing of communities of color and its response to the civil rights movement. The White House denies that Trump was aware of this phrase’s origin. Yeah, right! So, I ask again: WHEN WILL THIS END? CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER This will end when we all work together to eradicate racism, denounce white supremacy and work toward healing and reconciliation. It will end when we work together as community leaders, elected leaders, houses of worship and all others, including the business community, to help alleviate the unnecessary pain of centuries of systemic racism. This will end, when we all have the courage to recognize and respect points of view different from our own. This will end when our politics are about compromise and not always about political combat. The time has come, for us to come together. One Nation under God, indivisible for liberty and justice for all. Then this will end. This will end when our leaders, including public safety officials, take responsibility to train members of their workforce. When we have leaders who, rather than blaming everyone and everything else for his own failures, step up and work across barriers to build bridges of understanding. Leaders who  have  empathy, rather than indifference. Who unify and protect our country, including communities of color, rather than divide us and pit red and blue states against each other. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP I pray this will end, or at the very least begin to end, with each of us reflecting on what we can do to make this better. When we elect leaders who will unify our country in its fight to defeat systemic racism and stop the murders of innocent African-American men and women. All of these tragic deaths, by the pandemic and by the police, WILL END! CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM DONNA BRAZILE

 Republicans and Democrats in the Senate are unifying around three infrastructure bills to fix America’s highways, ports and water systems. The bipartisan pieces of legislation are the result of input from every U.S. senator and – as of last month – all three have passed out of committee with unanimous support. As our country begins to open back up, these bills will help get the American people and the American economy moving again. They will provide an immediate boost by creating jobs, while providing the long-term benefit of efficiently moving goods and services across the country. Meanwhile, Democrats in the House or Representatives are at a partisan standstill. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and House Transportation Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., have put out nothing other than a partisan outline calling for massive government spending over the next five years. ANDREW McCARTHY: ANTIFA TERRORIST DESIGNATION – TRUMP MOVE UNNECESSARY. HERE'S WHY The dollar amounts included in the plan accompany a laundry list of liberal priorities. Instead of working on bipartisan infrastructure solutions with House Republicans, House Democrats seem focused on writing a second “Green New Deal.” The framework includes measures to make federal buildings carbon-neutral and to eliminate transportation-related emissions altogether. Included in the colossal spending total was over $100 billion for public transit systems. This represents a 72 percent increase over current funding levels. The top reason Democrats gave for spending so much on public systems was not efficiency or public mobility, but the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. As our nation grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic and continues to implement social distancing, it’s clear Americans will rely more on cars, roads and bridges and less on public transportation. A recent survey found 20 percent of people who took buses, trains and subways regularly before the virus will now avoid them in the future. Another 28 percent plan to use them less frequently. That’s nearly half of the people who use public transportation. Even in response to the health crisis, House Democrats have continued to pound the drum for partisan ideas. In March, House leaders floated legislative language to create a “cash-for-clunkers” program for airlines as part of emergency coronavirus relief legislation. At the same time, they wanted to hold hostage financial aid to the airlines by making it conditional on restrictive emissions reductions. Instead of keeping airlines flying, House Democrats prioritized punishing new regulations. Infrastructure is critical to our economic recovery. Senators want to take up the combined bills, once the immediate health crisis is behind us.   While House Republicans have been eager to work on bipartisan infrastructure legislation, House Democrats have excluded them entirely. In response to the House Democrats’ framework, Rep. Sam Graves of Missouri – the top Republican on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee – said, “Any serious effort toward enacting infrastructure legislation must incorporate Republican principles as well.” It’s become clear that House Democrats aren’t serious. By contrast, Democrats and Republicans in the Senate are working hand in hand on meaningful infrastructure legislation. Last year, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee – which I chair – advanced the most substantial highway infrastructure legislation in history. The bill will invest billions of dollars in our highways and bridges. It will Increase funds for every state. The overwhelming majority of that money will go directly to state, tribal and local governments. This is good for two reasons. First, local leaders can determine which road and bridge projects are top priorities. And second, it allows funds to be spent more quickly, so people can get to work. Similarly, our committee – on a bipartisan basis – has written and passed two water infrastructure bills to rebuild America’s ports, levees, dams, waterways and drinking water systems. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER The three bills together will help cut government red tape, make communities safer and create much-needed jobs. Liberals and conservatives alike support these three bills. President Donald Trump called for the highway bill to pass in his State of the Union Address and every committee member, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has voted in favor of all three pieces of legislation. Infrastructure is critical to our economic recovery. Senators want to take up the combined bills, once the immediate health crisis is behind us. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Democrats in the House should follow the Senate’s lead. It’s time to find real solutions for the American people and economy. Infrastructure should be bipartisan. The Senate is ready to pass major legislation. The Democrat-led House of Representatives is nowhere close. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM SEN. JOHN BARRASSO

Andy McCarhty suggests what law enforcement can do to crack down on Antifa and what Trump must do to restore order According to President Trump and his most ardent supporters, he is a “disruptor” here to shake up established Washington ways. Nevertheless, in announcing that he will “designate” Antifa, the far-left radical movement, as a terrorist organization, he is pulling a page from the Swamp’s playbook. It is political rhetoric portrayed as legally significant action to bring to heel an array of sociopaths that, to be sure, are playing their now familiar instigator’s role in the rioting that roils American cities. ANDREW McCARTHY: LAWS AGAINST RIOTING AND TERRORISM MUST BE ENFORCED AGAINST ANTIFA AND OTHER VIOLENT RADICALS The purported designation would be pointless, in that the means of taking aggressive enforcement action against Antifa, and against domestic terrorism generally, are plentiful and ready to hand. The president’s move would also be legally invalid because, under federal law and for very sound reasons, designation is available only for foreign terrorist organizations. Antifa is a domestic enterprise. The name “Antifa” has a European pedigree, going back to the self-described anti-fascist movements of the radical Left, beginning in the 1920s. And there are some overseas groups that also use the name. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER To the extent, however, that Antifa has a relevant identifiable existence as an entity promoting seditionist violence in the United States, it is as a loosely knit, interstate American group (as much as Antifa itself would be repulsed at the thought of being part of AmeriKKKa and fancies itself as an agent of global anarchism). As the New York Times has reported, Antifa is organized in local autonomous cells around the country. Though it is said to lack “official” leaders, it does have operatives who move across the country making mayhem. More significantly for present purposes, on Sunday (the same day the president’s imminent designation of Antifa was announced), the Trump Justice Department branded Antifa a domestic terrorist group. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As Attorney General Bill Barr’s press statement put it, “the violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly.” CLICK HERE TO READ THE REST OF THIS COLUMN IN THE NATIONAL REVIEW CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY ANDREW MCCARTHY

 The tragedy of the riots sparked by George Floyd’s death was brought home by a distraught elderly black woman interviewed by the local ABC affiliate in her ruined south Minneapolis neighborhood. “These people did this for no reason,” wept Stephanie Wilford, who lives in an apartment next to where shops were looted and burned Friday night. “They went straight to ... every store over here that I go to. I have nowhere to go now and I have no way to get there because the buses aren’t running.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER The violence “is not going to bring George back.

South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, Republican member of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, joins Chris Wallace on 'Fox News Sunday.' Just as we begin to see a light out from the threat of COVID-19, the threats of racism and abuse of power rear their ugly heads. The unnecessary death of George Floyd at the hands of a white police officer is yet another symptom of a societal virus that is more difficult to eradicate than any physical disease we’ve faced. Racism continues to claim American lives, and we seem no closer to a cure than we are to finding a vaccine for COVID-19. As a father and an American citizen, I unequivocally condemn the racism, abuse of power and evil that were demonstrated not only in the instances of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor but also in countless other cases. I mourn with the African-American community for the losses they have endured. NICK HALL: GEORGE FLOYD RESPONSE — MINNEAPOLIS PASTOR OFFERS 3 ACTIONS STEPS FOR JUSTICE Yet, while I can easily call out the evil for what it is, I’ll be the first to say that I do not have all of the answers. The solution for this great evil can only come from a posture of listening to those who have been victimized by it. The majority of us who live outside of the black community cannot begin to imagine living in continuous fear of our rights. In the great opposition of establishing the Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln once said, “Whenever I hear anyone arguing for slavery, I feel a strong impulse to see it tried on him personally.” Until we inform ourselves of the injustices, racism and wrongdoings ingrained in the daily reality for African-Americans, we cannot begin to activate a deep desire for these wrongs to be made right. While it may be difficult for me to understand the unique experiences of my fellow Americans who live this reality every day, I can join them in hoping for a more just and equal future. In desperate circumstances, the potential for hope in our lives can easily be overlooked and underutilized. How we handle one challenge can often determine how we manage future trials in life. Hope offers endless benefits. Hope gives us peace, joy and courage in the face of pain. Hope helps us choose endurance rather than throwing in the towel. The hope of a better future drives us to confront the horrors of the present. Have we fully engaged our responsibility for racial justice? Do we genuinely hope for a future of equality and freedom untainted by fear?  In 1863, President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation because he hoped for a great America. In 1955, Rosa Parks declined an order to move out of her seat because she hoped for a better future. In 1963, when Martin Luther King Jr., made his “Dream” speech and led a nonviolent march on Washington, D.C., he hoped that racial prejudice would be a thing of the past. Following the senseless murders of these American citizens, many of us outside of the black community may share our disappointment and outrage on social media. We may offer our condolences to our black friends, co-workers and the community around us. But we must ask ourselves: CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Have we fully engaged our responsibility for racial justice? Do we genuinely hope for a future of equality and freedom untainted by fear? We may think that sharing a post or verbal dismay at these situations is enough support. Yet we have forgotten that for a real change to occur, hope must be activated in our lives, and true hope is most authentically reflected in our actions toward that which we hope for. When we truly embody hope, it ought to have a considerable effect on us. It should impact the way we think, talk and act. It should cause us to be quiet in moments we may speak out, speak up when we'd typically stay quiet, and ignite in us a righteous anger when we would typically turn our heads. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP For those of us watching these injustices take place, it is time we get off the sidelines and begin to activate a hope for racial justice. We must call ourselves, our families, our communities and our nation to a higher standard. True, life-changing hope is not just a feeling or a sentiment. It is a call to action. It is time for our nation to activate and actualize a hope for the millions who live in fear of their lives and fear of their freedoms. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM DR. KENT INGLE

 For most of Donald Trump’s brief political career, chaos has been his friend.

 Editor’s Note: This is the second in a two-part series on Rod Rosenstein’s upcoming testimony before Congress. Part one can be found here.  Former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein played a central role in the Russia hoax. He was vindictive, conniving and unscrupulous as he sought to destroy the very president he pretended to support and serve.  On Wednesday, Rosenstein will finally be questioned about his actions by the Senate Judiciary Committee as its first witness into an investigation of the origins and evolution of the Russia probe that was opened by the FBI in the summer of 2016. Ten months later —thanks to Rosenstein— it morphed into a special counsel case that dragged on for an agonizing 22 months.    It was Rosenstein who presided over the special counsel investigation of President Trump, all the while conspiring behind the scenes to overthrow him. The duplicity was classic Rosenstein.  GREGG JARRETT: IN RUSSIA COLLUSION HOAX, ROD ROSENSTEIN MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR FLAGRANT MISCONDUCT He well knew that his appointment of Robert Mueller in May of 2017 was an illegitimate abuse of power and contrary to federal regulations governing the naming of a special counsel, as explained in my last column. At the time, there was no evidence that Trump or his campaign had colluded with Russia to steal the 2016 presidential election. It was all there in the FBI files, hidden from the public but readily available to Rosenstein.  Months earlier in January of 2017, the FBI had debunked the anti-Trump “dossier” as little more than scurrilous lies, exaggerations and fiction. There was no other credible evidence of a collusion conspiracy. James Comey’s FBI knew it, and so did Rosenstein. Yet, he was undeterred. In a fit of anger, he hired Mueller for an investigation in search of a crime, which is anathema to the rule of law. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER The White House was understandably shocked. And so were other top officials at the Department of Justice (DOJ). As I recounted in my book, "Witch Hunt: The Story Of The Greatest Mass Delusion In American Political History" (page 155), Rosenstein was allegedly confronted in his office over what he had done: “Rosenstein was literally cowering … hiding behind and somewhat below his desk. ‘Am I gunna get fired?’ blubbered Rosenstein.”   It is a scathing indictment of Rosenstein’s lack of character that he only seemed to care about himself. Never mind that he had launched — on his own authority — a national nightmare that would hobble the presidency for two more years, divide Americans over an unfounded scandal and inflict profound damage to our system of justice. Why did Rosenstein appoint Mueller? It was an act of retaliation. The deputy attorney general was furious that Democrats in Congress blamed him for the firing of Comey as FBI director.  Rosenstein, who authored the firing memo, was suddenly “regretful and emotional,” according to people who interacted with him at the time. He became unglued and blamed Trump for all the criticism. Mueller was Rosenstein’s revenge. But hiring the special counsel was merely the first part of Rosenstein’s nefarious scheme. Part two constituted one of the most diabolical plots in American political history.  The Attempted Coup            The moment Comey was fired by the president, Rosenstein began meeting secretly with Comey’s temporary replacement, acting FBI director Andrew McCabe (who was later fired for lying). McCabe decided to initiate a new FBI investigation of Trump simultaneous with Rosenstein’s appointment of Mueller as special counsel. In other words, they double-teamed Trump even though neither one had a scintilla of evidence to justify their actions.  At the same time, Rosenstein and McCabe convened repeatedly behind closed doors to discuss a plan to evict the duly elected president of the United States from office and undo the 2016 election results. According to McCabe, it was Rosenstein’s idea to depose Trump by secretly recording the president for the purpose of gathering incriminating evidence of something —anything. Armed with such supposed evidence, he would recruit cabinet members to remove Trump under the 25th Amendment Here is what McCabe later told CBS’s "60 Minutes":     “The deputy attorney general offered to wear a wire into the White House. He said, ‘I never get searched when I go into the White House, I could easily wear a recording device, they wouldn’t know it was there.’ Now, he wasn’t joking, he was absolutely serious, and in fact, he brought it up in the next meeting we had.”     McCabe didn’t stop there in unraveling the sordid story. He explained how Rosenstein intended to use whatever evidence he might gather furtively as a basis for convincing cabinet officials to remove Trump from office.  “Discussion of the 25th Amendment was simply, Rod raised the issue and discussed it with me in the context of thinking about how many other cabinet officials might support such an effort.” McCabe claimed that Rosenstein was already “counting votes” among cabinet members he had contacted surreptitiously. Government memos confirm this account, and those documents were handed over to Mueller. Did he do anything about it? Of course not. The special counsel report made no mention of it.          The Senate Judiciary Committee must confront Rosenstein about his warrant application. The Justice Department has stated that it was illegally obtained without probable cause. The plot to carry out the equivalent of a coup would have been a lawless misuse of power. The 25th Amendment provides for the removal of a president if he is incapacitated or “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.” Disliking a president or his decision-making is not a basis for evicting him from office under the amendment.  When the story of Rosenstein’s scheme was later revealed in news reports, he dismissed the story as “inaccurate and factually incorrect.” But in his meticulously worded statement to the media, he did not deny seeking an illegitimate basis for removing Trump. It was a canny misdirection and quite typical of Rosenstein’s propensity for deflection. In a bid to hang on to his job, Rosenstein arranged a meeting with Trump. Here is what the president told me about their conversation: President Trump: He (Rosenstein) said it didn’t happen. He said he never said it. What he told other people is that he was joking. But to me, he claimed he never said it.   Jarrett: Did you believe him?  President: I didn’t really know what to believe.    So which was it? A joke or a fiction? Logically, it cannot be both. During which account was Rosenstein telling the truth? In one of them, he must have been lying.  On Wednesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee must grill Rosenstein in detail about his attempted coup to remove the president and subvert democracy. Spying On Carter Page The four successive surveillance warrants to spy on former Trump campaign associate Carter Page were serial abuses of constitutional rights and the legal process. Factual assertions submitted to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) were not just wrong, they were never validated as true even though the FBI and DOJ officials who signed the documents swore that the information was, indeed, verified. The applications were filled with errors, omissions, deceptions and lies.  Rosenstein signed off on the final renewal in June of 2017 shortly after he wrongfully appointed the special counsel and schemed to depose Trump from office. The deputy attorney general was desperate to come up with some kind of evidence that would justify what he had already done.  The FBI and Rosenstein relied almost entirely on the “dossier” composed by ex-British spy Christopher Steele. It was phony on its face. It was commissioned by the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democrats. Newly declassified documents show that it was nothing more than malicious Russian disinformation. By January of 2017, the FBI knew this. Surely, Rosenstein knew it too. All of this was concealed from the judges. Yet, he affixed his signature on the warrant to spy on Page, thereby representing to the court that the information was both true and verified when he must have known that it was not. Lying to a court constitutes fraud and other potential crimes. Rosenstein was well aware of this, as any lawyer would be.  Consider what he said at a public forum several months after he signed the warrant application: “In order to get a FISA warrant, you need an affidavit signed by a career law enforcement officer who swears the information is true… And if it is wrong, that person is going to face consequences. You can face discipline and sometimes prosecution.”        Rosenstein’s words frame a prophetic indictment of his own wrongful and, arguably, illegal actions. He swore the information was true and verified. The opposite was true. Rosenstein was acutely aware that the FBI had spent months trying in vain to verify the evidence. A month after his public remarks, Rosenstein was questioned by the House Judiciary Committee. He refused to answer direct questions but suggested that he might not have even read the warrant application that he signed. Grudgingly, he admitted that he did not always read what he was signing.  It is ironic that the man who so sternly lectured an audience about how imperative it was for every prosecutor to ensure that a spy warrant contained truthful information is the same man who may never have bothered to read the one he signed against Carter Page. Or perhaps he read it but didn’t care about the many lies and misrepresentations contained therein. On Wednesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee must confront Rosenstein about his warrant application. The Justice Department has stated that it was illegally obtained without probable cause. It has Rosenstein’s dirty fingerprints all over it.  Attorney General William Barr has denounced government officials for their “misconduct,” “malfeasance and misfeasance” and “clear abuse of the FISA process.” Rosenstein was an integral part of it.  Barr has said that officials “misled the FISA court, omitted critical exculpatory facts from their filings and suppressed or ignored information negating the reliability of their principal source.”  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Rosenstein is far more guilty than others. As the highest-ranking official involved, he had a special and affirmative duty to ensure that the law was being scrupulously followed. His chronic failures and malevolent actions, as described above, constitute an egregious breach of trust. Come Wednesday, senators in their questioning of Rosenstein should give no quarter in demanding honest answers from a man who has shown no regard for either honesty or justice.

 It was bad enough when New York Democrats and Gov. Andrew Cuomo enacted the “Green Light Law” in January that allowed illegal immigrants to legally obtain driver’s licenses. Yes, those who are in the country in violation of federal law were granted the privilege of obtaining a state driver’s license by New York politicians. “Green Light” is an appropriate name because this law gives illegal immigrants a green light to disrespect our immigration laws and our sovereignty. That law also forbids state Department of Motor Vehicle (DMV) agencies from sharing data with immigration authorities like Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP). This was beyond even what other states had done with similar laws. NEWT GINGRICH: CORONAVIRUS AND SENIORS — CUOMO SOLD THEM OUT. HERE ARE THE ASTONISHING DETAILS Of course, none of this squares with the Real ID Act but that doesn’t matter. This is about fighting President Trump, about being part of the resistance. Now a bad law has gotten even worse. In the New York state budget signed by Cuomo in April, an amendment was added to the “Green Light Law” that makes it a Class E felony for officials to share DMV information with an agency like ICE or the Department of Homeland Security that enforces immigration laws. You read that right. New York politicians passed a law that makes it a felony for law enforcement to work with law enforcement. If we have learned anything from the 9-11 Commission, it was that law enforcement agencies should always communicate and work with each other. The left will say these agencies don’t need to work together, that this is immigration enforcement overreach. They are misleading the public. This is about knowingly hiding information about those here in violation of federal law, many of whom are criminals. Entering this country illegally is a crime, but I am not talking about that. ICE’s most recent data shows that 89 percent of those the agency arrests in the U.S. either have a criminal conviction or have criminal charges pending against them, in addition to entering the country illegally. That’s right, almost nine out of 10. The Green Light Law and its latest amendment clearly place a political agenda ahead of public and officer safety. But that remaining 11 percent is important too. Remember, at least three of the 9-11 hijackers had overstayed their visas and were illegal immigrants at the time of the attacks. They did not have any criminal history at the time. I’m not saying that all illegal immigrants are terrorists or criminals. Most are not. But how many are too many? I’d say one. During my tenure as acting director, ICE took over 5,000 criminal illegal immigrants off the streets of New York. Cuomo should be sending a thank you letter to ICE for helping keep communities in his state safe, not keeping information away from them. The Border Patrol also arrests not only illegal immigrants but many individuals who are criminals and public safety threats. Consider how this new amendment affects them. J.P. Kennedy, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of New York, said it best: “Border Patrol, for example, working the highway in the middle of the night, pulls over a vehicle. They can’t run the plates to determine who owns that vehicle. I think it’s legislating obstruction and it’s very concerning to me.” CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Kennedy says the amendment was passed quietly, while the world was focused on a global pandemic, and raises concerns for the safety and security of New York residents. I agree with him 100 percent and I raised the same concerns months ago when the Green Light Law first passed. It is obstruction and the Department of Justice needs to investigate and take action. Imagine if the federal government responded in kind, refusing New York law enforcement officers access to the National Crime Information Center database. That would be devastating to state law enforcement. But of course, Attorney General William Barr and President Trump would never do that because they care about the safety of all law enforcement officers and the people they protect. As he has proven over and over again, the president has the back of our cops. The same is true of Border Patrol and ICE officers. Even though New York has passed a law that puts them at risk, the men and women of these two agencies will never turn their back on New York cops. They would not hesitate to put their lives on the line for fellow officers, ensuring that they can go home to their families at night. You cannot outlaw the camaraderie among law enforcement officers. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Green Light Law and its latest amendment clearly place a political agenda ahead of public and officer safety. Every New York legislator who supported this law should visit the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington and explain to the families of fallen officers, include more than 200 from the Border Patrol and ICE, why they turned their back on those who serve. These officers gave their lives helping keep this country safe while politicians slept soundly in their beds at night. This Green Light Law, sooner or later, will cause more names to be added to that same wall. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY TOM HOMAN

 The fear of police among black and brown people can be puzzling to whites who find comfort in the famous “Thin Blue Line” between them and criminals. But the video showing the shocking death of George Floyd under the knee of a Minneapolis policeman makes black fear of the police – especially among black men – a reality for people of all races to see. Now comes the hard part. NICK  HALL: GEORGE FLOYD RESPONSE — MINNEAPOLIS PASTOR OFFERS 3 ACTION STEPS FOR JUSTICE Black or white, Asian or Latino, native born or immigrant, we all need police. And poor people, disproportionately people of color who often live with high rates of crime, need good police the most. Crime drives down property values and pushes out retail stores. It can be just as poisonous as banks and insurance companies using red lines on maps to show where they cut off poor neighborhoods as not worthy of investment for home mortgages or home improvement. It is just as destructive as district lines that separate good schools from bad schools. When people with power signal they are OK with police harassing “those people” it can lead to daily tension that like a burning fuse, is sure to lead to an explosion of outrage after the officer is videotaped pushing his knee into an unconscious man’s neck. And it inevitably leads to fear and sometimes outbursts of anger among young people of color who feel stigmatized and unfairly harassed by the police. Even worse, it sometimes leads to police thinking that roughing up people on the wrong side of town is their job since the powerful never raise a voice against it. The key here for all Americans, but especially for white people at the top of the corporate and political ladder, is to take on the job of shifting a morally corrupt mindset that celebrates the police as a buffer – the Thin Blue Line – between the poor and people in the better parts of town. That failure of conscience by community officials leads police to use skin color as a shorthand as they assess the threat posed by a citizen.  Americans with money and political power can demand respect from public police forces and even buy private security. And they can turn away from police harassment of teen and young adult black males – remember “stop and frisk” – as a necessary police tactic because of higher rates of crime in poor neighborhoods. That kind of thinking – us against them – leads to excusing police abuse of “those people.” That failure of conscience by community officials leads police to use skin color as a shorthand as they assess the threat posed by a citizen. The result of that twisted logic is too often the mistreatment of black people of any economic class because they are not seen as citizens first but as a threat on the basis of skin color. That kind of thinking can lead to harmful, racial stereotyping of a young black man taking a run across town. It can lead to a white woman threatening a black man by telling police that she is in danger from a black man, knowing the police are more likely to believe her lie than his truth that she got angry after he asked her to obey the law. In this moment healing can only come from shared purpose, the tissue of community reconnecting to bridge the wound. It is already on view in Minneapolis, where black and white citizens can be seen with shovels, brooms and “Go-Fund-Me" donations helping to repair the mindless damage done when legitimate, peaceful protests are taken over by violence. And healing will come when leaders in government, in business and in culture agree to take on the daily work of sending the message to their community that the police are here to protect everyone from crime. Healing will lead to peace when the police chief, the mayor, the governor and the president repeat the message that police are here to protect everyone. Healing means insisting that police do all they reasonably can to show respect for citizens of all colors. That means people at their best, people at their worst. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER That kind of policing is the best because it will make us all safer. It is hard work to defeat a racial stereotype that has been around for so long. But the best policing begins by successfully crossing racial lines to reach from the poorest neighborhood to the wealthiest with standards in line with the eponymous police pledge to protect and serve all citizens – not just us from them.

 Recent racially charged incidents including the tragic death of George Floyd have stirred ensuing riots and torn open the rawest of wounds – racism. Judging a person according to skin color is an ancient sin. For that reason, God gave this ancient solution. In the earliest words of Scripture, God spoke: “Let us make human beings in our image, make them reflecting our nature so they can be responsible for the fish in the sea, the birds in the air, the cattle, and, yes, Earth itself, and every animal that moves on the face of Earth” (Genesis 1:26). Embedded in these words is the most wonderful of promises: God made us to reflect his image. PAUL BATURA: PENTECOST AT A TIME OF CHAOS, PAIN – THESE FRUITS OF THE SPIRIT CAN BEGIN HEALING PROCESS No one is a god except in his or her own delusion. But everyone carries some of the communicable attributes of God. Wisdom. Love. Grace. Kindness. A longing for eternity. We are made in his image. Sin has distorted this image, but it has not destroyed it. Our moral purity has been tainted. Our intellect is polluted by foolish ideas. We have fallen prey to the elixir of self-promotion rather than God-promotion. The image of God is sometimes difficult to discern. But do not think for a moment that God has rescinded his promise or altered his plan. He still creates people in his image to bear his likeness and reflect his glory. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Pop psychology is wrong when it tells you to look inside yourself and find your value. The magazines are wrong when they suggest you are only as good as you are thin, muscular, pimple-free or perfumed. The movies mislead you when they imply that your value increases as your stamina, intelligence or net worth does. Religious leaders lie when they urge you to grade your significance according to your church attendance, self-discipline or spirituality. According to the Bible you are good simply because God made you in his image. Period. He cherishes you because you bear a semblance to him. And you will only be satisfied when you engage in your role as an image-bearer of God. Such was the view of King David. “As for me, I will see your face in righteousness. I shall be satisfied when I awake in your likeness” (Psalm 17:15). How much sadness would evaporate if every person simply chose to believe this: I was made for God’s glory and am being made into his image. Would you let this truth find its way into your heart? You were conceived by God before you were conceived by your parents. You were loved in heaven before you were known on earth. You are not an accident. You aren’t a random fluke of genetics or evolution. You aren’t defined by the number of pounds you weigh, followers you have, car you drive or clothes you wear. You are made in God’s image. Print that on your resume. You are a diamond, a rose and a jewel, purchased by the blood of Jesus Christ. In the eyes of God you are worth dying for. Would you let this truth define the way you see yourself? Would you let this truth define the way you see other people?  Every person you see was created by God to bear His image and deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. This means that all people deserve to be seen for who they are: image-bearers of God. Imagine the impact this promise would have upon the society that embraced it. What civility it would engender! What kindness it would foster! Racism will not flourish when people believe their neighbor bears God’s image.  Why does God love you with an everlasting love? It has nothing to do with you. It has everything to do with whose you are. The fire of feuds will have no fuel when people believe their adversaries are God’s idea. Will a man abuse a woman? Not if he believes she bears the stamp of God. Will a boss neglect an employee? Not if she believes the employee bears a divine spark. Will society write off the indigent, the mentally ill, the inmate on death row or the refugee? Not if we believe, truly believe, that every human being is God’s idea. And he has no bad ideas. Parents and grandparents understand the implications of this truth. I recall when my daughter Jenna was pregnant with our first grandchild. She was round as a ladybug. Long before Jenna gave birth to Rosie, I loved our granddaughter. I’d never seen her, but I loved her. She’d done nothing to earn my love. But I loved her. She’d never brought me coffee or called me papa. She’d never sung me a song or danced for me a dance. She’d done nothing! Yet I loved her already. I would do anything for her. That is not hyperbole. Why? Why did I love her so? Because she carries some of me. A small part for sure, but a part of me, nonetheless. Why does God love you with an everlasting love? It has nothing to do with you. It has everything to do with whose you are. You are his. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP How can we respect our neighbors? What is God’s solution to angry racism that gives birth to violence and bloodshed? Government programs might help. Lectures might enlighten. But, in the end, God’s plan is the only plan: see every person on the planet as God’s idea. And He has no bad ideas. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM MAX LUCADO

 “No justice, no peace!” This is the cry ringing through the Twin Cities as buildings are burning and businesses are boarded to protect against riots filling our streets. I drove through my hometown, Minneapolis, over the weekend, and what I saw resembled more the war-torn places I’ve been in overseas than the white-collar city I know. I couldn’t help but think of Isaiah 59:15, “The Lord saw it, and it displeased him that there was no justice.” ALVEDA KING: AS RIOTS SPREAD ACROSS US, HEED WORDS OF MY UNCLE MARTIN LUTHER KING TO END VIOLENCE AND RACISM George Floyd’s death at the hands of police officers last week has triggered an avalanche of anger that has spilled over the streets of not only our Twin Cities but also New York, Los Angeles, Houston, Atlanta and many other cities across America. The arrest of Derek Chauvin, the officer who pinned Floyd to the ground with his knee, seems to have not quelled the anger many Americans are feeling. As Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said on March 14, 1968: “A riot is the language of the unheard” — and the unheard will be silent no longer. Yet in the midst of this chaos and pain, I was surprised to experience overwhelming hope. As I walked past smoldering buildings and broken people, voices filled the air on a sound system proclaiming peace. And as I stood with neighbors — men and women, both black and white — gathering to pray and call for change at the intersection where the largest riots have been centered, I saw a glimpse of revival. While the images we see on our TVs show arson and theft, what I witnessed was a generation of mostly young black men and women, surrounded by friends from all backgrounds, all unwilling to fit the mold of a culture that highlights crime and controversy over character. They gathered peacefully to express their anger and call for change. They prayed. They cried. They even challenged one another to become cops, lawyers, doctors and preachers. And while most of America may not see these young leaders, they are here in Minneapolis standing in the gap. It is impossible to sensitively respond to issues of racism and injustice if all your relationships are with people just like you, so seek to learn under those different from you. Your life will be enriched, and you just might make a friend!  As a white man, I will never understand what it is like to be followed in a store, abused, harassed or afraid of my loved ones being mistreated because of the color of their skin. But that doesn’t mean I can’t speak up, pray, lend a hand and do whatever I can to work toward justice, unity, equity and peace. For everyone outside Minneapolis, unsure of how to respond, here are three action steps I would encourage: Pray and repent  The first prayer I encourage you to say is the hardest and requires raw honesty from your part: Pray for God to reveal racism in you … and repent. Plainly and simply put, racism is evil. It is sin. Every human being is created in God’s image, and if we don’t see our neighbors in that light, we need to check our hearts and repent. Pray for the men, women and children who are afraid for their lives because of the color of their skin. Mourn with those who mourn. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER And pray for your mayor, governor, police officers, first responders and elected officials. Pray for the safety of those protesting. Pray that the church of the Twin Cities will rise up and lead in this time. I long to see our staff, stages and budgets built in ways that demonstrate our belief that all people have value. Learn about the pain of others   We shouldn’t still have to talk about racism, discrimination and the profiling of our brothers and sisters of color in 2020. But the facts do not lie, and it’s our responsibility to bring change. We need to educate ourselves, to humble ourselves to learn from and about their experience. I encourage you to pick up a book, listen to a podcast or talk with someone who knows about the history of racism, privilege and discrimination in America. Seek relationships with those who are different from you and learn how to love your neighbor. It is impossible to sensitively respond to issues of racism and injustice if all your relationships are with people just like you, so seek to learn under those different from you.

There are countless groups you can learn from and support. ⠀ To all of my friends who are afraid and angry, I am sorry. I am praying for justice.

 George who? The unarmed Minneapolis man who was killed with a cop’s knee in his neck seemed light years away as my neighborhood, and then my intersection, and then my apartment filled with smoke Saturday night.  Around 6 p.m., hundreds of loud, but peaceful, protesters walked up Fourth Avenue toward Manhattan’s Union Square. ”No justice, no peace!” they chanted. “The people, united, will never be defeated,” they promised. ANDREW McCARTHY: LAWS AGAINST RIOTING AND TERRORISM MUST BE ENFORCED AGAINST ANTIFA AND OTHER VIOLENT RADICALS Throughout the late afternoon and early evening, demonstrators lamented Monday’s brutal, police-involved death of George Floyd. Their shouted slogans echoed off apartment buildings as they mustered in Union Square and walked in large numbers, intermittently north, south, east and west.

       Just after dark, yet another crowd of demonstrators headed north on Fourth Avenue as another cadre walked south from 14th Street. The two groups met, mingled, and made noise as scores of NYPD officers stood ground. Within minutes, someone lit a pile of garbage — not a rare find in this town. The flames were not huge, but they were pronounced and menacing, for all that they foreshadowed. The crowd stepped lively west, across the street, as if in deference to the blaze. The police, some in riot helmets, took this as their cue to split the crowd into segments. They formed two lines and stood, shoulder to shoulder, along East 13th and 14th streets. The masses seemed to retreat within a few minutes. Four firemen from FDNY’s Ladder Three Company, steps away on East 13th, walked over, flattened the burning trash with a shovel, and doused the flames with a fire extinguisher. “That settles it,” I reckoned. Bad call. About 20 minutes later, I smelled something burning. I opened my balcony door and saw huge billows of thick, black smoke on 13th Street, between Fourth Avenue and Broadway.  BOOM! Something exploded. What do smoke, scorched aluminum and shards of glass have to do with George Floyd’s needless, wasteful and hideous killing? Nothing.  BOOM! Another blast. I could not see what was alight. But within seconds, flames reflected off the windows of the Regal Union Square, a top-notch tetradecaplex where I savor motion pictures — when America is not menaced by arson within race riots inside an economic implosion tucked into a global pandemic. “My God,” I thought. “The Hyatt Regency Union Square is on fire!” I feared that the hotel’s entire north side would be incinerated. As rioters looted George Floyd's spotlight, I stepped inside and watched Fox News Channel’s live coverage, ironically expecting to find a better angle on this mayhem on TV than from the actual bedlam unfolding half a block from my home Fox News soon revealed the source of this dense, irritating, eye-burning smoke: an NYPD van. It was fully engulfed. Fire raced from its windows. More of New Yorkers’ tax dollars up in flames — this time literally. At least five such NYPD vehicles were badly damaged or destroyed. They now line nearby University Place, where they sit as further victims of Saturday night's anarchy. These far-Left agitators did not spare even a van from the NYPD's Homeless Outreach Unit. Its windshield is bashed in, and its side windows are smashed or busted out completely. So much for the Left's "compassion" for the downtrodden.

He didn’t do this with any sense of purpose or apparent outrage. He did this more casually than if he swatted a fly. The banality of evil in the East Village.

 Following yet another caught-on-video killing of a black man by police, our nation once again is engulfed in the flames of racial tension. In multiple cities, the flames are more than metaphorical as rioters burn vehicles, loot businesses and generally wreak havoc in the streets. Many of the victims of this senseless violence are black small-business owners who have seen their stores heavily damaged or destroyed. As we act immediately to stamp out these riots, our nation must also undertake a fresh and earnest conversation addressing the root causes of these waves of unrest. MORE RIOTS, LOOTING PROMPT CURFEWS, CALLS FOR NATIONAL GUARD IN CITIES, STATES ACROSS US And that discussion starts with a clear-eyed look at the incidents provoking the outrage among people of color in the first place – incidents such as the sickening display of unreasonable and deadly force used by white Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin that led to the death of George Floyd on Monday. As a career prosecutor trained in evaluating evidence and the importance of due process, I have made it my practice to reserve judgment on conduct “caught on tape.” Fundamental fairness requires that we allow for evidence to be properly gathered and reviewed before rendering pronouncements – especially in actions where police conduct is subject to public scrutiny. But we also must be real. We must recognize that there exist far too many indications of blatant police brutality captured on video in real time that reflect a consistent disregard for human life, particularly as it relates to people of color. We cannot deny what we plainly see. The arrest of Chauvin, who has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter and fired from the police force, provides a proper avenue toward accountability for the death of George Floyd. But this arrest does not even come close to addressing the widening divide of racial animus splitting apart American society. These awful cases of black Americans losing their lives at the hands of police have simply become too much of a regular pattern. Aside from the most tragic incidents resulting in deaths, we see the ugly bubbling to the surface of anti-black prejudice even in the smaller details of daily life. Our Constitution guarantees the right to assemble and protest, but it does not condone anarchy, violence and lawlessness. Consider the exhibition of raw racism caught on another video in which a woman repeatedly used the words “African-American man” as a trigger to falsely depict a black man in Central Park in New York City as dangerous. The clear dismay of the black man, who recorded that encounter, epitomizes the frustration in the black community. While we must seek and encourage peaceful solutions, we must understand that peace and justice can no longer be a one-way street. For me, these issues are personal. My late father was a freedom fighter and NAACP branch president in the 1950s and 1960s. Like my father before me, I am a life member of the NAACP. I appreciate the drive for equality and justice that have produced the civil rights victories of the past and that continue to motivate the push for progress today. And yet no amount of frustration can justify the random destruction of property nor injuries caused to others through violent rioting across the nation, including in my own state of Indiana. Our Constitution guarantees the right to assemble and protest, but it does not condone anarchy, violence and lawlessness – crimes that must be put down quickly and decisively. Furthermore, while shameful conduct by police must be stopped and prevented, the law enforcement community overall deserves our appreciation and support even as we work to improve law enforcement interactions with people of color. I believe the majority of our police officers are worthy of our trust. Let us take a moment to be candid. We all harbor certain stereotypes, preconceptions and implicit biases that influence our beliefs and inform our behavior. We must engage in conversations that encourage us all to confront our own shortcomings in upholding fairness. Therefore, I cling to this hope: Once we recognize that each one of us engages in some type of racial, ethnic, gender or religious stereotyping, then we can be more forgiving and accepting of the shortcomings of others. And we all can work to improve our attitudes and behavior. In cases of gross infringement of people’s civil rights, meanwhile, we still must gird our loins and fight tooth and nail for justice for all. In these cases, we must use the court systems and every legal tool at our disposal. Murderers – even those who wear badges – must pay the appropriate penalties for their crimes. There are times, as Frederick Douglass said, that “it is not light that we need, but fire; it is not the gentle shower, but thunder. We need the storm, the whirlwind, and the earthquake.” CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER In other situations, such as the Central Park incident, we might be surprised at how much we might accomplish simply through civil and respectful dialogue. Our nation is badly in need of racial reconciliation and healing, and it begins by listening and working to understand the concerns of our neighbors.

 Give me a stack of Bibles so I can swear on them this simple fact: The conversion of Norma McCorvey, the Jane Roe of Roe v Wade, to a pro-life position and to faith in Christ, was no act. The assertions gleefully made by abortion advocates that an upcoming documentary show she was lying are about as believable as someone who would presume to tell you that your sibling or best friend was just pretending to be who they were their whole life. My colleague Janet Morana and I were privileged to be by Norma’s side for her journey for 22 years, from her baptism in 1995 to the day of her death in 2017 – a day on which we had our final conversation with her. DR. ALVEDA KING: CLAIM THAT 'JANE ROE' WAS PAID TO JOIN PRO-LIFE CAUSE IS FALSE I received her into the Catholic Church in 1998, as Janet sat next to her. We led her through an intense spiritual and psychological healing process from the wounds she incurred in the abortion industry, had thousands of conversations and spent countless hours both in public and in private, for business and pleasure. The sacrifices Norma made on this journey of healing are not things you can fake. Her life can’t be summarized in an article or in an interview – even with her. One had to see the whole pattern, all the ups and downs, to identify her center of gravity. She was wounded and erratic, and yet knew she was a new creation in Christ; she was needful of help and yet fiercely independent, tender of heart and yet capable of fierce anger and rebellion. I don’t know what the interview was that the documentary is touting, or what was said leading up to it. What I do know is that the conversion and commitment, the agony and the joy I witnessed firsthand for 22 years was not a fake. There is zero percent chance of that. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER In 2013, Norma traveled to New York to celebrate with me as I marked the 25th anniversary of my ordination. On what was one of countless similar occasions, Norma regaled a number of us until late in the night with stories from her life. She was a character, funny and flawed. She was a sinner, just like the rest of us. On the day she died, her daughter Melissa – sensing the end was near – called Janet and me in Rome and we were able to talk to Norma before she passed. She urged us to continue fighting to overturn the unjust decision made in the name of Jane Roe, the persona she had long since outgrown. There was no play-acting in Norma’s final words to us. Everyone will talk about this film for a few days but most won’t care about the truth. There have always been people who have tried to reshape Norma’s story, or get her to reshape it. She resented that and would resent it today. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP If anything, what the other side has to face up to is that Norma rejected abortion before she became pro-life. The day before the pro-abortion press conference in which she was first revealed as the “Roe” of Roe v Wade, she told Gloria Allred that she thought abortion was wrong. And while working in abortion clinics, she talked women out of their abortions. If there was any ambiguity, it was about her commitment to pro-choice, not to pro-life. Our movement should take this wave of negative publicity as a chance to get to know Norma better, and to urge America to get to know better Roe v Wade, a policy of abortion-on-demand throughout pregnancy – a policy that not only Norma but America has rejected.

Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. God tells us repeatedly throughout the Bible that He is trustworthy. This seems simple enough at face value--we know God is good, so we can trust Him, right? Makes sense. But do we live our lives as if we believe it? I think it’s safe to say most of us can find areas where we avoid God,  typically because, through fear or pride, we resist giving Him control over these areas. KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS PROVIDING UP TO $100M IN CORONAVIRUS AID TO CHURCHES STRUGGLING WITH DONATIONS  Sadly, our resistance to release control to God is usually highest in the more important areas of our lives--which ultimately reveals our lack of faith in Him. Whether consciously or not, sometimes we determine the risk is too great to loosen our grip even slightly to make room for God’s timing and will in these areas. Luckily for us, even as we actively resist  Him, God pursues us and works to help us trust Him, one step at a time. God understands us better than we understand ourselves; only He truly knows our full potential. And as strange as it may seem, oftentimes He will increase our confidence and help us reach our potential by first showing us how weak we are without Him. Understanding our limitations will drive us to rely on Him. Jesus spoke about this in His Sermon on the Mount, teaching, “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven”(Matthew 5:3). Pastor Alex Seeley unpacks this in her book, “The Opposite Life.” Seeley points out that although God does not make bad things happen in our lives, He uses them to shape us into the people He created us to be, to bring glory to His kingdom. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER As Romans 8:28 declares, “we know that God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God and are called according to his purpose for them.” Seeley argues that without these trials and, more importantly, our dependence on God in the midst of them, we will never live out our full God-given potential and purpose. God understands us better than we understand ourselves; only He truly knows our full potential. While we all prefer for things to go “as planned” in our lives, we don’t always see the whole picture, because our perspective is limited. But when we surrender our will to God, we tap into His power. It’s important to understand that because God has given us free will, He may not intervene unless we ask Him.  My pastor Manny Hastings of C3 NYC Church frequently says, “God is a gentleman. He will knock on the door, but He will never barge His way into your heart. He will patiently wait for you to invite Him in, but will never stop knocking.” So how do we begin to give God control over these coveted aspects of our lives? It begins simply by talking to Him. We can make our prayers more conversational, admitting our concerns and hesitations, and asking God to help change our hearts to want the same things He desires for us. Beloved evangelist Ravi Zacharias, who passed away earlier this week, wrote, “Prayer is not the means of bringing our wills to pass but the means by which He brings our will into line to gladly receive His will. And what a glad moment that is.” What a beautiful depiction of God’s vision for our relationship with Him. God longs for us to live lives to the fullest, to take us to new heights and to achieve things we never thought possible. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Though there will be trials we have to experience in order for God’s plans for us to unfold, He promises us He will be with us every step of the way (Isaiah 41:10). When we depend on Him rather than ourselves, “We can do all things through Him who strengthens us” (Philippians 4:13). As we give more of ourselves to His will, He will guide us to achieve things for His Kingdom we never would have thought possible. Knowing this,  we can be filled with hope and confidence for whatever may come. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM CHRISTEN LIMBAUGH BLOOM

 From Minneapolis to Manhattan and Atlanta, and in numerous other cities across the United States, one gets the sense that mayhem and evil are on the loose. Did it all start with the horrifying death of George Floyd, an African-American man who died while in police custody? I don’t think so. Wickedness almost always starts from the inside out, often long before a flashpoint ignites an explosion. DEROY MURDOCK: RIOTERS DO INJUSTICE TO GEORGE FLOYD, TORTURED AND KILLED IN A CASE OF POLICE BRUTALITY What we’ve been witnessing the last few days is the product of years of neglect, indifference and outright disrespect toward life. Inherent in such a culture is a disdain for dignity. Every man, woman and child is of inestimable value – “red, brown, yellow, black and white, they are precious in His sight” – as the old children’s Sunday school song goes. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER What’s the answer? Governors can call in the National Guard and President Trump can deploy troops to help restore order. But, in a sense, it will be a fragile peace because neither warriors, for all their good intentions, nor their weapons can reach the real source of man’s wickedness. At the root of our current crisis, and the reason for the madness is our sin and our failure to see that all people are made in God’s image. It was the late Billy Graham who once said, “Jesus made it plain that sin was far more than a wrong act. Anything that is against or contrary to the will of God is sin.” And racism and rioting are clearly against God’s will. Ironically, this latest crisis falls amid a transformative season of the Christian church as Christians celebrate a force that can turn hostile hearts to loving and peaceful ones. In the hierarchy of Christian holy days, Christmas and Easter stand alone. One follows the other, of course. Without the birth of Jesus of Nazareth, there would be no need or reason for His resurrection from the dead 33 years later – a singular, monumental and transformative event upon which every Christian’s faith rests. But there is a third day on the Christian calendar that is woefully understated and under-recognized. I’m referring to the feast of Pentecost – an ancient festival commemorating the day when followers of Jesus believe the Holy Spirit descended from the heavens and rested upon His once scared and frightened apostles. The anniversary of that special day is today – the 50th day after Easter. In Christian teaching, God is three persons in one – God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit. Some theologians even divide history into three corresponding eras based on this triune belief. Prior to Jesus’ three-year ministry, we lived in the era of God the Father. Then there was the brief but substantial era of Jesus. Ever since His ascension, we’ve been living in the era of the Spirit. When the apostle Paul wrote a letter to his friends in Galatia, an area in modern-day Turkey, he reminded them that the “fruit” of the Holy Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.  Pentecost is celebrated in many churches, marked in some by the wearing of red and the reading and singing of relevant Scriptures and hymns. But I’ve long thought it should be way more of a big deal, because the arrival of the Holy Spirit changed everything, most especially the trajectory of the early Christian Church. But speaking more personally, the Holy Spirit didn’t just change the world – He changed me. I remember a day in the sixth grade when it all came together for me. I had an awakening to the Holy Spirit that inexplicably filled me with a confidence and boldness that seemed to put feet to my faith. I was overwhelmed with a sense of peace, assurance and conviction. It was so wonderful that even 36 years later, I can hardly explain it. I didn’t hear any audible voice, but I could sense the Lord telling me, “Paul, you’re ready to go out and share your faith. People may mock and make fun of you, but don’t worry about it. Just tell them in your own words what I am doing for you.” When the apostle Paul wrote a letter to his friends in Galatia, an area in modern-day Turkey, he reminded them that the “fruit” of the Holy Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Rarely have the people of the world needed the “fruit” of the Spirit more than today. There’s an old saying that something too good to be true usually is – but not in this case, nor ever in God’s economy. There are thousands of promises in the Bible, and one of my favorites involves how to bring the Holy Spirit into your life. In reality, it’s also the way to eternal life. It’s from the evangelist Luke: CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.” We’re all a work in progress, but I hope you’ll join me in praying for peace throughout America, and may the power of the Holy Spirit infuse and transform all of us from the inside out.

 Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.  Sign up here.  The epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in the United States is in New York state, particularly the New York City region. As of this writing, New York state has 376,309 confirmed cases and 29,653 deaths — most of which are in New York City. Why is New York the epicenter of the virus? Did the lack of leadership from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D.) and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D.) contribute to increasing the spread of the virus? I try to answer these questions on this week’s episode of my podcast “Newt’s World.” My guest is Dr. Betsy McCaughey, former lieutenant governor of New York from 1995 to 1998 and author of "The Next Pandemic," in which she discusses the coronavirus crisis and how to battle the next pandemic without an economic shutdown. TUCKER CARLSON: CORONAVIRUS AND THE SHOCKING ABUSE HAPPENING IN NURSING HOMES. THIS TRAGEDY WASN'T BY ACCIDENT Of course, the news media has been utterly unwilling to tell the truth about New York state. Cuomo has been portrayed as some Churchillian figure, leading his state through this crisis courageously and effectively. Just a few weeks ago, people were even calling for Cuomo to run for president. Contrast that with the coverage of red-state governors from Georgia, Florida and other places who have been portrayed as heartless and incompetent. In reality, New York has far more infections and deaths than any other state, and it’s because of bad decisions from Cuomo and others, not bad luck. Most egregiously, Cuomo’s Health Department actually mandated that nursing homes accept patients with coronavirus from hospitals. As the pandemic worsened and hospitals in New York filled up with people infected by the virus, hospitals said they needed to move elderly patients into nursing homes with empty beds to make room for others. The state government wouldn’t even let nursing homes require coronavirus testing for admission. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER This process led to an astonishing number of deaths in nursing homes. And McCaughey, who has intimate knowledge of Albany’s inner workings, explains in detail how it all happened because Cuomo sold out New York’s senior citizens to the hospital industry. Indeed, the Greater New York Hospital Association is a massive donor to Cuomo. With so much money at stake, McCaughey argues, Cuomo and his Health Department kowtowed to the hospital industry and chose money over lives. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP We also go beyond New York and look toward the next pandemic by discussing McCaughey’s book. She details how we don’t need to put the country on lockdown to fight a pandemic and can use a number of new technologies that, inexplicably, we don’t seem to be prioritizing now. I hope you will listen to this week’s episode to hear the truth about what is happening in New York and help me think through how we can prepare for the next pandemic. I also hope you will listen to my next episode, set to air Wednesday. We’ll be discussing the future of space exploration and space as an infrastructure investment, topics near and dear to my heart.

 President Trump was right when he placed blame Saturday for the riots tearing apart cities around the country on Antifa and other radical left-wing groups. He should now go one step further and declare Antifa a domestic terrorist organization. The rioting this past week was ostensibly sparked by the death of George Floyd – a 46-year-old black man who was arrested by Minneapolis police Monday for allegedly trying to use a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes. There is no question that Floyd’s death was horrific and should never have happened. But in fact, many of the rioters affiliated with Antifa simply and cynically have used Floyd’s tragic death as an excuse to spread mayhem and destruction. The officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck – Derek Chauvin – was charged Friday with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Chauvin and any other officers who go on trial for Floyd’s death should be punished to the full extent the law allows if convicted. But Floyd’s killing should not be used as an excuse by anyone to justify rioting and domestic terrorism that in many cases has victimized African-American small-business owners and others in many cities. DUELING CLAIMS: TRUMP BLAMES ANTIFA FOR RIOTS, MINNESOTA OFFICIALS POINT FINGERS AT WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND CARTELS “These are ‘Organized Groups’ that have nothing to do with George Floyd. Sad!” Trump tweeted Saturday in describing the rioters. “It’s ANTIFA and the Radical Left. Don’t lay the blame on others!” The president’s accurate description of Antifa fits the definition under federal law of a domestic terror group. Under that definition, such a group breaks laws “to intimidate or coerce a civilian population” or to “influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion.” Antifa claims to be an anti-fascist group dedicated to stopping oppression of marginalized communities. But the group considers law enforcement officers and many government agencies to be among the “oppressors,” along with many others who reject its radical agenda. Antifa members have been advocating for and conducting violence to intimidate for a long time now, but the wave of terror they unleashed this past week makes taking action against them truly urgent. There’s no question that many of those protesting the killing of George Floyd had every right to peacefully express their outrage over his death. But in many cases, Antifa radicals hijacked those legitimate protests to turn them into riots. Antifa sent the word out far and wide to burn buildings, loot stores, destroy cars and attack law enforcement officers. Police agencies warned that Antifa and its many tentacles were using the Floyd protests to further their agenda. "Domestic extremists, including anarchist extremists and other anti-government extremists, are using the unrest in Minneapolis to amplify and justify their calls for dismantling law enforcement agencies and carrying out attacks on law enforcement, government, and capitalist targets," a Philadelphia Police Department bulletin reported. Antifa members have instigated violence many times before and for a variety of leftist causes like shutting down speech they don’t like, armed attacks on Immigrations and Customs Enforcement detention facilities and other anti-police violence. The nexus for violence at any leftist protest will always be a band of black-clad Antifa thugs burning, breaking windows and attacking anyone they see as part of the oppressive system Antifa’s track record of violence is undeniable, but it is a nebulous and diffuse group. Antifa is anarchistic by nature and members are more likely to be squatting in an abandoned building than running a storefront office. Since all terrorist groups operate mostly in the shadows, we must empower our law enforcement and security agencies with all the tools possible to illuminate their malevolent and dangerous activities. These vital tools will become available under the Patriot Act if Antifa is designated as a domestic terrorist group. As a terrorist group, Antifa could have its electronic communications monitored by law enforcement agencies that obtain search warrants. This would enable authorities to gain knowledge of what criminal activity Antifa was up to and more easily prevent violence and apprehend organizers. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER In addition, the terrorist designation would make it a federal offense for Antifa to engage in terrorist attacks and other acts of violence against mass transportation systems. A favorite tactic of Antifa members is to burn buses when rioting. As a terrorist group, they could face federal prosecution for this crime. The terrorist designation would also ban aiding Antifa because that activity would be considered to be providing material support to terrorists and terrorist organizations under federal law. Antifa members often work with other leftist groups, serving as their shock troops. These other activist groups know that they can rely on Antifa to do the burning and breaking, but would themselves be held liable for these crimes if Antifa is officially designated as a terrorist group. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The bottom line we need to keep in mind is that peaceful protesting is a cherished American right – but violent attacks are criminal conduct. By accurately labeling Antifa as a domestic terrorist group we can protect against its terrorist crimes without infringing on the rights of the rest of us to protest and exercise our rights of free speech under the First Amendment of the Constitution.

Dr. Alveda King, niece of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., says Americans need to come together as one people to end violence and racism. As we see cities burning across America following the senseless killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis on Monday, there is a cry to heaven going up across America: Lord, please heal our land! It is a cry for unity, for social justice, for safety and for an end to hatred. There is a unique opportunity for leaders of our families, our communities and our nation to open our stadiums, town halls, sanctuaries and social media streams and invite people to stop panicking and stop fighting and breathe. George Floyd was robbed of his very God-given breath. The unarmed black man accused of passing a counterfeit $20 bill was on the ground in handcuffs when white police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for about eight minutes, crushing the life out of him even as Floyd pleaded that he could not breathe. ANOTHER NIGHT OF RIOTS ERUPTS IN US AS PROTESTERS, POLICE CLASH IN NYC, PHILLY, CHICAGO, OTHER CITIES Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in the merciless killing of a defenseless man suspected of a minor crime. What a senseless loss of life! Right now, here in America we are in a season of repentance and revival. It is very important for spiritual leaders to lead the way in repentance and prayer; especially with the violence erupting out of Minneapolis spreading destruction across the country like wildfire. Thankfully, spiritual leaders are recognizing that we are in a battle of evil against good. Of course, good always prevails in the end. God is good. As members of one common race – the human race – we continue to fight this battle. We should unite, fighting as one with our spirits, souls and bodies in full engagement. As leaders, we must encourage people who are frightened and frustrated. We must stand in solidarity and unity as one human race. We must reject the socially engineered concept that our skin colors and ethnicities divide us into racial groups. As my uncle, the prophet Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. – who was also killed by a white man – famously said, he dreamt of a world where people “will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.” Amen. Martin Luther King preached love, not hate; peace, not violence; and universal brotherhood, not racism. The Bible tells us: “The God who made the world and everything in it, this Master of sky and land, doesn’t live in custom-made shrines or need the human race to run errands for God, as if God couldn’t take care of God. God makes the creatures; the creatures don’t make God. Starting from scratch, [from one blood] God made the entire human race and made the earth hospitable, with plenty of time and space for living so we could seek after God, and not just grope around in the dark but actually find God. God doesn’t play hide-and-seek with us. God’s not remote; God’s near. We live and move in God, can’t get away from God! One of your poets said it well: ‘We’re the God-created.’ Well, if we are the God-created, it doesn’t make a lot of sense to think we could hire a sculptor to chisel a God out of stone for us, does it?” (Acts 17:24-29) People are human beings with so much more uniting us than dividing us. People have human personalities. As Martin Luther King once said: “When we value the human personality we won't kill anybody.” He also said: “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. I have decided to stick with love; hate is too great a burden to bear.” In the midst of the Minneapolis crisis, President Trump has said anarchists must not be allowed to drown out the voices of peaceful protesters. Now is a time for a peaceful protest prayer and repentance. I am saddened yet undaunted that a quote from my Uncle Martin is being taken out of context. The prophet said that "violence is the language of the unheard.” Some people are calling this an endorsement of violence, but nothing could be further from the truth. MLK spoke those words in defense of non-violence; he refused to promote violence as a solution to the ills of society. Martin Luther King preached love, not hate; peace, not violence; and universal brotherhood, not racism. “Love is the only force capable of transforming an enemy into a friend,” he said in 1963. If only my uncle could still be with us now; fighting nonviolently for justice and against all manifestations of hatred and racism. As we are in the eye of the storm, the solution remains: peace be still. No peace, no justice. I believe MLK would agree. America is in flux, with George Floyd, Martin Luther King Jr., COVID-19 and unborn aborted babies all whirling around in a chaotic storm. Peace be still. Anchor with the Gospel of Jesus Christ. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER As these storms coincide and converge we must ask: What can we do so that we are not fearful and not panicking but praying, believing and loving? We must pray and unite as people of one blood, one America, one human race. My heart is heavy with grief and is moved by the cruel killing of George Floyd, who was a man of God. An urgent cry is growing in my heart. Please America, pray for an end of the looting and shooting! Unite in prayer as one blood. Thank God for promises made and promises kept. We must continue on. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP I am spending part of my Sunday with my goddaughter, Angela Stanton, and others in prayer. We are praying for an end to violence and racism in America. And as we pray, as we thank God, we see all of the progress we are making together in America. We will get through this, just as we will get through the coronavirus pandemic. Pray for America!

 Attorney General William Barr issued a statement Saturday decrying the rioters who have violently hijacked peaceful protests over the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. The attorney general made explicit reference to “groups of outside radicals and agitators” who are pursuing a “separate and violent agenda.” Barr added: “In many places, it appears the violence is planned, organized and driven by anarchist and far left extremists, using Antifa-like tactics, many of whom travel from out of state to promote the violence.” The mention of Antifa is significant. It is a loosely-knit, interstate movement whose objective is to wage a terrorist war against the United States, using violence against the government and our civilian infrastructure. DUELING CLAIMS: TRUMP BLAMES ANTIFA FOR RIOTS, MINNESOTA OFFICIALS POINT FINGERS AT WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND CARTELS Equally salient is the attorney general’s assertion that the radical groups involved in the rioting are pursuing a specific, violent agenda. That obviously refers to the ongoing campaign to coerce acceptance by the country of these groups’ counter-constitutional totalitarianism. Barr vowed that the Justice Department will take enforcement action across the nation. This is worth pausing over, particularly because when these uprisings occur, as they do with disturbing frequency, there are inevitable calls for the enactment of domestic terrorism laws. I’ve investigated and prosecuted terrorists – jihadists who adhered to foreign terrorist organizations but operated domestically, as well as those who attacked American interests overseas. I can thus tell you that the laws we already have are more than adequate to the task. There is no need for new laws. Calls to enact them are either ill-conceived or the usual case of preening politicians sensing the need to look like they’re doing something in response to a crisis. Rioters can and will do immense damage if, as some foolishly suggest, we wait for them to exhaust themselves. I led the 1990s prosecution of the jihadists who bombed the World Trade Center and then planned a more ambitious campaign – which, fortunately, we thwarted – to bomb such New York City landmarks as the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels, the United Nations complex, the FBI’s lower Manhattan field office, some military installations, and so on. Concurrently, the terrorists plotted political kidnappings and assassinations, as well as jailbreaks of imprisoned jihadists. They were unable to execute these ambitions schemes, but it was not for lack of preparation, including extensive paramilitary training. This is why Attorney General Barr’s mention of the violent agenda of the rioters pinged my antennae. We prosecuted the so-called Blind Sheikh (the late Omar Abdel Rahman) and his subordinates using a Civil War-era statute that criminalizes “seditious conspiracy.” This rarely invoked penal law targets conspiracies to levy war against the United States, or to forcibly oppose or overthrow our government. The key element is violence – either its use or planned use. That is the attribute that fundamentally distinguishes legitimate protest from insurrection. The attorney general also pointed out in his statement that it is a federal crime to cross state lines or use interstate facilities in order to incite or participate in rioting. Indeed it is, and this also raises the specter of federal racketeering laws. We think of these principally as a vehicle for prosecuting organized crime groups. But they actually apply to any “enterprise,” which is simply an association of some kind. It could be informal and secretive, like a Mafia “family” or a drug cartel; or it could a more formal entity (racketeering laws have been applied to corporations, guilds, political parties, labor unions, and so on). CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER The racketeering enterprise must affect interstate commerce through a pattern of criminal activity. This would enable the Justice Department to investigate outfits like Antifa, which are organized around a nihilistic vision and which dispatch members throughout the country to commit mayhem, seriously injuring Americans and destroying property. Our existing laws, at both the federal and state levels, are more than adequate to the task of dealing with terrorism and seditionist violence. The Justice Department and the FBI, including the bureau’s Joint Terrorism Task Forces (partnerships with police authorities in major cities throughout the country), are highly experienced and adept in this area, and they have the resources to get the job done. The job needs doing. The ravaging of our major cities right now is a violation of the rights of peace-loving Americans, both those who are legitimately exercising their First Amendment rights to protest, and those who are going about their lives expecting the governmental protection to which the Constitution entitles them. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP For society to flourish, the rule of law must assert itself. Justice must be done, which means bringing anti-American domestic terrorists to heel. Rioters can and will do immense damage if, as some foolishly suggest, we wait for them to exhaust themselves. The failure to confront radicals only increases their energy and appetite to do harm. Order does not happen spontaneously. It takes a commitment to enforce the laws. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY ANDREW MCCARTHY

 Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.  Sign up here.  It’s been 11 Sundays since Richmond Community Church had a live Sunday service. But this Sunday that unbelievable streak ends. We will meet together again at our Glen Allen campus. Of course, it will not look like the last time we met on Sunday, March 8. There will be no hugging or handshaking, no passing of the offering bags, no refreshments after the service. And the auditorium capacity is capped for physical distancing. Just to come this Sunday you have to pre-register to attend the service. We’ve had five Christmas Eve services to accommodate the crowds but we never required a registration. Now you need to register just to attend a service the Sunday after Memorial Day. NEWT GINGRICH: AMERICA'S SUCCESS IN SPACE IS DUE TO CHEERFUL PERSISTENCE, DESPITE DANGERS AND CHALLENGES There will be those who choose not to attend. And that is fine. We don’t want anyone to feel uncomfortable or unsafe. But we do want to be open for those who desire to attend. Who desperately want to be back at church. Some will say it is wrong to reopen, we are putting lives at risk. But we are not forcing anyone to attend, only offering the option. They can continue to attend our online service. We were the first church in Virginia to have an online campus over 12 years ago. We are quite comfortable doing ministry in this format. We don’t have many people in the high-risk category of over 60 in our church. We are following the governor’s mandate and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. I can’t see a compelling reason for our church not to start having live services again. In fact, the biggest question is not, should we have services, but rather, what is God saying to us? What is the message from this pandemic for the church? Is this enormous disruption for a purpose? There is an amazing story in the history book of the New Testament. The book of Acts tells us how the early church began and expanded. It gives us a timeline of church growth and shares the stories of church leaders who led the way. One of the most fascinating stories is about the apostle Paul. He was the Christian leader who started churches and wanted to continue expanding the church into Asia. Since God has a purpose for all of us then he must be up to something. This virus certainly did not take him by surprise. Is there something new we need to discover?  But God stopped him. He did not allow Paul to preach the Gospel, he actually stopped him twice. Acts 16: 6-7 tells us, “Paul and his friends went through Phrygia and Galatia but the Holy Spirit would not let them preach in Asia. After they arrived in Mysia, they tried to go to Bithynia but the Spirit of Jesus would not let them.” What a remarkable event. Throughout the New Testament Christ-followers are told to preach the Gospel, to share the good news and yet here God stops it. Just like the church has been stopped from meeting since March. Could God do his greatest work in the new reality of a broken plan? Since God has a purpose for all of us then he must be up to something. This virus certainly did not take him by surprise. Is there something new we need to discover? Paul ended up going to Macedonia. And it changed history. Christianity advanced from Asia to Europe. The Church was established in Europe and then spread throughout the world. There are now over 2 billion Christians. It never would have happened without God’s disruption. Paul responded enthusiastically and positively to the change in his plans. He is the one who wrote the poignant words “All things work together for good to those that love God, to those who are called according to his purpose.” CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Paul could have been mad at God or felt sorry for himself. He could have begrudgingly gone to Europe but not given himself to the work. But instead, he established the church in many cities. We are like Paul in a situation we did not plan to be in. No one could have ever predicted churches would be stopped from meeting on Sundays for services. It’s a total disruption, a complete change from everything we normally do. Paul went to Macedonia because he had a dream of a man asking him to come over and help them. In the midst of this change to our lives and church there is an opportunity to do even greater good. To have a higher impact. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Church is not stopped, certainly not defeated. We have a new chance, a new possibility. Jesus went to Calvary and all seemed lost but he triumphed over it and won the victory. And we can too. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM RICK MCDANIEL

 Equal application of the law, justice, is what we all need to calm the country. “The greatness of our nation comes from our commitment to the rule of law,” said Attorney General William Barr, and he is correct. Without justice, everyone in our country is at risk. Everyone I spoke with, on all sides of the political spectrum, was sickened, disgusted, saddened, frightened and mad about the apparent excessive force by a Minneapolis police officer evidently carrying out his own justice on George Floyd, who was handcuffed and pinned to the ground for nearly nine minutes. He died. It should not have happened. KAY COLES JAMES: GEORGE FLOYD'S SENSELESS KILLING – END RACISM THAT AFFLICTS AMERICA'S SOUL LIKE A CANCER Unfortunately, there are a small number of people who seek chaos in the United States. They take advantage of tragedy and try to compound it with violence, fear and rioting. Barr said, “Groups of outside radicals and agitators are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate and violent agenda.” Barr added, “In many places, it appears the violence is planned, organized and driven by anarchistic and far-left extremists, using Antifa-like tactics, many of whom travel from out of state to promote the violence.” While there must be swift justice for the death of George Floyd, there can be no acceptance of lawlessness. After four nights of violence and rioting in his city, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey boldly stated, “This is no longer about protesting….This is about violence, and it has to stop.” Perceptive, but unfortunately four nights too late. We should not tolerate rogue cops nor should we tolerate “protesters” who go too far by stoking violence and breaking the law. The mayor and the governor, both Democrats, have been far too slow to address the problem before it erupted, and once it was spiraling out of control, law enforcement was nonexistent. Friday night they issued a curfew but refused to enforce it, adding to the chaos and ceding deference to looters and rioters. That should not be acceptable in America. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER We should not tolerate rogue cops nor should we tolerate “protesters” who go too far by stoking violence and breaking the law. Ultimately the long-term solutions for peace, prosperity and united communities will be found in families, neighborhoods, churches, safe schools, good jobs and a justice system that is fair. They will be found in communities where Lady Justice wears a blindfold and equally administers the law, no matter who you are, where you came from or who you know. Until that confidence is restored, no community deserves to be overrun with looting and fear.  Order must be restored as the wheels of justice turn. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Barr said, “We must have law and order on our streets and in our communities, and it is the responsibility of the local and state leadership, in the first instance, to halt this violence. The Department of Justice (including the FBI, Marshals, ATF, and DEA), and all of our 93 U.S. Attorneys across the country, will support these local efforts and take all action necessary to enforce federal law." The good news is solutions will best be found in our local communities, where an individual’s voice can have the most impact. If we wait for Congress to solve these issues, it most likely will never happen. These problems can be expeditiously addressed by prioritizing justice and rejecting fear and violence. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY JASON CHAFFETZ

 Things are often more complicated than they appear at first blush. That is certainly the case with the murder of George Floyd, with which former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was charged in a complaint filed on Friday. KAY COLES JAMES: GEORGE FLOYD'S SENSELESS KILLING – END RACISM THAT AFFLICTS AMERICA'S SOUL LIKE A CANCER For one thing, contrary to most people’s assumption, Floyd appears not to have died from asphyxia or strangulation as Chauvin pinned him to the ground, knee to the neck. Rather, as alleged in the complaint, Floyd suffered from coronary-artery disease and hypertensive-heart disease. The complaint further intimates, but does not come out and allege, that Floyd may have had “intoxicants” in his system. The effects of these underlying health conditions and “any potential intoxicants” are said to have “combined” with the physical restraint by three police officers, most prominently Chauvin, to cause Floyd’s death. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER As I’ve noted, Hennepin County prosecutors have charged Chauvin with third-degree depraved-indifference homicide. Now that the complaint has been released publicly, we see that a lesser offense was also charged: second-degree manslaughter. This homicide charge involves “culpable negligence creating an unreasonable risk” of serious bodily harm, and carries a maximum sentence of ten years’ imprisonment. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It is easy to see why prosecutors added this charge (and why they shied away from more serious grades of murder described in my column). The case is tougher for prosecutors if there is doubt about whether Chauvin’s unorthodox and unnecessary pressure on Floyd’s neck caused him to die. Had he been strangled, causative effect of the neck pressure would be patent. But if the neck pressure instead just contributed to the stress of the situation that triggered death because of unusual underlying medical problems (possibly in conjunction with intoxicants Floyd may have consumed), it becomes a harder murder prosecution.

 Saturday’s successful launch of the first manned space flight from American soil since 2011 marked a triumphant and thrilling turning point in America’s remarkable history of space exploration. The days of American astronauts hitching a ride out of this world on Russian rockets are over. America is once again a spacefaring nation operating under our own power, not dependent on any other country. Like millions of others, I watched with excitement as NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley were blasted into the heavens with explosive force, headed to the International Space Station. SPACEX MAKES HISTORY, LAUNCHES NASA ASTRONAUTS INTO SPACE FROM US SOIL FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 2011 The launch from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla., of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket was a welcome relief after the planned liftoff Wednesday had to be scrubbed with only minutes to go due to bad weather. Importantly, the launch proved that the partnership between NASA and private enterprise can work, marking a new chapter in space exploration. NASA has harnessed the mighty engine of our free enterprise system to drive space exploration in the most efficient and cost-effective way possible. The launch also gave the American people a much-needed boost of hope and good news. We certainly need that at now. Rioting has broken out in many cities following the death of an unarmed and handcuffed black man, George Floyd, after white police officer Derek Chauvin was captured on cellphone video kneeling on Floyd’s neck for about eight minutes. Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. The space launch is something we can all celebrate after too much bad news. And, of course, the coronavirus pandemic has tragically claimed the lives of over 100,000 people in our country, cratered our economy, and thrown millions of Americans out of work. The space launch is something we can all celebrate after too much bad news. Outer space has long been the source of great human fascination – long before Russia launched the Sputnik satellite in 1957 and American astronaut Neil Armstrong’s historic first steps on the surface of the moon in 1969. Those events took place before I was born, but I know from my parents and other relatives and friends who lived through the historic early days of space exploration and the race to the moon how those adventurous journeys captured the attention of billions of people around the world. Humans have always looked skyward and wondered what lies beyond. It was the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates who once observed: “Man must rise above Earth to the top of the atmosphere and beyond, for only then will he fully understand the world in which he lives.” Thousands of years have passed since that statement, but the quest for answers and the curiosity of the unknown persists. As he awaited the liftoff Wednesday that was scrubbed, SpaceX founder Elon Musk called the project the “culmination of a dream” that was 10 years in the making. With the launch Saturday, he saw his dream turn into reality. The controversial and quirky Musk suggested that if someone had asked him a decade ago how likely it was that he and the team would be able to pull the launch off now, he’d have given it no more than a 1 percent chance. If you’ve lived long enough, every successful launch brings a sigh of relief. Your mind can’t help but wander back to the tragedies of Space Shuttles Challenger in 1986 and Columbia in 2003 that claimed the lives of a total of 14 astronauts. Fortunately, the three astronauts of the Apollo 13 survived a close call that could have resulted in their deaths. We know the price of exploration can be fatal – which is why we rightly hold explorers up so high in our esteem. We cheer for them when they succeed because we know their victory ultimately benefits us all. Reaching for the heavens reminds us, too, that there is life and wonder beyond what the eye can see. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER The late John Glenn, who became the first American to orbit Earth, told reporters: “To look out at this kind of creation and not believe in God is to me impossible. It just strengthens my faith.” I’ve long believed that one of the keys to happiness is to keep reaching – even for things beyond my grasp. Goals provide structure and force us to focus – but they also provide us with the thrill of the pursuit, something that Musk has long championed. “There have to be reasons that you get up in the morning and you want to live,” Musk reflected. “Why do you want to live? What’s the point? What inspires you? What do you love about the future?” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Let’s cheer on the astronauts heading toward the Space Station and allow their triumph to inspire us to work toward the fulfillment of our hopes and dreams. Americans love longshots and underdogs, especially dreams that seem out of reach and out of this world. Maybe it’s because intuitively or even subconsciously, we know that if a person like Musk’s dream can come true, maybe someday, somehow ours might as well. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY PAUL BATURA

 The senseless and completely unjustified killing of George Floyd – an unarmed black man – by a white police officer in Minneapolis on Monday should shock the conscience of America. While I understand the frustration and anger, I do not condone the violence spreading across this country in response to Floyd’s horrific killing. Rioting tearing apart Minneapolis and cities coast-to-coast will never lead to anything but more suffering. Those who are committing crimes are distracting us from the even larger group of people who are peacefully demonstrating. But we cannot shrug off Floyd’s killing – along with the killings of so many other black Americans throughout our nation’s history and up through today. DEROY MURDOCK: RIOTERS DO INJUSTICE TO GEORGE FLOYD, TORTURED AND KILLED IN A CASE OF POLICE BRUTALITY How many more black people must die, and how many more times will statements of sympathy have to be issued? How many times will protests have to occur? How many more committees will have to be formed until America admits that racism is still a problem in this country? Racism in America is a fatal wound. Every time another incident occurs we put a Band-Aid on it, but the Band-Aid keeps falling off. Band-Aids are not enough to ever stitch this country back together. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER The arrest of fired Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin on Friday on charges of manslaughter and third-degree murder is a welcome step, but it is just a Band-Aid. Chauvin is seen on cellphone video kneeling on Floyd’s neck as Floyd lay on the pavement handcuffed and helpless. Other officers with Chauvin did nothing as they watched Floyd die, and should face justice for their inexcusable inaction. During my 70 years on this Earth I have lived through the civil rights movement, I have seen the highs and lows of this country, I have seen America’s goodness, and I have seen its hatred. There is no other country like ours in the world – nothing compares to its greatness. But the issue of racism is America’s Achilles’ heel. It has been embedded into our culture for 400 years, since the first Africans were seized from their homes on the other side of the world and brought to colonial America in chains and enslaved. The racism experienced by black Americans is not a political issue and to anyone who tries to use it as one, on the left or the right, I say shame on you. No longer should our communities be pieces in a grand chess game. The promise of the Declaration of Independence that we are all created equal applies to people of every race. This is not about politics – it is about morality. It’s time America takes responsibility and expands human flourishing to all of its citizens – not just the majority of them.  This country’s founding principles have created a system for injustices to come to light. They are designed to enable the human flourishing of all America’s citizens. Let’s use those principles to guide us. It’s time America takes responsibility and expands human flourishing to all of its citizens – not just the majority of them. Americans must speak up and reject the racism and division in their own communities. There has always been a remnant outside the black community fighting for racial equality. It can no longer be just a remnant. Racial equality is something that every one of us, regardless of skin color, must work toward on a daily basis. Individually, we can make a difference by promoting peace and prosperity for all people, knowing that life is better for everyone when we as Americans succeed together. It will take courage to speak up, but it is the only way we can overcome racism and the problems plaguing our nation. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Simple acts like starting a dialogue with a neighbor or teaching your children the difference between right and wrong can have a profound impact now and for generations to come. Nothing can bring George Floyd back to life. But if his horrific and needless death proves to be a turning point to make Americans finally end the ugly racism that stains our nation’s history and afflicts us like a cancer of the soul, he will leave behind a legacy we sorely need.

 President Trump announced on Friday that he has directed his administration to "begin the process of eliminating policy exemptions that give Hong Kong different and special  treatment." This means a wide range of agreements between the U.S. and Hong Kong, from and extradition treaty to trade policies, will be affected. His announcement came a day after China's National People's Congress (NPC) rubber-stamped a national security law drafted by the Chinese government. The law seeks to ban “treason, secession, sedition and subversion.” But it is so broadly defined and vaguely worded that it will greatly expand the CCP's control over Hong Kong by criminalizing Hongkongers for exercising their basic rights to free speech and free assembly. The fact that Beijing chose to bypass Hong Kong's legislature to impose such a controversial law on the people of Hong Kong effectively ends the "One Country, Two Systems" framework, which was supposed to guarantee Hong Kong's political autonomy from Beijing fo 50 years. Beijing's action and announcement have drawn international outcry and condemnation. CHRISTIAN WHITON: TRUMP'S TOUGH ACTION AGAINST CHINA IS LONG OVERDUE – BEIJING MUST PAY FOR ITS MISCONDUCT As Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement, "No reasonable person can assert today that Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy from China, given facts on the ground." To fulfill his duty required by the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act (HRDA) mandate, Pompeo informed the U.S. Congress on Wednesday, "Hong Kong is no longer autonomous from China." Based on Pompeo's recommendation, President Trump instructed his administration now to revoke Hong Kong’s preferential treatment as a separate customs and travel territory from the rest of China. Trump also said his administration will sanction individuals and officials from both the Communist China and Hong Kong who are responsible for eroding Hong Kong's autonomy. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Beijing's breach of  international treaty in Hong Kong certainly warrants such strong responses from the U.S. The Trump administration's actions are welcomed by pro-democracy Hongkongers. In addition to imposing these punitive measures, the Trump administration should also consider humanitarian assistance to Hong Kong by laying out a welcome mat for freedom-loving Hong Kongers. There are three good reasons for the U.S. to do so. First, Hong Kong people meet the refugee definition. The U.N. Refugee Agency defines refugee as someone who has been forced to flee his or her country because of persecution, war or violence. Hong Kong was once one of the freest places in the world, but now it is a police state. Amnesty International has documented Hong Kong police's brutality against protesters, including arbitrary arrests, brutal beatings and evidence of torture during detention. In recent weeks, Hong Kong police indiscriminately arrested and detained hundreds of peaceful Hong Kongers, most of whom are young people and some who never even participated in any protests. Beijing already said it would send security agents to Hong Kong to help enforce the national security law. It has become increasingly clear that it is next to impossible for Hong Kongers to exercise their rights to speech and assembly without the fear of persecution. Freedom-loving, pro-democracy Hong Kongers have to find a new home because their beloved city is no longer safe for them. Second, when the U.S. removes Hong Kong's special treatment, it will cause economic pain on Communist China, but it's the Hong Kong people who will suffer the most. Hong Kong’s economy already declined after months of unrest in 2019 and the coronavirus outbreak in the first half of 2020. Hong Kongers' knowledge, skills, work ethic and their devotion to freedom will make them a good addition to our great nation. They will no doubt enrich any community that welcomes them with open arms. Losing special economic status and facing the U.S. economic sanctions will likely prompt mainland Chinese businesses and international businesses to move their operations, transactions and trade to other places, taking capital and jobs with them. Hong Kong people will be left to suffer economic hardship. If they want a better life for themselves and their families, they have to pack up and leave. Third, welcoming Hong Kongers benefits the United States too. Hong Kongers are well-educated. Since English is an official language in the city, many Hong Kongers are already used to communicating in English on a daily basis. Hong Kongers are also industrious, creative and resourceful. They successfully transformed Hong Kong from a small fishing village into an international financial and trade center and one of the wealthiest places in the world. Most importantly, Hong Kongers are well-versed in democracy and have a deep appreciation for political freedom. They often look up to the U.S. for inspiration. More than once, we have seen them wave American flags and heard them sing the American anthem during their protests. Their peaceful mass demonstrations, last summer especially, demonstrated their dignity and maturity as responsible citizens, serving as a powerful rebuttal to Beijing’s assertion that western democracy is incompatible with Chinese people and culture. Hong Kongers' knowledge, skills, work ethic and their devotion to freedom will make them a good addition to our great nation. They will no doubt enrich any community that welcomes them with open arms. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The British government is reportedly already working on a migration plan that would allow some Hong Kongers to settle in the United Kingdom. It's time for the Trump administration to join our closest ally in this noble effort and designate a special process to speed up the application and approval process for any Hong Kongers seeking political asylum in the United States. It is in our nation's DNA to serve the unique role of being “the last best hope of earth,” in the words of Abraham Lincoln, for freedom-loving people around the world. People of Hong Kong are at the front line fighting against tyranny. They simply wish to have what we Americans know very well: freedom and the right to self-determination. The United States can and should help them. Let's welcome them to our land of the free. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM HELEN RALEIGH

Former Assistant Commerce Secretary Bruce Mehlman shares his predictions for the economy as it begins to reopen. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.  Sign up here.  New York state law mandates K-12 schools practice 12 fire drills per year. But the state has never required schools to practice remote instruction, leading to predictable failures and avoidable inequities when the coronavirus pandemic arrived and schools closed. And 19 years after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks shut down airspace across the nation, Congress still had no plan for remote operations in a national emergency when the coronavirus hit. Voters in Wisconsin’s primaries had to literally risk their lives to exercise their franchise because planners never planned for foreseeable contingencies. NEW YORK CITY IS NOW ONLY PART OF STATE STILL WAITING ON REOPENING When the pandemic postmortem is written, historians won’t need to look far to find fault. For decades, policymakers underfunded pandemic preparedness and opted for health system efficiency over surge resilience. Our safety nets are woefully inadequate: 53 percent of American families lack emergency savings, over 33 million have no paid sick leave, and 28 million lack health insurance. Across our economy, we see a mixed bag of readiness. Government, health care and education were least prepared for the arrival of the disease COVID-19 that is caused by the novel coronavirus. In stark contrast to these failures, the more digitized sectors of our economy proved the most buoyant in dealing with the pandemic. Technology companies led the way, shifting employees to remote work before government mandates, and enabling the millions of other Americans to continue working, playing and learning. Digital readiness begat pandemic resilience beyond the technology sector itself. From retail to banking to communications to manufacturing, businesses that had embraced mobility, the cloud and broadband-enabled services persisted and often increasing productivity despite the lockdowns. Of course, few of these businesses became digital-savvy in anticipation of a global pandemic. Rather, digital readiness is a 21st-century business imperative, and few companies or individuals can hope to compete without leveraging the power of such technologies. We see this in the productivity statistics. From 2000 to 2015, the digital industries generated productivity growth of 2.7 percent per year, compared to just 0.7 percent for physical industries. And according to data from the National Science Foundation, digital industries were twice as likely to innovate compared to physical industries. This contrast will only accelerate after the coronavirus pandemic has ended. In this decade it’s not the strongest companies that will survive nor the most intelligent individuals. The businesses and people who are most digital-ready and adaptable to technological change will succeed. Survival of the connected-est. The fourth industrial revolution is accelerating, and even more than before the pandemic, software is “eating the world.” Despite many positive possibilities for workers, consumers and students of the future, this trend threatens to exacerbate the already significant inequality between the digital haves and have-nots. Well before the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown, we saw how digital divides contribute to gaps in learning, earning and even life expectancy. Today some children who were struggling to keep up in the physical classroom are denied admission to the virtual school for want of Internet-enabled devices. Rural businesses without broadband connections found it impossible to apply for and obtain government stimulus loans. Older Americans in need of health care services but unable to leave home could not access the telehealth providers to whom so many of us have turned. We can do better. As policymakers focus on helping Americans rebuild our economy and our lives, they can take meaningful steps to close these digital divides and accelerate our comeback by making broadband more available, affordable, accessible and American. Available Deployment of broadband to serve rural areas takes investment in infrastructure where market forces alone may not reach – in addition to regulatory approaches that do not discourage private sector investment and spectrum policies that prioritize broadband. Congress could include such incentives in the next round of COVID-19 recovery legislation. Affordable While there are effective existing programs to help make broadband more affordable to low-income Americans, they need greater funding – especially now. Additional initiatives could ensure that K-12 students have access to computers with Internet access so that no child is denied entry to the Zoom classroom and no family is unable to access government services. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Accessible Even when broadband is available and affordable, it remains inaccessible for too many businesses and individuals. Some lack the digital literacy that should be taught in schools. Others reasonably worry about cybersecurity risks or insufficient privacy protections. Still more find essential government and health care online offerings poorly designed and user-unfriendly. American Years of aggressive investment in innovation combined with robust government subsidies and domestic protectionism enabled Chinese technology companies such as Huawei to vie for global dominance in 5G. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP American policymakers have awakened to the economic and national security challenges presented by questionable foreign network equipment deep in the network. They should catalyze efforts by U.S. innovators to develop and deploy alternative technologies that replace expensive proprietary hardware systems with smarter, American-made open standards software alternatives. The coronavirus pandemic exposed many longstanding failures in our nation’s safety nets and policy priorities. But we know how to fix the challenges. Investments in today’s recovery can yield greater leadership, fairness and innovation in the decades ahead.  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY BRUCE MEHLMAN

This was a special occasion for me because my niece, Brianna Francis Golden, was in the graduating class. She is now the first law school graduate in the Brazile family – and graduated cum laude! Well, the coronavirus won’t stop me from sharing my message with new graduates – not just at Southern University, but with every graduate reading these words. So here is my commencement address for all college and university graduates who had no commencement ceremonies of their own this year. OBAMA KNOCKS 'FOLKS IN CHARGE' WHILE DISCUSSING COVID-19 IN COMMENCEMENT SPEECH Dear Class of 2020: Let me begin by saying how much I am impressed with you. I am impressed because you are graduating. That’s no mean feat in the best of times. This is also a remarkable occasion because you are the first generation of university graduates who have already made history – you are the first to graduate virtually.                                      You already have “a first” to tell your future grandchildren. And you are graduating after surmounting obstacles that haven’t been faced by young people entering this society in many generations. You are beginning your adult lives after already having accomplished something impressive just by getting this far. If you begin to wonder if things will ever get back to normal, remember this: Not only do “all good things come to an end,” so do “all bad things come to an end.”  Gratitude lifts the spirit, soothes the strain of struggle and replenishes your energy. It’s been over a century since our world has seen a pandemic on this scale – longer than living memory for almost all of us. The 1918 flu pandemic ended in the spring of 1919, in a world much less equipped to deal with the challenges the disease posed. This current pandemic will also end, more from our own efforts than from the vicissitudes of nature. Not every generation experiences a pandemic. Not every generation is as rudely tossed into the tides of history as your young generation already has been. It’s a challenge. But rising to that challenge is not simply a necessity – it’s also an opportunity. My ancestors survived American slavery. My grandparents experienced the 1918 flu pandemic. My parents were born during the Great Depression, grew up during World War II, and graduated into the Korean War. They call the generation that grew up during the Depression and fought the Second World War the “Greatest Generation.” Like you, their path to adulthood was littered with obstacles. But their success in dealing with those obstacles shaped them and benefited all subsequent generations. And they earned the gratitude and admiration of all who have followed. Most of you were born during the presidencies of Bill Clinton or George W. Bush. The first president you remember much about is likely Barack Obama. And because the universe likes variety, you are graduating when Donald Trump is president. You’ve already experienced the entire gamut of presidents! Who knows what other twists life has in store for us. But whatever comes our way, we’re equipped to survive and thrive. Consider this: we are all here today because some relatives survived the 1918 flu pandemic and found each other. They had children who persevered and triumphed. And they in turn raised another generation that fought to make the world we were handed a better place for all of us to live. Now it’s your turn to take the torch. I know you will make your own descendants admire and revere you as much as we admire and revere those who have come before us. So what is it that I can say that you will want to take with you today? It is this: Regardless of how unique the novel coronavirus pandemic is, you have a place in this world and God has a purpose for you. That purpose may be a once-in-a-generation responsibility, or it may be to serve where you are living, as supportive spouses, parents, friends, good neighbors and good citizens. Whatever purpose there is for you, you’re up to it! You’re up to it because you’ve not only acquired knowledge at a good institution of higher learning. You’re up to it because you’ve passed tests of your courage, your endurance, your resourcefulness and your persistence. The fact that you’re here today, graduating, is evidence you’re ready and able to confidently enter into life. Take time to pursue your goals. Do not be a bystander. Be a participant in – and a shaper of – history. Most importantly, the history of helping to meet the current challenges of your generation. Here is my challenge to you: Go beyond yourself. Seek to be of service every single day. Look for the goodness around you; express kindness in the small acts you can do. If you see a lack of love, then how much more important it is for you to be a small, steady light of love in this world. Measure yourself soberly, in humility, yet with a quiet confidence. By whatever name we give the presence of good in this world – know that you have the ability to do great things. Go beyond the ordinary. You are not where you are by accident of time and birth. You are exactly where the universe intends you to be. Take it one day at a time. Know that you are an agent of change and a manifestation of love that others can depend on. Do not despair of graduating into a world of dangers. This has always been a dangerous world. The cave dwellers daily experienced wild animals that saw them as lunch, and came down with illnesses they didn’t understand and couldn’t treat, much less prevent or cure. Rather than feel a victim, believe that you are born to serve at a time when you have a vital role to undertake and an opportunity to make a difference. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER “In all things be thankful,” says scripture. It doesn’t say: “For all things be thankful.” When you are most discouraged, think about what you can be thankful for. The Almighty, who is still in charge of this universe, wants you to be grateful because gratitude helps you. Gratitude lifts the spirit, soothes the strain of struggle and replenishes your energy. We are meant to struggle in this world. Take hold of hope and faith. They are gifts that allow us to keep going and to accomplish the seemingly impossible. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP How fortunate you are to be where you are now, just when the world most needs you. Those of us who have graduated prior to this day have your back – and you have our support. Just be yourself. That’s all you have to do because you, like the Greatest Generation, have a rendezvous with destiny. Believe that you will be the difference we need in the future.

 PROGRAMMING ALERT: Watch special coverage of the SpaceX launch on Fox News Channel anchored by Neil Cavutor at 3 p.m. EST on Saturday, May 30. This is the moment to remember that cheerful persistence is the key to America’s success in space. We have lost rockets. We have lost satellites. Tragically, we have lost people. Yet, again and again, Americans return to inventing, discovering, and developing the future. This commitment to progress – despite frustrations, disappointments, and difficulties – was held by the original settlers crossing a dangerous Atlantic Ocean in small ships. SPACE ALLIANCE: ELON MUSK AND PRESIDENT TRUMP SET FOR HISTORIC DEMO-2 LAUNCH It was possessed by the pioneers following Daniel Boone and others into dangerous places with unknown threats. It was embodied by the wagon trains and after them the railroad builders. The inventors and developers of aviation had far more crashes and lost far more lives than everything we have experienced in space. And yet, at every instance, we have picked ourselves up and continued to build the future, despite the dangers and challenges. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER American perseverance and daring to launch astronauts on a reusable private rocket have attracted attention from around the world. My wife Callista, currently serving as U.S. Ambassador to the Holy See, caught some of this excitement in a video in which she noted that Pope Saint Paul VI had gone to the Papal Observatory at Castel Gandolfo, near Rome, and watched the first landing on the moon back in 1969. As a tie between the past and the future, the Papal Observatory is an amazing place. It has roots in helping Pope Gregory XIII reform the calendar (the Gregorian Calendar which we still use today) in 1582. The modern observatory was established by Pope Leo XIII in 1891 “so that everyone might see clearly that the Church and her Pastors are not opposed to true and solid science, whether human or divine, but that they embrace it, encourage it, and promote it with the fullest possible devotion.” While based in Italy, the Papal Observatory also runs telescopes at the Mount Graham International Observatory in Arizona. As part of understanding the worldwide impact of the renewed American space program, Callista got the director, Brother Guy Consolmagno, an American Jesuit, to share his good wishes and hopes for the future.

 Don't listen to White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany's predictable critics. The level of vitriol the leftist media hurls at her daily -- during and apart from the press briefings -- conclusively proves she is doing a superb job. Liberal journalists whip their long knives in her direction and seem shocked she doesn't grovel. They've been savaging her since her first press conference on May 1. No one with the audacity to work for President Donald Trump deserves a second's worth of honeymoon. On McEnany's first day, New York Times White House correspondent Annie Karni quoted her as saying she would never lie to the press and then cited numerous examples of her supposedly violating the oath right off the bat. WHITE HOUSE BRIEFLY LOCKED DOWN AS UNREST SPREADS TO ATLANTA, DC, NYC AFTER GEORGE FLOYD DEATH They were lying in wait for her. They still are. On May 26, Tom Jones from Poynter called McEnany "arrogant, inexperienced and ineffective." "(S)he just looks overmatched," he wrote. "(I)n barely more than a month, McEnany has already had several high-profile controversies." I wonder why she's had "controversies." Could it be that the White House media cabal enters those briefings with war paint -- ready to smear President Trump and discredit McEnany if she interferes with their plan? The media's attitude is purely adversarial, yet they act appalled that McEnany returns fire, albeit calmly, respectfully and eloquently. They uniformly dismiss this Harvard Law graduate as green and over her head, but she is remarkably polished, and it is driving them mad. It would be different if the media were to use the briefings to help inform the viewing public. But few of them ever ask questions that could better inform the citizenry. Instead, they serve up accusations not even thinly disguised as genuine questions. Let me give you a sadly typical example. Politico's Ryan Lizza asked McEnany: "What does the White House view as having -- by Election Day, what does the White House view as the number of dead Americans where you can say that you successfully defeated this pandemic? Is there a number?" As I watched this, I was stunned at the brazen inappropriateness of the question -- and few things from this bunch surprise me. When McEnany refused the bait and said that every single life matters, Lizza persisted, asking, "When voters go to the polls in November and they want to judge the president on his response to this pandemic, what is the number of dead Americans that they should tolerate ...?" The question was so out of line I admire McEnany for retaining her composure. But she crossed the media's inviolable line in telling Lizza he was asking the wrong question and suggesting that he could have asked a more pertinent one. How dare she position herself as his equal? Fair observers know that Lizza's question was crass, outrageous and an egregious example of the left politicizing everything about the coronavirus. The media's attitude is purely adversarial, yet they act appalled that McEnany returns fire, albeit calmly, respectfully and eloquently. They uniformly dismiss this Harvard Law graduate as green and over her head, but she is remarkably polished, and it is driving them mad. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER You see, you are not allowed to talk back to the sacrosanct Washington press corps, especially if you work for that unrefined, interloping president who stole the election and is still trespassing on 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. As Trump's press secretary, McEnany is an accessory to his adverse possession of the White House who forfeited any expectation of civil treatment when she accepted the job. Some television anchors and commentators are particularly offended by McEnany's aforementioned practice of parrying the hostile questions they volley at her with suggestions of other questions. This just cannot happen because the press is holy and McEnany is their inferior who must curtsy while they abuse her and slander her boss. It is odd enough these self-important journos believe they are above challenge, but it is even more so considering they draw first blood. Do they actually believe McEnany is supposed to stand there passively in the face of their mistreatment, and not fire back and reasonably defend herself and President Trump? I can guarantee you one thing: The tens of millions of Trump supporters don't agree, and they have her back. We don't share the media's warped belief that they can behave rudely and then whine like innocent victims when they get a small dose of their own medicine. The media can continue this sick charade that they are objective journalists, but half the nation knows better, and the other half probably does, too. But many approve of the media's odious behavior because they applaud a media at war with a president they loathe. Anyone familiar with media "fact-checkers" knows that today's left describes contrary opinions as lies. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Even if McEnany were completely deferential, the Trump-hunting media would never accept her unless she betrayed Trump. They would accuse her of lying anytime she presented a position that differs from theirs. The liberal media will continue to posture and complain about McEnany, and the rest of us can rest assured that in so doing, they further validate her in our eyes.

 It's ironic that Democrats and their mouthpieces in media have been pounding the table the past few years about Russia, Russia, Russia and the importance of preserving the integrity of our elections while overlooking the fox in the henhouse of Silicon Valley. A powerful tech sector, run by ultra-liberal political activists at Twitter and other social media networks, routinely censor conservatives and any voices that stray from its left-wing ideology. This includes Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., whose Twitter account was suspended last August. This week, ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, tweeted: "Two years ago, Twitter shadow bans @RepMattGaetz @MarkMeadows @DevinNunes and myself. Now they've decided to censor @realDonaldTrump What's next, @jack?" JIM HANSON: TRUMP’S SOCIAL MEDIA EXECUTIVE ORDER IS JUSTIFIED – PROTECTS FREE SPEECH, COMBATS CENSORSHIP Of course, Jack Dorsey, Twitter's CEO, denies any foul play while the rest of us see pervasive evidence of alarming political bias -- and de facto election meddling. Take Twitter's latest attempt to humiliate President Donald Trump by fact-checking some of his tweets expressing concern about mail-in voter fraud. This week, Twitter singularly targeted the president -- in the midst of a presidential election cycle -- effectively labeling his tweets as "fake news" despite ample evidence that mail-in voter fraud exists. Had Twitter administrators bothered to do a simple internet search, they would've found that federal prosecutors charged Thomas Cooper, a 47-year-old postal carrier, on Tuesday for fraudulently altering mail-in ballots from one political party to another. Or Twitter's content monitors could've easily gone to WhiteHouse.gov and found a comprehensive study done by the Heritage Foundation which details scores of examples of voter fraud surrounding absentee ballots. Or, heck, Twitter could've watched a 2004 video available on YouTube by Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., who warned: "Paper ballots are EXTREMELY susceptible to fraud... I can show you experience which would make your head spin." This is precisely what the president was warning us about in his tweets, but alas, Twitter's "fact-checkers" either didn't bother to do basic research or, worse, deliberately chose not to. If you suspect it's the latter, then you are correct given the politically charged, anti-Trump tweets recently uncovered and outlined in an eye-opening piece at Fox News. Yoel Roth, Twitter's Head of Site Integrity has tweeted his disdain for our commander in chief and the millions of patriotic, law-abiding Americans who support him. In November 2016, Roth tweeted "I'm just saying, we fly over those states that voted for a racist tangerine for a reason." Translation: If you live in "fly-over" states and voted for Trump, then your voice doesn't count. Twitter is "fact-checking" the president -- while turning a blind eye to his past and present political opponents who've spread malicious misinformation on its platform in an attempt to stop Trump from getting elected in 2016 and to block him from getting re-elected this November. Or how about this missive? In September 2016, Roth tweeted: "I've never donated to a presidential campaign before, but I just gave $100 to Hillary for America. We can't f--- around anymore." Roth has also compared the Trump administration to "ACTUAL NAZIS." This is who Twitter wants us to trust as a "neutral" fact-checker. Now also consider that when Twitter "fact-checked" the president, it linked to selectively chosen information that attempts to counter the accuracy of the president's tweets. Articles that were -- you guessed it -- created by anti-Trump left-wing media. No bias there right? But that's not all. What's also glaringly obvious and warranting the executive action by the president we're told is forthcoming is that Twitter hasn't fact-checked any Democratic lawmakers, media outlets or blue check-marked "journalists" who've spent the past four years spreading malicious lies and misinformation about the Russia collusion conspiracy theory and propaganda campaign that was waged against President Trump and his 2016 campaign since debunked by a special counsel probe. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Twitter is "fact-checking" the president -- while turning a blind eye to his past and present political opponents who've spread malicious misinformation on its platform in an attempt to stop Trump from getting elected in 2016 and to block him from getting re-elected this November. This stacked deck has sparked a widespread backlash against Twitter and a historic warning by the president via tweet Thursday morning: "This will be a Big Day for Social Media and FAIRNESS!" The president is expected to announce an executive order addressing the matter in the near future. Not a minute too soon! Twitter has not only demonstrated rampant political bias for far too long -- it's also crossed the line into election meddling -- as studies have shown most voters get their news online.

It’s about time. China has been challenging the United States across the board, and Trump – with his comprehensive comments Friday – signaled the United States would defend itself across the board. Trump announced a series of actions, including: Terminating America’s relationship with the World Health Organization. Trump said the WHO is biased in favor of China and has failed to approve reforms arising out of its dealing with the coronavirus pandemic that originated in China. The move cuts off about $450 million in U.S. funding for the WHO. Trump said the U.S. would use those funds for “other worldwide and deserving urgent global public health needs.” Suspending entry into the U.S. of Chinese nationals posing a security risk. Revoking almost all special exemptions and rules for Hong Kong and imposing sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials. Studying the “differing practices” of Chinese companies listed in the U.S. The president signed a proclamation stating that he will block entry into the United States of Chinese students and researchers tied to U.S. military efforts. In his brief remarks, Trump also commented on other matters, especially the spreading of the coronavirus. “The world is now suffering as a result of the malfeasance of the Chinese government,” he said. On the issue of Hong Kong, Chinese leaders were undoubtedly waiting to see if Trump would withdraw America’s special treatment of the beleaguered territory on trade and other issues. Some thought Trump would not do this, making this issue a test of his resolve. In meeting the test, the president showed political will rarely seen in American leaders. Most observers thought the president would concentrate his remarks on Hong Kong. The surprising aspect of the comments was their comprehensive nature. Moreover, the tone of the president’s words – he was not only adversarial but also angry – broke with decades of precedent. Chinese leaders have not heard an American leader talk to them this way in public. The range of announced actions should concern Chinese leaders. The actions suggest Trump is now leading a whole-of-government charge on China. Not everyone thought Trump was so resolute. The Financial Times, for instance, said Trump “pulled his punches,” not adopting a “range of measures” the markets feared. For instance, he did not terminate the Phase One trade deal, signed Jan. 15. Yet the trade agreement looks shaky – termination or no termination. There are signs China will not meet its principal commitment – increasing purchases of American goods and services by $200 billion over a two-year period. A result, the trade deal is in danger. The Financial Times also said the markets were relieved that Trump did not impose new tariffs or freeze assets of Chinese nationals. The markets should not break out the champagne just yet, however. The Trump administration will be announcing more actions in the weeks to come, probably including “full expensing” for costs to relocate factories from China and Hong Kong to the United States. Larry Kudlow, the director of the president’s National Economic Council, talked about such subsidies in an interview with Fox Business’ Stuart Varney on Tuesday. Moreover, Trump’s mentioning of the behavior of listed Chinese companies is a warning that investment is the next big area on the chopping block. China for months has been saying the “decoupling” of the United States from China was not possible. However, on Friday Trump was making the process look inevitable. Trump said he wanted “an open and constructive relationship with China” – but ultimately the state of relations is not up to him. Beijing, showing off its “wolf warrior diplomacy” has taken a series of aggressive actions since February including: invading India; engaging in boat-bumping and other incidents against six of its neighbors in the South China and East China Seas; threatening to invade Taiwan; breaking promises over Hong Kong; and increasing the tempo of dangerous intercepts of the U.S. Navy in China’s peripheral waters and airspace. It’s not entirely clear why China is lashing out at this moment. Some say it’s a sign of strength. Others says it is a sign of weakness. But it is evident that America’s engagement policy has failed. Engagers, adopting a long view, often ignored or condoned unacceptable Chinese behavior. That feckless policy approach – conducted by U.S. presidents of both parties and by liberals and conservatives alike – only emboldened the worst elements in Beijing by showing everybody else that aggression worked. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER The upshot is that there is now a perception that Chinese communism cannot be reformed – meaning the only thing the Trump administration can do to protect America is to reduce exposure to China. The underlying theme of the president’s actions Friday was that his administration is cutting ties with Chinese communism. That is the correct approach. The People’s Republic of China is more than just an adversary. A year ago the Communist Party declared a “people’s war” on America. That hostility means that apart from surrendering to Beijing, there is not much Trump can do to patch up relations with China. This is not a Trump issue; it is a China one. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP There will be costs in unwinding decades of misguided U.S. policies toward China – how could there not be? But Beijing is leaving Trump with little choice. It’s time an American leader did what is necessary: go after China on all fronts. And that’s what the world heard Friday from President Trump. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY GORDON CHANG

 Here's a simple question: A police station in a major American city was occupied, looted and burned on Thursday night. Most of us assumed we’d never live to see something like that happen here. But it did happen. So the question is, has anyone been arrested for doing it? Will anyone ever be arrested? No one in authority seems especially interested in apprehending the people who did it. All of it happened on camera, but the perpetrators just walked away. And it’s, maybe likely, that most of them will never be punished for it. TUCKER CARLSON: OUR LEADERSHIP CLASS IS FANNING RACIAL FLAMES. THEY'RE DOING NOTHING TO CALM THE SITUATION That’s striking. It’s a very different experience from the ones most Americans have living here. As Minneapolis burns and crowds grow in the streets of Atlanta and many other cities, the rest of us are continuing on as we always do -- dutifully following the rules. There are many of those. Every year, there seem to be countless new rules to follow. They multiply like insects. We do our best to keep up. We get our permits, apply for our licenses, put on our reading glasses to check the latest regulations on the internet. We wear our little masks. We keep our dogs on leashes. We drive sober. We don’t eat on the subway. We never litter. We make orderly lines and patiently wait our turn. In airports and government buildings, we remove our shoes and submit to body searches from strangers. We lose our dignity every time we do this, but they tell us we must, so we accept it without complaint. In public, we hide what we really think. We bury our natural instincts. We keep our deepest beliefs to ourselves. We know the boundaries. We understand we will be punished for telling the truth. This is the America the rest of us live in. For the privilege of citizenship in a country like this, we work as hard as we can. We never stop sharing what we earn with others. We send money we’d rather give to our own children to politicians in faraway cities. With that money, they make new rules. We follow those rules to the letter. That’s what we were told to do as children. That’s the deal we’ve struck. At least we thought it was. Now we know that other people have somehow negotiated a far better deal than the one we have. They get to ignore the rules. There don’t believe in order or fairness. They reject society itself. Reason and process and precedent mean nothing to them. They use violence to get what they want immediately. People like this don’t bother to work. They don’t volunteer or pay taxes to help other people. They live for themselves. They do exactly what they feel like doing. They say exactly what they feel like saying. They spray paint their opinions on buildings. On television, hour by hour, we watch these people — criminal mobs — destroy what the rest of us have built. They have no right to do that. They don’t contribute to the common good. They never have. Yet suddenly, they seem to have all the power. This is hardly the first time this has happened in America. Spasms of destructive violence are a recurring feature of our history — of every country’s history. The ideologues will tell you that the problem is race relations, or capitalism, or police brutality, or global warming. But only on the surface. The real cause is deeper than that and it’s far darker. What you’re watching is the ancient battle between those who have a stake in society, and would like to preserve it, and those who don’t, and seek to destroy it. Underneath it all, this violence doesn’t have much to do with the behavior of the Minneapolis police department. For evidence, watch this tape. It’s from the 1992 riots in Los Angeles. It was shot almost 30 years ago. It could have been shot this afternoon: Elderly African-American man confronts rioters on tape: It’s not right! It’s not right what y’all are doing! I came from the ghetto, too! Same as all of you kids! Why are you destroying my business?! Why are you destroying my truck?! Why are you destroying my computer?! I tried to make it! Can you understand that! The first thing you notice about that video is, it’s not a racial dispute. The elderly man could be the grandfather of the young rioters swarming around him. But that’s misleading. They are nothing at all alike. The old man is fighting to defend civilization, he’s armed only with a hammer. The young men are working to tear it down. And those are the battle lines. They always are. Which side in that war have our leaders taken? Watch carefully. It’s obvious. The rioters in Minneapolis and in other places act as if they’re allowed to loot and burn. In fact, they are allowed. No one stops them. The authorities don’t arrest them. Instead, they pander to them, flatter them, desperately try to win their love. Why are masked lunatics setting fire to Wendy’s? Because the rest of us are sinful. That’s what our leaders tell us. The crimes of the mob are the punishment we deserve. That’s their argument. Many seem to buy it. On a White House executive staff call just this morning, key domestic policy advisors Brooke Rollins and Ja’Ron Smith argued that it would seem racist to say anything about the rioting in Minneapolis. Better just to let it happen. So that’s what they are doing. We should have seen this coming. When you express an opinion our leaders don’t like, they call it violence. When criminals commit acts of actual violence, they call it speech. In other words, the game is rigged. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER So why are the rest of us still playing it? We have more power than we think we do. Our system only functions because dutiful normal people — people with self-control and decency, and a sense of responsibility toward others — created our system. They sustain it. They pay the bills. None of the thugs looting Target, or the well-paid nihilists on television who are egging them on, have added a thing. Nothing. Yet all of the destroyers expect this arrangement will last forever. For them, it’s been a very good deal. But what exactly are you getting in return for your contributions to this system? The authorities clearly don’t care about you. The police won’t show up to save your life. Literally. During election years, sweaty politicians claim to be on your side. It’s a lie. They’re not. They’ll waste your time with hollow posturing. They’ll feed you pointless symbolic victories and expect you to celebrate, like you’ve actually won something. But when the mob comes, they’re gone. You’re on your own. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP That’s true. Those are the facts. We can’t change them. All we can control is our own behavior. Should you keep playing along with all of that? Ponder that the next time they demand you get a permit to put a deck on your own house. Think about it even harder the next time you write a tax check. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM TUCKER CARLSON

 President Trump spoke Friday with more clarity about China than any previous president, referencing the “malfeasance” of the Chinese government and its outrageous “cover-up of the Wuhan virus” as he announced his latest tough action against the communist regime. Trump spoke in the wake of Beijing’s progressive assault on freedom in Hong Kong, and as China continued to refuse to come clean about the coronavirus pandemic it started. Invoking human rights that we often take for granted in America, Trump cited the Chinese Communist Party’s refusal to see the benefits of the liberty and human rights that existed in Hong Kong and that China solemnly promised to preserve when Britain handed back the colony in 1997. We now see that China’s pledge is another in a long line of its broken promises. TRUMP ANNOUNCES US ‘TERMINATING’ RELATIONSHIP WITH WHO Unlike his predecessors in the White House, Trump followed tough words with tough action Friday. He terminated U.S. membership in the corrupt and pro-Chinese World Health Organization. This is another welcome blow to globalist bureaucracies that mainly serve the purposes of the world’s bad guys. Trump put an end to visas for graduate students with links to China’s People Liberation Army. This step is fundamentally important. China’s outright theft of the free world’s technology prevents the kleptocracy there from falling too far behind. But China’s real dream is to beat America and its allies, and that means having doctoral and post-doctoral science and technology students learn from masters in the United States and then bring their way of thinking back to China. Ultimately we should halt all student visas for Chinese nationals, who displace American students and harm Asian-Americans in particular, given that many institutions have tacit quotas that limit Asian students. Colleges would scream at the loss of revue from Communist China, but frankly, those institutions deserve it given their lack of patriotism and their fleecing of Americans in exchange for degrees of decreasing usefulness. Trump also moved closer to delisting Chinese equities from U.S. stock exchanges, where they pose a systemic risk given the penchant of Chinese companies for corruption and opacity. It is a testament to Wall Street’s cluelessness about the threat from China that the Chinese companies were allowed to list on U.S. exchanges in the first place. Finally, Trump threatened targeted sanctions against Chinese officials involved in undermining freedom in Hong Kong in violation of China’s explicit promises. He also vowed to adjust Hong Kong’s status as a separate trade entity from mainland China that enjoys low-tariff trade with the United States. In stopping short of fully revoking this status, Trump maintained leverage against China for future use. Overall, Trump made a strong move to begin making China pay for its misconduct. However, Trump still has not laid out a clear overall vision for how to beat China. We are still left mostly with tactics and sentiment, as opposed to a strategy the whole of our government and the American people can get behind. Trump and his aides should look back at the Ronald Reagan and Harry Truman administrations, which both understood how to construct a coherent plan to wage cold war and how to communicate it to the public. Truman promulgated “NSC 68,” a reference to the policy compiled by his National Security Council, which was a blueprint for resisting Soviet expansionism through military and other means. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Reagan issued National Security Decision Directive 75, titled “U.S. Relations with the USSR” two years into his administration. On a single page, it outlined a three-fold strategy that helped undermine the Soviet threat and that caused the demise of the Soviet Union itself: contain Soviet expansionism with military deterrence; promote political change inside the Soviet Union; and engage in negotiations without a double standard that favored the opposition. While the documents were classified at the time, each administration’s public statements stemmed from these clear policies. Today the idea of putting political pressure on the Chinese Communist Party is still anathema to some. Indeed, a report the Trump administration sent to Congress last week said: “United States policies are not premised on an attempt to change [China’s] domestic governance model.” In fact, that is precisely what we should do, because when the Chinese Communist Party is forced to play defense at home, it will have less bandwidth and ability to be aggressive with America and the free world. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Perhaps someday the Trump administration can back into a strategy from the various tactics it has employed. Fighting China through nonviolent means is one of the few issues for which there is bipartisan support in Washington and across the country. Nevertheless, Trump has made clear that America will fight China using the timing and tactics of our choice. The zealots who run the Chinese government are on notice.

 In the name of George Floyd, Minneapolis rioters have done a huge injustice to George Floyd. Floyd, 46, is dead. A widely viewed video confirms that the unarmed black man was killed after white police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, arrested him for allegedly passing a counterfeit $20 bill, handcuffed him, pinned him to the asphalt, and then planted his knee on Floyd’s neck. “His nose is bleeding,” one horrified onlooker said off-camera. “How long y’all gotta hold him down?” MINNEAPOLIS COP WHO KNELT ON HANDCUFFED BLACK MAN GEORGE FLOYD CHARGED WITH 3RD DEGREE MURDER, MANSLAUGHTER “He’s human, bro,” one man beseeched Chauvin, the subject of 12 unpunished police-misconduct complaints. This did not continue for a few moments or just long enough to stop Floyd from resisting arrest, which – being cuffed – he didn’t do anyway. Instead, this dragged on for eight minutes. “I can’t breathe,” Floyd implored. “Don’t kill me.” Chauvin did not relent. Floyd’s plea became a premonition: He died. Unless something astonishing is hidden on that recording, this is a museum-grade specimen of overreaction, excessive force and police brutality. Citizens rightly assembled, expressed their outrage, and called for the arrests of Chauvin and the three cops/spectators who let this happen. (Chauvin was arrested Friday afternoon and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter). But then things went too far. The protests – as CNN called them, even after violence erupted – soon became riots. Locals attacked an elderly lady in a wheelchair and sprayed her with a fire extinguisher. That’s not activism. That’s bedlam. When those who derided Floyd’s killing smashed police car windows and lobbed bottles at cops, the rioters began their slide off the moral high ground. The ski jump off the moral high ground began when Minnesotans turned this into a 100 percent-off shopping spree. Whatever sympathy people may have felt for Black Lives Matter or greater police accountability collapsed when hoodlums looted HDTVs, sneakers and other merchandise. Stunning images of thieves hammering open cash registers at a picked-clean Target store did not engender empathy for George Floyd or justice for his survivors. AL SHARPTON SAYS DESTRUCTION OF 'BLACK-OWNED STORES' IN MINNEAPOLIS IS 'RECKLESS' Arsonists turned Auto Zone, Minnehaha Lake Wine and Spirits, and at least 14 other structures into cinders. How many disproportionately black locals now will lose their jobs because these establishments have been torched? Those whose jobs survived the COVID-19 lockdown now likely will join 40 million other Americans on unemployment. The membrane between civilization and savagery is about a millimeter thick. In the Twin Cities, it dissolved like a communion wafer. Minneapolis police officers deserted Third Precinct headquarters, which rioters breached, a la America’s Tehran embassy in 1979 or the Bastille in 1789. The flames that leapt from the abandoned police building gave proof of the total anarchy that officials permitted, to let rioters “blow off steam.” The membrane between civilization and savagery is about a millimeter thick. In the Twin Cities, it dissolved like a communion wafer. Korboi Balla, a black firefighter, plowed his life savings into a sports bar, which he expected to launch on Monday. Grand opening canceled. Arsonists had other plans for his watering hole. Even worse, Balla had no insurance. So, his life is a smoldering ruin. Nice work, thugs! As Balla explained all of this to a TV crew, looters tiptoed through the embers of his American Dream, as they tried to swipe his safe in broad daylight. Rioters also incinerated Midtown Corner, a privately funded, $37 million, 190-unit affordable- housing complex, slated to open next spring. Where’s the social justice in that? “Waking up this morning to see Minneapolis on fire would be something that would devastate Floyd,” his girlfriend, Courtney Ross, told the Star Tribune newspaper. None of this will encourage police officers to behave better. If anything, it will arch their backs. The rioters body-slammed the spotlight from the torture and killing of George Floyd to the narcissistic, nihilistic destruction of their own city. These barbarians resemble Palestinians who demolish their surroundings, such that they reduce any legitimate grievances into rubble. Leftists predictably blame President Trump. Regardless, he called this “a very shocking sight” and correctly ordered the Justice Department and FBI to “take a very strong look” at what happened. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Trump’s enemies are never satisfied. If he dispatched federal agents to hunt Floyd’s killers and blast them with revolvers, Hate Trump, Inc. would scream, “Why not Glocks? Why not machine guns?” President Trump said Friday that he has contacted Floyd's loved ones family and expressed his condolences and those of the nation. “I spoke to members of the family, terrific people,” Trump said. “I understand the hurt, I understand the pain. People have really been through a lot. The family of George is entitled to justice and the people of Minnesota are entitled to live in safety.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The president said he supported peaceful protests but “we can’t allow a situation like happened in Minneapolis to descend further into lawless anarchy and chaos.” Trump now should bring burned-out merchants to the White House and ask them to urge people to stop the mayhem that has converted a worthy cause into total chaos.

Former House speaker and Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich says the anger over George Floyd's killing is justified but the violence is not. The death Monday of George Floyd, a black man in police custody, is a complete outrage. The complete failure of Minneapolis officials to stop and prevent the ensuing rioting is a second outrage. Derek Chauvin, the fired white Minneapolis policeman seen on cellphone video kneeling on Floyd’s neck despite Floyd complaining that he couldn’t breathe, was arrested Friday afternoon and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter.  I will discuss Floyd’s horrifying death in a moment, but I’ll start with the Minneapolis system’s failure. POLICE CHIEFS ACROSS US CONDEMN OFFICERS INVOLVED IN GEORGE FLOYD DEATH The first rule of riots is to preempt them and stop them. While people are rioting, the rule of law is collapsed and street mobs dominate. Because mobs are directionless and led only by waves of emotion, hostility and hate, every innocent person nearby is inherently in danger. The more authority pulls back, the more lawlessness moves in and the mob takes property, destroys property, and endangers lives. People who had been forced to stay home by COVID-19 now might find themselves forced to stay home because of fear of what might happen to them if the mob catches them in the street. And in the most violent neighborhoods, even staying in your own home is not a guarantee of safety. Small business owners in Minneapolis – who are often Somali, black or Hispanic, and mostly women – may find their lifetime’s work destroyed by a vengeful, hateful mob. The first duty of government is to provide physical security. But the city of Minneapolis failed to protect its citizens. The state of Minnesota failed to protect its citizens. Now President Trump is threatening to intervene with federal forces as President Lyndon Johnson did when rioting hit Detroit in 1967 and as President George H.W. Bush did in Los Angeles in 1992. Unfortunately, the tragedy unfolding in Minneapolis is one we have seen again and again. The first rule of riots is to preempt them and stop them. A significant part of the black community rightly feels abandoned and alienated. Liberalism has cheated them in virtually every aspect of their lives. They are trapped in a political system controlled by bureaucratic unions, interest groups dependent on or regulated by government, and left-wing activists. There is both a sense of hopelessness and a feeling of constant anger that can explode into rage. In Minneapolis, the teachers’ union traps poor children in schools that fail to educate them. This makes it hard to get a decent job. High taxes and layers of self-serving, unaccountable bureaucrats make it hard to create small businesses. Faced with high unemployment, few property owners, even fewer business owners, and no one to mentor young people in how to succeed, there is a depth of bitterness and despair. The liberal elected officials who dominate Minnesota and Minneapolis hold beliefs that simply don’t work. They hire too few police, train them too little, and offer them no support. Meanwhile, there are many studies that show if you want to reduce use-of-force incidents, government must fund police and ensure they are well-trained. Much of the black community sees the police as an occupying force. Liberals spew hatred of the police. Meanwhile, much of the police force sees itself as trying to protect people who dislike and sometimes despise the police. The video of the killing of George Floyd was horrifying to see. Anyone who saw it who had an ounce of compassion had to have been deeply enraged. The minute the video went viral, officials should have moved decisively to establish control. First, officials should have found a plausible reason to keep Officer Chauvin (who was finally arrested Friday) detained earlier, pending an investigation. The videos from multiple directions provide overwhelming proof that something horrendous happened, and officials should have known this would enrage people. Officials should have announced immediately and firmly that no violence or destructiveness would be tolerated. Peaceful demonstrations should have been accepted and encouraged. In addition, officials should have immediately mobilized enough National Guardsmen to retain control of the street. The liberals on the Minneapolis City Council have so weakened the police department that it should have been obvious the police could not maintain control. Furthermore, the police were going to be the focus of community anger, so asking the police to be the line between civilization and barbarism was inviting a disaster. The minute the crowd began to build around the police station, the National Guard should have been sent in to flood the streets with the forces of law and order (the classic British principle for controlling riots in Hong Kong).  CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER If necessary, the Minnesota State Police should have been assigned to work as partners with the Minneapolis Police in arresting anyone who broke the law. Instead of these tried and true principles for controlling a crisis, elected officials reacted in exactly the wrong way. They enraged the crowd by announcing they were not ready to immediately arrest Officer Chauvin, even though he was seen on video kneeling on George Floyd’s neck. Officials sounded weak and uncertain, giving the mob the impression its violence would be tolerated and condoned. The Minneapolis Police – after years of budget cuts, training cuts and vilification by elected officials and activists – decided it wasn’t their fight and began to empty the precinct station because they saw no reason to risk their lives for a political system that held them in contempt. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP There is every reason to be angry about what happened to George Floyd and to demand justice. There is no reason to allow a mob to take over Minneapolis. Sadly, this is a glimpse of much deeper roots of tragedy and failure in many American cities.  To read, hear, and watch more of Newt Gingrich’s commentary, visit Gingrich360.com.

 This week, for the first time, Twitter “fact-checked” one of President Trump’s opinions and redirected users to coverage from that paragon of fairness and objectivity, CNN (don’t laugh). Twitter announced the introduction of the new feature earlier this month. The goal, two workers wrote, is to “make it easy to find credible information” and to stanch the flow of “misleading content.” But I wonder: Will the platform also append “fact-check” labels and links to tweets from prominent liberals that also turned out to be “misleading” or outright false? JIM HANSON: TRUMP’S SOCIAL MEDIA EXECUTIVE ORDER IS JUSTIFIED – PROTECTS FREE SPEECH, COMBATS CENSORSHIP Start with a 2017 tweet from CNN contributor Ana Navarro claiming that an “Ivanka Fund got $100 million pledge from the Saudis and UAE.” The truth: The cash went to a World Bank initiative for female entrepreneurs. Navarro’s tweet garnered more than 43,000 retweets. Or how about a 2019 tweet from actress Nancy Lee Grahn that featured photos of migrant children at a border detention center and railed against Team Trump for allegedly torturing kids? As Internet sleuths pointed out, Grahn’s photo was cropped to remove the timestamp: 2015. It garnered nearly 50,000 retweets anyway. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Then there was Rachel Maddow’s blog’s 2018 claim that the White House had edited the video of the president’s Helsinki news conference with Russian strongman Vladimir Putin “to remove [a] question about whether [he] wanted Trump to win.” The Washington Post and numerous other outlets debunked the claim, yet the tweet is still up, with 24,000 retweets — and no Twitter warning label. In January 2019, former President Barack Obama’s ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, joined thousands of other members of the blue-check Twitterati in touting a made-for-Twitter BuzzFeed News exposé. “This is big,” McFaul wrote, “President Trump directed his attorney to lie to Congress.” Yes, big — and false: Special counsel Robert Mueller’s team was quick to characterize the story as inaccurate, and its report made clear that the president had done no such thing. No Twitter “fact-check” hazard for McFaul, et al., though. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Harvard law professor and #Resistance icon Laurence Tribe in December 2017 asked his followers to “retweet if, like me, you’re aware of nothing in the Christopher Steele dossier that has been shown to be false.” Nearly 8,000 did retweet, despite the fact that the dossier has been thoroughly debunked. Finally, on a local note: Surely, if a tweet should come with a health hazard, it was city Councilman Mark Levine’s February invitation to Gothamites to celebrate the Lunar New Year in Chinatown “in defiance of the coronavirus”: “If you are staying away, you are missing out!” This column originally appeared in the New York Post.

With so many forced to adopt telework and distance learning policies in a matter of days, it is very likely this national health pandemic will permanently shift the operational mindsets of many businesses, universities and local governments. As we aim to embrace our new reality, society is looking for alternative means to achieve some sense of normalcy. Whether it be video conferencing in a work environment, distance learning for students, or more phone calls instead of face-to-face interactions, in so many ways we have leaned on technology to fill the gap of physical presence. While utilizing these forms of technology have been proven to be a saving grace for many Americans, a group of lawmakers on Capitol Hill and several political action groups are now suggesting we should offer fully digital ballots for the upcoming 2020 election. From a societal stance, I understand why this is a proposed solution. But, as the CEO of a cybersecurity firm, I can tell you that from a technological stance, it is quite frankly a terrible idea. RNC CHAIR McDANIEL: DEMOCRATS AND VOTER FRAUD IN NEVADA — HERE'S HOW IT WILL IMPACT YOU First and foremost, just as we’ve seen recently with Zoom, the Internet is not a secure place.  Why on Earth would anyone think hosting an election in an environment where hackers target Americans and hold their personal data hostage is a good idea? Even more so, say we do offer ballots that are delivered, completed and returned digitally – the data captured during the voting process and the integrity of the ballot has multiple places to be potentially compromised. The first potential area the ballot could be compromised – delivery. Whether it’s done through a website or app, the American democracy is now reliant upon the functionality and security of this platform. What happens if the website or app has technical issues like Iowa experienced during its caucuses earlier this year? How will the site be kept secure? America is in no position to begin hosting elections online.  Next, you have the completion of the ballot. How will officials know who is completing it and what validation measures will be in place to ensure my vote is truly my vote? Between the potential technical issues, the threat of security breaches, concerns of ballot integrity, and the idea of putting a massive target on this process for cybercrime, the pros of voting online most certainly do not outweigh the cons.  Assuming personal information is being shared, how will that be kept safe? Data breaches happen regularly, and if America decides to host an online election, can you imagine how big that target will be for cybercrime? Personal information for every American eligible to vote?! A hackers goldmine. Then there is the submission phase. This data would be stored on a server somewhere. How secure is it, both physically and digitally? What backups are in place to ensure the integrity of the ballots is not compromised, or hacked and held for ransom? Now, while it is understandable to question why we accept mail-in absentee ballots but are urging that we shouldn’t consider an absentee online voting system, I’d point to one distinct added variable to an online voting process – cybersecurity risks become an imminent threat. In every absentee situation, regardless of where those ballots originate, we are forced to validate the integrity of each ballot. With an online voting process, not only would we have to see the validation process through, but we’d be charged with securing an online-based electoral process from falling victim to a cyberattack when we’re not even fully successful at protecting basic government entities from falling victim to the very same sorts of attacks. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Between the potential technical issues, the threat of security breaches, concerns of ballot integrity, and the idea of putting a massive target on this process for cybercrime, the pros of voting online most certainly do not outweigh the cons, and absolutely could undermine the integrity of our nation’s entire electoral process. There’s no doubt that technology is amazing and really has become the crutch for America during these uncertain times. However, even with that being true, America is in no position to begin hosting elections online.

 If you were watching any of the coverage from Minneapolis about what happened Wednesday night, you know perfectly well that what's happening on the streets there. No matter what it may look like, is actually a quest for justice. It's long overdue search for answers by legitimately frustrated protesters who, if we are going to be honest about it, have been oppressed for so long they can no longer stand idle. What you're seeing in Minneapolis is democracy in its purest form. CNN REPORTER, CREW FREED AFTER BEING ARRESTED WHILE COVERING GEORGE FLOYD PROTESTS Effectively, it's a political rally. Here's was a representative scene last night. Unidentified male: This is literally the craziest stuff I've ever seen right now. This is Target right now. "Now, wait a second," you may be thinking. "That didn't look like a political rally. Those people look like looters. They were smashing cash registers with hammers to steal other people's money." Well, yes, technically they were doing that. And yes, as a factual matter, they were smashing the cash registers because they had already stolen everything else in the store. So no, it doesn't look like conventional political activism. But before you judge them, keep in mind, it could have been far worse. It's not like they were doing something immoral, like protesting Gretchen Whitmer's coronavirus lockdowns in Michigan. That would have been a different story. Joy Reid, MSNBC host: Black people's right to protest is secondary to white people's right to be an armed protest with long guns, terrifying-looking war weapons. Chris Hayes, MSNBC host: This is how the protest of George Floyd's death ended up. Police in riot gear, flooding the streets with teargas and shooting rubber bullets into the crowd. Another example of how this pandemic has been a kind of black light, exposing all the inequalities in American life. Chris Cuomo, CNN anchor: That's the meme that's going around right now with the cops, with the black kid on the ground saying hello to the white guy in camo with the AK-47 and the mask who was protesting in Michigan. That when it's white people with guns and they're out and they're angry and their faces with cops -- CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Don Lemon, CNN anchor: I didn't see any of that. Cuomo: Everybody is civil. Eddie Glaude, Jr.. chairman of African-American Studies at Princeton University and MSNBC contributor: It says if some people are accorded the rights of citizenship and other folks are just expected to be obedient. Peaceful -- it ended up in the [Michigan] state capitol, Craig, with automatic weapons and they were treated with kid gloves. Oh, you see, it's not at all like those fascists in Michigan. In Minneapolis, there is a reason people are doing it -- a legitimate reason, even the cash register masters. They were simply smashing the cash register, so relax. In any given year, police kill more white suspects, armed and unarmed, than black suspects. And that's a fact, by the way. It's not political propaganda. It's probably true. Yet no one on television will ever say that because that fact threatens the scams they're working. By the way, the cash registers deserved it anyway. As Joy Reid suggests on MSNBC, they're probably European cash registers and therefore complicit in oppression. Reid: Europeans came to this country to get away from being subjects of the kings in Europe. But what they did was they created for themselves sort of a kingdom -- every man a king, but the subjects are black people. These armed white men who can get armed up and walk into a state capitol [in Michigan], and that's okay and the police are benign. They don't even act afraid. But let black people show up and protest the death of an innocent black man, and suddenly, you know what, we need tear gas. We've got to go full force. Charlottesville, the same thing. The police were there to protect the people who were marching as Neo-Nazis, not to protect the black people. So who watches Joy Reid, you may be wondering? Well, it turns out the people who run Minneapolis apparently watch Joy Reid. As their city crumbled around them, local leaders huddled in deliberation. They emerged with a plan. They declared that racism is "a national emergency." CNN immediately trumpeted the development as if it were breaking news. Meanwhile, mobs in downtown Minneapolis kept looting stores, kept burning. Normal people of all colors huddled indoors, terrified. No one bothered to explain how any of this was connected. How exactly does racism have anything to do with looting ATM machines or stealing PlayStations from Target? It's confusing. What we do know is that riots are now acceptable because racism is a national emergency. That's the new standard. Okay. So now that we're in a state of national emergency, the question is, what is not acceptable? What's not okay? Anything? Here's what some of the quote "protesters" were chanting last night in Minneapolis. Unidentified female: Shoot the white folk. Shoot the white folk. So, you're not going to see that clip on CNN. How come? It is simple. Facts like this -- and there are a lot of them -- challenge the carefully constructed storyline that our leaders richly profit from. Therefore those facts must be suppressed. Things are falling apart in Minneapolis. And as they collapse, our leadership class seems thrilled. They're doing nothing to calm racial division. In fact, they're eagerly stoking it. For example, practically every day, we're told that white cops are a mortal threat to black men and some are, obviously. It's what started this whole thing. A black man was killed by the police. It's awful. But what are the national numbers on this? Well, actually, we know the answer. A study from last year found that white police officers were less likely to shoot and kill nonwhite suspects than nonwhite police officers were. In any given year, police kill more white suspects, armed and unarmed, than black suspects. And that's a fact, by the way. It's not political propaganda. It's probably true. Yet no one on television will ever say that because that fact threatens the scams they're working. Eddie Glaude, Jr. might be the living embodiment of this phenomenon. If you've ever wondered whether yelling racist at the people you want things from its an effective business plan, Eddie Glaude is living proof that indeed it is. By regularly screaming "racist," Glaude has been able to ride a mediocre academic career all the way to an endowed professorship at Princeton. It's a job with such high pay and so few actual requirements that Glaude can dress like a British lord, and spend much of his day shuttling by limo between cable news hits. Talk about a sweet gig. As long as Eddie Glaude continues to denounce people as racist -- the right people -- he can probably keep that job forever. So naturally, Eddie Glaude has no interest in explaining how exactly racism makes people loot Target. It just does, okay? And if you disagree with that premise, you're a racist yourself. So shut up. Minneapolis has decided to just let their riot happen and damn the consequences. As Glaude told viewers in MSNBC, it's all about the "context." Glaude: Most human beings' natural inclination when they feel wronged, when they feel put upon, when they're living under oppressed conditions, is to lash out. And this is the history of the modern West, the history of the world. And so part of what we have to do is try to understand the context of what led to what happened. Oh, "the context" -- and squint your eyes as you say "the context." Of course, there's a context to setting fire to McDonald's, says Professor Glaude. It's interesting. So, you've got to wonder how would Eddie Glaude, Jr. respond if something like this happened to him. If looters descended on his house, would Glaude gently describe them as "protesters" as they made off with his Hermes necktie collection? If thugs with bandanas on their faces smashed the windshield of his BMW with rocks, would Eddie Glaude call the police? Or would calling the police be racist? Just how long, in other words, could Edie Glaude maintain his fraudulent racial justice shtick in the face of the kind of violence that he routinely excuses on television? We're thinking not very long. It's just a guess. Let's hope Eddie Glaude is never tested on that, certainly, anytime soon. Let's hope none of us are tested. The problem with outbreaks of mob violence is you really have no idea where they're going next. You can't know. Sometimes they subside; often, they metastasize. They're unpredictable, and they are mortally dangerous, and that's why you don't encourage them. In St. Paul, signs have appeared in store windows announcing, "This is a black-owned business." In other words, we're the right skin color, spare us. What does that tell you? Imagine if you saw a sign saying "white-owned business" in windows. You would be horrified and you should be. You'd know it was a race riot. We've had a lot of those in this country through the years and there is nothing worse than that. But Minneapolis has decided to just let their riot happen and damn the consequences. Watch the city's police chief explain why he doesn't plan to do anything at all to stop rioters. Reporter: So, what you're saying is it's too dangerous for police to directly confront the looters, so you've made the decision to maybe let that site go for now and focus on keeping the rest of the neighborhood as safe as possible? Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo: Absolutely. Our officers are being -- have been through several hours here, Molotov cocktails thrown at them, rocks and other projectiles. And so obviously their safety is paramount, and so I don't want them going into an area where they're at risk of harm themselves. Obviously, the safety of officers is paramount announces the chief. The interviewer says nothing. But in fact, it's not at all obvious. In fact, it's perfectly backward. Society's first concern is the safety of citizens, especially the weakest citizens. That's why we have police in the first place -- to protect people who cannot protect themselves, the public. Not everyone wants to do that job and that's fine. Do something else. But we can't allow this. Imagine if the Secret Service adopted the same attitude. Sorry, I can't protect the president today, too risky. How about the military? We'd love to repel the invasion, but unfortunately, we might get hurt. Our apologies. Things would fall apart. Things are falling apart in Minneapolis. And as they collapse, our leadership class seems thrilled. They're doing nothing to calm racial division. In fact, they're eagerly stoking it. The New York Times wrote a piece Thursday morning with the title, "How White Women Use Themselves as Instruments of Terror." The subhead read this way: "There are too many noosed necks, charred bodies and drown souls for them to deny knowing precisely what they are doing." Wait a second. "Them"? What "they" are doing? Keep in mind, this didn't run in Louis Farrakhan's free weekly. This was The New York Times, this country's most important newspaper, the high temple of American liberalism. The New York Times is telling you that every single person of a certain color and sex has a hand in genocide. They are stained by bloodguilt. They are murderers, every one of them. What do you do to murderers? You know the answer. It's hard to believe our leaders are actually talking like this. But they are -- a lot and loudly. And if they keep it up, things will not end well. Yet, they show no signs of slowing down. Watch as two of CNN's leading lights get to the bottom of the national emergency we're living through. They've discovered who is responsible for it -- 100 percent responsible. They know who is guilty. Here's a hint: It's an entire racial group. Don Lemon: It is not incumbent upon black people to stop racism, to stop this. It is incumbent upon people who hold the power in this society to help to do that, to do the heavy lifting. And guess who that is? Who is that, Chris? Chris Cuomo: White people. The funny thing is, as we often point out, these are the very same people who claim they're fighting your racism. Okay. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But the problem is much bigger this time than mere hypocrisy. We're very used to that. This problem is far more ominous. Here it is in three sentences. There are 320 million of us in this country. A lot of us are very different from one another, yet we all have to live together. In fact, most of us want to live together. But suddenly our leaders are making that dangerously difficult. Adapted from Tucker Carlson's monologue from "Tucker Carlson Tonight" on May 28, 2020. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM TUCKER CARLSON

Ohio continues lifting restrictions and soon will allow weddings with up to 300 people. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. “As Ohio goes, so goes the nation.” That’s the mantra we have heard in presidential elections time and time again. A ruling by an activist federal judge in the Buckeye state foreshadows a dangerous outcome for the rest of the country. Hopefully, an appellate court ruling has saved the day for now, but we now have insight into the liberal playbook for future elections. Once hailed as the most purple state in the country, Ohio’s changing demographics are making it redder by the year. That will not stop Democrats from putting resources into the Buckeye state to try and expand Joe Biden’s path to electoral victory. The national COVID-19 pandemic has impacted all facets of our lives and our ability to vote in elections is included. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, has been focused on having as normal an election as possible in November, but an unelected, Bill Clinton appointed judge has attempted to throw a wrench in the process. And, it’s a precedent we are likely to see more of in the future. OHIO GOV. MIKE DEWINE SAYS CAREFUL REOPENING PROCESS SHOWING POSITIVE RESULTS Last week, Southern District Court Edmund Sargus Jr. ruled that because groups trying to get liberal pet issues into the Ohio constitution “cannot collect signatures in person” by the legal deadlines due to the state’s stay-at-home order, the Secretary of State must accept electronic signatures. By allowing signatures to be submitted electronically, Sargus effectively tried to remove accountability from the process. Under his ruling, witnesses were no longer required, and his recommendations essentially required a computer science degree to determine whether potential fraud may be occurring. Our democracy demands better. In reading between the lines, here’s the simple strategy: the more liberal issues which appear on the ballot, the more likely it is that Democrats will come to the polls.  This is especially true when they are not enamored with their candidate at the top of the ticket. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER I’m not a believer that either voter fraud or voter suppression occurs to the degree advocates on either side of the debate profess it happens.  But, activist decisions like this one degrade the efficacy people have in the electoral process. The integrity of our elections is as equally important as the ability for citizens to believe their vote is counted. Provisions like this have been introduced in legislatures across America.  Not a single one has passed and currently, electoral signature gathering is only allowed in Massachusetts. Oh, and that one was forced by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court just a few weeks ago. Notice a pattern? Thankfully, LaRose asked Attorney General Dave Yost to appeal this faulty decision to the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals and the judge’s order was stayed pending further appeal. Depending on where this case goes from here, Ohioans could be forced into this scenario even though the process has not been vetted in any meaningful way by any other state. Nor has it even been debated in Ohio!  We have foreign governments that we know have targeted our elections, yet it’s OK for an activist judge to mandate a technology on voters without informing us about the potential downsides? CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP While Judge Sargus only made this ruling for a select group of liberal issues and only for this November’s election, we all understand how the slippery slope works.  Once the goalposts move, it is almost impossible to have a sane discussion about returning to normalcy without voting groups screaming about suppression from the tops of their lungs. If electronic signature gathering is allowed only for the 2020 pandemic, smart money is it starts to spread in 2021 and beyond. Moreover, why would this only apply to issue campaigns. Signature gathering is the same basic process regardless of the type of elections.  Candidates will likely be granted this ability to use the internet to gather signatures as well. Thankfully, the U.S. Sixth Court of Appeals has restored temporary sanity to the process. Regardless of the ultimate outcome of this particular case, electronic signature gathering is likely going to be the next hot topic in the battle over the ballot box. If it’s true that Ohio sets the tone for the nation, electronic signature gathering could be coming to your state.

 Former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is a master of prevarication and deflection. He holds an M.S. in BS and a Ph.D. in vacuous excuses. He’s a professor emeritus of duplicity and deception. As a prodigious suck-up, he’s the Eddie Haskell of lawyers. We can expect Rosenstein’s skill set to be on full display Wednesday when he finally and belatedly appears before the Senate Judiciary Committee as its first witness in an investigation into the origins and evolution of the fallacious Trump-Russia collusion probe. During his ignominious tenure at the Justice Department, Rosenstein was at the center of the Russia hoax, pulling the investigatory levers of manipulation over an imaginary collusion conspiracy that eventually went bust. But not before incalculable damage was done to the Trump presidency, government institutions and America’s faith in our system of justice.  ROSENSTEIN TO TESTIFY AS FIRST WITNESS IN SENATE JUDICIARY'S RUSSIA PROBE Before his departure from the Justice Department in May 2019, Rosenstein consistently spurned most attempts by Congress to explain his inexplicable actions and shady tactics. He was a profile in cowardice. Perhaps now he will be held to account. It won’t be easy. When the truth is at issue, Rosenstein is as slippery as an eel. He’s deathly allergic to personal and professional responsibility. Everyone else is to blame. When in doubt, deny it ever happened. In Rosenstein’s orbit, integrity is a mythical platitude. FBI Investigation Was Illegitimate Rosenstein’s testimony comes at a critical juncture. Just recently, the FBI document that launched the Trump-Russia witch hunt was declassified and made public. The FBI Electronic Communication (EC) dated July 31, 2016, identifies not a single scrap of plausible evidence that justified the bureau’s investigation of the Trump campaign. Under FBI regulations governing the opening of a formal probe, the agency is required to present specific articulable facts and credible evidence in support of a crime. None was stated in the EC. Hence, there was never a factual predicate nor a reasonable basis that warranted what then-FBI Director James Comey’s bureau was doing. Moreover, there was no reliable intelligence information to merit a counterintelligence probe, which was a cleverly contrived cover for a criminal investigation.  Undeterred, then-FBI agent Peter Strzok engineered what can only be described as a “phantom” EC record to target the Trump campaign with a baseless investigation in search of a crime. As Kevin Brock, a former FBI assistant director of intelligence, observed: “It was a document created by Peter Strzok, approved by Peter Strzok, and sent from Peter Strzok to Peter Strzok.”   Brock says the EC memo proves that the FBI’s investigation should never have been opened up “in a million years.”  He called it a “made-up investigation that sprung from the mind of someone who despised Donald Trump, and then blessed by inexperienced leadership at the highest levels who harbored their own now well-established biases.” Given this newly discovered information, Rosenstein must be asked during his Senate testimony about his knowledge of the FBI’s corrupt conduct in triggering an invalid investigation of Trump. When then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself, Rosenstein was placed in charge of the case in April 2017. Did he examine the FBI file and discover it was devoid of evidence and therefore illegitimate? How could he not? Why didn’t he expose the truth? Did Rosenstein question Comey, Strzok and others at the FBI about any of this or demand that they produce some tangible evidence that would justify the continued investigation? Why didn’t Rosenstein shut down an obviously illicit probe of the president? He had every opportunity to do so, but did not. Instead, he accelerated and elevated the investigation to a more dangerous level. Mueller’s Appointment Was Illegitimate              The appointment of a special counsel applies only to criminal investigations, not to counterintelligence probes. Yet, at the time that Robert Mueller was appointed as special counsel to investigate what we now know is the Trump-Russia collusion hoax by Rosenstein on May 17, 2017, the FBI’s case was a counterintelligence matter, according to Comey’s own testimony. Rosenstein must be asked specifically by members of the Senate Judiciary Committee why he appointed Mueller. There was still no evidence of a collusion conspiracy involving the Trump campaign and Russia. Months earlier, in January of 2017, the FBI had debunked the infamous Steele “dossier” upon which the FBI had so heavily relied. It turned out to be a collection of fabrications and exaggerations, as Inspector General Michael Horowitz later found. Other FBI efforts to locate collusion evidence produced nothing.  Therefore, upon what legal and factual basis did Rosenstein make the appointment? The special counsel regulations require that there first be some evidence of a potential crime. What crime? What evidence? An “articulable criminal act” must be identified. What act? It is clear that Mueller’s appointment was defective because he was empowered to investigate something that was not authorized by the regulations. Those same regulations also state that a special counsel can only be named where an investigation or prosecution “would present a conflict of interest for the Department of Justice.” Where exactly was the conflict? Sessions had already recused himself, and there were no other known conflicts that would have prevented regular prosecutors from handling the case. Rosenstein has never offered an explanation for that fundamental defect. He must now be asked.  A lawyer cannot be an impartial investigator, witness, prosecutor and judge all rolled into one. It is folly for Rosenstein to argue (although he surely will) that the firing of Comey was the reason for the special counsel, inasmuch as it was Rosenstein who authored the memo recommending the director be sacked for repeatedly violating FBI regulations. Was Rosenstein unduly influenced by Comey himself? Recall that the canned director bragged how he leaked presidential memos to the media for the sole purpose of triggering a special counsel. Rosenstein must be asked if Comey’s devious machinations prompted the decision to name Mueller. And why select Mueller of all people? He was a longtime friend, colleague and ally of Comey. Isn’t that a serious conflict of interest? Was there some hidden deal? Was Mueller hired to either justify or cover up what Comey had done? Who did Rosenstein talk to about hiring Mueller? Where did the idea emanate?  When Trump met with Mueller in the Oval Office (ostensibly to interview Mueller for the job of replacing Comey as FBI director) the day before Mueller was named as special counsel, why was Mueller’s pending appointment concealed from the president? Was this a scheme to gather evidence against Trump about his firing of Comey? Rosenstein’s Refusal to Recuse Himself  Once Mueller was appointed, he began investigating whether Trump had obstructed justice in the firing of Comey – again, an absurd proposition. Since Rosenstein had held extensive conversations with Trump and Sessions about discharging Comey for a justifiable cause, this made Rosenstein a central witness in any obstruction case. It presented an egregious conflict of interest that demanded his recusal. Yet, Rosenstein refused. Why? The most important person who could attest to the president’s motivations was the very man who supervised the investigation into Trump’s intent. There is no greater conflict of interest. Footnotes in the Mueller Report seem to confirm that Rosenstein was actually interviewed as a witness by the special counsel. Although Mueller answered to Rosenstein it was Rosenstein who had to answer Mueller’s questions. That is about as warped and improper as a case can get. Think of it this way: the boss was questioned by his subordinate, and then the boss played an instrumental role in deciding whether charges should be brought based, in whole or in part, on his own testimony. It does not take a genius to realize that the scenario was fundamentally wrong and unethical. A lawyer cannot be an impartial investigator, witness, prosecutor and judge all rolled into one. Rosenstein must be asked hard questions about his atrocious lapse in judgment that rendered the entire special counsel investigation inherently suspect amid persistent questions of self-interest, political bias and a lack of objectivity. The then-deputy attorney general advised Trump how to get rid of Comey and then hired Mueller to investigate whether that decision constituted obstruction of justice by the president. No responsible and ethical lawyer would ever do such a thing. What if Rosenstein did not tell the truth when he was interviewed? What if other witnesses or documents offered proof that he lied? As supervisor of the case, would he disregard it and cover it up? Or would he decide to charge himself for false statements or perjury?  Rosenstein had not just one but two untenable conflicts of interest. He was tangled up in the “collusion” case, as well. He signed his name on the fourth FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) warrant application to spy on Trump campaign associate Carter Page. The Justice Department subsequently determined that the warrant was unlawfully obtained without probable cause.  In my next column, I will outline how the Senate Judiciary Committee should hold Rosenstein to account for the lies and fraud perpetrated on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP I’ll also address how Rosenstein should be grilled by senators over his leading role in what became known as the “attempted coup” – a disgraceful plot to secretly record the president and recruit Cabinet members to remove him from office under the 25th Amendment. Rosenstein told Trump that “it didn’t happen.” Government memos show that it did.  There is a lot to this sordid story … and many more questions for the reprehensible Rosenstein.

 Ahmaud Arbery. Breonna Taylor. And now, George Floyd. These promising young Americans had their whole lives ahead of them until two white male vigilantes, a rage-filled law enforcement officer, and a no-knock warrant cost them everything. These Americans, who were just like me, were killed simply because they happen to be black in the United States of America. I know that some will attempt to view the lives and deaths of Arbery, Taylor and Floyd in a vacuum. These individuals will also attempt to flip the stories and make you believe that these three Americans’ deaths were standalone incidents that don’t describe the general American experience for people of color. They will also try to urge you to hold judgment until we get all the facts, while bringing up facts about the victims’ past mistakes as if those indiscretions should somehow excuse their deaths. The truth is that the apologists are wrong. We as a nation must come to the realization that prejudice is alive and well. These young people are just three more victims of the deadly epidemic known as racism. GEORGE FLOYD CASE: TWO MINNEAPOLIS COPS CAUGHT ON TAPE HAVE HISTORY OF CONDUCT COMPLAINTS There isn’t a black person I know who wants to debate race and racism all day. Truth be told, just like every other American, black people – myself included – want to live in peace. We want to sleep in our beds without fear. We want to send our kids to school without worrying about an overzealous school resource officer. We want to live in our communities without trauma, judgment, scrutiny or being deemed a threat. For more than 400 years – even before America was an independent nation – this land has been stained by the impacts of racism. While we have made a lot of progress, the stain hasn’t been washed away. It has actually become more pronounced. When a police officer is allowed his freedom after suffocating a fellow American to death while atop his neck with his knee – as happened to George Floyd – we have a problem. When two men can shoot and kill a black man jogging in his neighborhood – as happened to Ahmaud Arbery – and not be arrested on the spot, we have a problem. When a law enforcement officer can fatally shoot an EMT in her head while she’s at home resting between shifts – as happened to Breonna Taylor – we have a problem. America’s racism problem won’t be solved in the halls of Congress or in state capitols. Though there’s a great deal of legislative work that we can do, our problems must be resolved around kitchen tables and in living rooms. We as a nation must come to the realization that prejudice is alive and well. For far too long, African-Americans have led the fight for racial justice and equity. The news over the last three months makes it clear that white racial animus can only end when white Americans make the choice to be anti-racist. Anti-racists acknowledge their privilege, work to challenge internalized racism and most importantly, interrupt racism when they witness it. Now let’s be clear, acknowledging privilege in America has nothing to do with economic, political or social status. It has everything to do with how one is seen by society. The best way to understand it is by asking yourself this simple question: would the three black people discussed above still be alive today if they were white? The likely answer is that yes, they probably would. That’s because the idea of a white officer placing his knee on a white man’s neck sounds almost improbable. It is! About 1 in 1,000 black men and boys in this country can expect to die at the hands of law enforcement, according to a recent analysis of officer-related deaths by the National Academy of Sciences. That makes this group 2.5 times more likely than their white counterparts to not survive an encounter with a cop. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER For decades, black America has been raising its voice and demanding change in this country. We have urged our elected leaders of both parties to work with us to end the health, economic, education and societal disparities that have plagued this country. We have pushed for greater police accountability and transparency. We have also asked, simply, to be treated justly in classrooms, courtrooms and boardrooms. This time around, we are tired and we can no longer do it by ourselves. We didn’t create racism, and we can’t be tasked to dismantle it by ourselves. George Floyd should be with his children right now. Ahmaud Arbery should have just returned from a jog. Breonna Taylor should be getting ready for work. Sadly, they have all been killed by racism – a solvable epidemic that’s spreading.

My message to non-black Americans is simple: If you can see us as humans, you should be willing to add your voice to the choir of justified protesters around the country demanding justice, fairness, and – most importantly – liberty for other Americans. You should be willing to do so just as you would do for your son, daughter, mother or father CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY RICHARD FOWLER 

 President Trump was absolutely right to direct the Justice Department and FBI Thursday to conduct an expedited investigation of the death of George Floyd, an African-American man who died in the custody of Minneapolis police Monday. Rioting and violent protests of the death continued for a second night Thursday in Minneapolis and spread to New York City and other cities. The Justice Department has confirmed that the investigation of Floyd’s death is a high priority and according to the Wall Street Journal “it was assigning experienced prosecutors and FBI criminal investigators to see if Minneapolis police officers broke federal law, including whether they willfully violated Mr. Floyd’s constitutional rights.” GEORGE FLOYD UNREST IN MINNESOTA: FEDS, LAW ENFORCEMENT CALL FOR CALM, TIME TO INVESTIGATE AMID RIOTS From 2007 to 2011 I worked at the city of Boston Corporation Counsel’s office defending police officers in civil claims of excessive force, wrongful conviction and other lawsuits alleging constitutional violations. My natural inclination from that experience is to not rush to judgment in these kinds of cases, but to learn all the facts and see it from both sides before making a conclusion. The George Floyd case is different. There is no nuance here. Surveillance video from a nearby restaurant makes it crystal clear that Floyd was handcuffed and appeared to be fully cooperative with police. The video shows there was no need for Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin to push his knee into Floyd’s neck for eight minutes, ultimately killing a restrained and defenseless man. The case is now in the hands of U.S. Attorney Erica MacDonald in Minnesota and the special agent in charge of the Minneapolis FBI field office. They will work in conjunction with the Civil Rights Division at Justice Department headquarters, which is run by Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband. Undoubtedly, Attorney General William Barr will be heavily involved with how this investigation moves forward. Surveillance video from a nearby restaurant makes it crystal clear that Floyd was handcuffed and appeared to be fully cooperative with police. Whether the investigation results in an indictment of Chauvin or the other officers will depend on whether U.S. Attorney MacDonald and the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division believe that a grand jury will find there is probable cause that any of the officers willfully violated 18 U.S.C. Section 242. That law makes it a crime for a person acting under color of any law (for example, a police officer) to willfully deprive a person of a right or privilege protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States. The question here for a grand jury would be whether Floyd was deprived the right to be free from unreasonable or excessive force by a police officer. Model jury instructions for the federal district courts of Minnesota state that in determining whether excessive force was used, jurors should consider “the need for application of force; the relationship between the need and the amount of force that was used; the extent of the injury inflicted; and whether a reasonable officer on the scene, without the benefit of hindsight, would have used as much force under similar circumstances.” In this case, it is clear that there was little if any need to use force, that even if force was somehow necessary the amount used was completely disproportionate, and that the injury inflicted was of the worst possible kind – death. As to the question of what a reasonable Minnesota police officer would have done in similar circumstance look no further than the Minneapolis Police Manual. It specifically prohibits the use of neck restraints where an officer is met only with “passive resistance.” “Passive resistance” is defined as “behavior initiated by a subject, when the subject does not comply with verbal or physical control efforts, yet the subject does not attempt to defeat an officer’s control efforts.” From the video, it certainly appears that, at worst, Floyd engaged in only passive resistance. As for how long an investigation may take before the Justice Department seeks an indictment, the case of Michael Slager may provide a roadmap. Slager, who was a police officer in North Charleston, S.C., shot a fleeing Walter Scott in the back and killed him on April 4, 2015. While Slager was indicted on murder charges by a South Carolina grand jury in June of 2015, it was not until May 11, 2016 – after a mistrial on state murder charges – that the Justice Department indicted Slager. Like the Slager case, there is a local investigation alongside the federal investigation. The Hennepin County Attorney may also want to file state charges. These would likely include first- degree manslaughter. The speed at which a federal case will move will in part depends on whether the Justice Department brings a case before the local prosecutors. But even in those circumstances, it is far from clear that the Justice Department could complete its investigation and seek an indictment before the fall, even with President Trump’s directive. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER In 2014, Eric Garner was killed on Staten Island in what many are calling an eerily similar situation when Garner was placed in a chokehold by New York City Police Officer Daniel Pantaleo and ultimately died. This incident was also caught on video. A Richmond County jury declined to indict Pantaleo and after five years the Justice Department decided it did not have a strong enough case to prosecute. The comparisons to Garner might cause some to fear that the Justice Department may ultimately back off an indictment because of the similarities. I don’t think that the department should, and I don’t think that it will. There are key facts that distinguish the cases. Eric Garner was not handcuffed and was resisting the officers’ attempts to restrain him. That does not mean that he somehow deserved to die, but Floyd’s case seems far clearer cut and less subject to interpretation. In Floyd’s case, he offered no resistance and he did not pose a danger to anyone – he was handcuffed and on the ground, helpless, while a police officer forced the life out of him.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP No case is a sure thing and considerations of success and failure should always guide decisions before attempting to indict someone in a high-profile case. Fortunately, both President Trump and Attorney General Barr have shown themselves to be fearless in the performance of their duties. Based on what we’ve seen, I believe that the facts and the law are on their side and that they will move swiftly to deliver justice in this case. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY IAN PRIOR

 President Trump was right and justified Thursday to sign an executive order calling for new regulations to strip legal liability protections from social media companies that censor posts and engage in political conduct on their sites. I hope the president never has to take action against any social media company. The solution to the very real problem of social media company discrimination – which most often is directed against conservative views – is to end the discrimination, rather than for the government to intervene. However, President Trump and many conservatives have identified a serious problem. Twitter and some other social media companies want to be two things at the same time: common carriers where anyone can post comments, and news organizations that selectively fact-check some posts and determine which ones are accurate and which ones are not. Making such determinations is an editorial decision that is often very subjective. TRUMP SIGNS SOCIAL MEDIA EXECUTIVE ORDER, CALLS FOR REMOVAL OF LIABILITY PROTECTIONS BECAUSE OF 'CENSORING' Right now social media companies enjoy protection from liability under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act for what is posted on their sites, because in most cases they allow people to post whatever they wish – as if they were posting on a giant virtual bulletin board. In contrast, news organizations can be sued for libel if they publish false information with “’actual malice’ – that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not,” according to a 1964 Supreme Court decision in the case New York Times Co. v. Sullivan. On average more than 500 million tweets are posted each day. You can see the enormous number tweeted on the day you read this here. It would be impossible for Twitter to review each of these tweets and fact-check them all before posting. Other social media companies face a similar impossible task. However, Twitter has selectively targeted conservatives – most recently President Trump this week – and has either taken down their tweets or labeled them as misleading and added a fact check, as was the case with two of the president’s tweets dealing with problems with mail-in voting. Ironically, the president’s tweets saying voter fraud can take place with mail-in voting were accurate. Twitter’s fact check claiming that the president’s tweets were factually inaccurate was itself inaccurate. What is crucial here is that by deciding to selectively review a tiny number of tweets on its site and running supposed fact checks on them, Twitter is exercising editorial judgment and deciding what people are told is true. Even Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, told Fox News’ Dana Perino that social media companies should not act as the “arbiter of truth.” ZUCKERBERG KNOCKS TWITTER FOR FACT-CHECKING TRUMP, SAYS PRIVATE COMPANIES SHOULDN'T BE 'THE ARBITER OF TRUTH' President Trump’s executive order states that social media companies that remove or restrict content should be exposed to liability “like any traditional editor and publisher that is not an online provider.” Will Twitter now fact-check every tweet by former Vice President Joe Biden and every Democratic elected official in the nation? Will Twitter now fact-check every tweet by former Vice President Joe Biden and every Democratic elected official in the nation? Will it fact check every tweet critical of President Trump? Obviously not. But by selectively running a fact check (which was actually inaccurate) on Trump’s tweets, Twitter abandoned all pretense of being an unbiased common carrier.   Social media companies should be like trains that allow anyone to board. As common carriers they should allow any ideas to be transported on their platforms without selecting which ones are permitted. Once the companies start picking and choosing among the ideas, they should lose their status and liability protection as common carriers. WHAT'S IN TRUMP'S EXECUTIVE ORDER ON SOCIAL MEDIA? Telephone companies are appropriately designated as common carriers. You can call anyone you want and say anything you want without exposing the phone company to liability for what you say. While a caller can be held liable for what he or she says on the phone – such as making a death threat, or plotting a terrorist attack – the phone company cannot be held liable because it does not censor calls. President Trump’s executive order doesn’t restrict speech or require Twitter, Facebook or other social media companies to publish any particular speech. It focuses on whether the companies act as publishers exercising editorial control or simply as unbiased platforms for content created by users. The order also asks federal agencies to evaluate whether the companies are applying their terms of service in ways that do not match the published terms of service. There is plenty of evidence showing that social media companies treat ideas and accounts differently based on political and ideological affiliation. The executive order calls for the Federal Trade Commission and a consortium of state attorneys general led by the U.S. attorney general to examine whether the actual practices of the social media companies are deceptive. The president’s executive order is a shot across the bow of the major social media firms. The order is an attempt to address the longstanding concern of many on the political right that the liberal activist nature of most social media company employees and the companies themselves has unfairly damaged conservative ideas and accounts. The companies deny they act in a biased manner, but they have been caught doing so in the past. During the 2018 midterm elections Twitter was exposed for shadow-banning conservative accounts, thereby limiting their reach to a much smaller audience. This affected Republican officeholders and candidates, but was not applied to their Democratic opponents. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Twitter initially denied this, but was eventually confronted with enough evidence that it had to remove the “quality filter” it had imposed that was causing this problem. President Trump announced he was considering all options such as the ones in the executive order during a Social Media Summit at the White House last July that I attended. There are several other aspects of social media company operations not called for in the executive order that could come under scrutiny in the future. One is an investigation by the Federal Election Commission into whether unfair treatment of Republican accounts compared to Democratic accounts amounts to an in-kind contribution by the social media companies to the advantaged campaign. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Federal Trade Commission could also look at the potential monopoly of the public information space by a handful of social media companies. President Trump has been clear that he does not want to trade the control now exercised by the tech firms for the unsubtle hand of a government overseer. But the social media censorship of our shared public information space in a way that discriminates against some ideas is an intolerable situation. Let’s hope the social media companies take the hint and change their ways. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY JIM HANSON

 As a young black man who spent a lot time running the streets of downtown Minneapolis, George Floyd’s terrible death Monday on those same streets really hurt. I grew up on those same streets where Floyd died this week. Minneapolis is not just where I grew up, it's a town where I poured my heart and soul into the sports, community and culture. I am a former Minnesota Viking and Gopher and in 2018 Mayor Jacob Frey awarded me the Key to the City of Minneapolis. GEORGE FLOYD CASE: MINNEAPOLIS POLICE CHIEF SAYS CITY'S 'DEFICIT OF HOPE' CANNOT BE COMPOUNDED WITH MORE TRAUMA, VIOLENCE It all feels so personal to me. In the aftermath of Floyd’s death, I was once again reminded of the reality many black men face as a result of a broken cop culture that has historically exonerated police officers who commit blatant hate crimes. And as a national spokesman for the Police Athletic League, I pray that we don’t let a handful of evil cops take away from the amazing things many law enforcement officers bring to communities across our nation. I must admit, it’s emotionally draining to write this often about unarmed black men losing their life at the hands of evil individuals who are supposed to be defending and protecting their fellow citizens. It’s even more draining to continue to watch polarization and identity politics being used to divide us following a brother or sister’s tragic loss of life. This is definitely a war -- I just hope we keep our eye on the actual enemy. If we take our eye off fighting the evil of racism to focus on politicizing identity, then we will continue to lose this spiritual war. According to Fox News, “The Justice Department said Thursday morning that it has made the federal investigation into George Floyd's death a ‘top priority’ and assigned experienced prosecutors to investigate the death of the Minneapolis black man. Floyd died after he was handcuffed by a white police officer.” That’s how we honor the loss of a fellow American brother. Seeing fabricated photos and posts from prominent black leaders like Ice Cube and others depicting the evil murderers of George Floyd as a racist Trump supporter is just not how we should proceed. And it’s certainly not how we are going to win this fight against the evil spirit of racism that is at the root of years of racial oppression and civil rights injustices. If we take our eye off fighting the evil of racism to focus on politicizing identity, then we will continue to lose this spiritual war. Most decent, God-fearing Americans cringe at the sight of a cop pressing his knee into the throat of a handcuffed man. White, black, green or purple. After watching Trayvon Martin’s killer avoid federal hate crime charges from the Obama administration’s Department of Justice, I began to really lose faith in our system. GEORGE FLOYD CASE: TWO MINNEAPOLIS COPS CAUGHT ON TAPE HAVE HISTORY OF CONDUCT COMPLAINTS When pro athletes kneel or protesters take to the streets demanding justice, the more tangible solution is something different. What’s needed is a full prosecution by local law enforcement as well as the DOJ enforcing federal hate crime laws. The sad reality is that, over our history, this has just not happened. The federal definition of a hate crime is: "An offense involving actual or perceived race, color, religion or national origin. Whoever, whether or not acting under color of law, willfully causes bodily injury to any person or, through the use of fire, a firearm, a dangerous weapon, or an explosive or incendiary device, attempts to cause bodily injury to any person, because of the actual or perceived race, color, religion or national origin of any person." Additionally, any offense committed against an individual because of actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability is also a hate crime. Despite the mainstream media’s attempt to spin when it comes to police brutality and hate crimes perpetrated against unarmed black men, the truth may not be what you expect. From Trayvon Martin to Freddie Gray to Michael Brown to Eric Gardner to Alton Sterling, no rogue cop or racially motivated citizen’s arrest was ever charged with a hate crime under the Obama administration’s Department of Justice. As shocking as all of this may sound to folks like Ice Cube and others, President Donald J. Trump’s Department of Justice became the first in over a decade to prosecute a police officer for a hate crime in 2018. At the time this also surprised me and seemed unlikely, as former Attorney General Jeff Sessions made a direct attempt to shield police officers from the Department of Justice. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Then came AG Bill Barr, who wasted no time upholding justice for Americans of all races, colors and creeds. On his last day in office, Sessions signed a memo in an attempt to limit the DOJ’s ability to federally enforce cases that dealt with local law enforcement. His memo stated, “These guidelines are designed to ensure that consent decrees with state and local governments are narrowly tailored to remedy the alleged violations and are not used to extract greater relief from the state or local government than the Department could obtain through litigation. They are also structured to ensure that, where appropriate, responsibility is returned to democratically accountable state and local institutions.” This should not be a surprise, as Sessions was against reversing many of our nation’s most oppressive policies toward blacks, which included being adamantly against the passing of the historic First Step Act. This deepened his already well-established credentials of being perceived as an old school establishment racist. Under the direction of the Trump administration, Barr has not allowed partisan politics or racial bias to erode justice, as displayed by wasting no time to prosecute the recent lynching of Ahmaud Arbery as a federal hate crime. Following this week’s murder of George Floyd, the FBI is already investigating this tragedy. Now the nation needs to rally together to call on the Trump administration’s Department of Justice to quickly pursue hate-crime charges against the four Minneapolis police officers. Black men like myself shouldn’t have to look over our shoulders at cops. We shouldn’t have to worry about our black sons getting pulled over while driving to the store. And shall I mention that our main issues are not all black and white. The same pain we feel when a cop kills an unarmed black man is the same hurt we must feel with a black man kills another black man in the inner city. It’s simply the golden rule of loving thy neighbor as thy self. Since his terrible death, I’ve spoken with people who knew Floyd. He put out messages to black youth in Texas to stop killing each other. He was a security guard who always wanted to resolve issues, not invoke violence. It is sad and it’s not right for protesters to be igniting violence and looting in the name of a man who was so loving and peaceful.

We must keep our eye on the real enemy if we are ever going to win the war on racism. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JACK BREWER

Tom Wolf’s heavy-handed economic shutdown. Fighting back tears at a rally, owner Brad Shepler delivered a warning far clearer than anything the governor has said in weeks: “You need to realize, we’re all losing our rights as American citizens. And we should all be afraid of that.” State officials threatened to revoke Shepler’s barbering license and fine him up to $10,000 per day after he reopened his business without authorization. This individual revolt — and countless others — came just days after eight Pennsylvania counties threatened to ditch Wolf’s haphazard reopening process to make their own decisions. Meanwhile, state lawmakers have passed bill after bill to reopen critical industries and reverse Wolf’s refusal to abide by transparency measures in the state’s equivalent of the Freedom of Information Act. JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO: CORONAVIRUS SHUTDOWNS ORDERED BY GOVERNORS AND MAYORS ARE UNCONSTITUTIONAL There are common denominators in the governor’s decisions: he makes them behind closed doors, and they hurt people. As a result, Pennsylvania is now in the throes of a second public health crisis, devastated by the predictable after-effects of mass unemployment and social isolation. Overdoses, drug-related deaths, domestic violence, domestic abuse, anxiety, depression, and suicide attempts are all spiking. Wolf’s home county has seen over three times more deaths from opioid abuse during quarantine than from COVID-19. Most tragically, Wolf refuses to come clean about Pennsylvania’s widely reported nursing home catastrophe. Nearly 70 percent of COVID-19’s death toll in Pennsylvania comes from these homes for the elderly. The Health Department, led by Secretary Rachel Levine, circulated a nursing home early response plan but never implemented it — then covered up its failure. The governor’s lack of transparency is compounded by his top coronavirus aide’s hypocrisy. Levine, having insider access to the rising death toll, quietly transferred her elderly mother from a nursing home to a hotel — even while the health department mandated those homes accept COVID-19 patients. Wolf campaigned promising “jobs that pay, schools that teach, and government that works.” His handling of this pandemic has produced the opposite: record unemployment, shuttered schools, and government failure. No wonder he is one of only five governors, all Democrats, to receive an “F” for his reopening strategy, according to an analysis from the Committee to Unleash Prosperity. The groundswell of opposition to Wolf’s repudiation of transparency is growing daily. In addition to demanding the resignation of Levine, state legislators have taken the governor to court to scrutinize the dubious waiver system he established to grant exemptions from his shutdown of so-called “non-life-sustaining” businesses. By keeping citizens in the dark, Gov. Wolf has forced Pennsylvanians to question the motives behind his every decision. From the beginning, his administration kept waiver records from the public, while granting them to the politically connected, like his former business, Wolf Home Products. The auditor general, a Democrat, is currently auditing the Wolf administration’s handling of the waiver process. Wolf has also earned resentment from the press corps after treating them like infants. The governor’s press conferences are a parody: Wolf stands before an empty press briefing room as his press secretary reads him pre-screened questions. Reporters have complained that their submitted questions were altered, calling the practice “unacceptable” and “disingenuous.” And follow-up questions are strictly forbidden. By keeping citizens in the dark, Wolf has forced Pennsylvanians to question the motives behind his every decision. The lesson is clear: Transparency is never optional — not even during a crisis. But instead of coming clean, Wolf has called those questioning his policies “cowards” and “deserters” and threatened to withhold federal stimulus money from counties that don’t comply with his shutdown order. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Fortunately, state lawmakers are showing no signs of caving. They immediately pushed back, sending the governor another sheaf of reopening bills. Perhaps they heard the cries of an onlooker from the barber shop rally who shouted, “We will not watch our freedoms wither and die.” Pennsylvania is showing precisely how citizens and their elected representatives can fill the leadership vacuum under a governor who has jettisoned any pretense of transparency and strayed far from his stated goals.

We take extremely seriously our duty of parens patriae – to protect, defend, and vindicate the legal rights of all of the citizens we represent. This duty rings true in times of crisis and uncertainty, especially during the unprecedented pandemic we face today. The coronavirus crisis has touched all of us. We have lost friends to COVID-19 and thousands of our constituents have been stricken with the illness. Countless businesses in our states have been shuttered and jobs there lost. Our brave doctors and nurses working front line shifts, treating their patients, have been put at great risk. And, increasingly now, we hear about culpability. We are learning more about who is responsible for this modern-day plague. All roads lead to a cover-up orchestrated by communist China. CHINESE STATE-RUN MEDIA CALL US THREATS OVER HONG KONG 'NOTHINGBURGER' Recently, we sent a letter to congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle. The letter has a very simple request that even in these hyper-partisan times we are hopeful that politicians of all stripes will get behind and support. An investigation would establish an official public record that would cut through the foreign propaganda and media spin. We asked Congress to investigate the Chinese government’s role in the coronavirus crisis and assess its culpability for this terrible pandemic. Press reports reveal that the Chinese government and Chinese Communist Party actively sought to suppress vital information about the coronavirus and its characteristics – particularly its ability to spread from human-to-human contact – for weeks or even months. They allegedly silenced whistleblowers and detained doctors who dared to speak out about what they were seeing in their hospitals and labs. They expelled western media who might have been able to see through their propaganda. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Other reports have even indicated that China compromised the World Health Organization, directing its response to this crisis by feeding it bad information and excluding contrary voices like those of its rival the Taiwanese government. In effect, they turned the world’s most important collaborative public health establishment into a megaphone for their own propagandistic proclamations. Furthermore, while all of this was going on, China appears to have taken steps to corner the world market in personal protective equipment (PPE) and life-saving medical supplies, ensuring shortages and dependence when the world was finally able to see through their lies and obfuscation. There have even been accusations that Chinese entities purposely shipped defective PPE and other equipment to foreign countries. These acts, if proven, are not only wrong, they are evil. And these allegations, if true, are not merely worrying, they are actionable. Some of us are considering legal action to hold China accountable for the profound damage done to our states and our citizens. The state of Missouri has already sued China, the Chinese Communist Party, and other related defendants in federal court. However, an all hands-on deck approach is needed when confronting an issue of this magnitude. Congressional hearings would help clarify truth from rumor, reality from hype, and fact from fiction. With their broad investigative powers, congressional committees could subpoena necessary witnesses, assemble relevant documents, and create a complete factual picture of how exactly the world was brought to its knees by this pandemic. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP An investigation would establish an official public record that would cut through the foreign propaganda and media spin. When, inevitably, the parties responsible for this crisis attempt to shift the blame, a free and open record — in addition to our legal actions— will help shine a light on the truth and facts. A century ago, Louis D. Brandeis wrote that “sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.” These words still ring true today. Eric Schmitt is Missouri Attorney General.

 We're going to state the obvious: Donald Trump tweets an awful lot. Many wish he didn't do it. He does it anyway. It's often his preferred mode of communication. Now, whether or not it's politically wise for him to do this, Donald Trump has an absolute right as an American to express what he actually thinks, even if every other person on Earth disagrees with him. When they used to tell you this was a free country -- and they often said that -- that's what they were talking about, the freedom of speech. TWITTER'S JACK DORSEY FIRES BACK AT ZUCKERBERG, DEFENDS FACT-CHECKING TRUMP TWEETS Well, sadly, it's become a much less free country recently. Power has become radically concentrated in far fewer hands than at any time in the past 100 years at least. And the people who wield that power have no interest whatsoever in your right to say something they disagree with. In fact, they're delighted to silence you if you try. They're not embarrassed to admit that they do this. They don't pretend anymore. Twitter, for example, now openly purges its users whose political views their executives don't like. It's bewildering, if you think about it, that they're allowed to do this because, like all the Big Tech companies, Twitter only exists -- its CEO is a billionaire -- only because Twitter enjoys key exemptions from federal law, exemptions that you don't enjoy, and we don't enjoy here at Fox News. It has those exemptions because Congress carved them out for the Big Tech companies, and that means Congress has the power to defend your free speech online. The White House does, too. And yet they've done absolutely nothing so far to help you. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Until Tuesday, Twitter returned the favor by leaving the commander-in- chief's Twitter feed alone. And then Trump criticized mail-in voting. The president tweeted that mail-in ballots could be "substantially fraudulent."As s a factual matter, that is true and we can prove it. As we told you Tuesday night, mail-in ballots have been linked to numerous cases of election fraud. People have been criminally convicted for it. So, it's really not up for debate. But this is an election year, and mail-in voting is now the central objective of the Democratic Party, and so you're not supposed to know any of that. On Tuesday Twitter placed a so-called "fact check" on the president's tweet. "Trump falsely claimed that mail in ballots would lead to a rigged election," Twitter announced. "Fact checkers say there is no evidence that mail-in ballots are linked to voter fraud." Now, again, as a factual matter, that is a lie. There's no other way to interpret it. But worse than a lie, it is a form of political censorship. The role of pushing back hard against censorship, was reserved for reporters. Their job was to safeguard the First Amendment, which is designed to protect the weak, not the strong. The weak are protected by the freedom of speech, and journalists are supposed to care about the weak, about the public -- their readers and viewers. So, who decided to do this, to censor it? Well, Yoel Roth has the Orwellian title "head of site integrity "at Twitter -- an irony-free zone where they don't understand that their titles alone are scary. That means he is one of the company's censors. And not surprisingly, Roth is a political activist and not an especially subtle one. In January 2017, Roth compared Kellyanne Conway to the Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels. That same day, he referred to the president's new staff just moving into the White House as actual Nazis and a lot more. You can look up his Twitter feed if you want, assuming he hasn't pulled it down by now. So, these are the people controlling what you're now allowed to think and say in America. They're authoritarians. If they're willing to censor the president, they will think of nothing at all of silencing you -- and they don't. They gladly do it, and no one pushes back. Traditionally, that role, the role of pushing back hard against censorship, was reserved for reporters. Their job was to safeguard the First Amendment, which is designed to protect the weak, not the strong. The weak are protected by the freedom of speech, and journalists are supposed to care about the weak, about the public -- their readers and viewers. They weren't supposed to be simply thugs hired to protect the powerful, but that's what they have become. Watch Don Lemon of CNN -- who, in his defense, often has no idea what he is saying -- try to bully Twitter into censoring ideas the authorities don't care for. Don Lemon, CNN anchor: Twitter wouldn't remove those tweets, and they wouldn't come on the show to talk about their decision to let this disgusting smear stand. People have been removed from Twitter for far less outrageous behavior. Come on, Jack Dorsey. Stop hiding behind the First Amendment for profit. Stop doing it. Do the right thing. "Stop hiding behind the First Amendment," says Don Lemon. In the annals of cable news that must be the most unintentionally hilarious line ever uttered by a script reader, as if exercising your God-given inborn right to speech and thought and conscience is somehow wrong. It's immoral. Don Lemon demands that you stop thinking for yourself. Fall in line, get on board, obey. Tow the party line, or we will hurt you. That's his message. And it's the mirror image of what journalists should be saying. There's only one reason we have a free press -- and that's to fight back against authoritarian power structures that demand we read from approved scripts. And now CNN is writing those scripts. It's terrifying. And all of a sudden, it's everywhere. Throughout April and May, YouTube, which is part of Google, took down any video that "explicitly disputes the efficacy of global or local health authority recommended guidance." If you dared to question the decrees of the politicians -- some of whom are impressive and wise, many of whom are dumb and making it up as they go along -- but if you criticize them, you are censored. And many were censored for doing that. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently explained why censorship isn't really bad. In fact, it saves lives. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook: If information, if someone is spreading something that puts people at imminent risk of physical harm, then we take that down. We don't allow that on Facebook. There are also other misinformation that may not lead to physical -- imminent risk of physical harm, but still isn't the type of stuff we want to be spreading through our system. So this month, Facebook announced that it is expanding this effort. It announced the first 20 members of its new oversight panel. That panel will help decide which ideas can be expressed in public and which ideas must be thrown into the fireplace and forgotten forever. And you can imagine who's on the panel. It's a list of political activists and aggressive opponents of free speech. Stanford Law professor Pamela Carlin headlines the group.

 ‘If you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black,” Joe Biden said Friday in an interview with Lenard Larry McKelvey, better known as “Charlamagne Tha God,” a co-host of the popular “Breakfast Club” radio show.

President of Freedomworks Adam Brandon joins Trace Gallagher to discuss the potentially negative impact of the stimulus bill on the U.S. deficit. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.  Sign up here.  The current U.S. budget deficit could soon exceed a record $4 trillion. The massive borrowing is being driven both by prior budget profligacy and a hurried effort by the Donald Trump administration to pump liquidity into a quarantined America. The shutdown has left the country on the cusp of a self-inflicted economic collapse not seen since the Great Depression. Americans may soon have to service a staggering national debt of about $30 trillion — nearly $100,000 of debt for every American. TUCKER CARLSON: CNN, MSNBC ARE PEDDLING PANIC, MORAL JUDGMENT, NOT SCIENCE AND DATA, IN CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE Democrats and Republicans can blame each other, either for spending too much or for too little taxation, or both. But both sides will agree that managing such an astronomical debt requires several frightening choices.   One, Americans would be forced to live with permanent near-zero interest rates, or perhaps even negative interest rates. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER We are already seeing how the current low interest rates punish those who were thrifty and put away money in savings accounts. Negligible interest rewards those who borrow but forces savers to look for returns in volatile real estate or the risky stock market. In other words, there would be little interest paid out on the federal debt. The selling point for investors would be that the U.S. at least honors it bonds and debts and is safer than alternative global investments. America would become a permanent debtor that avoids paying much interest to anyone who lends it ever more money — on the cynical rationale that investors have no other safe place to put their money. Two, Americans, who are already taxed heavily at the local, state and federal levels, would simply have to pay even more. Top earners might pay a real tax rate of 60 percent to 70 percent of their incomes to government, with deleterious effects on incentives to create or earn further wealth. Gasoline prices are at astonishing lows, so some have advocated yet another federal fuel tax increase, a national sales tax or a wealth tax on the rich. The problem with constant increases in taxation is the ensuing culture of even greater spending that inevitably follows and the destruction of individual incentive. Three, the government could make draconian cuts in spending, focusing mostly on entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare, along with defense, where the bulk of federal expenditures are found. Cutting Social Security and Medicare is usually political suicide. In times of growing tensions with China, Russia, Iran and North Korea, it would equally be foolish to slash defense spending. Instead, expect some sort of reductions in Social Security benefits for high-income Americans, along with higher Medicare deductibles for everyone. We are postponing another rendezvous with reality. But as we near $30 trillion in debt, what cannot go on much longer soon probably won’t.  Four, the government could fall into the bad habits of the 1970s and simply expand the money supply, fuel inflation and pay down the debt with funny money. We would then likely experience the baleful consequences that a prior generation faced with stagflation and curative but staggeringly high interest rates during the Nixon, Ford, Carter and early Reagan administrations. Rather than fooling with interest rates and the money supply, a mixture of increased revenue and spending cuts seems wiser. Yet both are far harder to enact politically than just letting the Federal Reserve Board adjust national liquidity and interest. Five, the government could hope that new deregulation and more tax incentives might spur GDP growth of 3 percent or more per annum and thus “grow” our way out of deficits by radically expanding the economy. Such optimism is frequently voiced but rarely has prevented large budget deficits. A decade ago, the bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, headed by former Republican Sen. Alan Simpson and former Democratic official Erskine Bowles, charted a pathway out of debt. The commission outlined a holistic plan of gradual cuts and revenue increases. Its wise recommendations found little to no political support. In the first two decades of the 21st century, the United States has faced three existential crises. The first was the 9/11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, which prompted a global effort to fight radical Islamic terrorism. The second occurred in 2008, when the U.S. financial system and stock market nearly collapsed. The third began earlier this year with the COVID-19 epidemic and a quarantine that reduced the economy to its most shaky state since the 1930s. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP During the first two crises, we snapped back the economy with low interest rates, increased government spending and larger annual deficits — and passed the greater long-term debt to another administration, another Congress and another generation of Americans. We are postponing another rendezvous with reality. But as we near $30 trillion in debt, what cannot go on much longer soon probably won’t. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY VICTOR DAVIS HANSON

President Trump prepares action against China over Hong Kong; reaction and analysis from Missouri Senator Josh Hawley. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. Remember the old public relations maxim: “There’s no such thing as bad publicity”? Try telling that to Beijing. Having loosed a pandemic, China finds itself (quite deservedly) deluged with bad publicity. Yet, oddly, the regime seems to think the best way out of their image nightmare is to make it worse. Well, alrighty then. If that’s their play, the U.S. ought to spend more time thinking about how we can help the Chinese Communist Party dig itself a deeper hole. DR. SYRA MADAD: CORONAVIRUS PROTECTION – AS COUNTRY REOPENS, THIS IS YOUR BEST DEFENSE The list of China’s self-inflicted wounds grows longer by the day. They failed to confine the epidemic in Wuhan. They allowed millions of travelers to carry the disease around the world. They failed to inform the world of the disease in timely fashion. They failed to cooperate with other nations seeking to understand the disease. They hoarded protective equipment. They spread lies (like blaming others for the outbreak) to deflect criticism. Then they started threatening some countries — like Australia — that announced plans to investigate Beijing’s handling of the outbreak. Global anger at China does not seem to be waning. Even countries that complain about the current U.S. administration will, in their next breath (or under their breath), complain even more about Beijing. Of course, China sees the U.S. as the big obstacle on its long march to become the world’s most dominant military and economic power. However, Beijing’s strategy has always been to “win without fighting.” Rather than directly bump heads with Washington, it seeks to find ways to undercut U.S. dominance, bend international organizations its way and draw off American friends and allies. The Trump administration has pushed back bluntly. It has slapped tariffs on Chinese goods and pressed for better trade deals. It has actively opposed China’s candidates for leadership positions in international organizations. And it has called out Chinese disinformation and lies disseminated during the pandemic response. The regime has demonstrated once again it cannot be trusted to uphold its commitments. And it has shown its willingness to bully and bluff to get its way. All of this creates a challenge for China, and a 16-page summary of the American strategy recently published by the White House shows the U.S. has no intention of backing down. The COVID crisis, in fact, seems to have steeled American resolve. To make matters worse for Beijing, that American resolve in spreading. Several countries have joined the U.S. in pressuring the World Health Organization (WHO) to readmit Taiwan as an observer. (Taiwan was kicked out of the organization in 2016 at Beijing’s insistence.) A number of countries have also demanded an independent investigation on both the WHO and Beijing’s influence on its leadership. The Chinese response to this has been to put on a brave face and act even more belligerently than usual. They have been more vociferous in their claims on the South China Seas and moved troops into contested regions of the border with India. Most troubling of all is the regime’s announcement that it will pass legislation that could significantly compromise the freedoms of the people of Hong Kong, gutting the commitments Beijing swore to uphold when it signed the “Basic Law,” marking the return of the island to China from Great Britain. If the law looks like what we expect, the deal of “one country, two systems,” will be effectively dead. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER China’s troubles with Hong Kong predated the COVID crisis. Demonstrations against Beijing’s interference in the governing of the island sparked massive demonstrations and even some violence. That news was overwhelmed by the pandemic. While it was always assumed the Chinese Communist Party would circle back and punish the people of Hong Kong for their upstart behavior, the fact that they’re doing it right now is interesting. It appears that Beijing wants to use Hong Kong as an example; by throwing its muscle around there, it hopes to remind the world not to mess with China and to demonstrate that those who dare to push back will pay a price. Yet, this round of aggression comes with a cost. The regime has demonstrated once again it cannot be trusted to uphold its commitments. And it has shown its willingness to bully and bluff to get its way. That will only make the world more wary of China. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The U.S. administration is absolutely right to take a strong stand and condemn the proposal for the new law. China will never stop its destabilizing actions unless the U.S. stands strong to defend its interests and work with friends and allies to mitigate the China challenge. In dealing with the Beijing bullies, the U.S. must stick to its strategy: when China does wrong, we need to call them on it and make them pay a price for their bad behavior.

Former Deputy National Security Adviser K.T. McFarland reacts to Gen. Flynn unmasking controversy. A picture is starting to emerge about the abuse of power against the incoming Trump administration orchestrated by a cabal of outgoing Obama administration officials, House Democrats, the intelligence community and their allies in the media. According to Attorney General William Barr, “What happened to the president in the 2016 election and throughout the first two years of his administration was abhorrent. It was a grave injustice and it was unprecedented in American history.” Turns out the entire Russian investigation was a sham, and Obama administration officials knew it from the get-go. Senior intelligence officials testified before closed-door congressional hearings that there was NO collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians. GREGG JARRETT: TRUMP ATTORNEY ACCUSES MUELLER OF 'MONSTROUS LIE AND SCHEME TO DEFRAUD' Yet Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan, FBI Director James Comey, FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff went on cable news shows day after day implying or saying outright to the American people that they had proof of collusion and that Donald Trump would never have been elected without Russian interference. Some even claimed Trump was a Russian asset and continued to do Russian President Vladimir Putin’s bidding from the Oval Office. As Barr concluded, “The law enforcement and intelligence apparatus of this country were involved in advancing a false and utterly baseless Russian-collusion narrative against the president.” The Trump-hating media gleefully repeated their claims. They quoted “anonymous sources” who told of treasonous wrongdoings by Trump and his associates. They served as the echo chamber for these baseless claims, ratcheting up their ratings and profits in the process. Even now, with the steady accumulation of evidence – and more to follow – don’t expect any of these people to come clean or admit their mistakes. Instead, they’re doubling down and coming up with new excuses to justify their actions. One you’re likely to hear more of in the days ahead comes from that fateful few days in late December 2016, when President Obama imposed sanctions on the Russians for election interference. The administration expected the Russians to retaliate on the eve of Trump’s inauguration, leaving the new president a U.S.-Russia crisis to greet his arrival at the White House. As I write in my book, “Revolution: Trump, Washington and ‘We the People,’” the Russian president’s response to Obama’s sanctions was classic Putin and most likely carefully choreographed from the beginning.   When the Russians didn’t retaliate, Obama directed the intelligence community to find out why, with the presumption that Trump must have cut a deal with Putin during the final days of the transition. At that time, the president-elect was in Mar-a-Lago. I was also there in my role as the senior national security adviser. My boss, National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, was vacationing in the Dominican Republic. This was what the FBI and Mueller prosecutors grilled me about over more than 30 hours and several interrogation sessions in the summer, fall and winter of 2017 and 2018. They were convinced there was a smoking gun somewhere, and that I was the middleman. They presumed that President-elect Trump directed me to tell Flynn to make promises to the Russians in exchange for not retaliating. They were hoping to seize on the Logan Act, an obscure, ancient and never enforced law dating back 200 years (a strategy that even the Justice Department admitted early on wouldn’t fly). I insisted over and over again that wasn’t the case, that Trump gave me no such order, yet they persisted. The Mueller prosecutors asked about a 60-minute period on Dec. 29 when I didn’t text, phone or email, suggesting that was when I must have met with the president-elect to receive my marching orders. I explained that the 60-minute gap was actually when I left my cell phone behind at my desk and took a walk with my husband along the beautiful Mar-a-Lago beach. What they never figured out, or never wanted to figure out, was that Putin probably played us all along. Putin didn’t retaliate against Obama’s sanctions because it wasn’t in his best interest to do so. He had far more to lose in perpetuating the bad relationship he had with the Obama administration into the new Trump administration. One of Trump’s campaign promises was to improve relations with Russia. Why would Putin jeopardize that by retaliating against a lame-duck president? CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER As I write in my book, “Revolution: Trump, Washington and ‘We the People,’” the Russian president’s response to Obama’s sanctions was classic Putin and most likely carefully choreographed from the beginning. Immediately after Obama imposed sanctions, the Russian foreign minister announced, as expected, that Russia would retaliate. Putin swooped in a day later to overrule his foreign minister. He announced he would rise above the “irresponsible ‘kitchen’ diplomacy” of Obama and wait for the new president before responding to the sanctions. Putin won three ways: He made himself look like a great statesman, he insulted Obama’s pettiness, and he could get brownie points from the new administration by avoiding an inauguration day crisis. Either the senior officials of the Obama administration, including Obama himself, were incompetent in analyzing Putin, or deliberately used it as their excuse for investigating and wiretapping Flynn and others. I will leave it for others to decide. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Russia hoax was all designed to prevent President Trump from doing what the American people elected him to do – drain the swamp. Why did the cabal want to stop Trump? Because they are the swamp. The American people have paid a very high price for the Russia hoax. Even if the investigation of the investigators uncovers the rot in the intelligence community, the ramifications of their actions will live on. By setting Americans at each other’s throats for three years, our adversaries, especially the Chinese, were able to exploit our divisions to their advantage. That is the real crime against the American people – the cabal distracted us from the growing strategic threat, so they could play nasty games against their political opponents.

President Trump attacks social media outlet over alleged bias; reaction and analysis from with FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr and John Yoo, former deputy assistant attorney general. After President Trump tweeted to raise concerns about states mailing all registered voters ballots, Twitter added a “fact check” label to those tweets Tuesday for the first time, stating that “there is no evidence that mail-in ballots are linked to voter fraud.” Besides setting a dangerous precedent that will no doubt infringe on free speech, Twitter isn’t the authority on elections – the Committee on House Administration is. Committee Republicans recently produced a report on the fraud that exists in certain instances of vote-by-mail. What most people don’t know about voting by mail is that there's a vast difference in states allowing voters to request an absentee ballot and what the Democrats in California are trying to do, which is the same thing that House Democrats tried to do with their political wish list disguised as coronavirus relief. ZUCKERBERG KNOCKS TWITTER FOR FACT-CHECKING TRUMP, SAYS PRIVATE COMPANIES SHOULDN'T BE 'THE ARBITER OF TRUTH' Democrats want to force states to mail all registered voters live ballots, whether or not voters request ballots. While this may seem like a good way to vote that allows everyone to stay home during the coronavirus pandemic, forcing states to use an entirely new vote-by-mail system comes with its own problems – especially less than six months before the presidential and congressional elections. How can you send every registered voter a live ballot in the mail when you don’t keep accurate voter registration lists? The National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) requires states to have a uniform, nondiscriminatory voter registration list maintenance program. This requirement was part of the NVRA because the drafters foresaw the way public confidence is undermined when these lists are not maintained properly. But many states have simply ignored or not had the resources to comply with this requirement, leaving states with inaccurate voter registration lists and certainly ill-prepared for voting by mail. Allowing states to send all of their recorded registered voters a ballot without making states update their lists of registered voters would unquestionably invite fraud into elections. Ballots would be mailed to addresses of individuals who have moved or passed away. The new residents may not be eligible to vote but could see the ballots in the mail and try to vote anyway.  At the beginning of May, California and Los Angeles County were required to remove 1.5 million inactive voters from their registration lists when a Judicial Watch lawsuit said Los Angeles County has more registered voters than citizens. You read that correctly – Los Angeles County has more registered voters than citizens. If Democrats can federally mandate a nationwide all-mail election in November, election officials will be sending out more live ballots than voters, which will lead to fraudulent ballots being returned. What Democrats are also not telling you is that California allows for ballot harvesting – meaning that any individual can pick up any number of ballots for any reason, completely unchecked. These harvesters picking up ballots don’t have to show an ID, they don’t have to be a citizen, and they don’t have to be eligible to vote. You expect Americans to believe that having someone who can’t vote picking up ballots won’t invite fraud in our elections? No one is keeping track of who is picking up thousands of ballots, so how do we know they’re being delivered? How do we know the harvesters aren’t altering votes or pressuring people on how to vote? Also, why are Democrats pushing to allow for ballot harvesting when all these mail ballots will supposedly have prepaid postage? If voters can mail ballots in for free, then they don’t need “ballot brokers” coming to collect their ballots, unchecked. This raises questions in my home state of Illinois, where the state Legislature just passed a bill to allow ballot drop boxes in Champaign County. These ballot boxes have no checks on who would be dropping off ballots or how many are turned in to these boxes, not to mention no supervision of the ballots once they’re dropped off. Practices like these raise many red flags and leave our election systems ripe for fraud. Democrats say vote-by-mail is our only option to make sure everyone can vote, but what about the Americans who are unable to easily vote from home? The Native American Rights Fund, an organization that provides legal assistance to tribes and individual Native Americans, outlined potential obstacles for Native Americans in an entirely vote-by-mail election, like issues with access to traditional mail services, a lack of broadband connectivity, and cultural communication barriers. Democrats, who blame everyone but themselves for suppressing voters, are now going to allow a practice that will discriminate against thousands? The fact of the matter is, transitioning to an all vote-by-mail election wouldn’t even be possible at this point. States without the vote-by-mail infrastructure are not equipped to transition to an all vote-by-mail election. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER A Bipartisan Policy Center review revealed that 34 states had fewer than 15 percent of their ballots cast by mail during the 2018 election, with many in the single digits. Washington Secretary of State Kim Wyman, whose state has been using vote-by-mail for many years, has said if states are not already at 60 percent of ballots or above being cast by mail they are unlikely to be prepared all-mail-in elections in November. States that have successfully implemented vote-by-mail did so over the span of several years with intense, focused statewide training for state and local officials who are actually conducting elections. A successful transition to an election by mail requires major technology and staff upgrades, managing resources between in-person and mail voting, adjusting ballot return deadlines, configuring prepaid postage, and setting realistic ballot processing expectations. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP If states try now to implement an entirely vote-by-mail system and mail every voter on their outdated registration lists a ballot, they are inviting fraud into our elections. My message to Twitter: Before you decide to censor speech by throwing a label on the president of the United States – or any American – make sure you know the facts yourself.

Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano weighs in on ‘The Daily Briefing.’ Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.  Sign up here.  The governors of all 50 states and the mayors of many large cities have assumed unto themselves the powers to restrict private personal choices and lawful public behavior in an effort to curb the spread of COVID-19. They have done so not by enforcing previously existing legislation but by crafting their own executive orders, styling those orders as if they were laws, using state and local police to enforce those so-called laws and – presumably when life returns to normal and the courts reopen – prosecuting the alleged offenders in court. It is hard to believe that any judge in America would permit a criminal trial of any person for violating a standard of behavior that has not been enacted into law by a legislature. SEN. JOHN BARRASSO: CORONAVIRUS COLLATERAL DAMAGE – HERE'S WHY WE MUST OPEN SMARTLY, SAFELY AND SOON We know this because under our system of representative government, separated powers and guaranteed liberties, only the legislative branch can craft laws and assign punishments for noncompliance. This is Constitutional Law 101. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch has written that the executive branch cannot enforce a law that it has written. If it does, we will have approached tyranny. Have we approached tyranny already? During the past eight weeks, governors and mayors have closed most businesses, public venues and houses of worship, prohibited public assembly and restricted travel – all of which they have unilaterally decreed to be nonessential.  In his terrifying novel “1984” – which posits a future of total control of all persons by the government and total control of the government by one political party – George Orwell argued that he who controls the meaning of words controls the laws as well. That Orwellian truism has been manifested like never before here in America, where executive branch officeholders have used state and local police to restrain people from engaging in private and public behavior that they concede was lawful two months ago because today it is not deemed “essential.” Frankly, I am surprised at the ferocity of police enforcement and the lameness of police compliance. The police have taken the same oaths to uphold the same Bill of Rights – it’s not the Bill of Safety; it’s the Bill of Rights – as have all other officeholders. The police also know that it is unlawful for them to obey an unlawful order, particularly when they use force. The lockdown orders are all unlawful because none of them – none – has been enacted by a legislature, and all of them – all – interfere with fundamental liberties, each of which is guaranteed – guaranteed – by the Constitution. The government in America – state or federal – has no power and no right to determine what goods, services and venues are essential. Please don’t misunderstand me. I recognize the scientific value of personal efforts to control contagion. But under the Constitution, these social-distancing, wear-your-mask, shut-your-business, stay-at-home edicts constitute mere recommendations that should induce rational voluntary compliance, because the government in America is without lawful power to compel compliance. The governors complain about resistance. They need to know that Americans will resist efforts to interfere in behavior that remains as moral, natural, lawful and constitutional as it was 60 days ago. Last week, President Trump, sounding fed up with gubernatorial lockdown orders, declared that religious worship is essential – meaning, in his opinion, all houses of worship should be opened – and he offered that he was prepared to “override” any governors who disagreed with him. When he realized that he lacked any authority to override even unlawful gubernatorial decrees, he dispatched the Department of Justice to begin filing challenges to governors in federal courts and to argue that constitutional freedoms are being impaired by the states. I applaud this, but it is too little, too late. Where was the Justice Department when Catholic priests were threatened with arrest for saying Mass or distributing palms, and when rabbis were put in COVID-19-infested jails for holding funerals? At all these religious events, folks freely chose to exercise their freedom to worship; and to take their chances. These Justice Department interventions provoked the question: Who should decide what goods, services or venues are essential – the states or the federal government? The question is Orwellian, as the answer is: neither of them. The government in America – state or federal – has no power and no right to determine what goods, services and venues are essential. Those determinations have been for individuals to make since 1776, and those individual choices have been constitutionally protected from the feds since the Bill of Rights was ratified in 1791 and from the states since the 14th Amendment was ratified in 1868. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER What is essential to the laborer or student or housewife may not be essential to the former Goldman Sachs partner who was elected governor of New Jersey, and who decreed last week, “It shall be the duty of every person or entity in this State ... to cooperate fully” with his orders; or essential to the ideologue who is mayor of the Big Apple and who, for all his professed liberality, threatened to close permanently – permanently – businesses and houses of worship that flaunt his guidelines. A duty is undertaken voluntarily or by nature, not by executive command, Gov. Murphy. And the government cannot take property away from its owners except for a legitimate public use and only for just compensation, Mayor de Blasio. Governors and mayors can make all the dictatorial pronouncements and threats that they wish. But they cannot use public assets to enforce them. And when they seek to use force, those from whom they seek it should decline the offer.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In America, we decide for ourselves what produces happiness.

Twitter hasn't wanted to spend money on fact-checking efforts and now is paying the price; Fox News media analyst Howard Kurtz reports. Twitter purported Tuesday to “fact check” two tweets by President Trump in which the president pointed out – accurately – that mail-in ballots present substantial risks of election fraud. Below the president’s tweets, Twitter added a disclaimer: “Get the facts about mail-in ballots.”  The disclaimer states that “there is no evidence that mail-in ballots are linked to voter fraud,” and links to articles – including pieces published by The Washington Post, CNN and NBC – calling Trump’s claim “unsubstantiated.” I strongly disagree with Twitter. ZUCKERBERG KNOCKS TWITTER FOR FACT-CHECKING TRUMP, SAYS PRIVATE COMPANIES SHOULDN'T BE 'THE ARBITER OF TRUTH' ​In 2007, during a spirited debate over photo ID legislation while I was in the Texas Legislature, a Democratic lawmaker from Dallas objected to the bill on the grounds that it allowed voting by mail to proceed without photo identification. The legislator said: “Vote by mail, that we know, is the greatest source of voter fraud in this state. In fact, all of the prosecutions by the attorney general – I shouldn’t say all, but a great majority of the prosecutions by the attorney general occur with respect to vote by mail.” As the official now charged with prosecuting election fraud in Texas, I can say unequivocally that the legislator was right: going back more than a decade and continuing through the present day, around two-thirds of election fraud offenses prosecuted by my office have involved some form of mail-ballot fraud. These prosecutions include instances of forgery and falsification of ballots. One man pleaded guilty after forging 1,200 mail-in ballot applications, resulting in 700 suspected fraudulent votes in a 2017 Dallas election. He was identified after a voter, whose ballot he harvested, snapped a photo of him on her cellphone. “Authentic” signatures are also collected from voters, either under false pretenses or by experienced harvesters who confidently gain compliance from voters, as illustrated in a video that surfaced during the 2018 primary in the Houston area. The anonymous video appears to show how easily a ballot application and signature were collected from a voter by a campaign worker in less than 20 seconds. After providing her signature, the voter asked the worker: “Is this legal, what you’re doing?” The worker replied: “Yes, ma’am, we’ve done 400 already.” In South Texas, a former U.S. Postal Service employee was convicted of bribery in a federal prosecution in 2017 for selling a list of absentee voters to vote harvesters for $1,200. Once mail ballots go out, harvesters show up at a voter’s door and engage the voter to provide “voting assistance.” The variations are endless, but a common practice involves giving the voter the impression that the harvester is an election official. Whatever the case, successful vote harvesters leave with a voter’s signature and a ballot that is either blank, voted in the way the harvester wants, or that can be modified (or disposed of) later. TWITTER EXEC IN CHARGE OF EFFORT TO FACT-CHECK TRUMP HAS HISTORY OF ANTI-TRUMP POSTS, CALLED MCCONNELL A 'BAG OF FARTS' Skilled vote harvesters appear friendly and helpful. They may engage the voter in reassuring political discourse while assisting the voter in filling out the ballot. One fraudster was convicted of unlawfully “assisting” elderly nursing home residents – including an Alzheimer’s patient –complete mail ballots. Twitter’s head of site integrity, Yoel Roth, has attacked President Trump and his team as ‘ACTUAL NAZIS” and smeared Trump voters as supporting a “racist tangerine.” These instances are just the tip of the iceberg. Mail ballot fraud has been documented across the country. In fact, the Heritage Foundation has helpfully assembled a searchable database of over 1,000 instances of election fraud resulting in some form of plea, penalty or judicial finding. Many of those cases involving abuse of absentee ballots. Indeed, one of the most infamous instances of election fraud in recent memory – the 2018 contest for the 9th Congressional District in North Carolina – involved large-scale fraud conducted by ballot harvesters. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER President Trump is right to decry California’s or any other state’s plan to send every registered voter in the state a mail ballot ahead of November’s election. The potential for abuse by professional ballot harvesters – much like what happened in North Carolina – is high. The risk of abuse, which has been documented and explained numerous times, somehow escaped mention in Twitter’s “fact check” of President Trump’s tweets. Perhaps that omission owes less to a lack of “facts” and more to the biases of Twitter’s own fact-checkers. For example, Twitter’s head of site integrity, Yoel Roth, has attacked President Trump and his team as ‘ACTUAL NAZIS” and smeared Trump voters as supporting a “racist tangerine.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Whether or not Twitter ultimately decides to acknowledge the real facts about mail-in voting, I will continue investigating and prosecuting all forms of election fraud, including fraud by mail-in ballot. Moreover, I strongly urge that Twitter reconsider its selective – and apparently ideologically driven – “fact check” of President Trump’s statements about mail balloting in favor of a more objective, fair, accurate and evidence-based approach.

Woman calls cops on black birdwatcher after dog dispute. By now you've seen the video of that white Central Park lady in New York City who, when asked by a black birdwatcher to leash her dog, called the cops on him. That was ugly. She seemed fixated by race. You could say that's part of identifying someone to police. But it sounded more like using race to gin up a false allegation. Along with horribly manhandling her poor dog, the woman became the prime example of a person quick to complain to the manager – the dope who makes a scene about nothing. And not much of a dog owner. NYC WOMAN IN VIRAL CENTRAL PARK VIDEO IS FIRED: 'WE DO NOT TOLERATE RACISM' It backfired. She lost her job. And her dog. Is there satisfaction to be found in this? Maybe. She seems the type who no doubt has dished out the grief she's getting now. And her mistake isn't small. If this hadn't been captured on video, the black man could’ve been arrested and she could've lied some more. Shots could have been fired. Instead, the phone video saved the man and ruined the woman. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER So, is this proportional? She's a jerk. An oddball. Maybe a bigot. She apologized profusely. So why not forgive her? Because that’s what the birdwatcher did. Of her apology, he said: “If it's genuine and if she plans on keeping her dog on a leash in the ramble going forward, then we have no issues with each other." CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Not bad. If he can do it, so can you. And if you don't, then you're kind of being a judgmental person embracing outrage because it feels good. So don’t be the bully, be the birdwatcher. And remember, we all have bad days. Lucky for us, those days never get filmed. Adapted from Greg Gutfeld’s monologue on “The Five” on May 27, 2020.

 Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden told an African-American talk show host last week: “If you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black.” It was not a one-off remark. After strong condemnation, including from some fellow Democrats, Biden attempted to walk back his statement, suggesting he was trying to be funny. Biden has made other demeaning comments about minorities for many years. They are part of a pattern. HARLEMITES SOUND OFF TO LAWRENCE JONES ON BIDEN 'YOU AIN'T BLACK' COMMENTS: 'TRYING TO MARGINALIZE US' One of the definitions of “pattern” is: “a combination of qualities, acts, tendencies ... forming a consistent or characteristic arrangement.” In his self-defense, Biden frequently says, “Look at my record.” OK, let’s look. Biden claims the NAACP has supported him every time he has run for office. Not so, says current NAACP president, Derrick Johnson: “We want to clarify that the NAACP is a nonpartisan organization and does not endorse candidates for political office at any level.” Biden’s “record” of putting down minorities is also part of his pattern. In 2007, speaking of Barack Obama, Biden told Jason Horowitz of The New York Observer: “I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy,” he said. “I mean, that’s a storybook, man.” THE LATEST FROM FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN Last August, while speaking to the Asian and Latino Coalition in Des Moines, Iowa, Biden associated black people with poverty: “Poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids.” In 2006 while contemplating a run for president, Biden said, “You cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin’ Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent.” There’s more in Biden’s record. The Trump-Pence campaign has compiled a list of similar statements. In 1977, Biden worried about the results of certain desegregation policies: “Unless we do something about this, my children are going to grow up in a jungle, the jungle being a racial jungle with tensions having built so high that it is going to explode at some point.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER 1993, Biden described “predators” unworthy of forgiveness who must be locked away from society: “[U]nless we do something about that cadre of young people — tens of thousands of them, born out of wedlock, without parents, without supervision, without any structure, without any conscience developing ... because they literally have not been socialized ... [A] portion of them will become the predators 15 years from now, and ... we have predators on our streets that society has in fact, in part because of its neglect, created…  [W]e don’t very well know how to rehabilitate them at that point. That’s the sad truth. You’re looking at the fella who is one of the primary architects of the sentencing commission.” It was President Donald Trump who pushed sentencing revisions through Congress and won praise from African-American leaders. Biden has repeatedly praised racist Alabama Gov. George Wallace and bragged about receiving an award from him: “I think the Democratic Party could stand a liberal George Wallace — someone who’s not afraid to stand up and offend people, someone who wouldn’t pander but would say what the American people know in their gut is right,” Biden said in 1975. “[S]ometimes even George Wallace is right about some things,” Biden said in 1981. In 2003, Biden delivered a eulogy for one-time segregationist Sen. Strom Thurmond: “I was honored to work with him, privileged to serve with him, proud to call him my friend.” In 2010, Biden delivered a eulogy for a former KKK Exalted Cyclops, the late Sen. Robert Byrd: “He was a friend, he was a mentor and he was a guide.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In 2019, Biden bragged about working with Sen. James Eastland: “Even in the days when I got there, the Democratic Party still had seven or eight old-fashioned Democratic segregationists. You’d get up and you’d argue like the devil with them. Then you’d go down and have lunch or dinner together.” That’s the Biden record. Now let’s see him defend it. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM CAL THOMAS

 The United States is calmer, though still threatening, following days of rioting that spread with lightning speed across the nation, with murderous assaults on police officers and civilians and the ecstatic annihilation of businesses and symbols of the state. Welcome to a real civilization-destroying pandemic, one that makes the recent saccharine exhortations to “stay safe” and the deployment of police officers to enforce outdoor mask-wearing seem like decadent bagatelles. This particular form of viral chaos was inevitable, given the failure of Minneapolis’s leaders to quell the city’s growing mayhem. The violence began on May 26, the day after the horrifying arrest and subsequent death of a black man named George Floyd as he lay handcuffed on the ground. EX-NYPD COMMISSIONER KELLY ADMITS NYC MAY NEED NATIONAL GUARD 'IF THIS CONTINUES FOR A COUPLE MORE NIGHTS' On the night of May 28, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey ordered the city’s Third Police Precinct evacuated as the forces of hatred, distinct from legitimate forms of protest, descended upon it for a third day in a row. The building was promptly torched, sending a powerful sign that society would not defend its most fundamental institutions of law and order. On May 29, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz explained his reluctance to mobilize the National Guard as an unwillingness to seem “oppressive.” Naturally, he apologized for his white privilege – “I will not patronize you as a white man without living [your] lived experiences” – and explained the feral violence as an understandable response to racial injustice. “The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish, unheard,” Walz said. Few arrests were made after five days of rampant crime. The media, visibly exhilarated by this latest explosion of black rage, had its own explanation for the chaos: people were upset that the white officer who had kept his knee on Floyd’s neck for a sickening eight-plus minutes had not yet been arrested and charged. But when that arrest came, along with murder and manslaughter charges after a lightning-fast investigation by the district attorney, the anarchy continued – not just in Minneapolis but across the country. The charge against the fired officer was later upgraded to second-degree murder and three officers on the scene who failed to help Floyd were also fired and later charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder. Political leaders elsewhere were just as reluctant to use the necessary force to quell the violence. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called on police to use a “light touch” in response. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo coolly predicted on Sunday, during his now absurdly irrelevant daily coronavirus press conference, that the violence would continue. “The explosion we saw last night we’ll probably see again tonight,” Cuomo said –obviously confident in his own physical safety, if not the safety of the rest of the state’s residents. The attacks on local law enforcement were already happening out of sight of TV cameras before the most photogenic scenes of arson and the stomping of squad cars started showing up on network and cable news. On May 26, and May 27, Chicago residents surrounded and threw bottles at Chicago police trying to arrest gun suspects. One suspect was the likely perpetrator of a shooting that had just hit a five-year-old girl and two teenage boys. The other had just thrown his gun under a car; the cop-haters tried to free him from the squad car. No surprise that Saturday night, downtown Chicago was plundered. This pandemic of civil violence is more widespread than anything seen during the Black Lives Matter movement of the Obama years, and it will likely have an even deadlier toll on law enforcement officers than the targeted assassinations we saw from 2014 onward. On Tuesday, for example, four St. Louis officers were shot, and a police captain was killed, amid looting in the city. The next night, in Brooklyn, an officer was stabbed in the neck and two others were shot.  Even worse is to come, because since 2015, the country has absorbed another five years of academically inspired racial victimology. From Ta-Nehisi Coates to the New York Times’s 1619 project, the constant narrative about America’s endemic white supremacy and its deliberate destruction of the “black body” has been thoroughly injected into the political bloodstream. Facts don’t matter to the academic victimology narrative. One facts is that whites are the overwhelming target of interracial violence. Between 2012 and 2015, blacks committed 85.5 percent of all black-white interracial violent victimizations (excluding interracial homicide, which is also disproportionately black-on-white), according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. That works out to 540,360 felonious assaults on whites. Whites committed 14.4 percent of all interracial violent victimization, or 91,470 felonious assaults on blacks. Blacks are less than 13 percent of the national population. If white mobs were rampaging through black business districts, assaulting passersby and looting stores, we would have heard about it on the national news every night. But it is not happening. The national media have been insisting on the theme of the allegedly brutal Minneapolis Police Department. They said nothing as black-on-white robberies rose in downtown Minneapolis late last year, along with savage assaults on passersby. Why are the Minneapolis police in black neighborhoods? Because that’s where violent crime is happening, including shootings of two-year-olds and lethal beatings of 75-year-olds. Just as during the Obama years, the discussion of the allegedly oppressive police is being conducted in the complete absence of any recognition of street crime and the breakdown of the black family that drives it. Once the violence began, any effort to “understand” it should have stopped, since that understanding is inevitably exculpatory. The looters are not grieving over the stomach-churning arrest and death of George Floyd; they are having the time of their lives. You don’t protest or mourn a victim by stealing Oxycontin, electronics, jewelry and sneakers. Fittingly, the ideological handmaiden of this violence – academia – has already sprung into action. The chancellors and presidents of Harvard, the University of Arizona, the University of Pennsylvania and Yale – among others – released statements last weekend assuring their black students of their schools’ commitment to racial equity, in light of the George Floyd death – an event wholly unrelated to academic institutions. No college leader denounced the violence. UCLA Chancellor Gene Block – as well as the school’s $400,000 a year vice chancellor for equity, diversity and inclusion and a parade of deans – announced that the Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion and the school’s legions of equity advisers would be coming up with new programs for “virtual reflection spaces” in which to “humbly acknowledge the pain.” The school’s resources for racial trauma would be beefed up. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER The academic diversity bureaucracy has now been given a whole new excuse for existence and can be assured that it will escape the cost-cutting chopping block, even as universities beg the federal government for more coronavirus bailout money. The great philosophers and poets of the West – from Aeschylus and Euripides, to Shakespeare, Hobbes and the American founders – understood the chaos and lust for power that lurk beneath civilization. Thanks to the magnificent infrastructure of the rule of law, we now take stability and social trust for granted. We assume that violence, once unleashed in the name of justice, can easily be put back in the bottle. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It cannot. It was a signal accomplishment of both politics and science to banish humanity’s millennia-long fear of darkness. That city dwellers are now re-experiencing that fear with each fall of night is a measure of how rapidly we are losing our hard-won progress.

 All Americans have been shocked by the death of George Floyd while in police custody. This sickening act has set off more than a week of unrest. But was it the sole cause? Or was it the match that ignited dry timber? More likely the latter. History has yet to be written. But discussions over the coming weeks are sure to look increasingly at the role of the COVID-19 lockdown in putting the nation’s nerves on edge and inflaming these days of rage. We should ask the politicians – especially the governors, mayors and others seeking to place blame for the violence – what did you expect? You created a historic economic crisis throwing 40 million people out of work. GOV. KRISTI NOEM: GEORGE FLOYD PROTESTS – THEY SERVED THEIR PURPOSE. NOW LET'S DO THIS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM Forty million people. Did any of you who enjoyed appearing on TV every day telling Americans what they could and could not do — did you fully comprehend the full implications of pushing 40 million Americans into joblessness? You meant to save lives with your response to the pandemic. We get that. But then you went way, way too far, creating mass unemployment at levels approaching the equivalent of the Great Depression. Did you ever stop to consider that a job is not only a paycheck, but also a provider of dignity and purpose? Author and commentator Arthur Brooks has written eloquently about how work satisfies a primary human need to be needed. Politicians who see employers as greedy overlords and businesses as soulless generators of profit can’t or won’t understand this. For many people, a job is not just about money. It provides a connection to the community, sometimes even a substitute for family. Have you ever considered what happens to people when this vital connection is severed?  We’ve been seeing it this past week.  It’s no surprise that the Molotov cocktail-throwing Princeton educated-lawyer whose arrest made headlines in New York City had been “furloughed” from his firm. One wonders if he would have been driving his van around distributing homemade incendiaries if he had to be in the office the next day. Yet, from the very beginning, the “woke” mainstream media have been largely asleep to the pandemic’s potential to foment widespread unrest. And what of the millions of teenagers — many from single-parent families — who suddenly found themselves grounded at home after COVID school closings, often with little structure and purpose? Is it any surprise that some would take to the streets, perhaps with criminals released from prisons during the crisis by pandering, fear-mongering politicians? Yet, from the very beginning, the “woke” mainstream media have been largely asleep to the pandemic’s potential to foment widespread unrest. Few considered how month after month of “social distancing” could ultimately undermine social cohesion. Did any of those reporters, writing ad nauseum about Donald Trump’s fondness for hydroxychloroquine, ever consider probing the pressures building in low-income neighborhoods hit by lockdown-caused unemployment — where much of the rioting is currently taking place? CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Did they ever consider asking residents of these communities how they felt being thrown out of jobs and confined at home, unable to pay bills, subjected to the seemingly unending uncertainty of ever-extended lockdowns — while enduring an incessant drumbeat of bad news? The lockdowns no doubt also helped stoke rage among middle-class members of Antifa,  providing them with more time on their hands to organize their unprecedented national assault. Yet so far the relation of the present unrest to government-imposed COVID confinement has been largely ignored. The media have covered the pandemic’s impact on low-income unemployment mainly as a statistic. COVID stories have focused on data-driven reports of job losses, virus cases and death rates, the latest Donald Trump outrage, and pieces aimed at anxious elites. Two recent NY Times Editors’ picks: “Do Runners Need to Wear Masks?” and “Is it Safe to Keep Employing a Cleaner?” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP No question George Floyd’s death drove people into the streets.  And there needs to be an honest discussion of the lessons learned from this terrible tragedy. Already there is the predictable chest-beating as the political class seeks to explain the violent response as justifiable frustration over “white privilege.” However, if there is any “privilege” to be blamed, it is that of overreaching politicians who used the power of their offices to deprive 40 million people of their dignity as working Americans.

 The police officers responsible for the senseless and heartbreaking death of George Floyd must be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law. Like an overwhelming majority of Americans, I want to see justice served. It must be served. Unfortunately, outside agitators and professional anarchists have hijacked the protests to honor Floyd in order to push their radical goal of toppling the American way of life in favor of complete chaos. To make matters worse, Democrat politicians at the local and state level refuse to do their job and come down hard on looters, rioters and thieves. Whether it’s because they simply can’t handle the pressure or don’t want to, the inaction of Democrat leaders diminishes the message of the peaceful protesters, costing lives, millions of dollars in property damage and the dreams of hardworking American entrepreneurs. GOV. KRISTI NOEM: GEORGE FLOYD PROTESTS – THEY SERVED THEIR PURPOSE. NOW LET'S DO THIS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM Take the local firefighter and [now former — hopefully temporarily] owner of a sports bar in Minnesota. Korboi Balla, who is black, poured his entire life savings into his dream of opening a sports bar in Minneapolis that was set to open Monday. Instead, violent criminals ransacked his business, completely demolishing it. There are now countless stories of human suffering and property damage. Meanwhile, many in the mainstream media are ignoring, even condoning, the vicious behavior and destruction of minority-owned small businesses. Some in the mainstream media, particularly liberal-activists disguised as cable news hosts on CNN and MSNBC, have refused to cover the violent unrest in an intellectually honest manner. While an overwhelming majority of Americans demand justice for George Floyd, they pretend we can’t respect the rule of law AND stand with the black community. Unfortunately, likely Democrat party nominee for president Joe Biden, and today’s Democrat Party, are choosing to crank up the tension by using inflammatory rhetoric and pandering to the radical left. “Americans must be more than bystanders as the country struggles to address centuries of systemic racism,” Biden said Friday in a stunning display of a lack of self-awareness. Rank-and-file Democrat Party leaders have been slow to react, choosing instead to use the unrest as another opportunity to “get Trump.” The fact is Biden has been one of the most influential politicians in America for the past 50 years. In fact, he was the driving force behind mass incarceration policies in America. In the age of social media, where one of the nation’s two major political parties is refusing to even acknowledge the threat, it is as imperative as ever to come down fast and hard on the Antifa instigators and outside agitators. In fact, rank-and-file Democrat Party leaders have been slow to react, choosing instead to use the unrest as another opportunity to “get Trump.” Their failure to act with early, decisive action led to mass looting and assaults against businesses, large and small. Biden, as he has done consistently throughout his career, is attempting to play identity politics by blaming Trump despite the fact Biden has been a part of the permanent Washington political class for 50 years. President Trump has said, “We will stand with the family of George Floyd, with the peaceful protesters, and with every law-abiding citizen who wants decency, civility, safety and security." On Monday, he reminded the nation that his first and highest duty is to defend the country and the American people. He swore an oath to uphold the laws of the nation, an absolute necessity if we are to continue the great American experiment called Democracy. We can believe in America and what it stands for — as most Americans do — while also acknowledging and working to fix systemic injustices faced by the black community and other groups of Americans who feel the system doesn’t represent their interests. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER America is the greatest experiment ever conceived because our Constitution secures our God-given rights regardless of race. It’s America’s constant striving to do better, and be better, that makes the American experiment unique. The professional anarchists and Antifa want to decimate this great experiment in favor of mob rule. We must quash it now, and that’s exactly what President Trump is doing.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP After almost a week of inaction by Democrat leaders across America, President Trump made it unequivocally clear Monday — he will not allow professional provocateurs and violent mobs to drown out peaceful protesters and sully the legacy of George Floyd, his family and millions of Americans who stand with them.

Philanthropist and New York Mission Society Board Member Jean Shafiroff joins Fox News to discuss how she’s helping her community and raising awareness to help curb the growing numbers of food-insecure Americans Skyrocketing unemployment due to the coronavirus pandemic has been forcing a growing number of Americans to turn to charitable services for assistance as food insecurity among families with children grows. Philanthropist and New York Mission Society board member Jean Shafiroff joined Fox News to discuss how she’s helping her community and raising awareness to help curb the growing numbers of food-insecure Americans. New York City Mission Society has been serving the city’s most underserved children since 1812. Recently, it has been making food and utility baskets for the children it serves and delivering them during the pandemic. “I can't tell you how desperately these food baskets are needed...In the New York tri-state area, we have a very serious situation because so many residents live at or below the poverty level,” Shafiroff told Fox News. “The food pantries across the area are very helpful...but the supply and the demand are not working the way they should right now. There is massive demand all over the country --39 million Americans out of work, and this translates into no food on the table.” Shafiroff noted that a major issue during the pandemic has been getting food to the actual pantries, especially amid the shuttering of multiple meat processing plants across the country. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has even temporarily loosened its food labeling policies during the coronavirus pandemic to curtail supply chain disruptions and give producers more flexibility amid food shortages. According to a Brookings analysis, almost 35 percent of households with children said they did not have sufficient food, that's 14 percent higher than during the recession. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Shafiroff is encouraging those who can afford it to make donations to their local food pantry. “I know my husband and I recently donated 10,000 meals to Heart of the Hamptons, which is a food pantry in the Hamptons, because we feel so strongly about providing food and being part of the solution,” said Shafiroff, who is also the author of "Successful Philanthropy: How to Make a Life By What You Give," which explores the meaning of giving back in today’s era. "And of course, 10,000 meals really doesn't mean much when you look at a country with 39 million people out of work, but if we all work together, I believe we can solve this problem.” For more with Philanthropist and New York Mission Society Board Member Jean Shafiroff watch the full video above.

          This illustration by French artist Jean Jullien, released by Jullien to Fox News, was created to spotlight the work of iPads to Hospitals, a volunteer group that collects used tablets and donates them to hospitals and nursing homes in underserved communities. 
          (Jean Jullien) Hours after the 2015 terror attacks in Paris, French illustrator Jean Jullien spontaneously took to his sketchbook with simple brush strokes of ink to create a peace symbol with the Eiffel tower – known as “Peace for Paris” – which quickly became an iconic image of the world’s solidarity with France. His latest work is equally powerful. In a minimalist black-and-green illustration, the artist captures two people embracing through the frame of an iPad, a device that has become the new doorway to communication during the deadly COVID-19 pandemic. The 37-year-old Jullien created the image to spotlight the work of iPads to Hospitals, a New York-based volunteer group that is collecting used iPads and donating them to hospitals and nursing homes in underserved communities – allowing those in isolation to connect with loved ones. “My idea was to focus on the embrace, the warmth of bringing people closer,” Jullien said of his work, released exclusively to Fox News. “The tablet has become a digital gateway, a frame for this moment,” he said in an email. The effort by the group – founded by Amy Johnson and Jeff Arace, medical students at SUNY Downstate in Brooklyn – is making an impact. iPads to Hospitals has so far received 1,000 used tablets from 35 states and has nearly reached its $50,000 fundraising goal. The organization, which Fox News profiled last month, is now expanding its reach from hospitals to nursing homes, enabling the elderly to virtually connect with family members who are restricted from visiting due to the outbreak. “The elderly are a population susceptible to infection, so many homes have strict visitor restrictions, while individuals in hospice care and long-term rehabilitation hospitals have chronic or terminal illnesses that prevent them from being able to leave the medical care setting,” said Shenara Musthaq, a 26-year-old medical student at SUNY Downstate and one of the group’s volunteers. “Unfortunately, these are individuals that remain at a higher risk of infection than the general population so we hope to provide a stronger means of communication with loved ones until the safety measures are in place for in-person visits,” Musthaq said. “They stepped into a void that none of us knew even existed" As soon as used iPads are received by mail, volunteers, like 29-year-old Ian Kaplan, work to ensure the devices are properly reset and fit for donation. Sometimes the tablets arrive with handwritten notes, which exemplify the humanity of everyday Americans wanting to help from the confines of their homes. One woman from Los Angeles wrote about her father, who died from lung disease last July after falling ill in 2017 and spending months in a hospital – living longer than doctors expected. “This iPad was a hand-me-down given to me with love by my late father,” she wrote. “My family and I were very privileged to spend every day by his side. I believe that it made all the difference … My heart is breaking for patients and loved ones who cannot be together right now. My prayer is that even one more family might be able to beat the odds – and this will provide some comfort during dark times,” she said. “It’s not every day that someone receives a handwritten letter in the mail anymore,” Kaplan said of the notes he finds tucked away in boxes and wrapped around devices, some written by children. “The letters we received have just been incredibly powerful and touching. Some have brought me closer to the hearts of the donors writing them, as they share the deeply impactful stories behind their own personal motivation to get involved in our cause,” he said. 
      Medical staff at Bronx HealthCare System are seen holding iPads that were donated to the hospital by the volunteer group, iPads to Hospitals.
      (Bronx HealthCare System) Hospitals receiving the used iPads from across the five boroughs of New York include Jacobi Medical Center, New York-Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital, Calvary Hospital and Maimonides Medical Center. Dr. Douglas Reich, chairman of Family Medicine at Bronx HealthCare System, which received another batch of iPads from the group on Friday, described the impact of the donations as “event changing.” “They stepped into a void that none of us knew even existed,” Reich said of the group and its focus on the critical use of iPads during the pandemic. Reich said the hospital’s IT department worked from the beginning of the outbreak to use technology as a way to connect families with COVID-19 patients isolated in their rooms. “We had a limited numbers of iPads within our own institution. We’d have a patient’s family member arrive and we’d give them an iPad in the lobby and then run upstairs to give one to the patient. It was somewhat cumbersome,” he said. “The help from this group has now made it so much more efficient and has streamlined the process,” Reich said. “We’re now connecting 50 to 75 patients a day with iPads. So many more people are able to communicate with their family members.” Reich recounted one day in late afternoon when a COVID patient, speaking in Spanish, told him he had not seen or heard from anyone since doctors attended to him that morning. Reich promptly grabbed an iPad and dialed up the patient’s wife and three daughters, who were able to FaceTime with their father from his hospital bed. “It was a beautiful moment to witness,” he said. “At the end of it, one of my colleagues called back the family to ask if they had any questions or concerns and they were sobbing on the other end of the phone.” “They were so grateful for the experience to be able to see their dad,” he said.

Recovered COVID-19 patient Diana Berrent opened up to the "Fox News Rundown" podcast Wednesday about her experience as one of New York state's first confirmed coronavirus cases. "I was at a meeting on Monday, March 9, where ... I later found out, several of the people who were at that meeting had been at a conference in the previous days, in very early March in the city at the Sheraton Hotel, where there had been an outbreak," Long Island resident Berrent recalled. SUBSCRIBE AND DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS RUNDOWN "No one went into the meeting intentionally knowing at that point they weren't symptomatic. But everyone at the meeting did get infected," she continued. "There were only eight of us, which is under the 10 recommended [by the CDC], just important to keep in mind. And there were people who I had only met a couple of times before. So [it] wasn't social. There was no sharing of food or anything else.  "But everyone did contract it. And one person has since died a couple of weeks ago." Unaware that she had been infected, Berrent returned home to her family. Four days later, she began to feel symptomatic. "I woke up on the morning of Friday the 13th ... and there was nothing subtle about it. I had blisters in the back of my throat. I had at least 102[-degree] fever and I had a respiratory infection. I felt like I had an anvil on my chest," she said. "The first thing I did, and I thank goodness for this every day, is within 15 minutes of waking up with those symptoms, I grabbed my laptop and a couple of other things and I went into my bedroom and I stayed in self-isolation. NY MOTHER HOPES TO CONNECT FELLOW COROANVIRUS SURVIVORS WITH RESEARCHERS "Other than leaving to go get tested, I didn't leave the four corners of my bedroom for 18 days," said Berrent, who added to host Dave Anthony: "I think that there's an overriding civic duty to make sure that if you are infected, the infection stops at you so that you're not responsible for the continued spread." Berrent was initially unable to secure a coroanvirus test due to lack of availability, and required the help of Democratic Congressman Tom Suozzi. After testing positive, she saw a window of opportunity and spent her time in isolation launching an organization to help others affected by the virus. "They had this sort of 'Ah-ha!' moment realizing that... I'd be one of the first survivors. And with that came both the responsibility, but also an incredible opportunity." "They had this sort of 'Ah-ha!' moment realizing that ... if all went well, I'd be one of the first survivors," Berrent said. "And with that came both the responsibility, but also an incredible opportunity. "I have no science background, no public health background, but I remember just enough of my 10th-grade biology to realize that I would come out with antibodies and those antibodies could potentially provide immunity. And if we could gather together, you know, I might have an individual sort of superpower in my blood at the end of this virus. But there were going to be thousands to come after me. And if we could mobilize as a massive movement, that we could have incredible power," explained Berrent. Berrent launched Survivor Corps to rally recovered COVID-19 patients and those still fighting the illness to donate their blood plasma to academic and medical studies "What Survivor Corps really has done is we have issued a call to arms, literally arms, because inside the arm of every COVID-19 survivor is the antibody with plasma that will help lead us to a cure," she explained. "And so we are mobilizing an army of volunteers to go out, to donate their plasma, to donate their blood, to participate in every research trial program that is going on from the scientific, medical and academic community." CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE Berrent has already donated plasma four times since contracting the virus and now has "standing weekly appointments." "We're seeing [that] the more virus you are exposed to, it looks like the sicker you get," she explained. "So, if we can inoculate those individuals with a boost of antibodies, it could really protect them in the long run." "It really has the direct potential to save, they say, three to four lives per donation." To hear the full interview, subscribe and download The FOX News Rundown on your favorite podcast player.

 Foreign policy doesn’t stop for turmoil here at home. The U.S. can’t afford attention deficit disorder overseas. That is doubly true for meeting the challenge of China, the most consequential test this generation could see in its lifetime. Last Friday, President Trump rolled out a number of punitive measures designed to discourage the increasingly aggressive and threatening Chinese Communist regime. The action fully comports with the administration’s recently published China strategy, a document that explains the rationale for how the U.S. has dealt with Beijing over the last three years. Last week’s sanctions were just more of the same — and were absolutely the right move. ARTHUR HERMAN: US CORONAVIRUS LOCKDOWN — CHINA SEIZES CHANCE TO FULFILL THESE GLOBAL AMBITIONS Going forward, we need to stick with what we know works. No. 1: Don’t play games Diplomats often talk about “linkage,” where countries trade-off concessions on one issue to gain an advantage in another. That kind of barter won’t work in the complex relations between Washington and Beijing. The U.S., for example, was wise not to compromise with Beijing on trade in hopes the regime would help out with North Korea or the South China Seas.  It wouldn’t. Washington was right to handle each disagreement on its own merits. Last week, regardless of what else is going on between the two countries, even as we implement the trade deal, the president was right to threaten Chinese leaders with human rights sanctions. No. 2: Pursue the Harder Right   Predictably, last week the president was criticized for revoking the special trade privileges that Hong Kong had enjoyed with U.S. because of its status as an autonomous region of China. The administration, however, was just following U.S. law; it requires the administration to review Beijing’s breeches of its commitments to respect the political and economic freedom of the Hong Kong people. This action may lead Beijing to think twice about the scope of the new security law it is drafting to punish freedom-loving Hong Kongers. If the government insists on depriving them of their rights, the only party responsible for hurting Hong Kong is the Chinese Communist Party, which had committed to respect the guarantees made to the people of Hong Kong. The U.S. can’t ignore such tough choices. In the end, holding China accountable for its misdeeds is always the best policy. Otherwise, Beijing will regard Washington as nothing more than a speed bump to its global ambitions. To get — and keep — Beijing’s attention, Washington needs to target the regime with meaningful measures. That includes hitting them where it hurts the most: in the pocketbook … repeatedly.  No. 3: Keep Your Friends Close  There is a free world. If it doesn’t hang together to push back on Chinese malfeasance, the future of those freedoms will be in doubt. Critics may disagree on the president’s decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization (WHO), but there is no question that U.S. criticisms have galvanized the international community in demanding more transparency and accountability from the organization. We need now more of the same. The U.S. needs to lead the free world post-COVID economic recovery, regardless of Chinese meddling. A G-7 plus meeting is a good format to do that, although there should be no place there for Russia. Russia has nothing to offer on free-market economic recovery and will only obstruct an honest discussion among democracies on how to deal with China. No. 4: Stick with It for the Long Haul  To get — and keep — Beijing’s attention, Washington needs to target the regime with meaningful measures. That includes hitting them where it hurts the most: in the pocketbook … repeatedly. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER The administration is looking into whether Chinese firms are complying with requirements to list stocks on U.S. exchanges. This comes in the wake of reports that the Chinese company Luckin Coffee falsified reporting on business activities. China needs access to U.S. financial markets; a consistent campaign punishing them for abuses will definitely get their attention. No. 5: No Self-inflicted Wounds  Job one is to get America up and running again. Policies have to protect our freedom, prosperity and security as effectively as they deal with China. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The president’s announcement on restricting Chinese students at American universities and research institutes is a good example. Well over 300,000 Chinese students study in the U.S. each year. Many have engaged in spying, intellectual property theft and political activity on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party. The administration is right to start to crack down on this illicit activity. It sends a powerful warning to China that it could lose access to the American university system if the regime does not curb its worse abuses. This is the kind of prudent policy that strikes the right balance. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY JAMES CARAFANO

 Former Defense Secretary James Mattis boasts some 7,000 books in his library. This makes the unbearable lightness of his public attack on President Trump that much more mysterious. Had Mattis done some reading first, he might not have penned his vacuous anti-Trump broadside in The Atlantic. “I have watched this week’s unfolding events, angry and appalled,” Mattis wrote Wednesday. He aligned himself with the thousands of Americans protesting the atrocious killing of George Floyd at the knee of fired Minneapolis cop Derek Chauvin and three sacked colleagues May 25. All four have been arrested and charged for causing or allowing Floyd’s appalling death as Chauvin knelt on the neck of the handcuffed black man who was pinned and helpless on the ground, threating nobody. The other three officers did nothing to stop Chauvin from killing Floyd, as Floyd cried out desperately, "I can't breathe." TRUMP TOUTS LETTER FROM EX-ATTORNEY DOWD ATTACKING MATTIS: 'YOU NEED TO BONE UP ON YOUR HOMEWORK' According to Mattis, people demonstrating to protest the killing of Floyd share “a wholesome and unifying demand,” specifically, “Equal Justice Under Law.” These words, chiseled above the entrance to the United States Supreme Court, are central to the American creed. And then Mattis marched into a ditch. He wrote: “We must not be distracted by a small number of lawbreakers.” That’s just what I thought as riot-fueled smoke filled my Manhattan apartment last Saturday night. “Don’t cough too hard,” I told myself. “And don’t be distracted by a small number of lawbreakers.” Mattis’ words are almost touchingly naïve, as if the cause of justice for Floyd has been tarnished by a stolen police car hubcap here or a toppled trash can there. Mattis may be right. Let’s stay cool and not be distracted by such lawbreaking as: The defacement of the Lincoln Memorial (honoring the president who crushed slavery), the defilement of the anti-fascist World War II Memorial, and the desecration of New York City’s St. Patrick’s Cathedral, Los Angeles’ Congregation Beth Israel Synagogue, and other houses of worship. The bricks, stones, and other projectiles that rioters have hurled into storefront windows and the skulls and faces of police officers. Palettes of bricks and boxes of rocks mysteriously have materialized along protest march routes. They have taken flight and damaged objects and people. The widespread looting of retail establishments, from Target to Macy’s to Rolex. Some of these attacks are organized crimes, with choreographed mobs tearing down plywood, smashing the underlying windows, and then prying open metal security gates before slithering in to clean house. In Philadelphia, domestic terrorists have used dynamite to blast ATMs open and swipe the cash inside. The arson that has turned buildings into ashes and piles of rubble, including minority-owned businesses. Minneapolis rioters incinerated a 190-unit low-income-housing complex, under construction. Rioters in Washington, D.C., ignited St. John’s Episcopal Church, where every president since James Madison has worshipped. Luckily, it was damaged, but not torched. The plight of Minneapolis’ Third Precinct, which barbarians breached, occupied, and cremated, as police officers ran away. This signaled every criminal that civilization had surrendered, and it was open season on society. America still is paying the high price for this calamitous capitulation. The scores of police officers who have been targeted from coast to coast. Thursday morning, the Drug Enforcement Administration warned law enforcement officers to inspect their vehicles for sabotage after a Brooklyn cop found that the lug nuts on his personal car’s tires had been loosened. Hours earlier, two NYPD officers were shot, and a third was stabbed in the neck. They are among roughly 350 law enforcement personnel wounded in the disorder so far. And retired St. Louis Police Capt. David Dorn, 77 – whose black life mattered as much as George Floyd’s – was shot fatally in the head while shielding a friend’s pawn shop. This preying Matiss then tried to chew Trump’s head off via this unfiltered slander: “Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people – does not even pretend to try,” Mattis fumed. “Instead he tries to divide us. We are witnessing the consequences of three years of this deliberate effort.” This total lie ignores the president’s ongoing efforts at national unity, most overlooked by the Trump-hating media, so that they can claim he never tries to unite the country. But Mattis cannot blame media malpractice for his refusal to acknowledge Trump’s unifying remarks in his first State of the Union address in January 2018. Mattis was in the front row, with the rest of the Cabinet, when President Trump said: “Tonight, I want to talk about what kind of future we are going to have, and what kind of nation we are going to be. All of us, together, as one team, one people, and one American family.” Trump added: “Americans love their country. And they deserve a government that shows them the same love and loyalty in return.” In his first month in office, President Trump welcomed some three dozen presidents of Historically Black Colleges and Universities to the Oval Office. He energetically has championed these schools, provided them a steady stream of federal funds, and found them corporate partners for student apprenticeships. Trump signed and repeatedly promotes Opportunity Zones to bring economic vitality to low-income neighborhoods, many black and Hispanic. Trump signed the First Step Act, making criminal justice reform a reality and reducing mass incarceration of non-violent offenders, something for which Black Lives Matter militated, and which the eight-year Obama-Biden administration failed to deliver. The president has championed Israel, signed measures to fight anti-Semitism, and emceed two Hanukkah receptions at the White House last December. He also has hosted Iftar dinners with Muslim employees and diplomats to celebrate the end of Ramadan. Before COVID-19 torpedoed the economy, Trump trumpeted the record-high black and Hispanic employment that his pro-growth policies helped create. “The memory of George Floyd is being dishonored by rioters, looters and anarchists,” Trump said in Cape Canaveral, Fla., on Saturday, in a soothing, unifying speech. “Healing, not hatred; justice, not chaos are the mission at hand…. Right now, America needs creation, not destruction; cooperation, not contempt; security, not anarchy.” These comments also appear in a deeply moving Trump-Pence 2020 ad. This 3:45 video, produced the same day as Mattis' smearfest, disembowel's his "Trump-does-not-try-to-unite-America" disinformation. This beautiful spot is a must-see for every American. Even amid deadly turmoil, the Big Three networks’ newscasts that evening shortchanged Trump’s reassuring message. ABC broadcast 13 seconds of Trump’s remarks, the Media Research Center reports. Among his 830 relevant words, they aired 35 or 4.2 percent. CBS gave the president five seconds, 13 words, and 1.6 percent. NBC: 11 seconds, 24 words, and 2.9 percent CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Mattis then slammed President Trump’s statement that Trump might instruct the military to restore order in Washington after rioters set blazes near the White House, injured at least 60 Secret Service members, and reportedly forced the commander-in-chief into a secure bunker. “At home, we should use our military only when requested to do so, on very rare occasions, by state governors,” (versus federal governors?) Mattis scolded. Mattis should condemn the 12 previous presidents, from Thomas Jefferson to George H.W. Bush, who have invoked the Insurrection Act of 1807 on 19 separate occasions to quell unrest. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Without consulting governors, Republican Ulysses S. Grant used this law in 1872, to dispatch soldiers to South Carolina to stymie the Ku Klux Klan. Democratic deity John F. Kennedy cited this statute to stop instability in Mississippi in 1962. Democratic hero Lyndon Johnson mobilized troops under this authority in 1968. Why? To suppress riots in Washington, D.C.! For a reputedly well-read man, James Mattis has humiliated himself by not doing a few minutes of research before composing his flimsy, nasty screed against an embattled commander-in-chief who needs such petty sniping as much as another trip to the White House bunker.
