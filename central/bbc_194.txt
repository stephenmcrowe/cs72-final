In Buffalo, New York State, two officers were suspended after they were seen shoving an elderly white man to the ground. And in New York City, police were captured on video roughly handling demonstrators as they ran away. The reports come hours after a memorial for Floyd in Minneapolis, the city where he died at the hands of police. His killing, also captured on video, has caused outrage and sparked a wave of protests against racial discrimination and police treatment of African Americans in cities across the US and the world. The vast majority of demonstrations over the past eight days have been peaceful but some have descended into violence and rioting, with curfews imposed in a number of cities. At one protest, security forces in Washington DC fired pepper balls and smoke bombs to disperse demonstrators outside the White House, allowing President Donald Trump to walk to a nearby church for a photo opportunity. In response to this on Thursday, civil rights group the America Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit, accusing the president, the attorney general and others of violating the constitutional rights of protesters. "When the nation's top law enforcement officer becomes complicit in the tactics of an autocrat, it chills protected speech for all of us," said ACLU official Scott Michelman, quoted by Reuters. In a separate development, police in Arizona released details of the killing of another African American, Dion Johnson, in Phoenix on 25 May, the same day as Floyd. Johnson was shot dead by state troopers after being found "passed out in the driver's seat" of a car which was partially blocking traffic, a police statement said. "During the trooper's contact with the suspect, there was a struggle and the trooper fired his service weapon striking the suspect," police said. The statement was only released after Johnson's family was offered audio of the police dispatch and transportation department video of the incident. The Buffalo video shows a 75-year-old man approach police officers enforcing a curfew. They then move forward, pushing him back and causing him to fall over and hit his head. As he lies on the ground, blood is seen pouring from his ear. The man was taken away in an ambulance and was later found to have suffered a severe head injury. An initial statement from Buffalo Police Department said the man had "tripped" and fallen during a "skirmish involving protesters", compounding outrage at the incident on social media. Police spokesman Jeff Rinaldo later attributed the statement to officers not directly involved in the incident, adding that when the video had emerged the two policemen who pushed the demonstrator had been suspended without pay. On the same evening, a delivery driver in New York City was arrested 27 minutes after the city's curfew had started, despite being a key worker exempt from the curfew. And in the Williamsburg area of the city, police were filmed charging demonstrators, throwing at least one person to the ground. Other videos showed a man lying on the ground bleeding from the head, and being arrested.

City Mayor Bill de Blasio said the authorities were "doing everything from a perspective of restraint". But both men have since condemned the incidents which emerged overnight. In a tweet, Mr Cuomo described the Buffalo incident as "wholly unjustified and utterly disgraceful". "Police officers must enforce - NOT ABUSE - the law," he said. Meanwhile Mayor de Blasio said he had complained to the city police department after seeing the video of the arrest of the delivery worker. The incidents happened as police enforced curfews in dozens of cities across the US after a wave of protests sparked by George Floyd's death. Floyd, 46, was stopped by police investigating the purchase of cigarettes with counterfeit money on 25 May in Minneapolis. A video showed him being arrested and a white police officer continuing to kneel on his neck for several minutes even after he pleaded that he could not breathe. Protests erupted and have continued since, across many US cities and also internationally, with rallies on Wednesday in Australia, France, the Netherlands and in the UK, where thousands gathered in central London. A rally in the Australian city of Sydney has been refused permission by a court, amid fears of coronavirus health risks. Thousands had been expected to attend. Floyd's death follows the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri; Eric Garner in New York; and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement in recent years. For many, the outrage over Floyd's death also reflects years of frustration over socio-economic inequality and discrimination.  Protests over the death continued in dozens of cities on Thursday despite widespread curfews.  They followed a memorial service attended by hundreds, who stood in  silence for eight minutes and 46 seconds, the amount of time Floyd was alleged to have been on the ground under the control of police in Minneapolis. A lawyer for George Floyd told the service a "pandemic of racism" had led to his death. Giving the eulogy, civil rights activist the Reverend Al Sharpton said it was time to stand up and say "get your knee off our necks".

                                 A CNN reporter, Omar Jimenez, is arrested while covering the Minneapolis protest. Mr Jimenez was reporting live when police officers handcuffed him. A few minutes later several of his colleagues are also arrested. They are all later released once they are confirmed to be members of the media. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with murder and manslaughter. The charges carry a combined maximum 35-year sentence.

                                 President Trump threatens to send in the military to quell growing civil unrest. He says if cities and states fail to control the protests and "defend their residents" he will deploy the army and "quickly solve the problem for them". Mr Trump poses in front of a damaged church shortly after police used tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters nearby.

The ex-Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, Gen Martin Dempsey, told National Public Radio that Mr Trump's remarks were "very troubling" and "dangerous". Mr Trump's current and former defence secretaries have also spoken out. On Monday, the president threatened to deploy the military to "quickly solve" the unrest if states failed to act. Mainly peaceful protests have spread across the US since the death of African-American George Floyd in police custody last month. While demonstrations over Mr Floyd's death appear to be simmering down in the nation's capital, the White House's security perimeter has expanded in recent days. Police used batons and tear gas to clear protesters from nearby Lafayette Park on Monday, and have since erected high fences around the White House.  "The idea that the president would take charge of the situation using the military was troubling to me," Gen Dempsey said in rare public remarks on Thursday. "The idea that the military would be called in to dominate and to suppress what, for the most part, were peaceful protests - admittedly, where some had opportunistically turned them violent - and that the military would somehow come in and calm that situation was very dangerous to me," he added. Gen Dempsey served as America's most senior military officer under former US President Barack Obama from 2011-15. His criticism comes a day after former Marine Gen Jim Mattis, Mr Trump's former defence secretary, denounced the president, saying he deliberately stoked division.  "Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people - does not even pretend to try," Mr Mattis wrote in the Atlantic magazine. "Instead, he tries to divide us." Mr Trump hit back via Twitter at the "overrated general". Earlier that day, Mr Trump's current Defence Secretary Mark Esper had also spoken up. He said the use of active-duty forces to quash unrest across the nation would be unnecessary at this stage, in remarks that are known to have displeased the White House. Mr Trump said on Monday from the White House Rose Garden that he would act to disperse violent protesters. "If a city or a state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them," he said. While he spoke, authorities used force to disperse a mainly peaceful protest nearby so the president could walk to a historic church that was damaged by fire in the unrest and be photographed holding up a Bible. The justice department had ordered Lafayette Square, just outside the executive mansion, to be fenced off for Mr Trump's walkabout. By Thursday afternoon, that security zone was significantly expanded, with high fencing installed around the park area known as the Ellipse just south of the White House. Also on Thursday, a moderate Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski broke ranks to say she was unsure if she would support Mr Trump's bid for re-election. In what is being seen as the most outspoken criticism yet of the president from a senator in his own party, Ms Murkowski told the Washington Post: "I thought Gen Mattis's words were true and honest and necessary and overdue." Shortly afterwards Mr Trump tweeted that he would campaign to throw the Alaska senator out of office when she is up for re-election in 2022. He later tweeted a letter written by his former lawyer John Dowd, apparently addressed to Mr Mattis, that referred to peaceful protesters in Washington as "terrorists". He also denounced John Kelly, his former White House Chief of staff, after the retired general also backed Mr Mattis. Meanwhile, the New York Times has said it was wrong to publish an opinion column by Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton entitled, Send in the Troops.  It comes after dozens of journalists at the newspaper criticised the decision to run the piece, tweeting it put "Black @nytimes staffers in danger". The Times initially defended its publication of Sen Cotton's column, which called for the military to be deployed against protesters - saying that it wanted to provide readers with a range of opinions.  But the paper later issued a statement saying "a rushed editorial process led to the publication of an Op-Ed that did not meet our standards".

The unemployment rate fell to 13.3%, down from 14.7% in April, as businesses started hiring again. Firms in the hospitality, construction and health care sectors took on staff. In total, employers added 2.5 million jobs, with the education and retail sectors also recruiting. It came as US states started rolling back some of the tough measures put in place to control the spread of the coronavirus. As businesses start reopening, firms are beginning to rehire their employees. The job gains surprised economists, many of whom had warned the country could see the unemployment rate rise past 20% to a post-World War Two high. Economist Justin Wolfers, a professor at the University of Michigan, tweeted: "It's hard to escape the conclusion that the economy bottomed in early/mid May," he said. "We're in a massive and deep hole, and it'll take a while to climb out, but at least the hole isn't getting any deeper." President Donald Trump, who has maintained the economic rebound will be swift, immediately took to Twitter to celebrate the numbers and claim credit. "Really Big Jobs Report. Great going President Trump (kidding but true)!" he wrote. The gains go only a small way towards making up for the more than 21 million jobs US employers cut in March and April, as lockdowns forced many businesses to shut their doors. In April, the unemployment rate hit 14.7%. But Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia said the report showed that the economic re-opening has been more robust than thought. "It appears that the worst of the coronavirus's impact on the nation's job markets is behind us," he said. The news cheered investors, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 up more than 2%, continuing a recovery in share prices from their March lows. The job gains were not limited to the US.  In Canada, employers added 290,000 jobs - far more than expected. However, the unemployment rate shot to 13.7% - the highest level on record in data back to 1976. As recently as February, the jobless rate in the US was hovering at 50-year lows of 3.5%. On Friday, economists warned the path of the economic recovery still remained uncertain. They pointed out that the hiring in May came as the government released billions of dollars in emergency aid to businesses to cover wages for employees, encouraging recipients to recall staff. Hiring by restaurants and bars accounted for roughly half of the jobs created last month. Dentist offices accounted for another 10%. Many of the gains also came from individuals who had told surveyors that their layoffs were temporary. "This means this was all the easy part of the recovery," said economist Jason Furman, a top economic advisor to President Barack Obama. The losses have hit minority and low-wage workers hardest, a trend that continued in May. Among white workers, the unemployment rate fell to 12.4% from 13.8% in April. Unemployment also declined among Hispanic workers, from 18.5% to 17.2%. For black workers, however the unemployment rate ticked up from 16.4% to 16.8%. The US Labor Department has warned that the headline figures in recent months may underestimate the true jobless rate, due to discrepancies in how people describe their out-of-work status.  Economists say the unemployment rate is likely to still be about 10% at the end of the year - still quite high, and comparable to the peak following the financial crisis. "We still think it will be a long time before the labour market is anywhere near back to its pre-virus state," said Michael Pearce, senior US economist at Capital Economics. But at a press conference on Friday, Mr Trump rejected those forecasts. "We'll go back to having the greatest economy anywhere in the world," he said. "This is a rocket ship."The rest of the NBA season is set to be played at Florida's Disney World Resort from 31 July. The season was suspended on 11 March because of coronavirus measures. Thirteen Western Conference teams and nine Eastern Conference teams will contest eight games each to determine seedings for the play-offs. The ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in Orlando includes a 5,000-seat indoor basketball facility. Under the NBA's proposals, all 22 teams will be based at the resort and games will be played without spectators to minimise the threat of Covid-19. On Thursday the NBA board of governors approved the plan to resume the season. The National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) must agree to the plan before it is confirmed. It is expected to vote during a conference call on Friday. The Los Angeles Lakers, Los Angeles Clippers, Denver Nuggets, Utah Jazz, Oklahoma City Thunder, Houston Rockets, Dallas Mavericks and Memphis Grizzlies are in play-off positions in the Western Conference. The Milwaukee Bucks, Toronto Raptors, Boston Celtics, Miami Heat, Indiana Pacers, Philadelphia 76ers, Brooklyn Nets and Orlando Magic currently occupy play-off spots in the Eastern Conference. Those 16 teams will be joined by the New Orleans Pelicans, Portland Trail Blazers, Phoenix Suns, Sacramento Kings and San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference and the Washington Wizards in the Eastern Conference. The latest date possible for finishing the season - what would be game seven of the NBA finals - is 12 October.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window One of the men accused of murdering unarmed black man Ahmaud Arbery in the US state of Georgia used a racial slur after shooting him, a court has heard. An investigator said Travis McMichael used the epithet and an expletive as Mr Arbery lay on the ground. Mr Arbery was jogging when he was chased down by Mr McMichael and his father in Brunswick in February. A judge has ruled there is enough evidence to try the pair and another suspect on murder charges. The case caused widespread outrage after footage was leaked online. Travis and Gregory McMichael - a former police officer - are facing murder charges. Another man, William Bryan, faces charges of murder and criminal attempt to commit false imprisonment. They deny the charges. Magistrate Court Judge Wallace Harrell issued the decision at the end of Thursday's hearing, after prosecutors presented testimony and evidence, meaning the case will move forward. Protesters gathered outside the Glynn County court where the preliminary hearing was held.  Huge protests have been taking place across the US following the death of another unarmed black man, George Floyd, in police custody last month. Special Agent Richard Dial of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation told the court that co-defendant William Bryan heard Travis McMichael use the slur after shooting Mr Arbery. "Mr Bryan said that after the shooting took place before police arrival, while Mr Arbery was on the ground, that he heard Travis McMichael make the statement," Agent Dial said. Agent Dial said Mr McMichael had used the same slur many times on social media. Investigators had also found racially derogatory texts on Mr Bryan's phone, he said. He described how the McMichaels and Mr Bryan chased Mr Arbery in pick-up trucks as he jogged in their neighbourhood. He said Mr Arbery repeatedly tried to escape and Travis McMichael shot him three times. Asked by Travis McMichael's lawyer whether Mr McMichael could have acted in self-defence, he said it was Mr Arbery who had been defending himself. "I believe Mr Arbery's decision was to just try to get away and when he felt like he could not escape, he chose to fight," he said. In the moments before the fatal confrontation, the McMichaels, who are white, armed themselves with a pistol and shotgun and pursued Mr Arbery in a pickup truck in the Satilla Shores neighbourhood. Gregory McMichael told police he believed that Mr Arbery resembled the suspect in a series of local break-ins. Mr Bryan's 36-second video leaked online on 5 May, generating a nationwide outcry that was swiftly followed by murder charges. It was filmed by Mr Bryan from his vehicle while he was driving behind Mr Arbery. The clip appears to show Mr Arbery running down a tree-lined street as the McMichaels wait ahead for him in their vehicle. A tussle follows between the younger McMichael and Mr Arbery, who falls to the ground. The three defendants were not charged until more than two months after Mr Arbery was killed. State police began investigating after footage of the incident circulated. No action had been taken by Glynn County police. Charges were then filed by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Virginia's Governor Ralph Northam has announced that a statue of Confederate General Robert E Lee will be removed from the state capital.  The controversial statue will be put into storage "as soon as possible", the governor said. The monument has been vandalised during recent protests over the killing of African American George Floyd. Memorials to the Confederacy, which fought to keep black people as slaves, have long stirred controversy. At a news conference, a round of applause erupted when Governor Northam said the 12-ton statue would be removed. "In Virginia, we no longer preach a false version of history," the governor said. "In 2020, we can no longer honour a system that was based on enslaving people. That statue has been there a long time. But it was wrong then, and it's wrong now. So we're taking it down." Referencing Gen Lee's own words, Governor Northam said "I think it wise not to keep open the sores of war". The Robert E Lee statue is the largest of five Confederate statues along Richmond's Monument Avenue. They have been rallying points during protests in Virginia in recent days, and have been tagged with graffiti, including messages that say "end police brutality" and "stop white supremacy". "They are extremely heavy and would crush anyone standing too close. Please be aware of the danger. Stand down!" the Richmond Police Department tweeted on Monday. Hundreds of statues of Lee, General Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson and other famous figures of the Confederacy - the southern states that revolted against the federal government - exist in the US. Some see the memorials, as well as Confederate flags, as markers of US history and southern culture. But to others they serve as an offensive reminder of the country's history of slavery and racial oppression. Rev Robert W Lee IV, great-great-grandson of the Confederate general, gave his blessing for the monument to be removed at Thursday's news conference. He said the world was watching Virginia and the US as protests over the death of Mr Floyd convulsed the country, asking: "If today is not the right time, when will it be the right time [to remove the statue]?" The debate around Confederate symbols received renewed attention after the protests in Charlottesville in 2017, triggered by the city council's decision to remove a statue of Lee. The resulting rally caused the deaths of a counter-protester and two state troopers died in a helicopter crash as they monitored the event. An independent inquiry into a racist photo on Democrat Ralph Northam's 1984 college yearbook page ended in 2019 with no conclusive findings. The report could not determine the identities of two individuals, one in blackface, the other in Ku Klux Klan robes, in the image.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Several videos of police brutality have emerged during protests over the death of African American George Floyd. In Buffalo, New York State, two officers were suspended after they were seen shoving an elderly white man to the ground. And in New York City, police were captured on video roughly handling demonstrators as they ran away. The reports come hours after a memorial for Floyd in Minneapolis, the city where he died at the hands of police. His killing, also captured on video, has caused outrage and sparked a wave of protests against racial discrimination and police treatment of African Americans in cities across the US and the world. The vast majority of demonstrations over the past eight days have been peaceful but some have descended into violence and rioting, with curfews imposed in a number of cities. At one protest, security forces in Washington DC fired pepper balls and smoke bombs to disperse demonstrators outside the White House, allowing President Donald Trump to walk to a nearby church for a photo opportunity. In response to this on Thursday, civil rights group the America Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit, accusing the president, the attorney general and others of violating the constitutional rights of protesters. "When the nation's top law enforcement officer becomes complicit in the tactics of an autocrat, it chills protected speech for all of us," said ACLU official Scott Michelman, quoted by Reuters. In a separate development, police in Arizona released details of the killing of another African American, Dion Johnson, in Phoenix on 25 May, the same day as Floyd. Johnson was shot dead by state troopers after being found "passed out in the driver's seat" of a car which was partially blocking traffic, a police statement said. "During the trooper's contact with the suspect, there was a struggle and the trooper fired his service weapon striking the suspect," police said. The statement was only released after Johnson's family was offered audio of the police dispatch and transportation department video of the incident. The Buffalo video shows a 75-year-old man approach police officers enforcing a curfew. They then move forward, pushing him back and causing him to fall over and hit his head. As he lies on the ground, blood is seen pouring from his ear. The man was taken away in an ambulance and was later found to have suffered a severe head injury. An initial statement from Buffalo Police Department said the man had "tripped" and fallen during a "skirmish involving protesters", compounding outrage at the incident on social media. Police spokesman Jeff Rinaldo later attributed the statement to officers not directly involved in the incident, adding that when the video had emerged the two policemen who pushed the demonstrator had been suspended without pay. On the same evening, a delivery driver in New York City was arrested 27 minutes after the city's curfew had started, despite being a key worker exempt from the curfew.

Other videos showed a man lying on the ground bleeding from the head, and being arrested. Protestor injured#BlackLivesMatter #blacklifematters #BlueLivesMatters #GeorgeFloyd pic.twitter.com/7EikYOKS7u End of Twitter post  by @WMSBG On Thursday New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo defended police, saying they were not beating citizens "for no reason", and if they did "it's wrong". City Mayor Bill de Blasio said the authorities were "doing everything from a perspective of restraint". But both men have since condemned the incidents which emerged overnight. In a tweet, Mr Cuomo described the Buffalo incident as "wholly unjustified and utterly disgraceful". "Police officers must enforce - NOT ABUSE - the law," he said. Meanwhile Mayor de Blasio said he had complained to the city police department after seeing the video of the arrest of the delivery worker. The incidents happened as police enforced curfews in dozens of cities across the US after a wave of protests sparked by George Floyd's death. Floyd, 46, was stopped by police investigating the purchase of cigarettes with counterfeit money on 25 May in Minneapolis. A video showed him being arrested and a white police officer continuing to kneel on his neck for several minutes even after he pleaded that he could not breathe. Protests erupted and have continued since, across many US cities and also internationally, with rallies on Wednesday in Australia, France, the Netherlands and in the UK, where thousands gathered in central London. A rally in the Australian city of Sydney has been refused permission by a court, amid fears of coronavirus health risks. Thousands had been expected to attend. Floyd's death follows the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri; Eric Garner in New York; and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement in recent years. For many, the outrage over Floyd's death also reflects years of frustration over socio-economic inequality and discrimination.  Protests over the death continued in dozens of cities on Thursday despite widespread curfews.  They followed a memorial service attended by hundreds, who stood in  silence for eight minutes and 46 seconds, the amount of time Floyd was alleged to have been on the ground under the control of police in Minneapolis. A lawyer for George Floyd told the service a "pandemic of racism" had led to his death. Giving the eulogy, civil rights activist the Reverend Al Sharpton said it was time to stand up and say "get your knee off our necks".

                                 Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places, like Portland, Oregon, protesters lie in the road, chanting "I can’t breathe". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floyd’s arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat.

The ex-Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, Gen Martin Dempsey, told National Public Radio that Mr Trump's remarks were "very troubling" and "dangerous". Mr Trump's current and former defence secretaries have also spoken out. On Monday, the president threatened to deploy the military to "quickly solve" the unrest if states failed to act. Mainly peaceful protests have spread across the US since the death of African-American George Floyd in police custody last month. While demonstrations over Mr Floyd's death appear to be simmering down in the nation's capital, the White House's security perimeter has expanded in recent days. Police used batons and tear gas to clear protesters from nearby Lafayette Park on Monday, and have since erected high fences around the White House.  "The idea that the president would take charge of the situation using the military was troubling to me," Gen Dempsey said in rare public remarks on Thursday. "The idea that the military would be called in to dominate and to suppress what, for the most part, were peaceful protests - admittedly, where some had opportunistically turned them violent - and that the military would somehow come in and calm that situation was very dangerous to me," he added. Gen Dempsey served as America's most senior military officer under former US President Barack Obama from 2011-15. His criticism comes a day after former Marine Gen Jim Mattis, Mr Trump's former defence secretary, denounced the president, saying he deliberately stoked division.  "Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people - does not even pretend to try," Mr Mattis wrote in the Atlantic magazine. "Instead, he tries to divide us." Mr Trump hit back via Twitter at the "overrated general". Earlier that day, Mr Trump's current Defence Secretary Mark Esper had also spoken up. He said the use of active-duty forces to quash unrest across the nation would be unnecessary at this stage, in remarks that are known to have displeased the White House. Mr Trump said on Monday from the White House Rose Garden that he would act to disperse violent protesters. "If a city or a state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them," he said. While he spoke, authorities used force to disperse a mainly peaceful protest nearby so the president could walk to a historic church that was damaged by fire in the unrest and be photographed holding up a Bible. The justice department had ordered Lafayette Square, just outside the executive mansion, to be fenced off for Mr Trump's walkabout. By Thursday afternoon, that security zone was significantly expanded, with high fencing installed around the park area known as the Ellipse just south of the White House. Also on Thursday, a moderate Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski broke ranks to say she was unsure if she would support Mr Trump's bid for re-election. In what is being seen as the most outspoken criticism yet of the president from a senator in his own party, Ms Murkowski told the Washington Post: "I thought Gen Mattis's words were true and honest and necessary and overdue." Shortly afterwards Mr Trump tweeted that he would campaign to throw the Alaska senator out of office when she is up for re-election in 2022. He later tweeted a letter written by his former lawyer John Dowd, apparently addressed to Mr Mattis, that referred to peaceful protesters in Washington as "terrorists". He also denounced John Kelly, his former White House Chief of staff, after the retired general also backed Mr Mattis. Meanwhile, the New York Times has said it was wrong to publish an opinion column by Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton entitled, Send in the Troops.  It comes after dozens of journalists at the newspaper criticised the decision to run the piece, tweeting it put "Black @nytimes staffers in danger". The Times initially defended its publication of Sen Cotton's column, which called for the military to be deployed against protesters - saying that it wanted to provide readers with a range of opinions.  But the paper later issued a statement saying "a rushed editorial process led to the publication of an Op-Ed that did not meet our standards".

The unemployment rate fell to 13.3%, down from 14.7% in April, as businesses started hiring again. Firms in the hospitality, construction and health care sectors took on staff. In total, employers added 2.5 million jobs, with the education and retail sectors also recruiting. It came as US states started rolling back some of the tough measures put in place to control the spread of the coronavirus. As businesses start reopening, firms are beginning to rehire their employees. The job gains surprised economists, many of whom had warned the country could see the unemployment rate rise past 20% to a post-World War Two high. Economist Justin Wolfers, a professor at the University of Michigan, tweeted: "It's hard to escape the conclusion that the economy bottomed in early/mid May," he said. "We're in a massive and deep hole, and it'll take a while to climb out, but at least the hole isn't getting any deeper." President Donald Trump, who has maintained the economic rebound will be swift, immediately took to Twitter to celebrate the numbers and claim credit. "Really Big Jobs Report. Great going President Trump (kidding but true)!" he wrote. The gains go only a small way towards making up for the more than 21 million jobs US employers cut in March and April, as lockdowns forced many businesses to shut their doors. In April, the unemployment rate hit 14.7%. But Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia said the report showed that the economic re-opening has been more robust than thought. "It appears that the worst of the coronavirus's impact on the nation's job markets is behind us," he said. The news cheered investors, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 up more than 2%, continuing a recovery in share prices from their March lows. The job gains were not limited to the US.  In Canada, employers added 290,000 jobs - far more than expected. However, the unemployment rate shot to 13.7% - the highest level on record in data back to 1976. As recently as February, the jobless rate in the US was hovering at 50-year lows of 3.5%. On Friday, economists warned the path of the economic recovery still remained uncertain. They pointed out that the hiring in May came as the government released billions of dollars in emergency aid to businesses to cover wages for employees, encouraging recipients to recall staff. Hiring by restaurants and bars accounted for roughly half of the jobs created last month. Dentist offices accounted for another 10%. Many of the gains also came from individuals who had told surveyors that their layoffs were temporary. "This means this was all the easy part of the recovery," said economist Jason Furman, a top economic advisor to President Barack Obama. The losses have hit minority and low-wage workers hardest, a trend that continued in May. Among white workers, the unemployment rate fell to 12.4% from 13.8% in April. Unemployment also declined among Hispanic workers, from 18.5% to 17.2%. For black workers, however the unemployment rate ticked up from 16.4% to 16.8%. The US Labor Department has warned that the headline figures in recent months may underestimate the true jobless rate, due to discrepancies in how people describe their out-of-work status.  Economists say the unemployment rate is likely to still be about 10% at the end of the year - still quite high, and comparable to the peak following the financial crisis. "We still think it will be a long time before the labour market is anywhere near back to its pre-virus state," said Michael Pearce, senior US economist at Capital Economics. But at a press conference on Friday, Mr Trump rejected those forecasts. "We'll go back to having the greatest economy anywhere in the world," he said. "This is a rocket ship."The rest of the NBA season is set to be played at Florida's Disney World Resort from 31 July. The season was suspended on 11 March because of coronavirus measures. Thirteen Western Conference teams and nine Eastern Conference teams will contest eight games each to determine seedings for the play-offs. The ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in Orlando includes a 5,000-seat indoor basketball facility. Under the NBA's proposals, all 22 teams will be based at the resort and games will be played without spectators to minimise the threat of Covid-19. On Thursday the NBA board of governors approved the plan to resume the season. The National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) must agree to the plan before it is confirmed. It is expected to vote during a conference call on Friday. The Los Angeles Lakers, Los Angeles Clippers, Denver Nuggets, Utah Jazz, Oklahoma City Thunder, Houston Rockets, Dallas Mavericks and Memphis Grizzlies are in play-off positions in the Western Conference. The Milwaukee Bucks, Toronto Raptors, Boston Celtics, Miami Heat, Indiana Pacers, Philadelphia 76ers, Brooklyn Nets and Orlando Magic currently occupy play-off spots in the Eastern Conference. Those 16 teams will be joined by the New Orleans Pelicans, Portland Trail Blazers, Phoenix Suns, Sacramento Kings and San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference and the Washington Wizards in the Eastern Conference. The latest date possible for finishing the season - what would be game seven of the NBA finals - is 12 October.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window One of the men accused of murdering unarmed black man Ahmaud Arbery in the US state of Georgia used a racial slur after shooting him, a court has heard. An investigator said Travis McMichael used the epithet and an expletive as Mr Arbery lay on the ground. Mr Arbery was jogging when he was chased down by Mr McMichael and his father in Brunswick in February. A judge has ruled there is enough evidence to try the pair and another suspect on murder charges. The case caused widespread outrage after footage was leaked online. Travis and Gregory McMichael - a former police officer - are facing murder charges. Another man, William Bryan, faces charges of murder and criminal attempt to commit false imprisonment. They deny the charges. Magistrate Court Judge Wallace Harrell issued the decision at the end of Thursday's hearing, after prosecutors presented testimony and evidence, meaning the case will move forward. Protesters gathered outside the Glynn County court where the preliminary hearing was held.  Huge protests have been taking place across the US following the death of another unarmed black man, George Floyd, in police custody last month. Special Agent Richard Dial of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation told the court that co-defendant William Bryan heard Travis McMichael use the slur after shooting Mr Arbery. "Mr Bryan said that after the shooting took place before police arrival, while Mr Arbery was on the ground, that he heard Travis McMichael make the statement," Agent Dial said. Agent Dial said Mr McMichael had used the same slur many times on social media. Investigators had also found racially derogatory texts on Mr Bryan's phone, he said. He described how the McMichaels and Mr Bryan chased Mr Arbery in pick-up trucks as he jogged in their neighbourhood. He said Mr Arbery repeatedly tried to escape and Travis McMichael shot him three times. Asked by Travis McMichael's lawyer whether Mr McMichael could have acted in self-defence, he said it was Mr Arbery who had been defending himself. "I believe Mr Arbery's decision was to just try to get away and when he felt like he could not escape, he chose to fight," he said. In the moments before the fatal confrontation, the McMichaels, who are white, armed themselves with a pistol and shotgun and pursued Mr Arbery in a pickup truck in the Satilla Shores neighbourhood. Gregory McMichael told police he believed that Mr Arbery resembled the suspect in a series of local break-ins. Mr Bryan's 36-second video leaked online on 5 May, generating a nationwide outcry that was swiftly followed by murder charges. It was filmed by Mr Bryan from his vehicle while he was driving behind Mr Arbery. The clip appears to show Mr Arbery running down a tree-lined street as the McMichaels wait ahead for him in their vehicle. A tussle follows between the younger McMichael and Mr Arbery, who falls to the ground. The three defendants were not charged until more than two months after Mr Arbery was killed. State police began investigating after footage of the incident circulated. No action had been taken by Glynn County police. Charges were then filed by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Virginia's Governor Ralph Northam has announced that a statue of Confederate General Robert E Lee will be removed from the state capital.  The controversial statue will be put into storage "as soon as possible", the governor said. The monument has been vandalised during recent protests over the killing of African American George Floyd. Memorials to the Confederacy, which fought to keep black people as slaves, have long stirred controversy. At a news conference, a round of applause erupted when Governor Northam said the 12-ton statue would be removed. "In Virginia, we no longer preach a false version of history," the governor said. "In 2020, we can no longer honour a system that was based on enslaving people. That statue has been there a long time. But it was wrong then, and it's wrong now. So we're taking it down." Referencing Gen Lee's own words, Governor Northam said "I think it wise not to keep open the sores of war". The Robert E Lee statue is the largest of five Confederate statues along Richmond's Monument Avenue. They have been rallying points during protests in Virginia in recent days, and have been tagged with graffiti, including messages that say "end police brutality" and "stop white supremacy". "They are extremely heavy and would crush anyone standing too close. Please be aware of the danger. Stand down!" the Richmond Police Department tweeted on Monday. Hundreds of statues of Lee, General Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson and other famous figures of the Confederacy - the southern states that revolted against the federal government - exist in the US. Some see the memorials, as well as Confederate flags, as markers of US history and southern culture. But to others they serve as an offensive reminder of the country's history of slavery and racial oppression. Rev Robert W Lee IV, great-great-grandson of the Confederate general, gave his blessing for the monument to be removed at Thursday's news conference. He said the world was watching Virginia and the US as protests over the death of Mr Floyd convulsed the country, asking: "If today is not the right time, when will it be the right time [to remove the statue]?" The debate around Confederate symbols received renewed attention after the protests in Charlottesville in 2017, triggered by the city council's decision to remove a statue of Lee. The resulting rally caused the deaths of a counter-protester and two state troopers died in a helicopter crash as they monitored the event. An independent inquiry into a racist photo on Democrat Ralph Northam's 1984 college yearbook page ended in 2019 with no conclusive findings. The report could not determine the identities of two individuals, one in blackface, the other in Ku Klux Klan robes, in the image.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Another senior former military officer has denounced President Donald Trump's threat to use troops to suppress ongoing protests in the US. The ex-Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, Gen Martin Dempsey, told National Public Radio that Mr Trump's remarks were "very troubling" and "dangerous". Mr Trump's current and former defence secretaries have also spoken out. On Monday, the president threatened to deploy the military to "quickly solve" the unrest if states failed to act. Mainly peaceful protests have spread across the US since the death of African-American George Floyd in police custody last month. While demonstrations over Mr Floyd's death appear to be simmering down in the nation's capital, the White House's security perimeter has expanded in recent days. Police used batons and tear gas to clear protesters from nearby Lafayette Park on Monday, and have since erected high fences around the White House.  "The idea that the president would take charge of the situation using the military was troubling to me," Gen Dempsey said in rare public remarks on Thursday. "The idea that the military would be called in to dominate and to suppress what, for the most part, were peaceful protests - admittedly, where some had opportunistically turned them violent - and that the military would somehow come in and calm that situation was very dangerous to me," he added. Gen Dempsey served as America's most senior military officer under former US President Barack Obama from 2011-15. His criticism comes a day after former Marine Gen Jim Mattis, Mr Trump's former defence secretary, denounced the president, saying he deliberately stoked division.  "Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people - does not even pretend to try," Mr Mattis wrote in the Atlantic magazine. "Instead, he tries to divide us." Mr Trump hit back via Twitter at the "overrated general". Earlier that day, Mr Trump's current Defence Secretary Mark Esper had also spoken up. He said the use of active-duty forces to quash unrest across the nation would be unnecessary at this stage, in remarks that are known to have displeased the White House. Mr Trump said on Monday from the White House Rose Garden that he would act to disperse violent protesters. "If a city or a state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them," he said. While he spoke, authorities used force to disperse a mainly peaceful protest nearby so the president could walk to a historic church that was damaged by fire in the unrest and be photographed holding up a Bible. The justice department had ordered Lafayette Square, just outside the executive mansion, to be fenced off for Mr Trump's walkabout. By Thursday afternoon, that security zone was significantly expanded, with high fencing installed around the park area known as the Ellipse just south of the White House. Also on Thursday, a moderate Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski broke ranks to say she was unsure if she would support Mr Trump's bid for re-election. In what is being seen as the most outspoken criticism yet of the president from a senator in his own party, Ms Murkowski told the Washington Post: "I thought Gen Mattis's words were true and honest and necessary and overdue." Shortly afterwards Mr Trump tweeted that he would campaign to throw the Alaska senator out of office when she is up for re-election in 2022. He later tweeted a letter written by his former lawyer John Dowd, apparently addressed to Mr Mattis, that referred to peaceful protesters in Washington as "terrorists". He also denounced John Kelly, his former White House Chief of staff, after the retired general also backed Mr Mattis. Meanwhile, the New York Times has said it was wrong to publish an opinion column by Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton entitled, Send in the Troops.  It comes after dozens of journalists at the newspaper criticised the decision to run the piece, tweeting it put "Black @nytimes staffers in danger". The Times initially defended its publication of Sen Cotton's column, which called for the military to be deployed against protesters - saying that it wanted to provide readers with a range of opinions.  But the paper later issued a statement saying "a rushed editorial process led to the publication of an Op-Ed that did not meet our standards".

                                 George Floyd dies after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage shows a white officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floyd’s neck for several minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Mr Floyd is heard repeatedly saying "I can’t breathe". He is pronounced dead later in hospital.

                                 Four officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd are fired. Protests begin as the video of the arrest is shared widely on social media. Hundreds of demonstrators take to the streets of Minneapolis and vandalise police cars and the police station with graffiti.

                                 Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places, like Portland, Oregon, protesters lie in the road, chanting "I can’t breathe". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floyd’s arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat.

                                 President Trump blames the violence on a lack of leadership in Minneapolis and threatens to send in the National Guard in a tweet.  He follows it up in a second tweet with a warning "when the looting starts, the shooting starts". The second tweet is hidden by Twitter for "glorifying violence".

                                 A CNN reporter, Omar Jimenez, is arrested while covering the Minneapolis protest. Mr Jimenez was reporting live when police officers handcuffed him. A few minutes later several of his colleagues are also arrested. They are all later released once they are confirmed to be members of the media. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with murder and manslaughter. The charges carry a combined maximum 35-year sentence.

The unemployment rate fell to 13.3%, down from 14.7% in April, as businesses started hiring again. Firms in the hospitality, construction and health care sectors took on staff. In total, employers added 2.5 million jobs, with the education and retail sectors also recruiting. It came as US states started rolling back some of the tough measures put in place to control the spread of the coronavirus. As businesses start reopening, firms are beginning to rehire their employees. The job gains surprised economists, many of whom had warned the country could see the unemployment rate rise past 20% to a post-World War Two high. Economist Justin Wolfers, a professor at the University of Michigan, tweeted: "It's hard to escape the conclusion that the economy bottomed in early/mid May," he said. "We're in a massive and deep hole, and it'll take a while to climb out, but at least the hole isn't getting any deeper." President Donald Trump, who has maintained the economic rebound will be swift, immediately took to Twitter to celebrate the numbers and claim credit. "Really Big Jobs Report. Great going President Trump (kidding but true)!" he wrote. The gains go only a small way towards making up for the more than 21 million jobs US employers cut in March and April, as lockdowns forced many businesses to shut their doors. In April, the unemployment rate hit 14.7%. But Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia said the report showed that the economic re-opening has been more robust than thought. "It appears that the worst of the coronavirus's impact on the nation's job markets is behind us," he said. The news cheered investors, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 up more than 2%, continuing a recovery in share prices from their March lows. The job gains were not limited to the US.  In Canada, employers added 290,000 jobs - far more than expected. However, the unemployment rate shot to 13.7% - the highest level on record in data back to 1976. As recently as February, the jobless rate in the US was hovering at 50-year lows of 3.5%. On Friday, economists warned the path of the economic recovery still remained uncertain. They pointed out that the hiring in May came as the government released billions of dollars in emergency aid to businesses to cover wages for employees, encouraging recipients to recall staff. Hiring by restaurants and bars accounted for roughly half of the jobs created last month. Dentist offices accounted for another 10%. Many of the gains also came from individuals who had told surveyors that their layoffs were temporary. "This means this was all the easy part of the recovery," said economist Jason Furman, a top economic advisor to President Barack Obama. The losses have hit minority and low-wage workers hardest, a trend that continued in May. Among white workers, the unemployment rate fell to 12.4% from 13.8% in April. Unemployment also declined among Hispanic workers, from 18.5% to 17.2%. For black workers, however the unemployment rate ticked up from 16.4% to 16.8%. The US Labor Department has warned that the headline figures in recent months may underestimate the true jobless rate, due to discrepancies in how people describe their out-of-work status.  Economists say the unemployment rate is likely to still be about 10% at the end of the year - still quite high, and comparable to the peak following the financial crisis. "We still think it will be a long time before the labour market is anywhere near back to its pre-virus state," said Michael Pearce, senior US economist at Capital Economics. But at a press conference on Friday, Mr Trump rejected those forecasts. "We'll go back to having the greatest economy anywhere in the world," he said. "This is a rocket ship."The rest of the NBA season is set to be played at Florida's Disney World Resort from 31 July. The season was suspended on 11 March because of coronavirus measures. Thirteen Western Conference teams and nine Eastern Conference teams will contest eight games each to determine seedings for the play-offs. The ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in Orlando includes a 5,000-seat indoor basketball facility. Under the NBA's proposals, all 22 teams will be based at the resort and games will be played without spectators to minimise the threat of Covid-19. On Thursday the NBA board of governors approved the plan to resume the season. The National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) must agree to the plan before it is confirmed. It is expected to vote during a conference call on Friday. The Los Angeles Lakers, Los Angeles Clippers, Denver Nuggets, Utah Jazz, Oklahoma City Thunder, Houston Rockets, Dallas Mavericks and Memphis Grizzlies are in play-off positions in the Western Conference. The Milwaukee Bucks, Toronto Raptors, Boston Celtics, Miami Heat, Indiana Pacers, Philadelphia 76ers, Brooklyn Nets and Orlando Magic currently occupy play-off spots in the Eastern Conference. Those 16 teams will be joined by the New Orleans Pelicans, Portland Trail Blazers, Phoenix Suns, Sacramento Kings and San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference and the Washington Wizards in the Eastern Conference. The latest date possible for finishing the season - what would be game seven of the NBA finals - is 12 October.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window One of the men accused of murdering unarmed black man Ahmaud Arbery in the US state of Georgia used a racial slur after shooting him, a court has heard. An investigator said Travis McMichael used the epithet and an expletive as Mr Arbery lay on the ground. Mr Arbery was jogging when he was chased down by Mr McMichael and his father in Brunswick in February. A judge has ruled there is enough evidence to try the pair and another suspect on murder charges. The case caused widespread outrage after footage was leaked online. Travis and Gregory McMichael - a former police officer - are facing murder charges. Another man, William Bryan, faces charges of murder and criminal attempt to commit false imprisonment. They deny the charges. Magistrate Court Judge Wallace Harrell issued the decision at the end of Thursday's hearing, after prosecutors presented testimony and evidence, meaning the case will move forward. Protesters gathered outside the Glynn County court where the preliminary hearing was held.  Huge protests have been taking place across the US following the death of another unarmed black man, George Floyd, in police custody last month. Special Agent Richard Dial of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation told the court that co-defendant William Bryan heard Travis McMichael use the slur after shooting Mr Arbery. "Mr Bryan said that after the shooting took place before police arrival, while Mr Arbery was on the ground, that he heard Travis McMichael make the statement," Agent Dial said. Agent Dial said Mr McMichael had used the same slur many times on social media. Investigators had also found racially derogatory texts on Mr Bryan's phone, he said. He described how the McMichaels and Mr Bryan chased Mr Arbery in pick-up trucks as he jogged in their neighbourhood.

As anti-racism protests sweep across the US, Beijing has seized upon them to hit back at Washington for supporting last year's Hong Kong pro-democracy demonstrations. Chinese state media have given extensive coverage to the protests, highlighting the chaotic scenes and alleged police brutality in America to claim that China enjoys greater social stability. Speaking to an international audience, Chinese diplomats are attempting to portray Beijing as a responsible global leader, standing in solidarity with other countries in condemning the racial disparity and injustice in the US.  China's state news agency Xinhua described the US civil unrest as "Pelosi's beautiful landscape" - a reference to US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's comment last summer that the Hong Kong protests were "a beautiful sight to behold". State media Global Times' chief editor Hu Xijin wrote that American politicians now can "enjoy this sight from their own windows".  Beijing has long condemned American politicians, including Ms Pelosi, for "glorifying violence" coming from the Hong Kong demonstrators, who are categorised by China as "rioters showing signs of terrorism".  Protests paralysed Hong Kong for most of last year, prompting Beijing to impose a new national security law in the territory in May, only two weeks ahead of the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown. Aynne Kokas, senior faculty fellow with the University of Virginia's Miller Center for Public Affairs, says that both the US and China are contending with a high level of domestic instability triggered by the global coronavirus pandemic and political events.  "Now is a key moment through which China is able to leverage the lack of stability in the US, in order to more efficiently promote its own national security goals," she says.  Chinese and Hong Kong officials have also called out the US for applying "double standards" in its response to civil unrest. "You know there are riots in the United States and we see how local governments reacted," said Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam. "And then in Hong Kong, when we had similar riots, we saw what position they adopted then."  The officials' view is shared by many Chinese social media users, who dub America "the double standard nation".  Allegations of excessive use of police force during the US protests have been put under the spotlight by Chinese state media, to delegitimise Washington's position on upholding freedom and democracy. In one example, state broadcaster China Central Television reported on American journalists being pepper sprayed and a freelance photographer partially blinded by a rubber bullet while covering the protests. Georgia State University Global Communication Assistant Professor Maria Repnikova says that the scale and intensity of Chinese state media coverage on the US protests is unprecedented.  "It's powerful, because they are not making it up," Prof Repnikova says, but she points out that Chinese state media have cherry-picked the more peaceful pictures of Hong Kong police and the most violent ones from the US. China itself has been heavily criticised for cracking down on press freedom, which is rarely mentioned by the government and state media. On Weibo, many see America's freedoms and democracy as at risk, as police fired tear gas at peaceful protesters and military was deployed to quell the protests.  Ms Kokas says: "Chinese state media don't have to craft a narrative, they can just talk about the objective events that have happen in Washington DC, that undermines the very principal of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly."  The US's rhetoric about the democratic rights of Hong Kong now seems "very hollow"，she adds, "when military helicopters are flying over [Washington] DC". The increasingly outspoken Chinese diplomats have seized the chance to spotlight the US's governing failure and promote Beijing as a more responsible global leader.  Ms Kokas describes this as a continuation of the country's propaganda strategy on the Covid-19 pandemic - when America fails, China is here to help. Chinese diplomats on Twitter retweeted messages of UN and African Union officials, condemning racial discrimination and police brutality in the US. The Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying tweeted "I can't breathe", with a screencap of the US state department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus' previous criticism over Beijing's handling in Hong Kong.  But another of Hua's messages denouncing anti-black racism backfired on Twitter, as she included "all lives matter", a phrase often used to undermine the "black lives matter" movement. Meanwhile, there are reports that African residents in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou have been discriminated against and forced into quarantine during the coronavirus pandemic.  Beijing has not officially apologised for any mishandling, only stating that there were some "misunderstandings".  One Weibo user expresses "disappointment", as the person sees "some Chinese criticise others for racial discrimination, but when it comes to their own anti-black racism, they take it for granted". China is also accused of detaining hundreds of thousands of Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in high-security prison camps in its far western Xinjiang region. There's no doubt  US protests have sparked heated discussion on Weibo - the topic is one of the most popular on the site this week. Related posts have earned more than 25 billion views. Many Weibo posts "congratulate" the US for the civil unrest and push back at its support for the Hong Kong demonstrations.  One user writes: "The US government has been inflaming violence around the world, now the American people have finally woken up. The US government deserves this!"  And Beijing and its state media spread the theory that Washington was fomenting the protests in Hong Kong, calling it a "black hand" behind the unrest. As US-China relations have soured due to the Hong Kong protests, trade conflicts and the pandemic, anti-America sentiment appears to be on the rise in China. Thousands of Weibo comments describe the US protests as "karma" for Washington. But some Chinese seem genuinely saddened by the situation.  "This is trampling on human rights! Democracy in the US came to an end at this exact moment," a Weibo user commented under a video showing the CNN reporter getting arrested, receiving thousands of likes.  Many on Weibo also voice support for the civil rights movement. "Nothing much has changed after generations of fights. I hope this time will yield better results," a comment reads. Some Chinese also reflect on the weaknesses of their country. One Weibo user writes about being "envious of the freedom of expression" in the US, as anti-government protests are often forcefully cracked down in China. Some posts urge the state media to cover China's domestic police violence and injustice with the same level of dedication.   But liberal voices are often met with harsh criticism. State-affiliated yet liberal leaning newspaper Beijing News published a commentary advocating for empathy and respect for the American people, but it was quickly slammed as taking a "pro-America" stance and received tens of thousands of negative comments on Weibo.  Social media has always been an imperfect window to observe China's public opinion. Its echo chamber effect is exacerbated by the country's information censorship.  Prof Repnikova says that the relatively liberal views may become even more marginalised on Chinese social media, as cyber nationalism, a combination of bottom-up sentiments and top-down propaganda tactic, is increasingly dominant on the sites. "The more aggressive, nationalistic and vocal voices are taking over the space," she says.

In my first week in New York City last summer, I was invited to dinner at a friend's penthouse on the wealthy Upper West Side.  I picked up some fruit for her and arrived at her building carrying a plastic bag. The front desk sent me through an open courtyard to the back of the building, past residents' garbage bags and into a surprisingly dirty lift.  When I got off upstairs, my host opened the door mortified, all the colour drained from her face.  "My racist doorman thought you're a delivery guy and made you use the service elevator," she explained as she apologised.   I have worked in the complicated racial hierarchies of South Africa and the UK and have travelled around the world, but it still stung that an American butler did not think accomplished white people like my friend and her husband could have a black dinner guest.  That early micro-aggression forewarned me that America may be the land of opportunity for many, but it would still reduce me to the colour of my skin and find me unworthy.  It did not matter that I am from a black majority African nation, people who look like me here have to negotiate for their humanity with a system that constantly alienates, erases and punishes them.  In Kenya, I may disappear into the crowd, but in America I always have a target on my back for being black. A day after investment banker Amy Cooper called the police after a Harvard-educated black man asked her to follow park rules and leash her dog, a white policeman knelt on George Floyd's neck for so long it eventually killed him.  I was heartbroken.  As protests broke out nationwide to demand justice for Floyd and the countless other black people who have been killed by police, I held my breath. How could I grieve for someone I did not know? How could I own a pain I had not lived, as an African "fresh off the boat" in America? I wondered if I would be appropriating the African-American struggle at a convenient moment. Then I saw a video shot at a protest in Long Beach, California, that was clear about allegiances.  "The best way that Africans in America can support African-Americans is to stand with us, and to understand that we're all the same," said a protester.  I asked Tom Gitaa - a publisher of Mshale newspaper, which serves African immigrants in the Midwest of the US - what he made of the protests, subsequent riots and looting that began in his city of Minneapolis.  "Many of us didn't grow up with some of these civil rights issues in Africa so sometimes our understanding is not there. "But with issues like police brutality and discrimination at the workplace, we're running into a lot of the same things African-Americans have experienced over the years," said Mr Gitaa, who moved to the US from East Africa about 30 years ago and whose American-born 24-year-old daughter has been one of the people making their voices heard on the streets.  There has always been tension between Africans and black Americans.  My friend, Karen Attiah, and I unpacked some of it in The Washington Post two years ago when the superhero film Black Panther came out.  She is the paper's Global Opinions editor, a daughter of African immigrants - born in the US, but deeply connected to her parent's home continent.  Karen told me her parents are now discussing race and white racism specifically in a way she and her siblings did not hear while growing up. "I think we were supposed to almost maintain a distance from black Americans because we were immigrants, we were different," she told me this week.  "And now we understand that if a cop sees the colour of your skin, he's not about to ask if you're from Ghana or Nigeria or Zimbabwe, or Atlanta or the south side of Dallas, they just see a black person." African celebrities like actress Lupita Nyong'o and comedian Trevor Noah are using their powerful platforms to support the agitation for justice and to call out the hypocrisy in some of the criticism of the protests.

The first enslaved Africans arrived in the US - in the then British colony of Virginia - 401 years ago.  Last year, some of their descendants made the journey back to Africa to mark "the Year of Return" to where their forebears were stolen from four centuries ago. One of the marquee events was the Afrochella Festival in Ghana last December, the brainchild of Abdul Karim Abdullah.  When I called, he was recovering from a long night after protests hit his home borough of The Bronx in New York City. "A lot of Africans are ignorant to the fact that this is also their fight," he said.  "Injustice to black people anywhere is injustice. We should stand up and fight together in solidarity." Africans in the US have marched alongside Black Lives Matter activists, supported protests against white supremacy, donated money to social justice causes and organized their own events to show unanimity in the black community.  Protesters with African flags or with signs in languages from the continent have also been spotted at events in different parts of the US.  "People of colour, especially black men, are the most mistreated, misvalued and misunderstood community on this planet," a tearful Jada Walker told a crowd of marchers outside the Dallas City Hall in Texas. She worried about what awaits her two-year-old nephew who has special needs when he grows up.  "How is a cop going to treat him when he stands 6ft 8in like his father, is not communicative and looks like someone they're looking for?" Because of the violent history of American policing for black and brown communities, parents are always on edge. Ifrah Udgoon, a Somalia-born high school science teacher in Columbus, Ohio, lives with that fear for her 13-year-old son.  "Each passing day brings the realisation that soon, if not already, he will go from being seen as cute to being seen as threatening. And my heart breaks for his innocence," she wrote in South Africa's Mail & Guardian. Ms Udgoon captured a battle many other African immigrants feel: "I am expected to be grateful to be here. But have I sold my soul to the devil?" Mr Abdullah sees Afrochella as a platform to unite the black diaspora as they deal with seemingly intractable obstacles like this.  "I checked in with black friends from Haiti, Benin and St Vincent and the Grenadines because discrimination has no nationality. Systemic racism affects us all.  "For a long time, I hadn't realized it was an injustice until I started finding language for it. I've been pulled over, been through stop and frisk and racially profiled. This fight is my fight." Mr Abdullah said. It is not just his fight for African-Americans like him, it is a fight for the right to be black safely in America. I replayed Karen's voice note to me because she had a powerful conclusion: "I think right now what is on display is anti-blackness and it's raising the consciousness about the connectedness of so many of our struggles, not the same but very much connected."Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Following the death of George Floyd while under arrest, protests have consumed America and onlookers have wondered how one of the most powerful countries in the world could descend into such chaos.  Despite being defined by race, American society does not spend much time analysing the history of our racial divisions, and America prefers to believe in the inevitable progression towards racial equality.  The election of Barack Obama in 2008 fed into this narrative of progress, but Donald Trump's presidential victory in 2016 was seen as a step backwards, coming after a campaign with a slogan that championed America's divisive past as a form of progress. Floyd's death now appears to be the tipping point for an exhausted, racially divided nation still in the throes of the coronavirus pandemic and the economic cost that followed. Floyd's cries of "I can't breathe" echoed the cries of Eric Garner, who was choked by police on a New York City sidewalk in 2014.  Floyd's words reminded Americans of the oppressive past we work to forget regardless of whether it is six years ago, 60 years ago, the 1860s, or 1619 when some of the first slaves arrived in America. To a large extent, America's neglect of the past and belief in progress have left many Americans unaware of the severity and scope of our racial tensions, and as a result many Americans lack the words to articulate our current turmoil. Recently, I have used the word ethnocide meaning "the destruction of culture while keeping the people" to describe America's past and present racial tensions, and this language also helps articulate the uniqueness of America's race problem. In 1941, Raphael Lemkin, a Polish Jew and distinguished lawyer, immigrated to the United States as he fled the Nazis. While in America he implored the American government to stop the Nazis from killing his people, and as his words fell on deaf ears, he realized he needed to create a new word to describe the unique horror befalling his people. In 1944, Lemkin coined the words genocide and ethnocide. Lemkin intended for the words to be interchangeable but over time they diverged. Genocide became the destruction of a people and their culture, and this word radically changed the world for the better. Ethnocide became the destruction of culture while keeping the people, and has been ignored for decades. Recently, ethnocide has been used to describe the plight of indigenous people against colonisation, but regarding America, ethnocide also pertains to the transatlantic slave trade and the founding of the nation. From the beginning of the transatlantic slave trade, European colonisers destroyed the culture of African people, but kept their bodies in order to create the chattel slavery system that became the economic and social foundation of the United States. Colonisers prevented Africans from speaking their languages and practising their religions. Tribal and familial bonds were broken, and African people could no longer identify as Igbo, Yoruba, and Malian. Instead de-cultured names such as nigger, negro, coloured, and black were stamped upon African people.  Additionally, Europeans identified themselves as white, and in the United States the one-drop rule was created to sustain that division. One drop of black or African blood meant that a person could not be white. In America, whiteness became a zero-sum identity that was maintained by systemic racial division. Interracial marriage was still illegal in much of America until the Loving vs Virginia decision in 1967.  From colonisation to the formation of the United States, America has created countless laws and policies to sustain the racial division between blacks and whites forged by ethnocide. These American norms, extending to housing, education, employment, healthcare, law enforcement and environmental protections including clean drinking water, have disproportionately harmed African Americans and other communities of colour in order to sustain racial division and white dominance. George Floyd's murder represents a continuation of the systemic criminalisation and oppression of black life in America that has always been the American norm dating back to Jim Crow, segregation (which means apartheid), and slavery. When the Confederacy, the collection of American slave-holding states in the South, seceded from the United States, they launched the Civil War to defend the immoral institution of slavery. After losing the Civil War, these states were readmitted back into the United States. To this day, many Americans, and especially America hate groups, still celebrate Confederate soldiers and politicians as heroes, and there are monuments and memorials dedicated to them across America. Despite the American South losing the Civil War in 1865, American President Andrew Johnson pardoned Confederate soldiers, and soon thereafter Confederate politicians won elected office in the newly-reunited America. The influence of former slave owners and Confederates contributed to erasing the rights that African Americans won in the 1860s including citizenship and the right to vote.  The political campaign to remove African American rights was called the Redeemers movement, and it was led by former slave-owners and Confederates, who wanted to redeem the South by returning it to the norms of chattel slavery. The Redeemers and "Make America Great Again" derive from America's oppressive, ethnocidal school of thought. The Redeemers were also assisted by American terrorist groups such as the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) that were made up of former Confederate soldiers. The KKK, and many other white supremacist groups, terrorised and lynched black Americans, and they also prevented them from voting to help ensure that Redeemer candidates won elected office. The terrorists became the government. By the start of the 20th Century, the Redeemers had succeeded in undoing the racial equality progress of the post-Civil War Reconstruction era, and now Jim Crow segregation became the norm of the American South. The Supreme Court's decision in Plessy vs Ferguson made "separate but equal" the new law of the land, and America again became a legal apartheid state. According to the Equal Justice Initiative's 2017 report Lynching in America, over 4,400 lynchings of African Americans occurred from 1877-1950. That is more than a lynching a week for 74 years. During Jim Crow, America could not legally deny black people their humanity, but they could deny them the services that are afforded to human beings. Black people were denied education, housing, employment, and were expected to "know their place" as a perpetually subjugated people. Large prisons were erected on former plantations; black people were arrested for minor crimes and given long prison sentences doing manual labour on the same land their ancestors were forced to work as enslaved people.  As a result of Jim Crow, millions of African Americans fled the neo-slavery and terror of the South during the Great Migration, and racial tensions spread as other American cities did not welcome these domestic refugees. This is the same journey as the Underground Railroad, where prior to the Civil War enslaved African Americans escaped the South and sought refuge in Canada and the Northern parts of America. The civil rights movement of the 1960s effectively ended Jim Crow, and African Americans began reclaiming the rights, specifically voting rights and freedom of movement, they had previously won in the 1860s, but it is a long road to dismantle systemic and legalised racism and segregation. Obama's election in 2008 was a monumental event in American society, but it did not magically erase the systemic racism woven into America's social fabric and the 2012 killing of Trayvon Martin, 17, helped launch the Black Lives Matter movement to national attention.  Trayvon was shot and killed by George Zimmerman as he walked home in his own neighbourhood because Zimmerman thought he looked suspicious. Martin was unarmed. Zimmerman pled self-defence and a jury found him not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter. Trayvon was one of countless African Americans killed by America's ethnocidal society that sanctions terror from both the government and civilians. The unjust killing of black people by the police and racist vigilantes remained the norm during Obama's presidency, but now the black community could record and document these crimes on video, and had a president who would defend them. Obama famously said: "If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon." The emergence of the Black Lives Matter movement and other protests under Obama occurred because black Americans were confident that the White House would listen to their cries of "I can't breathe" and make American society finally equitable and just. Under Trump those cries have fallen on deaf ears and tensions have escalated. America has much work to do to fix our racial tensions because our divisions and inequality are forged in our ethnocidal roots. We need to reform the policing of a nation nearly the size of a continent with over 300 million people, but we also need to make our education, healthcare, and housing systems, and every facet of our democracy more equitable.  Additionally, truth and reconciliation commissions, a national apology, reparations, holding evildoers accountable, and other processes nations have used to heal after a genocide, the linguistic sibling of ethnocide, will help America change course and forge equality and justice.  Also, America has rarely criminalised white supremacist hate and terror and instead has spent centuries normalising white terrorist groups, celebrating them as heroes, and letting them decide if their actions are evil or not. This is why the Confederacy is still celebrated today. Europe did not allow fascists and Nazis to determine if their actions were good or not, but America has always given this luxury to racist slave-owners and their generational apologists and offspring. This must change. Rwanda, Germany, and South Africa have reckoned with their troubled past to make a better future, but America has long preferred to ignore the past, and proclaim the inevitability of progress. America today must define and confront the Original Sin of slavery, ethnocide, and the cultural destruction it has inflicted upon all Americans, past and present. Otherwise we will fail to make a better future, and will continue our regression.

Hydroxychloroquine received global attention after being promoted by Donald Trump, and then controversy after studies on it were retracted. The drug has now been pulled from the UK's Recovery trial, which is run by the University of Oxford. The findings have been passed on to the World Health Organization. Back at the start of the pandemic, laboratory studies had suggested the malaria drug could affect the virus. Small-scale studies in China and France then hinted it might help patients. There was a huge amount of hope, as the medicine is cheap and has been safely used to treat malaria and conditions such as lupus and arthritis. However, the evidence supporting its use for coronavirus has been weak. That is why the data from the Recovery trial is crucial. It is the first to test the drug in large numbers of people in a thorough clinical trial. More than 11,000 patients with Covid-19 are taking part, with 1,542 patients given hydroxychloroquine.  Due to mounting controversy about the drug, the UK's drugs regulator last night asked the Oxford researchers to review their data.  The results showed 25.7% of people taking hydroxychloroquine had died after 28 days. This compared with 23.5% who were given standard hospital treatment.  "This is not a treatment for Covid," said Prof Martin Landray, part of the Recovery trial. The trial immediately stopped using the drug.  The findings come in the wake of deep concern in academic publishing that led to an article being retracted in the Lancet - one of the world's most prestigious medical journals. It had published a study involving nearly 15,000 patients, from hundreds of hospitals, given hydroxycholoroquine or the similar drug chloroquine.  It concluded the drug was not beneficial and increased the risk of irregular heart rhythms and death. That publication led to the WHO suspending its trials of the anti-malaria drug. The data had been collected from hospitals by the little-known healthcare firm Surgisphere.  Concerns were raised about the data and then some of the study's authors said they could no longer stand by their publication as Surgisphere would not allow an independent review. Then the New England Journal of Medicine retracted another paper that had data based on Surgisphere.  Prof Peter Horby, from the University of Oxford which runs the Recovery trial, said: "Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have received a lot of attention and have been used very widely to treat Covid patients despite the absence of any good evidence.  "Although it is disappointing that this treatment has been shown to be ineffective, it does allow us to focus care and research on more promising drugs."

Mr Arbery was fatally shot during the encounter. More than two months later, the two men were arrested, as was the neighbour who filmed the death.  Here's what we know about the case. Gregory, 64, and Travis McMichael, 34, are in the custody of the Glynn County Sheriff's Department. They were detained by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) on 7 May. The father-son pair face murder and aggravated assault charges. A neighbour who filmed a video of the confrontation, William Bryan, was arrested on 21 May and charged with criminal attempt to commit false imprisonment. At a preliminary trial hearing on 4 June, a judge determined that there was enough evidence to try all three men for murder. It also emerged that Travis McMichael used a racial epithet and an expletive directed at Mr Arbery as he lay on the ground. The three men have denied the charges.  On 11 May Georgia appointed a new lead prosecutor in the case - district attorney Joyette Holmes - the fourth since Mr Arbery was killed. Her predecessor had called for a grand jury, but it could not be convened until Covid-19 restrictions began easing in June. In the afternoon on 23 February, Mr Arbery was out for a jog in the coastal city of Brunswick. At one point, he entered the Satilla Shores neighbourhood. A neighbourhood resident, Gregory McMichael, told police he believed Mr Arbery resembled the suspect in a series of local break-ins.  Police have said no reports were filed regarding these alleged break-ins. Gregory McMichael and his son, Travis, armed themselves with a pistol and a shotgun and pursued Mr Arbery in a pickup truck through the neighbourhood. According to the elder Mr McMichael, he and his son had said "stop, stop, we want to talk to you".  He said Mr Arbery then attacked his son. Lawyers for Mr Arbery's family have said the 25-year-old was unarmed. Three shots were fired and Mr Arbery fell down on the street. An autopsy report showed Mr Arbery had two gunshot wounds in his chest, and a gunshot graze wound on the inside of one of his wrists. He did not have drugs or alcohol in his system. The delay is in part tied to prosecutor turnover: the case is currently on its fourth. The Georgia Attorney General announced on Monday that Joyette Holmes of the Cobb County Judicial Circuit would replace attorney Tom Durden as lead prosecutor. Two local district attorneys recused themselves due to professional connections to the elder Mr McMichael. Officials have also publicly disagreed over whether there were orders to not arrest the pair. Brunswick District Attorney Jackie Johnson - whose office initially handled the case - has been accused by two county commissioners of not allowing police to arrest the McMichaels immediately after the shooting. Mr McMichael had been previously employed by her office. But Ms Johnson has denied the claim, and said no prosecutors in her office told law enforcement not to arrest them. She blamed local police for not deciding what to do. The second district attorney involved, Waycross Circuit District Attorney George Barnhill, had told police he believed the father and son had used citizen's arrest rights in confronting the jogger, and that as a result there were no grounds for arrest. Mr Barnhill recused himself, citing concerns raised by the victim's mother over his ties to Mr McMichael. Mr Arbery's family have criticised prosecutors' handling of the case as a "cover-up". Atlanta Attorney General Chris Carr has now formally requested the GBI to look into the conduct of the district attorneys who first handled the case before charges were filed. A former star high school football player, his father said he often exercised in the area. His family has described him as a good, generous young man with a big heart. He would have turned 26 in May. When Mr Arbery was in high school, he received five years of probation for a first-time weapons charge and in 2018, was convicted of probation violation for shop lifting according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspaper.  It emerged that in 2017, Glynn County officer attempted to tase him after he denied their request to search his car at a park. Police bodycam footage showed the encounter with officers, who said he was in a car in an area known for drug use. He said he was on his day off from work. The taser malfunctioned and he was allowed to leave on foot. A police report obtained by the Guardian shows the officers wrote that they later found a bag in his car which they believed to contain cannabis. Gregory McMichael was a former police detective. He also worked as an investigator for the local district attorney for years and had retired in 2019. Mr McMichael had previously been involved in an investigation of Mr Arbery, according to a letter written by Mr Barnhill, the second prosecutor to recuse.  The first video surfaced publicly on 5 May. The 36-second clip was filmed from a vehicle following Mr Arbery.  It shows Mr Arbery jogging, and approaching a stationary pickup truck which is ahead of him on the road.  He tries to bypass the truck and then is seen struggling with a man carrying a shotgun. There is muffled shouting and three gunshots are heard. A second man is standing in the bed of the pickup. The second man is then shown with a pistol standing alongside the other armed man with the jogger no longer in view. The clip - which sparked nationwide outcry swiftly followed by criminal charges  - was leaked at the behest of Gregory McMichael because he thought it would make him and his son look better, according to WSB-TV in Atlanta. On 10 May another video emerged, showing a man believed to Mr Arbery at a home construction site shortly before the shooting. In the footage from a surveillance camera, a black man in a white T-shirt walks onto the site and is seen looking around for a few minutes before leaving and jogging down the street. Lee Merritt, an attorney for Mr Arbery's family, said in a statement that it was Mr Arbery in the clip, and that it confirms the young man was out for a jog and did nothing illegal. Police arrested William Bryan, who filmed the first video, two weeks after the McMichaels. Mr Bryan, along with the two McMichael's, appeared to have been following Mr Arbery "in hot pursuit", according to a memo by Mr Barnhill.  He is also mentioned in the Glynn County police report of the shooting, in which officers noted that Mr Bryan had unsuccessfully tried to block Mr Arbery's path. However, Mr Bryan told a local TV station that he "had nothing to do with it" and was in "complete shock". He did not answer questions on why he was there or why he started recording, but his lawyer said: "My client was responding to what he saw, which was someone in the community he didn't know being followed by a vehicle he recognised."  Mr Bryan has submitted a voluntary lie-detector test to investigators, his lawyer has said, despite not being asked by law enforcement to do so. "Contrary to speculation, the polygraph examination confirms that on 23 Feb 2020, the day of the shooting, William 'Roddie' Bryan did not have any conversation with either Gregory or Travis McMichael prior to the shooting. Nor did William 'Roddie' Bryan have any conversation with anyone else that day prior to the shooting about criminal activity in the neighbourhood," said lawyer Kevin Gough, using Mr Bryan's nickname. In a CNN interview, Mr Bryan said he was praying for the Arbery family and hoped his tape would help bring closure. "If there wasn't a tape, then we wouldn't know what happened," he said. "I hope that it, in the end, brings justice to the family and peace to the family." Around the time of the incident, a number of emergency calls were made, CBS News has reported. In one, a neighbour said a black man was seen at a home under construction. When asked if the man was breaking in, the caller replied "No, it's all open, it's under construction." The caller then said that the man was "running down the street".  The dispatcher says "I just need to know what he was doing wrong. Was he just on the premises and not supposed to be?" and the caller replies: "He's been caught on the camera a bunch before at night. It's kind of an ongoing thing out here." The owner of the home that was under construction told CNN that, while his CCTV captured four short clips of a man that appeared to be Mr Arbery "trespassing" on his properly on 23 February, he had not reported any crime to the police. "I don't want it to be put out and misused and misinterpreted for people to think that I had accused Mr Arbery of stealing or robbery, because I never did," he said. A lawyer for the homeowner later said its their belief that Mr Arbery had been looking for water. Security footage shows he was not the only person to enter the construction site - children from the neighbourhood were also filmed playing at the site. Footage shows a man who looks like Mr Arbery entered the site twice in the five weeks before the fatal shooting, the lawyer added. On one of the nights where a man is filmed entering the building, Travis McMichael called 911 to report seeing a "black male, red shirt and white shorts". "When I turned around and saw him and backed up, he reached into his pocket and ran into the house," Mr McMichael told the police. "So I don't know if he's armed or not. But he looked like, he was acting like he was." Police records show only one burglary report in the neighbourhood between 1 January and 23 February,  US media report. That incident involved a gun being reported stolen from a pickup truck outside the home of Travis McMichael on 1 January.  The McMichaels have not issued a statement to US media.  In their account to police, Mr McMichael alleges the jogger attacked his son in the road after they tried to stop him, and that they acted out of self-defence.  Attorneys representing the pair have described Mr Arbery's death as a "tragedy" but urged against rushing to judgment. "We will not try this case in the media," said Laura Hogue, who is representing the elder McMichael with her husband, Frank Hogue. "The facts that matter will come out in the courtroom."  In a 15 May press conference, the lawyers suggested that new evidence would be revealed at trial but declined to provide further detail.  "Right now we are starting at the end," Jason Sheffield, who is representing the younger McMichael, said in a 14 May video conference. "We know the ending. What we don't know is the beginning." Mr Arbery's family has called his death a "lynching". His parents said the arrest of the McMichaels was a relief, but they have expressed a distrust of local law enforcement. His mother, Wanda Cooper Jones, told PBS News: "I honestly think that if we didn't get national attention to it, my son's death would have actually been a cover-up." Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for the family, has asked for the same justice for Mr Arbery if the situations were reversed and two black men had attacked an unarmed white man. "We know beyond a shadow of a doubt they would've been arrested on day one," Mr Crump said. Under the citizen's arrest law, an individual can detain someone they have seen committing a serious crime and if the suspect is trying to escape. Local media note that the law does not always allow deadly force in carrying out an arrest - that's limited to self-defence or times where it is absolutely necessary to prevent certain serious crimes. While Georgia is one of four states that has no hate crime statutes, the federal government can file those charges. The Department of Justice (DOJ) on Monday said its civil rights division, the FBI, and the US Attorney for the Southern District of Georgia have been supporting the state investigation. "We are assessing all of the evidence to determine whether federal hate crime charges are appropriate," spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said. Georgia's Attorney General Chris Carr has also asked the department to investigate the handling of the case.  The DOJ said on Monday it has requested Mr Carr send any information he has to federal authorities. The case has also prompted members of the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus to renew calls for a state hate crime law.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window As protests continue across the US over the death of an African-American man, George Floyd, President Donald Trump has said he's done "more for the black community than any president since Abraham Lincoln". He tweeted that he had delivered the lowest African-American unemployment, poverty and crime rates in US history. So how has he done? The African-American unemployment rate reached 16.8% in May this year - the highest since March 2010. It's spiked sharply because of the huge impact of the coronavirus crisis on the US economy.  And this has disproportionately affected African-Americans - their unemployment rate is 3.5% higher than the overall figure. But it's worth saying it went as low as 5.5% in September last year - the lowest figure recorded since the US Department of Labor started collecting these statistics in the 1970s. Prior to the coronavirus crisis, there had been a consistent downward trend in African-American unemployment under President Trump. But it's a trend which began under President Barack Obama, who saw the rate decline from 12.6% to 7.5% during his two terms in office from 2009 until 2017. However, there remains a disparity in wages between different groups in the US.  The average income of African-American households is almost 60% less than white households, with growth stalling under President Trump, according to the latest statistics. In 2018, the latest data available, the African-American poverty rate was 20.8% - which is the lowest on record, beating the previous year, since the official count began in the 1960s. That represents 8.9 million African-Americans in poverty, according to the US Census Bureau. The US Census Bureau calculates poverty by judging that if a family's total income is less than the family's needs, then every person in that family is considered to be in poverty. Black poverty also came down under President Obama, and was 21.8% in 2016  - his last full year in office. This is hard to answer with any certainty. There are crime statistics gathered by the FBI, but there isn't comprehensive data categorised by race. Violent crime overall has fallen under President Trump, continuing a trend which started after a peak in 1991.  When you look at the number of African-Americans arrested - which can give some indication - you can see arrests have come down over recent years. They've remained relatively steady for the last four years.  The latest available data is from 2018 and shows that 2,115,381 African-Americans were arrested, according to FBI statistics.

In Buffalo, New York State, two officers were suspended after they were seen shoving an elderly white man to the ground. And in New York City, police were captured on video roughly handling demonstrators as they ran away. The reports come hours after a memorial for Floyd in Minneapolis, the city where he died at the hands of police. His killing, also captured on video, has caused outrage and sparked a wave of protests against racial discrimination and police treatment of African Americans in cities across the US and the world. The vast majority of demonstrations over the past eight days have been peaceful but some have descended into violence and rioting, with curfews imposed in a number of cities. At one protest, security forces in Washington DC fired pepper balls and smoke bombs to disperse demonstrators outside the White House, allowing President Donald Trump to walk to a nearby church for a photo opportunity. In response to this on Thursday, civil rights group the America Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit, accusing the president, the attorney general and others of violating the constitutional rights of protesters. "When the nation's top law enforcement officer becomes complicit in the tactics of an autocrat, it chills protected speech for all of us," said ACLU official Scott Michelman, quoted by Reuters. In a separate development, police in Arizona released details of the killing of another African American, Dion Johnson, in Phoenix on 25 May, the same day as Floyd. Johnson was shot dead by state troopers after being found "passed out in the driver's seat" of a car which was partially blocking traffic, a police statement said. "During the trooper's contact with the suspect, there was a struggle and the trooper fired his service weapon striking the suspect," police said. The statement was only released after Johnson's family was offered audio of the police dispatch and transportation department video of the incident. The Buffalo video shows a 75-year-old man approach police officers enforcing a curfew. They then move forward, pushing him back and causing him to fall over and hit his head. As he lies on the ground, blood is seen pouring from his ear. The man was taken away in an ambulance and was later found to have suffered a severe head injury. An initial statement from Buffalo Police Department said the man had "tripped" and fallen during a "skirmish involving protesters", compounding outrage at the incident on social media. Police spokesman Jeff Rinaldo later attributed the statement to officers not directly involved in the incident, adding that when the video had emerged the two policemen who pushed the demonstrator had been suspended without pay. On the same evening, a delivery driver in New York City was arrested 27 minutes after the city's curfew had started, despite being a key worker exempt from the curfew.

City Mayor Bill de Blasio said the authorities were "doing everything from a perspective of restraint". But both men have since condemned the incidents which emerged overnight. In a tweet, Mr Cuomo described the Buffalo incident as "wholly unjustified and utterly disgraceful". "Police officers must enforce - NOT ABUSE - the law," he said. Meanwhile Mayor de Blasio said he had complained to the city police department after seeing the video of the arrest of the delivery worker. The incidents happened as police enforced curfews in dozens of cities across the US after a wave of protests sparked by George Floyd's death. Floyd, 46, was stopped by police investigating the purchase of cigarettes with counterfeit money on 25 May in Minneapolis. A video showed him being arrested and a white police officer continuing to kneel on his neck for several minutes even after he pleaded that he could not breathe. Protests erupted and have continued since, across many US cities and also internationally, with rallies on Wednesday in Australia, France, the Netherlands and in the UK, where thousands gathered in central London. A rally in the Australian city of Sydney has been refused permission by a court, amid fears of coronavirus health risks. Thousands had been expected to attend. Floyd's death follows the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri; Eric Garner in New York; and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement in recent years. For many, the outrage over Floyd's death also reflects years of frustration over socio-economic inequality and discrimination.  Protests over the death continued in dozens of cities on Thursday despite widespread curfews.  They followed a memorial service attended by hundreds, who stood in  silence for eight minutes and 46 seconds, the amount of time Floyd was alleged to have been on the ground under the control of police in Minneapolis. A lawyer for George Floyd told the service a "pandemic of racism" had led to his death. Giving the eulogy, civil rights activist the Reverend Al Sharpton said it was time to stand up and say "get your knee off our necks".

The drugs - normally used for malaria and other conditions - have been promoted and used by some world leaders, despite concerns about their safety and efficacy.  We've looked at what we know so far about these drugs. US President Donald Trump revealed in May that he was taking hydroxychloroquine as a preventative measure against Covid-19, but later said he'd stopped.   Mr Trump has repeatedly referred to its potential. At a press conference in April, he said: "What do you have to lose? Take it." Following Mr Trump's comments, there was a sharp increase reported in prescriptions in the US for both hydroxychloroquine and the related drug, chloroquine. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro claimed in a video that "hydroxychloroquine is working in all places."  This was removed by Facebook for breaching its misinformation guidelines. There's also been a global surge in demand for them. Hydroxychloroquine is safe for treating malaria, and conditions like lupus or arthritis, but so far no clinical trials have recommended it for use against Covid-19. Safety fears were highlighted following an article in the Lancet medical journal in May which said the drugs could increase the risk of heart problems. But the Lancet has now retracted this because of issues around the data that was used for the research. And the World Health Organization (WHO) said on 3 June it was resuming trials involving hydroxychloroquine, which it had earlier suspended over safety concerns. At the moment, there's not a great deal of evidence to show whether or not they're effective for either prevention or treatment. There are trials in various countries on using the drugs to prevent Covid-19, sometimes involving frontline workers who are more likely to be exposed to the virus. A trial is underway across Europe, Africa, Asia and South America, testing 40,000 people with either hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine or a placebo (a dummy drug used as a control in the test) to see if it's effective. In the US, various trials are taking place for a combination of drugs including chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and an antibiotic called azithromycin, for treating patients who already have Covid-19.  Nigeria is conducting trials, as are Morocco, Algeria and Senegal. However, Kenya suspended its trials in the wake of safety concerns. Results that have come out from one clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine by the University of Minnesota in the US show it is not effective at preventing Covid-19. Over 800 US and Canadian health care workers and other individuals exposed to the virus were given either a placebo or the drug.  No significant difference was found in the percentages of each group who got Covid-19.  There are countries using the drugs, usually in specific circumstances. In late March, the US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) granted "emergency use" authorisation for these drugs in the treatment of Covid-19 for a limited number of hospitalised cases. That means that hospitals can request and use the medicines for Covid-19 treatment under certain conditions. But on 24 April, the FDA issued a warning about the dangers of using the substances because of reports of heart rhythm problems in patients. And France, which had authorised hospitals to prescribe the drugs for patients with Covid-19, later reversed the decision after the country's medical watchdog warned of possible side effects. However, Brazil has relaxed its restrictions to allow doctors to prescribe hydroxychloroquine to patients with mild coronavirus symptoms, not just those in a serious condition in hospital.  The US government has sent two million doses to Brazil for frontline workers and those receiving treatment in hospitals. The Indian government expanded the use of the drug as a preventative medicine - but only under medical supervision - for healthcare workers in non-coronavirus environments, and for police working in areas with high rates of Covid-19.

The US has by far the largest number of cases, almost one third of the global total, according to figures collated by Johns Hopkins University. It also has the world's highest death toll, followed by the UK and Brazil.  In Europe, Italy, France and Spain have also been badly hit. In China, the official death toll is some 4,600 from about 84,000 confirmed cases, although critics have questioned whether the country's official numbers can be trusted.

                            Figures last updated: 4 June 2020, 21:36 BST
                         The outbreak was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March. This is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. The WHO has warned that the pandemic is a long way from being over and said people should be prepared for new outbreaks to build up very quickly - especially in areas where lockdowns are eased. The true number of cases is thought to be much higher than the reported figures, as many of those with milder symptoms have not been tested and counted.   Globally, at least 4.5 billion people - half the world's population - have been living under social distancing measures, according to the AFP news agency's estimates. Those restrictions have had a big impact on the global economy, with the International Monetary Fund warning the world faces the worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The United Nations World Food Programme has also warned that the pandemic could almost double the number of people suffering acute hunger. While some countries are starting to see confirmed cases and deaths fall following strict lockdown restrictions, others are still seeing figures rise. A sharp increase in cases in Latin America in the second half of May led the WHO to say the Americas were at the centre of the pandemic. But there have also been new spikes in Africa, Asia and the Middle East. These charts show four countries where deaths are still on an upward trajectory - as shown by the red lines. There is particular concern about the situation in Brazil, where President Jair Bolsonaro has compared contracting the virus to having "the sniffles".  There are now more than 600,000 cases in Brazil and around 35,000 people have died, according to official figures. In the same week that the number of deaths in one day twice hit record levels, Mr Bolsonaro said death was the destiny of everyone, and blamed the media for stirring panic. Brazil's death toll could exceed 125,000 by early August, according to a projection by experts at the University of Washington. Several other countries in Latin America are seeing widespread outbreaks, including Peru, Mexico, Chile and Ecuador.  Elsewhere, Russia has seen infections rise rapidly in recent weeks, but is easing some lockdown restrictions.  India has also seen infections spike and Iran shows signs of a second wave of infections. South Africa, Egypt and Nigeria have seen the largest outbreaks in Africa.  South Korea, which appeared to have brought its outbreak under control with an extensive "track, trace and treat" programme, has been forced to reintroduce some restrictions after a small spike in cases. In Europe, the UK, Italy, Spain and France, along with others, now appear to have passed the peak, with the number of new confirmed cases and deaths falling.  The UK has reported almost 40,000 coronavirus deaths, the highest number in Europe. Italy has had the second highest death toll with 33,000, while both France and Spain are just below 30,000. However, differences in population size and how countries report their figures, with some including deaths in care homes, or deaths of those suspected but not confirmed of having the virus, means international comparisons are complicated. Having been on lockdown to control the spread of the virus, European countries are now beginning to ease restrictions.  How and when restrictions are lifted varies from country to country, but the WHO has urged all nations to adopt a "slow, steady" approach. Sweden did not impose a lockdown, although it has encouraged some social distancing measures, and appears to have suffered a far higher number of deaths than its neighbours.  Latest figures show Sweden has recorded about 4,500 deaths. Denmark has had 580 deaths and restricted travel across the Oresund bridge, which connects the two countries. Norway and Finland have both recorded death tolls below 500.  However, as in the rest of Europe, new virus cases in Sweden are now falling. With more than 1.8 million cases, the US has the highest number of confirmed infections in the world. It has also recorded over 105,000 deaths.  The state of New York has been particularly badly affected, with about 30,000 deaths in total, but the number of daily deaths has now dropped to fewer than 100 - down from 1,000 a day in early April. At one point, more than 90% of the US population was under mandatory lockdown orders, but all 50 states have now begun to loosen their stay-at-home restrictions and allowed some businesses to reopen - a move health officials fear could further spread the virus. While the rate of new cases is now declining in many states, in others - including California, and several south-eastern states - it is still rising.  And mass protests against police brutality following the death of George Floyd have led to warnings from public health experts that crowds gathering could cause a further resurgence. The latest figures show more than 42 million people have lost their jobs since the outbreak hit the US - a quarter of the American workforce. The rise means the jobless rate is now worse than at any time since the Great Depression of the 1930s.  The data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University, data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, national governments and health agencies, as well as UN data on populations. When comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult. Other factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size  of the a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Snapchat says it has stopped promoting President Donald Trump's account. As a result, it will no longer feature in the app's Discover section. The firm said it would "not amplify voices who incite racial violence and injustice". The decision follows Mr Trump saying that "vicious dogs" and "ominous weapons" would have been used on protesters if they had breached the White House fence. It follows Twitter's decision to hide some of the president's posts. Snapchat's parent company Snap said: "Racial violence and injustice have no place in our society and we stand together with all who seek peace, love, equality, and justice in America." The move is likely to feed into tensions between the White House and social media, which escalated when Twitter added fact-checking tags to some of the President's tweets last week. The president subsequently signed an executive order seeking to curb legal protections offered to the industry. Twitter later hid one of the president's tweets for breaking its rules on "glorifying violence". Snapchat's action will also put further pressure on Facebook.  Its chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has resisted internal and external calls to intervene in regard to posts on its platform. Mr Zuckerberg has said the firm's free speech principles mean the president's posts should be left up unaltered. President Trump has more than one million followers on Snapchat, according to the Bloomberg news agency. It said the app is seen as being a "key battleground" by Mr Trump's re-election campaign because it offers a way to reach first-time voters. The president's account will not be suspended or deleted. However, the fact it will not feature in Discover means that his posts will only be seen by people who subscribe to or search for his account directly. Snapchat based its decision on remarks Mr Trump had posted to Twitter rather than its own platform. On Monday, Snap's chief executive Evan Speigel had sent a memo to staff in which he detailed his views on the civil unrest sparked by the killing of George Floyd. "Every minute we are silent in the face of evil and wrongdoing we are acting in support of evildoers," Mr Speigel wrote. "As for Snapchat, we simply cannot promote accounts in America that are linked to people who incite racial violence, whether they do so on or off our platform." "Our Discover content platform is a curated platform, where we decide what we promote," he added.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Another senior former military officer has denounced President Donald Trump's threat to use troops to suppress ongoing protests in the US. The ex-Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, Gen Martin Dempsey, told National Public Radio that Mr Trump's remarks were "very troubling" and "dangerous". Mr Trump's current and former defence secretaries have also spoken out. On Monday, the president threatened to deploy the military to "quickly solve" the unrest if states failed to act. Mainly peaceful protests have spread across the US since the death of African-American George Floyd in police custody last month. While demonstrations over Mr Floyd's death appear to be simmering down in the nation's capital, the White House's security perimeter has expanded in recent days. Police used batons and tear gas to clear protesters from nearby Lafayette Park on Monday, and have since erected high fences around the White House.  "The idea that the president would take charge of the situation using the military was troubling to me," Gen Dempsey said in rare public remarks on Thursday. "The idea that the military would be called in to dominate and to suppress what, for the most part, were peaceful protests - admittedly, where some had opportunistically turned them violent - and that the military would somehow come in and calm that situation was very dangerous to me," he added. Gen Dempsey served as America's most senior military officer under former US President Barack Obama from 2011-15. His criticism comes a day after former Marine Gen Jim Mattis, Mr Trump's former defence secretary, denounced the president, saying he deliberately stoked division.  "Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people - does not even pretend to try," Mr Mattis wrote in the Atlantic magazine. "Instead, he tries to divide us." Mr Trump hit back via Twitter at the "overrated general". Earlier that day, Mr Trump's current Defence Secretary Mark Esper had also spoken up. He said the use of active-duty forces to quash unrest across the nation would be unnecessary at this stage, in remarks that are known to have displeased the White House. Mr Trump said on Monday from the White House Rose Garden that he would act to disperse violent protesters. "If a city or a state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them," he said. While he spoke, authorities used force to disperse a mainly peaceful protest nearby so the president could walk to a historic church that was damaged by fire in the unrest and be photographed holding up a Bible. The justice department had ordered Lafayette Square, just outside the executive mansion, to be fenced off for Mr Trump's walkabout. By Thursday afternoon, that security zone was significantly expanded, with high fencing installed around the park area known as the Ellipse just south of the White House. Also on Thursday, a moderate Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski broke ranks to say she was unsure if she would support Mr Trump's bid for re-election. In what is being seen as the most outspoken criticism yet of the president from a senator in his own party, Ms Murkowski told the Washington Post: "I thought Gen Mattis's words were true and honest and necessary and overdue." Shortly afterwards Mr Trump tweeted that he would campaign to throw the Alaska senator out of office when she is up for re-election in 2022. He later tweeted a letter written by his former lawyer John Dowd, apparently addressed to Mr Mattis, that referred to peaceful protesters in Washington as "terrorists". He also denounced John Kelly, his former White House Chief of staff, after the retired general also backed Mr Mattis. Meanwhile, the New York Times has said it was wrong to publish an opinion column by Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton entitled, Send in the Troops.  It comes after dozens of journalists at the newspaper criticised the decision to run the piece, tweeting it put "Black @nytimes staffers in danger". The Times initially defended its publication of Sen Cotton's column, which called for the military to be deployed against protesters - saying that it wanted to provide readers with a range of opinions.  But the paper later issued a statement saying "a rushed editorial process led to the publication of an Op-Ed that did not meet our standards".

As anti-racism protests sweep across the US, Beijing has seized upon them to hit back at Washington for supporting last year's Hong Kong pro-democracy demonstrations. Chinese state media have given extensive coverage to the protests, highlighting the chaotic scenes and alleged police brutality in America to claim that China enjoys greater social stability. Speaking to an international audience, Chinese diplomats are attempting to portray Beijing as a responsible global leader, standing in solidarity with other countries in condemning the racial disparity and injustice in the US.  China's state news agency Xinhua described the US civil unrest as "Pelosi's beautiful landscape" - a reference to US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's comment last summer that the Hong Kong protests were "a beautiful sight to behold". State media Global Times' chief editor Hu Xijin wrote that American politicians now can "enjoy this sight from their own windows".  Beijing has long condemned American politicians, including Ms Pelosi, for "glorifying violence" coming from the Hong Kong demonstrators, who are categorised by China as "rioters showing signs of terrorism".  Protests paralysed Hong Kong for most of last year, prompting Beijing to impose a new national security law in the territory in May, only two weeks ahead of the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown. Aynne Kokas, senior faculty fellow with the University of Virginia's Miller Center for Public Affairs, says that both the US and China are contending with a high level of domestic instability triggered by the global coronavirus pandemic and political events.  "Now is a key moment through which China is able to leverage the lack of stability in the US, in order to more efficiently promote its own national security goals," she says.  Chinese and Hong Kong officials have also called out the US for applying "double standards" in its response to civil unrest. "You know there are riots in the United States and we see how local governments reacted," said Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam. "And then in Hong Kong, when we had similar riots, we saw what position they adopted then."  The officials' view is shared by many Chinese social media users, who dub America "the double standard nation".  Allegations of excessive use of police force during the US protests have been put under the spotlight by Chinese state media, to delegitimise Washington's position on upholding freedom and democracy. In one example, state broadcaster China Central Television reported on American journalists being pepper sprayed and a freelance photographer partially blinded by a rubber bullet while covering the protests. Georgia State University Global Communication Assistant Professor Maria Repnikova says that the scale and intensity of Chinese state media coverage on the US protests is unprecedented.  "It's powerful, because they are not making it up," Prof Repnikova says, but she points out that Chinese state media have cherry-picked the more peaceful pictures of Hong Kong police and the most violent ones from the US. China itself has been heavily criticised for cracking down on press freedom, which is rarely mentioned by the government and state media. On Weibo, many see America's freedoms and democracy as at risk, as police fired tear gas at peaceful protesters and military was deployed to quell the protests.  Ms Kokas says: "Chinese state media don't have to craft a narrative, they can just talk about the objective events that have happen in Washington DC, that undermines the very principal of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly."  The US's rhetoric about the democratic rights of Hong Kong now seems "very hollow"，she adds, "when military helicopters are flying over [Washington] DC". The increasingly outspoken Chinese diplomats have seized the chance to spotlight the US's governing failure and promote Beijing as a more responsible global leader.  Ms Kokas describes this as a continuation of the country's propaganda strategy on the Covid-19 pandemic - when America fails, China is here to help. Chinese diplomats on Twitter retweeted messages of UN and African Union officials, condemning racial discrimination and police brutality in the US. The Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying tweeted "I can't breathe", with a screencap of the US state department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus' previous criticism over Beijing's handling in Hong Kong.  But another of Hua's messages denouncing anti-black racism backfired on Twitter, as she included "all lives matter", a phrase often used to undermine the "black lives matter" movement. Meanwhile, there are reports that African residents in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou have been discriminated against and forced into quarantine during the coronavirus pandemic.  Beijing has not officially apologised for any mishandling, only stating that there were some "misunderstandings".  One Weibo user expresses "disappointment", as the person sees "some Chinese criticise others for racial discrimination, but when it comes to their own anti-black racism, they take it for granted". China is also accused of detaining hundreds of thousands of Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in high-security prison camps in its far western Xinjiang region. There's no doubt  US protests have sparked heated discussion on Weibo - the topic is one of the most popular on the site this week. Related posts have earned more than 25 billion views. Many Weibo posts "congratulate" the US for the civil unrest and push back at its support for the Hong Kong demonstrations.  One user writes: "The US government has been inflaming violence around the world, now the American people have finally woken up. The US government deserves this!"  And Beijing and its state media spread the theory that Washington was fomenting the protests in Hong Kong, calling it a "black hand" behind the unrest. As US-China relations have soured due to the Hong Kong protests, trade conflicts and the pandemic, anti-America sentiment appears to be on the rise in China. Thousands of Weibo comments describe the US protests as "karma" for Washington. But some Chinese seem genuinely saddened by the situation.  "This is trampling on human rights! Democracy in the US came to an end at this exact moment," a Weibo user commented under a video showing the CNN reporter getting arrested, receiving thousands of likes.  Many on Weibo also voice support for the civil rights movement. "Nothing much has changed after generations of fights. I hope this time will yield better results," a comment reads. Some Chinese also reflect on the weaknesses of their country. One Weibo user writes about being "envious of the freedom of expression" in the US, as anti-government protests are often forcefully cracked down in China. Some posts urge the state media to cover China's domestic police violence and injustice with the same level of dedication.   But liberal voices are often met with harsh criticism. State-affiliated yet liberal leaning newspaper Beijing News published a commentary advocating for empathy and respect for the American people, but it was quickly slammed as taking a "pro-America" stance and received tens of thousands of negative comments on Weibo.  Social media has always been an imperfect window to observe China's public opinion. Its echo chamber effect is exacerbated by the country's information censorship.  Prof Repnikova says that the relatively liberal views may become even more marginalised on Chinese social media, as cyber nationalism, a combination of bottom-up sentiments and top-down propaganda tactic, is increasingly dominant on the sites. "The more aggressive, nationalistic and vocal voices are taking over the space," she says.

Those gathered at Thursday's tribute stood in silence for eight minutes, 46 seconds, the amount of time Mr Floyd was alleged to be on the ground under the control of police in Minneapolis. Hundreds attended the service, which also heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton. It was time to stand up and say "get your knee off our necks", he said. Mr Floyd's killing, which was captured on video, has caused outrage and sparked a wave of protests in cities across the US. Meanwhile, a few blocks away, three police officers charged with aiding and abetting Mr Floyd's murder made their first appearance in court. Bail was set at $1m (£800,000) but would be lowered to $750,000 if they handed in any guns they owned and met other conditions, the judge said. Derek Chauvin, the officer who continued to kneel on Mr Floyd's neck as he pleaded that he could not breathe, has been charged with second-degree murder and is due to appear in court on Monday. The vast majority of demonstrations over the past eight days have been peaceful, but some have descended into violence and rioting, with curfews imposed in a number of cities. Addressing Thursday's memorial service, lawyer Benjamin Crump said it was "not the coronavirus pandemic that killed George Floyd". "It was that other pandemic," he said. "The pandemic of racism and discrimination." Members of Mr Floyd's family, the Reverend Jesse Jackson, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey were among several hundred people at the service at North Central University in downtown Minneapolis. Philonise Floyd, one of Mr Floyd's brothers, described how the family had been poor when he and Mr Floyd were young and had washed their clothes in the sink and dried them in the oven. "It's crazy man, all these people came to see my brother, it's amazing he touched so many hearts," he said. Reverend Al Sharpton meanwhile demanded accountability. "We won't stop," he said, referring to protests that have taken place in every US state. "We're going to keep going until we change the whole system of justice." In an emotional eulogy, he said Mr Floyd's story had echoed that of black people in America. "What happened to Floyd happens every day in this country, in education, in health services and in every area of American life. It's time for us to stand up in George's name and say: get your knee off our necks," he said. Further tributes will be held at Mr Floyd's birthplace of North Carolina on Saturday, and in his hometown of Houston on Monday. In his first video comments since Mr Floyd's death, former President Barack Obama said the demonstrations were as profound as anything he had seen in his lifetime, and called on Americans to seize the chance to deal with underlying problems in society. "Too often some of that violence has come from folks who were supposed to be serving and protecting you," Mr Obama said. "I want you to know that you matter. I want you to know that your lives matter, your dreams matter." The Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle, has also issued a personal message about Mr Floyd's death, saying his life mattered and recent events had been devastating. George Floyd, 46, was stopped by police investigating the purchase of cigarettes with counterfeit money on 25 May in Minneapolis. A video showed Mr Floyd being arrested and a white police officer continuing to kneel on his neck for several minutes even after he pleaded that he could not breathe. Protests erupted and have continued since, across many US cities and also internationally, with rallies on Wednesday in Australia, France, the Netherlands and in the UK, where thousands gathered in central London. Mr Floyd's death follows the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri; Eric Garner in New York; and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement in recent years. For many, the outrage over Mr Floyd's death also reflects years of frustration over socio-economic inequality and discrimination.  Protests over the death continued in dozens of cities on Wednesday night despite widespread curfews.  They have been largely peaceful, with cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago relaxing their restrictions amid hopes that the worst of the violence had passed. A post-mortem examination has revealed that Mr Floyd had the coronavirus in early April. But officials stressed that this played no role in his death.

George Floyd, 46, was arrested in the city of Minneapolis on 25 May for allegedly using counterfeit money to buy a pack of cigarettes. He died after a white police officer kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes, while he pleaded that he could not breathe. The officer, Derek Chauvin, 44, has been dismissed from the police department and charged with murder. Three other officers who were on the scene were also sacked and later charged with abetting the crime.  Unrest has broken out across the country. Police have used tear gas and force against demonstrators and President Donald Trump has threatened to send in the military. Here, we look at some of the context that will help you understand the fuller picture of what is happening. There are numerous recent examples of African-American people being killed by law enforcement officers in the US. High-profile cases from recent years include Philando Castile, Terence Crutcher, Michael Brown and Alton Sterling. In these cases the officers involved were not convicted of any criminal offence. "I'm tired of hearing about black people dying," one protester in Washington DC said. "I'm tired of being afraid just by being stopped by the cops." In particular, the George Floyd case has drawn comparisons with the death of Eric Garner in July 2014. Garner, a 43-year-old father of six, was arrested in New York on suspicion of illegally selling loose cigarettes. In a video recorded by a bystander, white police officer Daniel Pantaleo can be seen with his arm wrapped around Garner's neck in a chokehold. Garner, an asthmatic, was heard repeatedly saying "I can't breathe" before appearing to lose consciousness. He was later pronounced dead in hospital. A state grand jury declined to charge the officer with murder. The case sparked nationwide protests, but the officer never faced any criminal charges and lost his job in 2019 - five years after Garner's death.

Hundreds attended the service, which heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton. In the case of George Floyd, the speed with which the officers involved were fired, and with which Derek Chauvin was arrested and charged, was unusual. Former US President Barack Obama said the protests over Floyd's death represented a "genuine and legitimate frustration over a decades-long failure to reform police practices and the broader criminal justice system." Data collated by the BBC's Reality Check team highlights how the experience of African Americans differs from white Americans when it comes to law and order. In 2019, African Americans made up less than 14% of the population but accounted for more than 23% of the just over 1,000 fatal shootings by the police. African Americans are arrested for drug abuse at a much higher rate than white Americans even though surveys show drug use at similar levels for both groups. In 2018, African Americans represented almost a third of the country's prison population.  This means there are more than 1,000 African-American inmates in federal or state prisons for every 100,000 African Americans, while there are about 200 white inmates for every 100,000 white Americans. Data from Minneapolis, where Floyd lived, also reflect these law enforcement trends. George Floyd's death did not happen in a vacuum. It came on the heels of several other high-profile incidents just in the past few weeks that have provoked debates about racism in the country. On the same day as his death, a video went viral of a white woman in New York's Central Park calling the police after a black man asked her to put her dog on a lead. An exchange between the two started because Christian Cooper, a bird watcher, was concerned that the dog could endanger wildlife. He filmed Amy Cooper (no relation) threatening to call the police and tell them "there's an African-American man threatening my life". After calling the emergency operator she repeated, "He's African American," before pleading for them to send an officer. Ms Cooper was fired from her job and widely condemned. In a later interview with NBC News, Mr Cooper raised the recent high-profile shooting of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old black man who was out jogging when he was killed by two white men in February. A third man filmed the shooting. The case gained widespread attention in the national media and provoked outrage. It took more than two months for the suspects to be charged.  "We live in an age of Ahmaud Arbery, where black men are gunned down because of assumptions people make about black men, black people, and I'm just not going to participate in that," Mr Cooper said. Racial divisions in US society are also prevalent in areas such as housing, healthcare and employment. In 2016, the typical net worth of a white family was found to be nearly 10 times greater than that of a black family. Compared with white Americans, African Americans are almost twice as likely not to have medical insurance. African Americans are more likely to work in service industry jobs and to live in densely populated areas. These issues have all contributed to African Americans being disproportionately affected by the coronavirus outbreak, which is happening at the same time as the Floyd protests. George Floyd's autopsy concluded he had coronavirus, although this played no part in his death. According to the most recent government data more than 34% of those in hospital with coronavirus are black, out of 19,775 cases where race and ethnicity data were available. New York City has reported that rates of Covid-19 deaths are substantially higher among African Americans than white Americans. Rates of unemployment during the pandemic, as before, are also higher among African Americans than white Americans. George Floyd lost his job as a bouncer as a result of the coronavirus shutdown. "The coronavirus does not discriminate, but our housing, economic, and health care policies do," said Andre Perry, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of Know Your Price: Valuing Black Lives and Property in America's Black Cities.  "Environmental racism, unaffordable housing, a lack of job opportunities, poverty, and inadequate health care are underlying social conditions, strongly influenced by policy, which place black people and their neighbourhoods at risk." Such socio-economic inequality also exists in Minneapolis - the city where Floyd died and where the protests began. Minneapolis has a population of about 430,000 people, less than 20% of whom are black.  Even before layoffs caused by the pandemic, 10% of black residents of the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St Paul were unemployed compared with 4% of whites.  In 2016, 32% of black people living there fell below the poverty line compared with 6.5% of whites. Neighbourhoods there are highly segregated and black home ownership is among the lowest in the country. "The same attitudes that led a cop to kneel in the back of a black man's neck, choking him out are the same attitudes held by people in housing markets who facilitate the region's black-white homeownership gap of 46% to 79%," said Mr Perry. Donald Trump's presidency began with massive, nationwide protests. Now, it could be ending with them. The women's marches of January 2017 brought hundreds of thousands to US streets for largely peaceful demonstrations. Following George Floyd's death, the protests in the nation's capital, and across the country, have at times turned violent. And while the 2017 events were in direct reaction to Trump's inauguration, the purpose of latest uprising - addressing racial injustice and policing practices - are not specifically about the president. The president has taken the demonstrations personally, however. Like the women's marches, his actions suggest he views the Floyd marches as an attempt to undermine his presidency. The first set the stage for his administration, and these latest come just five months before he hopes to be re-elected to a second four-year term. The politics of the situation has clearly influenced the tenor of his response. He echoed a pledge to restore "law and order" that Richard Nixon used successfully in his 1968 and 1972 presidential victories. Trump's controversial decision to clear protesters and stand for photographs with a Bible in front of a church near the White House hints at a desire to court the evangelical voters he needs in November. Although the root causes of the Floyd protests predate the Trump presidency, the president - by his words and actions, intentional or not - have added fuel the storm.  The protests over George Floyd's death have drawn attention to the use of military equipment by police officers. While images of military vehicles being used for crowd control may appear shocking to some, it is not a new phenomenon in the US. The Department of Defense began a programme in the 1990s allowing the transfer of excess military equipment to police departments. Preference is meant to be given to anti-drug and counter-terror needs. Today more than 8,000 federal and state law enforcement agencies participate in the programme. It is overseen by the Defense Logistics Agency, which has the final authority over the type and quantity of equipment made available to different agencies. It does not specify how such equipment should be used. Data show that surplus military equipment transferred to local law enforcement agencies under the 1033 programme has been rising since the mid-2000s, with spikes after 2010.  As of 2015, more than $5bn worth of military equipment had been distributed to law enforcement agencies under the programme. Paul Poast, a political science professor at the University of Chicago, said prior to the mid-2000s much US military equipment was "simply not as usable for law enforcement". "With the start of counter-insurgency fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, manufacturers began to develop weapons that one could say had more 'dual-use': be usable in urban counter-insurgency environments and usable by urban law enforcement. "The surge starting in the 2010s can be explained by both the popularity of the equipment and the beginning of drawing down troops in Iraq. With less need for such equipment in Iraq, the equipment needed to go somewhere," he said. Former President Barack Obama barred the military from handing over some types of equipment after criticism that police were too heavy-handed in dealing with protests in Ferguson, Missouri, that followed the killing of an unarmed black teenager by a white police officer in 2014. But Mr Trump lifted the restrictions in 2017. Equipment given out under the programme includes aircraft, armoured vehicles and bullet-proof helmets. Mr Poast said the use of military equipment by police was a key example of how large-scale counter-insurgency campaigns abroad can influence domestic security policy.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window An influential article that found hydroxychloroquine increases the risk of death in coronavirus patients has been retracted over data concerns. Three of the study's authors said they could not longer vouch for its veracity because Surgisphere, a healthcare firm behind the data, would not allow an independent review of its dataset. Its findings led the WHO to suspend its testing on the anti-malaria drug. But leaders including US President Donald Trump continue to tout its use. Surgisphere chief executive Sapan Desai, the study's fourth author, told The Guardian newspaper he would co-operate with an independent audit but said transferring the data would "violate client agreements and confidentiality requirements". Research for the article, published last month in medical journal The Lancet, involved 96,000 coronavirus patients across 671 hospitals worldwide. Nearly 15,000 were given hydroxychloroquine - or a related form, chloroquine - either alone or with an antibiotic. It concluded that the drug showed no benefits against coronavirus and increased the risk patients developing irregular heart rhythms and dying. Mandeep Mehra, a Harvard University professor who led the study, together with Frank Ruschitzka of the University Hospital Zurich and Amit Patel of the University of Utah, said in a statement that they had tried to arrange for a third-party peer review of the data, but Surgisphere had refused to co-operate. "We deeply apologize to you, the editors, and the journal readership for any embarrassment or inconvenience that this may have caused," the group added. There is concern in the scientific community about using such drugs to treat coronavirus. Hydroxychloroquine is safe for treating malaria, and conditions like lupus or arthritis, but so far no clinical trials have recommended it for use against Covid-19. Results from one clinical trial at the University of Minnesota have shown that hydroxychloroquine is not effective at preventing coronavirus. The WHO said on 3 June that it would resume its trials after halting them last month. Other studies are also taking place in several countries including the UK, US and Senegal.  In March, the US Food and Drug Administration granted an "emergency use" authorisation for its use on a limited number of hospitalised cases. But the following month, it issued a warning about its use because of reports of heart problems in some patients. Despite concerns for its safety and efficacy, US President Donald Trump revealed in May that he was taking hydroxychloroquine as a preventative measure against Covid-19, but later said he'd stopped.   Mr Trump has repeatedly referred to its potential. At a press conference in April, he said: "What do you have to lose? Take it." Following Mr Trump's comments, there was a sharp increase reported in prescriptions in the US for both hydroxychloroquine and the related drug, chloroquine. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has also claimed in a video that "hydroxychloroquine is working in all places."  This was removed by Facebook for breaching its misinformation guidelines.

An investigator said Travis McMichael used the epithet and an expletive as Mr Arbery lay on the ground. Mr Arbery was jogging when he was chased down by Mr McMichael and his father in Brunswick in February. A judge has ruled there is enough evidence to try the pair and another suspect on murder charges. The case caused widespread outrage after footage was leaked online. Travis and Gregory McMichael - a former police officer - are facing murder charges. Another man, William Bryan, faces charges of murder and criminal attempt to commit false imprisonment. They deny the charges. Magistrate Court Judge Wallace Harrell issued the decision at the end of Thursday's hearing, after prosecutors presented testimony and evidence, meaning the case will move forward. Protesters gathered outside the Glynn County court where the preliminary hearing was held.  Huge protests have been taking place across the US following the death of another unarmed black man, George Floyd, in police custody last month. Special Agent Richard Dial of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation told the court that co-defendant William Bryan heard Travis McMichael use the slur after shooting Mr Arbery. "Mr Bryan said that after the shooting took place before police arrival, while Mr Arbery was on the ground, that he heard Travis McMichael make the statement," Agent Dial said. Agent Dial said Mr McMichael had used the same slur many times on social media. Investigators had also found racially derogatory texts on Mr Bryan's phone, he said. He described how the McMichaels and Mr Bryan chased Mr Arbery in pick-up trucks as he jogged in their neighbourhood. He said Mr Arbery repeatedly tried to escape and Travis McMichael shot him three times. Asked by Travis McMichael's lawyer whether Mr McMichael could have acted in self-defence, he said it was Mr Arbery who had been defending himself. "I believe Mr Arbery's decision was to just try to get away and when he felt like he could not escape, he chose to fight," he said. In the moments before the fatal confrontation, the McMichaels, who are white, armed themselves with a pistol and shotgun and pursued Mr Arbery in a pickup truck in the Satilla Shores neighbourhood. Gregory McMichael told police he believed that Mr Arbery resembled the suspect in a series of local break-ins. Mr Bryan's 36-second video leaked online on 5 May, generating a nationwide outcry that was swiftly followed by murder charges. It was filmed by Mr Bryan from his vehicle while he was driving behind Mr Arbery. The clip appears to show Mr Arbery running down a tree-lined street as the McMichaels wait ahead for him in their vehicle. A tussle follows between the younger McMichael and Mr Arbery, who falls to the ground. The three defendants were not charged until more than two months after Mr Arbery was killed. State police began investigating after footage of the incident circulated. No action had been taken by Glynn County police. Charges were then filed by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window A US Navy veteran is returning home after being freed from detention in Iran. Michael White was sentenced to prison last year on unspecified charges, but was released temporarily on medical grounds to the Swiss embassy in March. He was arrested in 2018 after travelling to meet his girlfriend in the Iranian city of Mashhad. His release came on the day that Iran's foreign minister announced the return from the US of an Iranian doctor. US officials have yet to confirm the release of Majid Taheri, but a third man - an Iranian scientist detained in the US - was deported to Iran earlier this week. Sirous Asgari, a materials science professor from Tehran, had been charged in 2016 with trying to trade secret research from an American university, but was acquitted in November.  The releases appear to be a rare example of co-operation between Iran and the US - although Washington has denied so far that it was a straight prisoner swap. US President Donald Trump confirmed on Thursday that Mr White had been freed and the Swiss plane he was travelling on had left Iranian airspace. "I will never stop working to secure the release of all Americans held hostage overseas," he said. I just got off the phone with former American hostage Michael White, who is now in Zurich after being released from Iran. He will be on a U.S. plane shortly, and is COMING HOME... End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrump "For the past 683 days my son, Michael, has been held hostage in Iran by the IRGC [Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps] and I have been living a nightmare," Mr White's mother said in a statement. "I am blessed to announce that the nightmare is over, and my son is safely on his way home." Both Mr White's family and President Trump thanked Switzerland for its help. The 48-year-old was one of at least six US citizens either imprisoned in Iran or out on bail. He was granted medical furlough to the Swiss embassy in March amid the release of large numbers of prisoners due to the spread of coronavirus in Iran. His family said he had visited the country a number of times before he was detained.  "We look forward to reuniting him with his family," US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday.  "[We] will not rest until we bring every American detained in Iran and around the world back home to their loved ones," he added. In December, the US and Iran conducted a prisoner swap in a rare sign of co-operation. Chinese-American researcher Xiyue Wang and Iranian scientist Massoud Soleimani were freed. Relations between the two countries have been increasingly hostile since the US abandoned the Iran nuclear deal in 2018.  But tensions escalated further this year when the US assassinated top Iranian commander Gen Qasem Soleimani in a drone strike in Iraq in January. Iran retaliated by launching ballistic missiles at Iraqi military bases hosting US forces.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window YouTuber Jake Paul has been charged with criminal trespass and unlawful assembly during unrest at a mall in Arizona. The 23 year old has denied any involvement in looting or vandalism at the mall in Scottsdale on Sunday. Local police said they had received hundreds of tips about his presence. At least 20 people have been arrested in the incident, part of widespread unrest across US cities in the wake of the death of George Floyd. Since the unarmed African-American died in police custody in Minneapolis last month, more than 10,000 people have been arrested in US unrest, according to a tally compiled by the Associated Press. Violence at the Scottsdale mall was estimated to have cost millions of dollars in damages and theft. Police say they have since recovered thousands of dollars in stolen property. In a statement on Thursday, the Scottsdale Police Department said that, as part of its investigations, "it was confirmed that Jake Paul was in attendance and remained inside after an unlawful assembly was declared". We've received 100s of tips in response to the events at @ScottsdaleFS. In our continued investigation it was confirmed that Jake Paul was in attendance & remained inside after an unlawful assembly was declared & has been charged with Criminal Trespass & Unlawful Assembly. pic.twitter.com/ySPmZT7ADv End of Twitter post  by @ScottsdalePD Jake Paul tweeted on Thursday: "Gimme my charges and let's put the focus back on George Floyd and Black Lives Matter." The YouTube star, who also has 3.7 million followers on Twitter, had earlier issued a statement on social media after photos and videos were posted online purporting to show him taking part in the violence. "Neither I nor anyone in our group was involved in any looting or vandalism," Jake Paul said. "We filmed everything we saw in an effort to share our experience and bring more attention to the anger felt in every neighbourhood we travelled through." Jake Paul is among the world's most high-profile YouTube stars. Forbes reported that his earnings in 2018 amounted to $21.5m (£16.8m), with videos of his rap songs and pranks gaining over 3.5 billion views in the space of a year. His elder brother Logan Paul - also a famous YouTuber - is no stranger to controversy either.  In 2018, YouTube cut some business ties with Logan Paul after he posted a video showing the body of an apparent suicide victim in Japan. Salford Red Devils have signed hooker Andy Ackers from fellow Super League side Toronto Wolfpack. The 26-year-old has signed a deal to keep him with the 2019 Grand Finalists until the end of the 2022 season. Former Swinton Lions and London Broncos player Ackers joined the Wolfpack in 2018, helping them win promotion to Super League in October. "I've been keeping myself at top fitness for when this season gets back under way," Ackers said. "I've spoken to [head coach] Ian Watson and [coaching consultant] Paul Rowley and they've said my game's going to fit in really well here." Ackers' signing comes after captain Lee Mossop and forward Luke Yates both signed contract extensions with the Red Devils last month.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Facebook has removed a number of Justice for George Floyd groups for exhibiting "inauthentic behaviour".  BBC News had highlighted some suspicious groups had switched their focus to call for justice for the black man killed in police custody. Some, run by accounts seemingly based in Vietnam or Bangladesh, had posted misleading images. And others had previously focused on coronavirus, 5G conspiracies and support for US President Donald Trump.  A Facebook spokesman said it had "removed the vast majority of them, for violating our policies". There has been a surge in membership for Facebook groups supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, following the protests sparked by Mr Floyd's death, on 25 May. But for some it is unclear what the motives of their administrators are. In some cases, they could be exploiting the movement to gain followers and/or stoke tensions. Some of the profiles based outside the US had frequently posted inflammatory images and videos before Facebook intervened. One group, Justice for George Floyd, had almost 2,000 members.  Set up in March, it originally focused on the coronavirus but later that month switched to "US breaking news", featuring stories sympathetic to the US president, before turning to Black Lives Matter. In its final incarnation, two administrators - identified as in Vietnam - had repeatedly shared posts critical of the protesters, including images of battered police cars that predate the current protests. Another group, Justice For George Floyd & Latest Updates, was run by a profile claiming to be based in Bangladesh. The administrator's profile photos had all been copied from other websites and included images of celebrities and animals. And it used highly emotive language in contradictory posts that supported both the police and the protesters. Others included: This would not be the first time Black Lives Matter groups have been hijacked. Investigations into foreign interference during the 2016 US presidential election accused Russia of being behind a misinformation campaign that had taken advantage of the movement. However, no evidence has been presented to indicate Moscow is involved this time.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Virginia's Governor Ralph Northam has announced that a statue of Confederate General Robert E Lee will be removed from the state capital.  The controversial statue will be put into storage "as soon as possible", the governor said. The monument has been vandalised during recent protests over the killing of African American George Floyd. Memorials to the Confederacy, which fought to keep black people as slaves, have long stirred controversy. At a news conference, a round of applause erupted when Governor Northam said the 12-ton statue would be removed. "In Virginia, we no longer preach a false version of history," the governor said. "In 2020, we can no longer honour a system that was based on enslaving people. That statue has been there a long time. But it was wrong then, and it's wrong now. So we're taking it down." Referencing Gen Lee's own words, Governor Northam said "I think it wise not to keep open the sores of war". The Robert E Lee statue is the largest of five Confederate statues along Richmond's Monument Avenue. They have been rallying points during protests in Virginia in recent days, and have been tagged with graffiti, including messages that say "end police brutality" and "stop white supremacy". "They are extremely heavy and would crush anyone standing too close. Please be aware of the danger. Stand down!" the Richmond Police Department tweeted on Monday. Hundreds of statues of Lee, General Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson and other famous figures of the Confederacy - the southern states that revolted against the federal government - exist in the US. Some see the memorials, as well as Confederate flags, as markers of US history and southern culture. But to others they serve as an offensive reminder of the country's history of slavery and racial oppression. Rev Robert W Lee IV, great-great-grandson of the Confederate general, gave his blessing for the monument to be removed at Thursday's news conference. He said the world was watching Virginia and the US as protests over the death of Mr Floyd convulsed the country, asking: "If today is not the right time, when will it be the right time [to remove the statue]?" The debate around Confederate symbols received renewed attention after the protests in Charlottesville in 2017, triggered by the city council's decision to remove a statue of Lee. The resulting rally caused the deaths of a counter-protester and two state troopers died in a helicopter crash as they monitored the event. An independent inquiry into a racist photo on Democrat Ralph Northam's 1984 college yearbook page ended in 2019 with no conclusive findings. The report could not determine the identities of two individuals, one in blackface, the other in Ku Klux Klan robes, in the image.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window A federal grand jury in Colorado has charged four executives from two US poultry companies with conspiracy for chicken price-fixing. The leaders of the Pilgrim's Pride and Claxton Poultry companies were indicted on Wednesday for a years-long plot to rig bids and elevate costs. Prosecutors say they worked to raise prices for chicken sold to restaurants and stores from at least 2012 to 2017. The chiefs face up to 10 years in prison and a $1m (£798,0000) fine. The case stems from a Justice department antitrust investigation into anticompetitive conduct in the poultry industry. Pilgrim's CEO Jayson Penn and former vice-president Roger Austin, along with Claxton president Mikell Fries and vice-president Scott Brady are now the first to be charged in the agency's price fixing investigation. Pilgrim's Pride is one of the largest chicken producers in the US, taking in more than 17% of the American consumer poultry market. The companies have not yet answered BBC's request for comment. "Particularly in times of global crisis, the division remains committed to prosecuting crimes intended to raise the prices Americans pay for food," said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim of the Justice department's antitrust division. "Executives who cheat American consumers, restaurateurs, and grocers, and compromise the integrity of our food supply, will be held responsible for their actions." The $1m fine the businessmen face may be increased based on the gains seen from the crime or the losses suffered by the victims. The indictment also suggests there may be other individuals involved. The $28bn US broiler chicken industry - chickens raised for meat - has faced price inflation accusations before. In 2016, Pilgrim's, along with other major companies like Tyson Foods and Perdue Farms, were sued by restaurants and buyers.  The poultry producing companies said prices rose due to supply and demand factors. Rival poultry producers Tyson Foods and Sanderson Farms are also part of the Justice department investigation. Both have denied the allegations of wrongdoing.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Hundreds of people are expected to attend a memorial in Minneapolis for African American George Floyd, who died in police custody last month. The death of Floyd, whose neck was pinned under a white officer's knee, has sparked huge protests over racism and police killings of black Americans. The tribute comes despite fears over coronavirus at large gatherings. New charges were announced on Wednesday against all four of the now sacked officers present at Floyd's death. The charge against Derek Chauvin has been elevated to second-degree murder while the other three officers, previously uncharged, face counts of aiding and abetting murder. The vast majority of demonstrations over the past eight days have been peaceful, but some have turned violent and curfews have been imposed in a number of cities. Former President Barack Obama and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, are among senior public figures who have offered their support to the protesters. They were joined on Wednesday by former Defence Secretary James Mattis, who also attacked his former boss President Donald Trump, saying that he stoked division and had abused his authority in his reaction to the protests. The event, in the northern city of Minneapolis where Floyd died, is the first of several to honour him. It will take place at a sanctuary at the city's North Central University. Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for the Floyd family, said it was more than just honouring the dead man's memory. "It's going to be a celebration of life, but it's also going to be a plea to America and a plea for justice that we don't let his death be in vain," he told NBC's Today show. Veteran civil rights campaigner, Rev Al Sharpton, will deliver the eulogy for the two-hour service, which will start at 13:00 local time (18:00 GMT). "Out of all the years that I've been marching and protesting and doing eulogies and speeches, I'm more hopeful going to this service than I have been in a long time," Rev Sharpton said on MSNBC's Morning Joe programme.  "Because I see more Americans of different races and different ages standing up together, marching together, raising their voices together... That makes me know we're on the brink of real change." Rev Sharpton, who met Floyd's family on Wednesday, said he would announce the launch of a new social movement at the memorial, as well as call for new federal legislation to end racial discrimination by police. Further tributes will be held at Floyd's birthplace in North Carolina on Saturday, and in his home town of Houston on Monday. Mr Obama said it was vital to channel the momentum built up in the recent protests to bring about change. In his first video comments since Floyd's death, he said the demonstrations were as profound as anything he had seen in his lifetime, and called on Americans to seize the chance to deal with the underlying problems in society. "Too often some of that violence has come from folks who were supposed to be serving and protecting you," Mr Obama said. "I want you to know that you matter. I want you to know that your lives matter, your dreams matter. "There is a change in mindset that's taking place, a greater recognition that we can do better," he added. Mr Obama did not comment directly on Mr Trump's handling of the unrest, although he urged mayors around the country to review their use-of-force policies. The Duchess of Sussex has also issued a personal message about Floyd's death, saying his life mattered and recent events had been devastating. George Floyd, 46, was stopped by police investigating the purchase of cigarettes with counterfeit money on 25 May in Minneapolis. A video showed Floyd being arrested and a white police officer continuing to kneel on his neck for several minutes even after he pleaded that he could not breathe. Protests erupted and have continued since, across many US cities and also internationally, with rallies on Wednesday in Australia, France, the Netherlands and in the UK, where thousands gathered in central London. Floyd's death follows the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri; Eric Garner in New York; and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement in recent years. For many, the outrage over Floyd's death also reflects years of frustration over socio-economic inequality and discrimination.  Protests over the death continued in dozens of cities on Wednesday night despite widespread curfews.  They have been largely peaceful, with cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago relaxing their restrictions amid hopes that the worst of the violence had passed. A post-mortem examination has revealed that Floyd had the coronavirus in early April. But officials stressed that this played no role in his death.

The move - which effectively accuses the leader of lying - refers to a tweet by Donald Trump about his first defence secretary. Mr Trump had tweeted that he had given James Mattis the nickname "Mad Dog" and later fired him. But Twitter's article says that the former general resigned, and his nickname preceded Trump's presidency. It follows last week's explosive confrontation, which saw Twitter fact-check two of President Trump's tweets and label another as glorifying violence. The latest confrontation was prompted by a strongly-worded statement issued by General Mattis last night, in which he criticised the president's handling of the protests that followed the killing of George Floyd. Gen Mattis described Donald Trump as "the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people - does not even pretend to try. Instead, he tries to divide us." The president fired back quickly in a tweet saying that the one thing he and predecessor Barack Obama had in common was "we both had the honour of firing Jim Mattis, the world's most overrated general. I asked for his letter of resignation and felt good about it". "His nickname was 'Chaos', which I didn't like, and changed it to 'Mad Dog'," he added. Twitter later published what it calls a Moment, a summary of a news story that you can see when you press the platform's search button. It has also been promoted within the What's Happening box that appears on Twitter's website. The article says that "Mattis resigned from the position... after the administration decided to withdraw US troops from Syria", and attributes the fact to a report by the Associated Press news agency. It then refers to journalists at CNN, the National Review, the Washington Post and The Dispatch as having written that the nickname 'Mad Dog' had been used before Trump's presidency, with published references dating back to 2004. Moments are curated by an internal team at Twitter. They provide a summary of a recent development before presenting some related tweets. This is not the first time the tool has been used to call out Donald Trump. In March 2019, it said the president had misidentified a co-founder of Greenpeace, and in April 2020 it said he had falsely claimed he could force states to reopen during the Covid-19 pandemic. But what is interesting here is that Twitter has chosen to raise the temperature of its clash with the president over what could be seen as a relatively minor issue.  It was on 20 December 2018 that Gen Mattis announced his resignation, effective from 28 February 2019.  A furious Mr Trump then announced his defence secretary was going from 1 January and stated he'd essentially fired him. So you could at least argue that, as in many cases, there is a blurry line between a resignation and a firing. Perhaps Twitter's chief executive Jack Dorsey is looking on, with a degree of schadenfreude, at what has happened in recent days at Facebook.  There, Mark Zuckerberg's determination not to follow Twitter's lead and take some kind of action over the president's posts has sparked open revolt. Facebook staff, who previously would only grumble anonymously about the company's practices, have put their names to statements deploring Mr Zuckerberg's failure to act.  This morning, nearly three dozen former employees, including some who had helped write the original guidelines on what can and cannot be posted, published an open letter accusing Mr Zuckerberg of a "betrayal" of Facebook's ideals. Last week, it felt as though Twitter might be putting its future in danger by taking on the president.  This week, it feels as though Mr Zuckerberg's failure to act might leave him facing an even bigger crisis than the Cambridge Analytica scandal.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window The will of Carole Baskin's husband was "100% a forgery", according to the Sheriff investigating his disappearance. Don Lewis went missing in Florida in 1997. Carole was left with millions of dollars.  The case is back in the public eye after featuring in the Netflix documentary Tiger King. She's never faced any criminal charges over his disappearance and has strongly and repeatedly denied being involved. Just a warning, there are spoilers coming up. If you've not seen it, Tiger King tells the story of zoo owner Joe Exotic and his heated and bitter rivalry with Carole Baskin, who's trying to get his zoo shut down. Things escalate pretty wildly - and Joe is currently in prison for trying to have Carole killed. But the show also explores the disappearance of Carole's second husband, who was last seen over 20 years ago. Joe Exotic has repeatedly and very publically accused Carole of murdering Don Lewis to get his money - something she denies. He even made a country music video called Here Kitty Kitty where a character, made to look like Carole, is seen seemingly feeding her husband to tigers.

"They had two experts deem it 100% a forgery," Chad Chronister explains. He adds that, since so much time has passed, they're not able to take any legal action over the will - but says the investigation into Don Lewis' disappearance is very much still open.

On Tuesday a judge ruled Joe Exotic's zoo should be handed over to Carole Baskin as part of a ruling in a $1m (£800,000) trademark dispute. In blog posts since Tiger King aired, Carole has called the idea that Don was a millionaire when she met him "a lie" - and claimed that the money she inherited was from joint business ventures.

Mr Trump said he would send in the military if cities and states failed to solve the problem themselves. However, Defence Secretary Mark Esper has said he does not support the use of active troops in the current situation.  Some state governors have questioned if the federal government has the authority to send in troops without their permission.  In short, yes he can under certain circumstances. There are already thousands of troops deployed from the National Guard, which is a reserve force for the US Army. They're in more than 20 states across the US trying to quell protests because they have been asked for by the cities or states themselves. However, a US law passed in the 19th Century lays out circumstances when the government in Washington DC can intervene without state authorisation. The Insurrection Act says the approval of governors isn't required when the president determines the situation in a state makes it impossible to enforce US laws, or when citizens' rights are threatened. The law was passed in 1807 to allow the president to call out a militia to protect against "hostile incursions of the Indians" - and it was subsequently extended to allow for the use of the US military in domestic disturbances and to protect civil rights. Another law passed in 1878 requires congressional authorisation for domestic military use, but a legal expert told the BBC that the Insurrection Act was sufficient legal authority on its own for the president to deploy the army. It is widely accepted that the president would have legal grounds to employ the military without asking for approval from the states in the current circumstances. "The key point", says Robert Chesney, a University of Texas law professor, "is that it is the president's determination to make; the governors do not have to request his help." However, Mr Trump's suggestion that he might use the Insurrection Act to quell the current unrest has been questioned by his own defence secretary. Mark Esper said: "The option to use active duty forces in a law enforcement role should only be used as a matter of last resort, and only in the most urgent and dire of situations," he said. "We are not in one of those situations now," he said. According to the Congressional Research Service, the Insurrection Act has been used dozens of times in the past, although not for almost three decades. It was last invoked in 1992 by former US President George HW Bush during riots in Los Angeles, after the governor of California requested federal help.  The law was used throughout the 1950s and 60s during the civil rights era by three different presidents, including when there were objections from state governors. President Dwight Eisenhower faced objections when he used the law in 1957 to send US troops to Arkansas to control a protest at a school, where black and white children were being taught together. Since the end of the 1960s, the use of the law has been rare. Congress amended it in 2006 following Hurricane Katrina in an attempt to make military assistance more effective, but the amendment was repealed after state governors objected to it.

Addressing students graduating from her former school in Los Angeles, Meghan said the events had been "devastating". She also recalled living through race riots in 1992 and spoke of her regret that nothing appeared to have changed. In her video message, Meghan called on young people and students at the school to come together to rebuild society. A wave of anti-racism protests have been triggered by the death of African-American Mr Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis on 25 May. Four officers have been charged in relation to his death. Anger has since spread to other parts of the world, including the UK, where thousands of people joined a protest in London on Wednesday organised by campaign group Black Lives Matter. The sister of black teenager Anthony Walker, who was murdered by two men in a racially-motivated attack in Merseyside in 2005, called for an "ongoing revolution" following the demonstrations - to break down institutional racism in society. Dominique Walker, vice chair of the Anthony Walker Foundation set up after her brother's murder, told BBC Breakfast that police reform in the UK "has to be taken further".  "There has to be that definitive work that works to break down institutional racism," she said. In the video of her virtual address to Immaculate Heart High School, the duchess said she was "nervous" about addressing graduates and speaking about events of the previous weeks. But she said that she "realised the only wrong thing to say is nothing because George Floyd's life mattered", before referring to other African-Americans who died in police shootings in the US in recent years. In the video, which was first reported by the African-American female magazine Essence, Meghan also gave a heartfelt apology to the graduating students "that we have not gotten the world to the place that you deserve it to be". She told the all-girls school: "I wasn't sure what I could say to you. I wanted to say the right thing and I was really nervous that I wouldn't or it would get picked apart, and I realised the only wrong thing to say is to say nothing - because George Floyd's life mattered and Breonna Taylor's life mattered and Philando Castile's life mattered and Tamir Rice's life mattered. "And so did so many other people whose names we know and whose names we do not know." She then shared her memories of living in the city through race riots in 1992, after police officers were filmed violently beating Rodney King. The duchess said: "I was 11 or 12 years old and it was the LA riots, which was also triggered by a senseless act of racism. "I remember the curfew and I remember rushing back home, and on that drive home, seeing ash fall from the sky, and smelling the smoke and seeing the smoke billow out of buildings. "I remember seeing men in the back of a van just holding guns and rifles. "I remember pulling up the house and seeing the tree, that had always been there, completely charred. And those memories don't go away." Meghan said she could not imagine that the students "would have to have a different version of that same type of experience".  "That's something you should have an understanding of, but an understanding... as a history lesson not as your reality," she said. "So I'm sorry that in a way we have not gotten the world to the place that you deserve it to be." She went on to highlight that people are "standing in solidarity" despite the unrest, and appealed to young people to "be part of this movement".  The duchess said: "I know that this is not the graduation that you envisioned [...] but I also know that there is a way to reframe this for you, and to not see this as the end of something. "But instead to see this as the beginning of you harnessing all of the work, all of the values, all of the skills that you have embodied over the last four years. "Now all of that work gets activated, now you get to be part of rebuilding." She added: "We are going to rebuild and rebuild and rebuild until it is rebuilt, because when the foundation is broken, so are we." In the US, protests began in Minneapolis where Mr Floyd died, and quickly spread across the country. Demonstrations have taken place in areas including New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Washington DC, South Carolina and Houston. Some have included clashes between police and protesters, including the use of tear gas and rubber bullets by officers. US president Donald Trump has pressed state governors to take a more forceful approach against protesters. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are now living in Los Angeles with their one-year-old son Archie, after stepping back as working members of the Royal Family.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Ex-US Defence Secretary James Mattis has denounced President Donald Trump, saying he deliberately stokes division. He said he was "angry and appalled" by Mr Trump's handling of ongoing protests over the death of African American George Floyd at the hands of police. Mr Mattis berated Mr Trump's "abuse of authority" - and backed protesters seeking to uphold American values, as did ex-President Barack Obama.  Mr Trump has described Mr Mattis repeatedly as an "overrated general". Mr Mattis quit in 2018 after Mr Trump decided to pull US troops out of Syria. He has remained mostly silent since then, until his rebuke of the Trump administration was published in The Atlantic magazine on Wednesday. In response to the fresh criticism, Mr Trump posted a series of tweets in which he claimed to have fired Mr Mattis. "I didn't like his "leadership" style or much else about him, and many others agree," he wrote. "Glad he is gone!" Probably the only thing Barack Obama & I have in common is that we both had the honor of firing Jim Mattis, the world’s most overrated General. I asked for his letter of resignation, & felt great about it. His nickname was “Chaos”, which I didn’t like, & changed to “Mad Dog”... End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrump The row comes as new charges were brought against all of the sacked police officers present at Mr Floyd's death in the city of Minneapolis. The charge against Derek Chauvin has been elevated to second-degree murder while the other three officers, previously uncharged, face counts of aiding and abetting murder. The death has sparked huge protests across the US in recent days. The vast majority of demonstrations over the past nine days have been peaceful, but some have turned violent and curfews have been imposed in a number of cities. "Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people - does not even pretend to try," Mr Mattis wrote in The Atlantic. "Instead, he tries to divide us." He continued: "We are witnessing the consequences of three years of this deliberate effort. We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership." Mr Mattis also addressed the recent wave of anti-racism protests. "We must not be distracted by a small number of lawbreakers," Mr Mattis wrote. "The protests are defined by tens of thousands of people of conscience who are insisting that we live up to our values... as a nation." The retired general - whose resignation letter in December 2018 was full of implied criticism of the president's foreign policy - also condemned the use of the military in response to the protests. "Never did I dream that troops... would be ordered under any circumstance to violate the Constitutional rights of their fellow citizens," he said. "Militarising our response, as we witnessed in Washington DC, sets up a conflict... between the military and civilian society," he added. Mr Mattis was referring to an incident earlier this week when peaceful protesters were dispersed with tear gas and rubber bullets from a park close to the White House.  Mr Trump then crossed the park for a photo-op at a historic church that had been damaged by fire in the unrest. This provoked sharp criticism from top Democrats and religious leaders, who accused the president of aggressively targeting the demonstrators for the purpose of posing for photographs. In his latest comments, Mr Mattis derided the "bizarre photo-op" and said clearing the park of demonstrators beforehand was an "abuse of executive authority". Mr Trump has repeatedly questioned whether the protesters were peaceful and, in an earlier tweet, he said "people liked my walk to this historic place of worship". And in an interview with his former press secretary Sean Spicer on Wednesday, the president once again defended the church visit. He said it was "handled really well" and "religious leaders loved it". Former President Barack Obama said it was vital to channel the momentum built up in the recent protests to bring about change. In his first video comments since Mr Floyd's death, he said the demonstrations were as profound as anything he'd seen in his lifetime, and called on Americans to seize the chance to deal with the underlying problems in society. "Too often some of that violence has come from folks who were supposed to be serving and protecting you," Mr Obama said. "I want you to know that you matter. I want you to know that your lives matter, your dreams matter." "There is a change in mindset that's taking place, a greater recognition that we can do better," he added. Mr Obama did not comment directly on Mr Trump's handling of the unrest, although he urged mayors around the country to review their use-of-force policies. Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, has also issued a personal message about Mr Floyd's death, saying his life mattered and recent events had been devastating. Protests over the death continued in dozens of cities on Wednesday night despite widespread curfews.  They have been largely peaceful, with cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago relaxing their restrictions amid hopes that the worst of the violence had passed. A post-mortem examination has revealed that Floyd had the coronavirus in early April. But officials stressed that this played no role in his death.

                                 George Floyd dies after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage shows a white officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floyd’s neck for several minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Mr Floyd is heard repeatedly saying "I can’t breathe". He is pronounced dead later in hospital.

                                 Four officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd are fired. Protests begin as the video of the arrest is shared widely on social media. Hundreds of demonstrators take to the streets of Minneapolis and vandalise police cars and the police station with graffiti.

                                 Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places, like Portland, Oregon, protesters lie in the road, chanting "I can’t breathe". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floyd’s arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat.

A few minutes later several of his colleagues are also arrested. They are all later released once they are confirmed to be members of the media. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with murder and manslaughter. The charges carry a combined maximum 35-year sentence.

Despite still being physically closed, ArtsEd, the London-based acting conservatory where Elliot studies musical theatre, has powered on virtually since the start of the coronavirus lockdown.  Alongside classmates on Zoom meetings, Elliot, 21, drills voice practices and dance moves on the garden decking, and taps away in the bathroom of his parents' house in Hampshire. But will there be any work for him and his fellow students after they graduate this summer? Normally, at this time of year, acting students around the world are making their first foray into the business, performing in person for agents, casting directors and producers, hoping to sign on with a talent agency, or even pick up their first paid work. But with theatres still closed, and TV and movie filming on hold, the acting world is currently an industry on pause. "All of our work has stopped," says James Calleri, who casts Broadway and regional theatre in New York as well as film and TV. "Everything has just been cleared." Mr Calleri, who also runs the graduate acting programme at New York's Columbia University, would normally have taken graduating students on an industry tour of Los Angeles back in April. They would have performed for some of the big showbiz decision makers. But all Columbia's acting school showcases were cancelled, indefinitely. "We were going to push to September, but the problem is that theatres are so debilitated right now," Mr Calleri says. "They don't even know what their life is going to be like after lockdown." Any auditions that are still taking place have moved to home recordings or "self tapes" that are emailed off.  Back in Hampshire, Elliot has made it though five rounds of recalls for a West End show. "The good thing is you get a second chance," he says. "You can watch it back, and if you want, you can do it again." Elliot's professors are also happy to give feedback and guidance before the videos are sent out, something that would not be possible with in-person auditions.  "The [movie and TV] businesses have been moving auditions to self tapes for some time, but I think plays and musicals will head that way too, even after the virus," says Chris Hocking, the principal of ArtsEd.  "Everyone is trying to help these graduates. We have worked hard so that the students have industry contact throughout their training." What continues for Elliot is a waiting game. An actor almost never receives feedback unless they win the job.  "Especially now," he says, "because everything is extended. And many tours have had to cancel because of the lockdown. "There is every chance you might be auditioning for a show, you could get cast, and then a couple of weeks later they'll say, 'I'm really sorry, it's been cancelled.'" Elliot knows he is lucky to be getting seen. Many new graduates are not getting any industry face-time.  Racheal Owens, a teacher at Guildford School of Acting, says their graduates were due to have a final day of performance for agents and casting directors back in March. But a day before the show, the lockdown restrictions were announced, and it was cancelled.  "Some students had signed, but others had not, and would have been hoping for more opportunities, as we had two musicals left to perform,"she says.  The staff at Guildford have continued to do everything possible to get self tapes to agents. Luckily the industry in London has been receptive, in an effort to support this year's graduates, but there is very little work available. "I really feel for these students, whose introduction to the industry is so compromised," says Ms Owens. A missed in-person performance can make life especially difficult for young actors with an offbeat style, or unusual looks, that might not come across well in a short self tape, plus resumé (CV) and headshot. Such performers are more likely to win over agents and casting directors in person. But even if young actors impress, however they are able to audition, how long will it be before the industry can return to some sort of normal? James Calleri wonders how the practical experience of going to the theatre would work with social distancing.  Producers might sell out a 1,200-seat Broadway theatre, but if 600 people sit in every other seat in order to socially distance, shows will fail to recoup costs, he points out. In smaller theatres, social distancing would be impossible.  "The class of 2020 is the injured party right now," he says. "I feel like the industry knows that and hopefully will try and look out for them." More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: Alex Butler, who runs the New York boutique agency Henderson Hogan, warns his recent signings that things aren't going to get better overnight.  "I told them, 'Look, if you are in this for the long haul, come to the city, get your apartment, your day job and your classes set up. Once things go back, we can gear up.'" But it could be a long wait. Mr Butler says he would love for Broadway to reopen in September but fears curtains may not rise until next year.  Still, he thinks that sometime down the road, if young actors coming out of school this year can hold tight, there will be opportunities to audition for these shows.  "People working on Broadway might decide they are done with the business, or if they are touring, their spouses won't want them to go on the road anymore," he says.  New York casting director Alison Franck, who casts Broadway, touring and regional musical theatre shows, says that actors have always needed to be creative and resilient. Those attributes are needed now more than ever, because many will struggle to get agents straight away. "These actors have to learn how to hustle on their own," she says. "And I think the ones who figure this out may often end up being more successful in the long run." Elliot understands how hard the current situation is, but he is ready to dig in. He believes the industry will come back "stronger than ever".  Acting has been his dream for his whole life. "I'm absolutely in it for the long haul," he says.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window As protests rock the US following the death of African-American George Floyd in police custody, Kenyan journalist Larry Madowo writes about the racism he has experienced in the country. In my first week in New York City last summer, I was invited to dinner at a friend's penthouse on the wealthy Upper West Side.  I picked up some fruit for her and arrived at her building carrying a plastic bag. The front desk sent me through an open courtyard to the back of the building, past residents' garbage bags and into a surprisingly dirty lift.  When I got off upstairs, my host opened the door mortified, all the colour drained from her face.  "My racist doorman thought you're a delivery guy and made you use the service elevator," she explained as she apologised.   I have worked in the complicated racial hierarchies of South Africa and the UK and have travelled around the world, but it still stung that an American butler did not think accomplished white people like my friend and her husband could have a black dinner guest.  That early micro-aggression forewarned me that America may be the land of opportunity for many, but it would still reduce me to the colour of my skin and find me unworthy.  It did not matter that I am from a black majority African nation, people who look like me here have to negotiate for their humanity with a system that constantly alienates, erases and punishes them.  In Kenya, I may disappear into the crowd, but in America I always have a target on my back for being black. A day after investment banker Amy Cooper called the police after a Harvard-educated black man asked her to follow park rules and leash her dog, a white policeman knelt on George Floyd's neck for so long it eventually killed him.  I was heartbroken.  As protests broke out nationwide to demand justice for Floyd and the countless other black people who have been killed by police, I held my breath. How could I grieve for someone I did not know? How could I own a pain I had not lived, as an African "fresh off the boat" in America? I wondered if I would be appropriating the African-American struggle at a convenient moment. Then I saw a video shot at a protest in Long Beach, California, that was clear about allegiances.  "The best way that Africans in America can support African-Americans is to stand with us, and to understand that we're all the same," said a protester.  I asked Tom Gitaa - a publisher of Mshale newspaper, which serves African immigrants in the Midwest of the US - what he made of the protests, subsequent riots and looting that began in his city of Minneapolis.  "Many of us didn't grow up with some of these civil rights issues in Africa so sometimes our understanding is not there. "But with issues like police brutality and discrimination at the workplace, we're running into a lot of the same things African-Americans have experienced over the years," said Mr Gitaa, who moved to the US from East Africa about 30 years ago and whose American-born 24-year-old daughter has been one of the people making their voices heard on the streets.  There has always been tension between Africans and black Americans.  My friend, Karen Attiah, and I unpacked some of it in The Washington Post two years ago when the superhero film Black Panther came out.  She is the paper's Global Opinions editor, a daughter of African immigrants - born in the US, but deeply connected to her parent's home continent.  Karen told me her parents are now discussing race and white racism specifically in a way she and her siblings did not hear while growing up. "I think we were supposed to almost maintain a distance from black Americans because we were immigrants, we were different," she told me this week.  "And now we understand that if a cop sees the colour of your skin, he's not about to ask if you're from Ghana or Nigeria or Zimbabwe, or Atlanta or the south side of Dallas, they just see a black person." African celebrities like actress Lupita Nyong'o and comedian Trevor Noah are using their powerful platforms to support the agitation for justice and to call out the hypocrisy in some of the criticism of the protests. (1/2) Trevor on George Floyd, the Minneapolis protests, Ahmaud Arbery & Amy Cooper:“While everyone is facing the battle against coronavirus, black people in America are still facing the battle against racism… and coronavirus.” pic.twitter.com/eaVUdq6NzJ End of Twitter post  by @TheDailyShow The African Union (AU) even released a rare statement condemning the death of Floyd, and asking the US government to "ensure the total elimination of all forms of discrimination". The first enslaved Africans arrived in the US - in the then British colony of Virginia - 401 years ago.  Last year, some of their descendants made the journey back to Africa to mark "the Year of Return" to where their forebears were stolen from four centuries ago. One of the marquee events was the Afrochella Festival in Ghana last December, the brainchild of Abdul Karim Abdullah.  When I called, he was recovering from a long night after protests hit his home borough of The Bronx in New York City. "A lot of Africans are ignorant to the fact that this is also their fight," he said.  "Injustice to black people anywhere is injustice. We should stand up and fight together in solidarity." Africans in the US have marched alongside Black Lives Matter activists, supported protests against white supremacy, donated money to social justice causes and organized their own events to show unanimity in the black community.  Protesters with African flags or with signs in languages from the continent have also been spotted at events in different parts of the US.  "People of colour, especially black men, are the most mistreated, misvalued and misunderstood community on this planet," a tearful Jada Walker told a crowd of marchers outside the Dallas City Hall in Texas. She worried about what awaits her two-year-old nephew who has special needs when he grows up.  "How is a cop going to treat him when he stands 6ft 8in like his father, is not communicative and looks like someone they're looking for?" Because of the violent history of American policing for black and brown communities, parents are always on edge. Ifrah Udgoon, a Somalia-born high school science teacher in Columbus, Ohio, lives with that fear for her 13-year-old son.  "Each passing day brings the realisation that soon, if not already, he will go from being seen as cute to being seen as threatening. And my heart breaks for his innocence," she wrote in South Africa's Mail & Guardian. Ms Udgoon captured a battle many other African immigrants feel: "I am expected to be grateful to be here. But have I sold my soul to the devil?" Mr Abdullah sees Afrochella as a platform to unite the black diaspora as they deal with seemingly intractable obstacles like this.  "I checked in with black friends from Haiti, Benin and St Vincent and the Grenadines because discrimination has no nationality. Systemic racism affects us all.  "For a long time, I hadn't realized it was an injustice until I started finding language for it. I've been pulled over, been through stop and frisk and racially profiled. This fight is my fight." Mr Abdullah said. It is not just his fight for African-Americans like him, it is a fight for the right to be black safely in America. I replayed Karen's voice note to me because she had a powerful conclusion: "I think right now what is on display is anti-blackness and it's raising the consciousness about the connectedness of so many of our struggles, not the same but very much connected."Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Controversial US Congressman Steve King, who has been criticised for a string of remarks on race and immigration, lost his bid to secure a 10th term in office on Tuesday. The Republican has held his Iowa seat since 2002, but was beaten to the party's nomination in a primary vote by state senator Randy Feenstra.  It comes amid mass protests in the US against racism and police brutality. They follow the death in police custody of unarmed black man George Floyd. Last year Mr King was stripped of his House committee seats after questioning why terms like "white supremacy" were offensive. The following month, when defending a ban on abortion, he suggested much of the human race might not exist without rape or incest, prompting renewed calls for him to resign. Mr King has also drawn ire for tweeting his support for the Dutch anti-Islam politician, Geert Wilders. "Wilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny," Mr King wrote on Twitter. "We can't restore our civilisation with somebody else's babies."  He later defended his comments, telling broadcaster CNN that he "meant exactly what he said".  The former lawmaker has also previously tweeted his support for a Toronto mayoral candidate with Neo-Nazi ties, and claimed in 2017 that diversity was not America’s strength. Despite multiple controversies, until now he has continued to hold Iowa’s fourth congressional district.  He narrowly reclaimed his seat in 2018, with just three percentage points separating him from his Democratic challenger.  Congratulations to Randy Feenstra on your big win in the Iowa Republican Primary. You will be a great Congressman! End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrump In the latest primary race, his rival Randy Feenstra focused on Mr King’s weakened influence in Washington.  In a video, Mr Feenstra thanked his supporters for “placing their trust” in him.  "I've said from day one that Iowans deserve a proven, effective conservative leader that will deliver results," he added.   Mr King posted a video of his own, saying his ousting was part of "an effort to push out the strongest voice for full spectrum constitutional Christian conservatism" from Congress. "There's some powerful elements in the swamp that [Mr Feenstra's] going to have an awfully hard time pushing back against," he said. Steve King's defeat is one of those rare electoral events that will be welcomed across much of the US political spectrum.  It will be celebrated by Democrats, who will view it as an indication that Iowa voters have soured on the congressman's divisive rhetoric, support for white nationalist viewpoints, and vehement anti-immigration views. Mr King's outspoken advocacy for a Mexican border wall predated Donald Trump's political rise, and they hope it could be a harbinger of his November defeat as well. Many Republicans will be relieved that an embarrassing congressional back-bencher in a safe seat will be replaced by someone who will be a reliably conservative vote without Mr King's political baggage.  In recent years, Mr King's continued success was seen as a sign that his brand of unapologetic ethno-nationalism had a foothold in the US. As a member of Congress, his associations with foreign politicians with similar viewpoints - such as Faith Goldy in Canada and Heinz-Christian Strache of the Austrian Freedom Party - gave them greater political standing in their home countries. With Mr King on his way out, that official imprimatur is gone, even if the sentiments he gave voice to still remain.

Mr Floyd died in police custody in the US after a white officer held him down by pressing a knee into his neck on 25 May, sparking international protests. The 46-year-old could be heard pleading for air in a video filmed by onlookers. While thousands joined a protest in London, a smaller number gathered in the Scottish capital for the event organised by Stand Up To Racism. Around 50-60 people gathered at 18:00 in Parliament Square outside St Giles' Cathedral.  They observed distancing measures and wore masks. Police were joined by liaison officers for the short protest, which lasted for 15 minutes. Sabby Dhalu, Stand Up To Racism co-convenor, said: "We are outraged that yet another black person has been killed at the hands of the police in the US and instead of calling for justice for George Floyd, Donald Trump chooses to inflame racism by threatening military action on protesters. "The events unfolding in the US are a product of hundreds of years of racism and oppression of black communities, which has led to countless lives lost." Sabby Dhalu added: "We must remember that we are in the midst of the deadly coronavirus global pandemic and that tens of thousands of BAME communities have died disproportionately as a result of this. "We share the concerns of many scientists regarding the premature easing of the lockdown and the disproportionate impact this could have on BAME communities." Another rally is being planned on Sunday by another group in Edinburgh. Protesters are due to meet at Holyrood Park for the event from 13:00. Organisers of the Edinburgh in Solidarity with Black Lives Matter rally met Edinburgh City Council and Police Scotland officials on Wednesday to discuss the event. The "peaceful, static protest" will include "speeches and performances from black community organisers and artists".Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window New charges have been announced against all of the sacked police officers present at the death of African American George Floyd in Minneapolis. The charge against Derek Chauvin has been elevated to second-degree murder, court documents show. The other three officers, previously uncharged, face counts of aiding and abetting murder. Floyd's death has sparked huge protests across the US against racism and the police killings of black Americans. The vast majority of demonstrations over the past eight days have been peaceful, but some have turned violent and curfews have been imposed in a number of cities. Announcing the new charges, Minnesota's Attorney General Keith Ellison said that they were in the interests of justice. Derek Chauvin had initially faced charges of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. These will stay on his charge sheet. The other three sacked officers are Thomas Lane, J Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao. They all face charges of aiding and abetting second-degree murder, and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter. Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar said on Twitter that the latest charges were "another important step for justice". Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison is increasing charges against Derek Chauvin to 2nd degree in George Floyd’s murder and also charging other 3 officers. This is another important step for justice. End of Twitter post  by @amyklobuchar Floyd family lawyer Benjamin Crump said in a statement: "This is a significant step forward on the road to justice and we are gratified that this important action was brought before George Floyd's body was laid to rest." But he later told CNN that the family believed the charge against Derek Chauvin should be first-degree murder and that they had been told that the investigation was ongoing and the charges could change further. At a press briefing, rights activist Rev Al Sharpton said that the Floyd case must lead to a national federal act. He said: "If we come out of all this and do not have federal legislation where we can protect citizens from local policing... then all of this is drama to no end. Drama in the street must be geared to fundamental legal change." Mr Ellison said he was under no illusion that bringing a successful prosecution against the former police officers would be difficult. "Winning a conviction will be hard. History does show there are clear challenges," he said. Only one officer in Minnesota has been convicted of killing a civilian while serving in the role. Mr Ellison said George Floyd was "loved by his family, his life had value" and that "we will seek justice for you and we will find it". He said bringing justice to society more generally would be slow and difficult work and that Americans did not have to wait for the end of the Floyd case to start that work. "We need to rewrite the rules for a just society now," he said. First- and second-degree murder under Minnesota law require proof that the defendant intended to kill. First-degree in most cases requires premeditation, with second-degree more related to crimes of passion. A third-degree murder conviction would not require proof that the defendant wanted the victim to die, only that their actions were dangerous and were carried out without regard to human life. A second-degree murder conviction can carry a sentence of up to 40 years, 15 longer than for third-degree. George Floyd, 46, was stopped by police investigating the purchase of cigarettes with counterfeit money on 25 May in Minneapolis. A video showed Floyd being arrested and a white police officer continuing to kneel on his neck for several minutes even after he pleaded that he could not breathe. Protests erupted and have continued since, across many US cities and also internationally, with rallies on Wednesday in Australia, France, the Netherlands and in the UK, where thousands gathered in central London. The Floyd case follows the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri; Eric Garner in New York; and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement in recent years. For many, the outrage over Floyd's death also reflects years of frustration over socio-economic inequality and discrimination.

Mr Trump told Fox News radio he went down during the day for a "tiny period of time" for an "inspection". There have been protests near the White House, and across the US, for days over the death in custody of George Floyd. Although some have turned violent, the defence secretary has said he does not back deploying "active duty forces". Mark Esper said on Wednesday he did not support invoking the Insurrection Act, which would enable the deployment of federal troops for domestic law enforcement. "The option to use active duty forces should only be used as a matter of last resort and only in the most urgent and dire of situations. We are not in one of those situations now," he said. This marks a break with President Trump, who has threatened to use the 1807 act and call up troops to quash demonstrations.  During a White House briefing on Wednesday, Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said for now, Mr Esper is still in his role. "As of right now, Secretary Esper is still Secretary Esper and should the president lose faith we will all learn about that in the future," she said. The death of African-American George Floyd, whose neck was pinned down by the knee of a white policeman in Minneapolis, sparked widespread protests. Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated across the United States for eight days against racism and the police killings of black Americans, while also calling for an end to racism and discrimination. The vast majority have been peaceful but some have turned violent and curfews have been imposed in a number of cities. He was speaking on radio to Fox's Brian Kilmeade, as well as posting a number of new tweets amid continued criticism of his response to the unrest.  A report in the New York Times quoted a source as saying Mr Trump was taken into the bunker on Friday night with bodyguards. "It was a false report," Mr Trump said, adding: "I was there for a tiny, little short period of time. And it was much for an inspection... maybe sometime you're going to need it." On Monday, Mr Trump came in for criticism after police dispersed mostly peaceful protesters to clear a way for him to stand outside the nearby St John's Church clutching a Bible. Mr Trump denied telling police to disperse protesters. "I didn't say, oh move them out, I didn't know who was there," he said, adding that "most religious leaders loved" his visit to the church. The presiding bishop of the the Episcopal Church, Michael Curry, accused Mr Trump of using the church for "partisan political purposes", while the Archbishop of Washington Wilton D Gregory said the president had "manipulated" the shrine. When asked about law enforcement during the protests, Mr Trump admitted "you have to get better than what they've been doing... we have to get the police departments, everybody has to do better", without giving any details on new policy. In his tweets, Mr Trump, defended his record on race relations saying his presidency had done more for black Americans than presidential rival Joe Biden had done "in 43 years". Mr Biden has said Mr Trump's actions are trying to "serving the passions of his base" and has pledged not to "traffic in fear and division". Tuesday evening saw tens of thousands of mainly peaceful protests in the US, with levels of violence markedly down, although some demonstrators continued to defy curfews. One of the biggest protests, joined by Floyd's relatives, took place in his hometown of Houston, Texas. On Wednesday there was international support for Floyd's family, with marches taking place in Ireland, New Zealand, the UK, Australia and elsewhere.

Hundreds attended the service, which heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton. Thousands chanted "no justice, no peace, no racist police" and "black lives matter" in central London. Some 20,000 in Paris remembered the death of black man, Adama Traore, in French police custody in 2016.

The US protests began after a video showed Mr Floyd being arrested on 25 May in Minneapolis and a white police officer continuing to kneel on his neck for several minutes even after he pleaded that he could not breathe. The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with third-degree murder and will appear in court next week. Three other police officers have been fired but not yet charged. CNN reports that the state attorney-general will on Wednesday make a "significant announcement" on possible additional charges. The Floyd case follows the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri; Eric Garner in New York; and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement in recent years.

Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Following the death of George Floyd while under arrest, protests have consumed America and onlookers have wondered how one of the most powerful countries in the world could descend into such chaos.  Despite being defined by race, American society does not spend much time analysing the history of our racial divisions, and America prefers to believe in the inevitable progression towards racial equality.  The election of Barack Obama in 2008 fed into this narrative of progress, but Donald Trump's presidential victory in 2016 was seen as a step backwards, coming after a campaign with a slogan that championed America's divisive past as a form of progress. Floyd's death now appears to be the tipping point for an exhausted, racially divided nation still in the throes of the coronavirus pandemic and the economic cost that followed. Floyd's cries of "I can't breathe" echoed the cries of Eric Garner, who was choked by police on a New York City sidewalk in 2014.  Floyd's words reminded Americans of the oppressive past we work to forget regardless of whether it is six years ago, 60 years ago, the 1860s, or 1619 when some of the first slaves arrived in America. To a large extent, America's neglect of the past and belief in progress have left many Americans unaware of the severity and scope of our racial tensions, and as a result many Americans lack the words to articulate our current turmoil. Recently, I have used the word ethnocide meaning "the destruction of culture while keeping the people" to describe America's past and present racial tensions, and this language also helps articulate the uniqueness of America's race problem. In 1941, Raphael Lemkin, a Polish Jew and distinguished lawyer, immigrated to the United States as he fled the Nazis. While in America he implored the American government to stop the Nazis from killing his people, and as his words fell on deaf ears, he realized he needed to create a new word to describe the unique horror befalling his people. In 1944, Lemkin coined the words genocide and ethnocide. Lemkin intended for the words to be interchangeable but over time they diverged. Genocide became the destruction of a people and their culture, and this word radically changed the world for the better. Ethnocide became the destruction of culture while keeping the people, and has been ignored for decades. Recently, ethnocide has been used to describe the plight of indigenous people against colonisation, but regarding America, ethnocide also pertains to the transatlantic slave trade and the founding of the nation. From the beginning of the transatlantic slave trade, European colonisers destroyed the culture of African people, but kept their bodies in order to create the chattel slavery system that became the economic and social foundation of the United States. Colonisers prevented Africans from speaking their languages and practising their religions. Tribal and familial bonds were broken, and African people could no longer identify as Igbo, Yoruba, and Malian. Instead de-cultured names such as nigger, negro, coloured, and black were stamped upon African people.  Additionally, Europeans identified themselves as white, and in the United States the one-drop rule was created to sustain that division. One drop of black or African blood meant that a person could not be white. In America, whiteness became a zero-sum identity that was maintained by systemic racial division. Interracial marriage was still illegal in much of America until the Loving vs Virginia decision in 1967.  From colonisation to the formation of the United States, America has created countless laws and policies to sustain the racial division between blacks and whites forged by ethnocide. These American norms, extending to housing, education, employment, healthcare, law enforcement and environmental protections including clean drinking water, have disproportionately harmed African Americans and other communities of colour in order to sustain racial division and white dominance. George Floyd's murder represents a continuation of the systemic criminalisation and oppression of black life in America that has always been the American norm dating back to Jim Crow, segregation (which means apartheid), and slavery. When the Confederacy, the collection of American slave-holding states in the South, seceded from the United States, they launched the Civil War to defend the immoral institution of slavery. After losing the Civil War, these states were readmitted back into the United States. To this day, many Americans, and especially America hate groups, still celebrate Confederate soldiers and politicians as heroes, and there are monuments and memorials dedicated to them across America. Despite the American South losing the Civil War in 1865, American President Andrew Johnson pardoned Confederate soldiers, and soon thereafter Confederate politicians won elected office in the newly-reunited America. The influence of former slave owners and Confederates contributed to erasing the rights that African Americans won in the 1860s including citizenship and the right to vote.  The political campaign to remove African American rights was called the Redeemers movement, and it was led by former slave-owners and Confederates, who wanted to redeem the South by returning it to the norms of chattel slavery. The Redeemers and "Make America Great Again" derive from America's oppressive, ethnocidal school of thought. The Redeemers were also assisted by American terrorist groups such as the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) that were made up of former Confederate soldiers. The KKK, and many other white supremacist groups, terrorised and lynched black Americans, and they also prevented them from voting to help ensure that Redeemer candidates won elected office. The terrorists became the government. By the start of the 20th Century, the Redeemers had succeeded in undoing the racial equality progress of the post-Civil War Reconstruction era, and now Jim Crow segregation became the norm of the American South. The Supreme Court's decision in Plessy vs Ferguson made "separate but equal" the new law of the land, and America again became a legal apartheid state. According to the Equal Justice Initiative's 2017 report Lynching in America, over 4,400 lynchings of African Americans occurred from 1877-1950. That is more than a lynching a week for 74 years. During Jim Crow, America could not legally deny black people their humanity, but they could deny them the services that are afforded to human beings. Black people were denied education, housing, employment, and were expected to "know their place" as a perpetually subjugated people. Large prisons were erected on former plantations; black people were arrested for minor crimes and given long prison sentences doing manual labour on the same land their ancestors were forced to work as enslaved people.  As a result of Jim Crow, millions of African Americans fled the neo-slavery and terror of the South during the Great Migration, and racial tensions spread as other American cities did not welcome these domestic refugees. This is the same journey as the Underground Railroad, where prior to the Civil War enslaved African Americans escaped the South and sought refuge in Canada and the Northern parts of America. The civil rights movement of the 1960s effectively ended Jim Crow, and African Americans began reclaiming the rights, specifically voting rights and freedom of movement, they had previously won in the 1860s, but it is a long road to dismantle systemic and legalised racism and segregation. Obama's election in 2008 was a monumental event in American society, but it did not magically erase the systemic racism woven into America's social fabric and the 2012 killing of Trayvon Martin, 17, helped launch the Black Lives Matter movement to national attention.  Trayvon was shot and killed by George Zimmerman as he walked home in his own neighbourhood because Zimmerman thought he looked suspicious. Martin was unarmed. Zimmerman pled self-defence and a jury found him not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter. Trayvon was one of countless African Americans killed by America's ethnocidal society that sanctions terror from both the government and civilians. The unjust killing of black people by the police and racist vigilantes remained the norm during Obama's presidency, but now the black community could record and document these crimes on video, and had a president who would defend them. Obama famously said: "If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon." The emergence of the Black Lives Matter movement and other protests under Obama occurred because black Americans were confident that the White House would listen to their cries of "I can't breathe" and make American society finally equitable and just. Under Trump those cries have fallen on deaf ears and tensions have escalated. America has much work to do to fix our racial tensions because our divisions and inequality are forged in our ethnocidal roots. We need to reform the policing of a nation nearly the size of a continent with over 300 million people, but we also need to make our education, healthcare, and housing systems, and every facet of our democracy more equitable.  Additionally, truth and reconciliation commissions, a national apology, reparations, holding evildoers accountable, and other processes nations have used to heal after a genocide, the linguistic sibling of ethnocide, will help America change course and forge equality and justice.  Also, America has rarely criminalised white supremacist hate and terror and instead has spent centuries normalising white terrorist groups, celebrating them as heroes, and letting them decide if their actions are evil or not. This is why the Confederacy is still celebrated today. Europe did not allow fascists and Nazis to determine if their actions were good or not, but America has always given this luxury to racist slave-owners and their generational apologists and offspring. This must change. Rwanda, Germany, and South Africa have reckoned with their troubled past to make a better future, but America has long preferred to ignore the past, and proclaim the inevitability of progress. America today must define and confront the Original Sin of slavery, ethnocide, and the cultural destruction it has inflicted upon all Americans, past and present. Otherwise we will fail to make a better future, and will continue our regression.

In emails since shared on social media, Sir Desmond Swayne likened racism to cancer but condemned the rioters. Mr Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American, suffered a cardiac arrest while being restrained in Minneapolis by a white police officer on 25 May. President Donald Trump has vowed to use the military to end the unrest that has broken out across the US. Footage of Mr Floyd's arrest shows police officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck while he was pinned to the floor. Mr Chauvin, 44, has since been charged with murder. He and three other police officers have been fired. The death of Mr Floyd has led to nationwide protests and a level of civil unrest not seen in the US for decades. There have also been protests in the UK, and appeals by constituents to their MPs to condemn Mr Trump and support the Black Lives Matter movement. Sir Desmond, MP for New Forest West in Hampshire, was asked whether he could support the US after it threatened to send in the military. In response to several queries, he said: "Racism is a cancer, and I'm glad that the perpetrator is on a murder charge. "Nevertheless, looters, arsonists and rioters have it coming." Constituent Millie Edland said she was "disgusted" by his email response to her, which has been seen by the BBC. Another of Sir Desmond's constituents, who asked to be identified only as Eleanor, has had a post on social media of his response to her shared 17,000 times. The Liberal Democrat councillor for Hampshire's Pennington Ward, Jack Davies, said: "It's a disgrace, he should apologise and I would even go so far as to say he should go for diversity training." Sir Desmond, 63, declined to comment when approached by the BBC. Last September in a post on his blog, the veteran Tory MP defended Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for wearing "brownface" makeup for a yearbook photo. "It was a themed 'Arabian Nights' fancy-dress party for heaven's sake," he wrote. "It comes to something when you can't dress up as Aladdin without attracting the opprobrium of the 'great and good'." It then emerged that Sir Desmond had himself blacked up for a Blues Brothers-themed party. Follow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

Here's a timeline of some of the major incidents from 2014 onwards. Eric Garner dies after he is wrestled to the ground by a New York police officer on suspicion of illegally selling cigarettes. While in a choke hold, Mr Garner uttered the words "I can't breathe" 11 times.  The incident - filmed by a bystander - led to protests across the country. The police officer involved was later fired, but was never prosecuted. It came a year after the Black Lives Matter movement emerged in response to the acquittal of the man who killed teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida. Michael Brown, 18, is killed by a police officer, in Ferguson, Missouri, who was responding to reports that Brown - who was not armed - had stolen a box of cigars.  The exact circumstances of the encounter are disputed, but Brown was shot six times, according to autopsy reports. A report by the Department of Justice later concludes that the police force had displayed racial bias against Brown and used excessive force. The officer involved resigns from the force, but is not prosecuted. The incident leads to multiple waves of protests and civil unrest in Ferguson, boosting the Black Lives Matter movement further. Tamir Rice, a boy of 12, is shot dead in Cleveland, Ohio by a police officer after reports of a male who was "probably a juvenile" pointing a gun that was "probably fake" at passers by.  Police claimed that they told Rice to drop the weapon - but instead of dropping it he pointed it at police.  The police confirmed that the gun was a toy after Rice had been shot dead.  There were no prosecutions after this case. The police officer involved was sacked three years later for lying on his job application form. Walter Scott is shot in the back five times by a white police officer, who is later fired and eventually sentenced to 20 years in prison.  Mr Scott had been pulled over for having a defective light on his car in North Charleston, South Carolina, and had run away from the officer after a brief scuffle. The killing sparks protests in North Charleston, with chants of "No justice, no peace". Alton Sterling's death leads to days of protests in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Mr Sterling is killed after police respond to reports of a disturbance outside a shop. The incident was caught on mobile phone footage and spread online. The two officers involved did not face criminal charges, but one was dismissed and the other suspended from the police. Philando Castile is killed while out driving with his girlfriend in St Paul, Minnesota. He is pulled over by the police during a routine check, and tells them he is licensed to carry a weapon, and has one in his possession. He was shot as he was reaching for his licence, according to his girlfriend.  She live-streamed the encounter on Facebook. The officer involved was cleared of murder charges. Stephon Clark dies after being shot at least seven times in Sacramento, California, by police who were investigating a break-in. The district attorney said that the police had not committed a crime, as the officers said they feared for their lives believing Mr Clark was armed. Only a mobile phone was found at the scene. The release of a police video of the incident sparked major protests in the city. Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical technician was shot eight times when officers entered her apartment in Louisville, Kentucky. The police were executing a search warrant as part of a drugs raid, but no drugs were found. They had raided the wrong address. Louisville police said they returned fire after one officer was shot and wounded in the incident. The family has filed a lawsuit for wrongful death and excessive force. George Floyd dies after being arrested in Minneapolis, and held down by police officers, one of whom has his knee on Mr Floyd's neck. He pleaded that he couldn't breathe. Protests break out in cities across the US, and there are demonstrations in other parts of the world. One officer is charged with second-degree murder, and three others face charges of aiding and abetting murder.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window The Church of England's first female black bishop has criticised President Donald Trump for "posing" with a bible as civil unrest continues. The Rev Dr Rose Hudson-Wilkin said the photo shoot in Washington was "inappropriate" and "unacceptable". The death in police custody of George Floyd prompted protests across the US.  Mr Trump was pictured outside St John's Episcopal Church, near the White House, after saying he planned to "dominate the streets" and end civil unrest. The Bishop of Dover called on the US president to instead engage with people who are "crying out 'I can't breathe'". Rev Hudson-Wilkin said Mr Trump was wrong to use a "religious backdrop as if to give affirmation to his perspective". "The god that I worship and serve isn't interested in our religiosity," she said. "God is interested in whether we feed the hungry, clothe naked, in whether we look after those who are most vulnerable in society.  "Posing with the bible is not engaging with those things."  While there was "no excuse" for the violence and looting seen in some parts of the US, Rev Hudson-Wilkin said protesters were "giving voice to the voiceless".  "What we are seeing is a cry for justice," she said. "[Mr Trump] would be better off sitting down at a round table and engaging with the structural racism that has over the years continued to contribute to a people being so disenfranchised." Rev Hudson-Wilkin said when she first saw a clip of Mr Floyd pinned to the ground she was left "screaming at these police officers get up of the man, he can't breathe". Asked what she would say to Mr Trump if she could address him directly, Rev Hudson-Wilkin said: "Get down of your high horse, get out of your privileged bubble and listen and hear and respond to the needs of those who are crying out 'I can't breathe'."Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window The Gambia has demanded a "credible" investigation after the son of a diplomat was shot dead by US police. Thirty-nine-year-old Momodou Lamin Sisay was shot after a car chase in Georgia on Friday morning, according to the preliminary investigation by Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI). He was pronounced dead on the scene. The police said he had produced a gun. The shooting comes amid widespread protests after a US police officer killed George Floyd last week. Georgia investigators said that at approximately 03:49 in the morning, a police officer in Snellville, Georgia attempted to stop his vehicle but the vehicle did not stop, and a pursuit ensued. "Officers approached the vehicle and gave verbal commands for the driver to show his hands.  The driver did not comply... the driver pointed a handgun at the officers.  Officers fired at the driver and pulled back to take cover behind their patrol vehicles," investigators said. A Swat team was called and "during the standoff, the driver pointed his weapon and fired at the SWAT officers. One GCPD SWAT officer fired his weapon", they added. Lare Sisay, the victim's father who works at the United Nations, said the police did not do enough to peacefully resolve the situation, and also disputed that he had a gun, according to local media. "We will do an independent autopsy and we want to get a private investigator to investigate the circumstances of his death and if necessary hire a lawyer to sue the Georgia state police. We're not going to let it go," The Point newspaper quotes him as saying. On Tuesday The Gambia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs asked its embassy in Washington DC to "engage the relevant US authorities including the State Department to seek transparent, credible and objective investigation". Mr Sisay's name has been used in social media posts this week supporting the campaign against US police brutality against black people. Protests have been taking place across the US following the death of Mr Floyd, an African-American man, who died after a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, kept his knee on his neck for more than eight minutes. Mr Chauvin has been sacked from the police force and charged with murder.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated, mainly peacefully, across the United States for an eighth night following the death of African-American George Floyd in police custody. One of the biggest protests, joined by Floyd's relatives, took place in his hometown of Houston, Texas.  Many defied curfews in several cities, imposed after violence and looting in some districts on Monday night. The Pope has issued a call for racism not to be ignored.  "We cannot tolerate or turn a blind eye to racism," he said. But he also condemned the violence: "Nothing is gained by violence and so much is lost." The Floyd case has reignited deep-seated anger over police killings of black Americans and racism. Demonstrators have taken to the streets - not only to express their outrage at the treatment of Mr Floyd - but to condemn police brutality against black Americans more widely.  There have been calls, and a proposal from a US lawmaker, to end the qualified immunity of police which prevents civil legal action against them. More generally protesters have called for an end to racism and discrimination.  In central Washington DC police fired tear gas after darkness. The military were again on the streets of the capital and helicopters hovered above protesters marching towards the White House.   Traffic was blocked in New York's Manhattan district as protesters ignored a night-time curfew, which had been extended for a week. Video footage showed them surrounding a police van.  In Houston, where Floyd is due to be buried, Mayor Sylvester Turner, told the crowds people should know that he "did not die in vain".  Big rallies were also held in Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Atlanta and Seattle. Minneapolis, where 46-year-old Floyd died, was reported to be relatively calm.  But in Seattle, Portland and Atlanta there were reports of tear gas being fired.   Sixteen members of George Floyd's family joined the 60,000 protesters for the Houston rally. They included sister La Tonya and brother Philonese. A nephew told the crowd: "Don't stop until we get justice for my uncle," the Houston Chronicle reports. At an emotional news conference in Minneapolis, Roxie Washington, the mother of George Floyd's six-year-old daughter Gianna, said he was a good man.  Standing with Gianna, she said: "I'm here for my baby and I'm here for George because I want justice for him." George Floyd's funeral is due to take place on 9 June in Houston.  The president on Wednesday again defended his record on race relations while condemning both "killers, terrorists, arsonists, anarchists, thugs, hoodlums, looters" and the coverage in much of the media. He posted tweets saying his presidency had done more for black Americans than presidential rival Joe Biden had done "in 43 years".

                                 George Floyd dies after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage shows a white officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floyd’s neck for several minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Mr Floyd is heard repeatedly saying "I can’t breathe". He is pronounced dead later in hospital.

                                 Four officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd are fired. Protests begin as the video of the arrest is shared widely on social media. Hundreds of demonstrators take to the streets of Minneapolis and vandalise police cars and the police station with graffiti. 
                                    27 May
                                 Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places, like Portland, Oregon, protesters lie in the road, chanting "I can’t breathe". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floyd’s arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat.

                                 President Trump blames the violence on a lack of leadership in Minneapolis and threatens to send in the National Guard in a tweet.  He follows it up in a second tweet with a warning "when the looting starts, the shooting starts". The second tweet is hidden by Twitter for "glorifying violence".

                                 A CNN reporter, Omar Jimenez, is arrested while covering the Minneapolis protest. Mr Jimenez was reporting live when police officers handcuffed him. A few minutes later several of his colleagues are also arrested. They are all later released once they are confirmed to be members of the media. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with murder and manslaughter. The charges carry a combined maximum 35-year sentence.

                                 Violence spreads across the US on the sixth night of protests. A total of at least five people are reported killed in protests from Indianapolis to Chicago. More than 75 cities have seen protests. At least 4,400 people have been arrested.  Curfews are imposed across the US to try to stem the unrest.

                                 President Trump threatens to send in the military to quell growing civil unrest. He says if cities and states fail to control the protests and "defend their residents" he will deploy the army and "quickly solve the problem for them". Mr Trump poses in front of a damaged church shortly after police used tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters nearby.

                                 Tens of thousands of protesters again take to the streets. One of the biggest protests is in George Floyd’s hometown of Houston, Texas. Many defy curfews in several cities, but the demonstrations are largely peaceful. 
                                    4 June
                                 A memorial service for George Floyd is held in Minneapolis.  Those gathered in tribute stand in silence for eight minutes, 46 seconds, the amount of time Mr Floyd is alleged to have been on the ground under arrest. Hundreds attended the service, which heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton. An earlier tweet had cited a number of measures, along with the "lowest black unemployment, poverty, and crime rates in history". Unemployment levels did hit a low last year but have soared in the coronavirus outbreak. Mr Biden has said Mr Trump's actions are trying to "serving the passions of his base" and has pledged not to "traffic in fear and division" or "fan the flames of hate". President Trump earlier defended his controversial decision to pose with a Bible outside a historic church in Washington, whose basement was set on fire at the weekend. Taking to Twitter, he wrote: "You got it wrong! If the protesters were so peaceful, why did they light the Church on fire the night before? People liked my walk." On Monday, police used rubber bullets and smoke grenades ahead of the curfew to clear a peaceful protest near the White House, before Mr Trump stood for the cameras outside St John's Church. Michael Curry, the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church diocese in Washington, accused him of using the Church for "partisan political purposes".  Criticism also came from Washington's Catholic archbishop, who condemned Mr Trump's visit to the Saint John Paul II National Shrine on Tuesday.  It "manipulated" the shrine, Archbishop Wilton D Gregory said. Monday night saw some of the worst unrest with widespread looting and arson as previously peaceful protests saw a minority resort to violence.  In Las Vegas, a police officer was described on Tuesday as being in a grave condition after being shot. Separately, an armed man was shot dead by police in the same city. Four police were also shot in St Louis, though their injuries were not described as life-threatening. But a retired officer was shot and killed outside a looted store.  The protests began after a video showed Mr Floyd being arrested on 25 May in Minneapolis and a white police officer continuing to kneel on his neck for several minutes even after he pleaded that he could not breathe. The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with third-degree murder and will appear in court next week. Three other police officers have been fired. The Floyd case follows the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri; Eric Garner in New York; and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement in recent years. Garner was placed in a police chokehold in New York in 2014 and could be heard crying out "I can't breathe" as officers restrained him. His words, which were also shouted by Mr Floyd in his final moments, have become a rallying cry for Black Lives Matter protesters. African-Americans are more likely to get fatally shot by police than other ethnic groups. They are also arrested for drug abuse at a much higher rate than white Americans, although surveys show drug use is at similar levels. For many, the outrage over Mr Floyd's death also reflects years of frustration over socio-economic inequality and discrimination.  But the protests also echo those of the Civil Rights movement more than 50 years ago. This action was led by Martin Luther King Jr and sought to challenge white supremacy and the segregationist policies that were commonplace at the time. The ongoing unrest is the most widespread racial turbulence the US has experienced since Dr King, known to most Americans as MLK, was gunned down by a sniper in 1968.

Tuesday's visit "manipulated" the Saint John Paul II National Shrine, Archbishop Wilton D Gregory said. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of people joined largely peaceful demonstrations in cities across the country. In New York City, protesters defied an earlier curfew.  Traffic police were deployed to stop a repeat of the previous night's looting in Manhattan, and there were no reports of major incidents. At least 40 cities have imposed strict curfew measures after days of violent protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd, 46, in Minneapolis on 25 May. In Atlanta, police fired tear gas to disperse a demonstration near Centennial Olympic Park, reports said.  Earlier, Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden criticised President Donald Trump for using the crisis to appeal to his supporters, saying he was "serving the passions of his base". On Monday, Mr Trump said he would deploy the army if cities and states failed to control the protests.  In a statement ahead of the president's visit to the Saint John Paul II National Shrine on Tuesday, Archbishop Wilton D Gregory said it violated the church's religious principles, adding that Catholics should defend the rights of all people. "I find it baffling and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree," the statement said. The archbishop also condemned the forceful clearing of protesters outside the White House on Monday to allow Mr Trump to visit a church where he held a Bible in front of gathered media. Saint John Paul "would not condone the use of tear gas and other deterrents to silence, scatter or intimidate [protestors] for a photo opportunity in front of a place of worship," he commented. Archbishop Gregory is the first African-American to lead the diocese. The shrine is run by the Knights of Columbus, an all-male Catholic organisation that has lobbied for conservative political causes. Washington's Episcopalian bishop, Mariann Budde, also condemned the president's actions. In the UK the archbishops of York and Canterbury said the unrest exposed "the ongoing evil of white supremacy". US President Donald Trump's signalling of religious affiliation has not been welcomed by a range of clerics as the nation struggles to manage the twin challenges of a pandemic and widespread political protest. President Trump does not belong to a particular congregation, only occasionally attends a service and has said many times that he does not like to ask God for forgiveness. But while he may not consider church essential to his personal life, it may yet hold the keys to his political future. In 2016, Mr Trump won 81% of white evangelical votes and exit polls found that white Catholics supported him over Hillary Clinton by 60% to 37%.

Official figures show that the economy shrank by 0.3% in the first three months of the year, amid bushfires and the early stages of the outbreak. Economists expect data for the current quarter to confirm that the shutdowns have pushed the country into recession. It comes even after the government and central bank stepped up measures to support the economy. The latest gross domestic product (GDP) figures highlight that the economy was struggling from a devastating bushfire season, a slowdown in tourism and weak domestic demand even before the virus-related restrictions started.  "This was the slowest through-the-year growth since September 2009, when Australia was in the midst of the global financial crisis, and captures just the beginning of the expected economic effects of Covid-19," Bureau of Statistics chief economist Bruce Hockman said. In March the Reserve Bank of Australia cut its main interest rate to a record low of 0.25%. The central bank also launched an unlimited bond buying programme. While the central bank kept the cost of borrowing on hold at its meeting on Tuesday, Governor Philip Lowe said the country was facing the toughest conditions since the Great Depression. "The Australian economy is going through a very difficult period and is experiencing the biggest economic contraction since the 1930s." However, he did add a note of optimism to his outlook: "It is possible that the depth of the downturn will be less than earlier expected." "The rate of new infections has declined significantly and some restrictions have been eased earlier than was previously thought likely," he said. The Australian government has also pledged hundreds of billions dollars to help support businesses and individuals and has signalled that more stimulus measures would be announced soon. Last month Japan fell into recession for the first time since 2015 as the world's third biggest economy shrank at an annual pace of 3.4% in the first three months of the year. The week before Germany, Europe's largest economy, slipped into recession, while other big economies, including the UK and the US are also seeing sharp downturns. A recession is widely defined as two  quarters in a row of economic contraction, or shrinking GDP.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window US President Donald Trump says Republicans have been "forced" to find another state to host their conference after North Carolina refused to budge on possible coronavirus restrictions. The president tweeted North Carolina's governor would not guarantee Republicans could use the venue "as originally anticipated and promised". Roy Cooper tweeted that Republicans had resisted "changes to keep people safe". Several other states have volunteered to host the event instead. Mr Trump tweeted that Mr Cooper, a Democrat, was "still in Shelter-In-Place Mode". "We are now forced to seek another State to host the 2020 Republican National Convention," the president added. The party conference, which was scheduled for Charlotte's NBA arena in August, will formally nominate Mr Trump to seek a second term in the 3 November election. The Republican president had set a deadline of this week for North Carolina to confirm that social-distancing restrictions would not be imposed on the convention. But Mr Cooper wrote in a letter on Tuesday to Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel that he could offer no such promise. He said "planning for a scaled-down convention with fewer people, social distancing and face coverings is a necessity." By Tuesday, North Carolina had reported 29,900 total coronavirus cases and 900 deaths.  Ms McDaniel tweeted that the party would "begin visiting the multiple cities and states who have reached out to us" to scout alternative venues.  Georgia, Florida and Tennessee, which have Republican governors, have all expressed interest in hosting the convention if North Carolina fell through.  North Carolina Republicans called Mr Cooper - who is up for re-election this year - a "hypocrite" and accused him of applying a different standard to those gathering to protest last week's killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. "We deserve to know why Cooper gives free reign [sic] to crowds gathered to riot, but refuses to let citizens peacefully and safely renominate the president," they said, reports Politico. Democrats have delayed their convention, which was originally scheduled for June in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Former US Vice-President Joe Biden is the party's presumptive presidential nominee to challenge Mr Trump.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Google has been sued in the US over claims it illegally invades the privacy of users by tracking people even when they are browsing in "private mode". The class action wants at least $5bn (£4bn) from Google and owner Alphabet. Many internet users assume their search history isn't being tracked when they view in private mode, but Google says this isn't the case. The search engine denies this is illegal and says it is upfront about the data it collects in this mode. The proposed class action likely includes "millions" of Google users who since 1 June 2016 browsed the internet in private mode according to law firm Boies Schiller Flexner who filed the claim on Tuesday in federal court in San Jose, California. Incognito mode within Google's Chrome browser gives users the choice to search the internet without their activity being saved to the browser or device. But the websites visited can use tools such as Google Analytics to track usage. The complaint says that Google "cannot continue to engage in the covert and unauthorized data collection from virtually every American with a computer or phone". Vigorously denying the claims Google spokesman Jose Castaneda said: "As we clearly state each time you open a new incognito tab, websites might be able to collect information about your browsing activity". The search engine says the collection of search history, even in private viewing mode, helps site owners "better evaluate the performance of their content, products, marketing and more." While private browsing has been available from Google for some time, Boies Schiller Flexner said it recently decided to represent three plaintiffs based in the US.  "People everywhere are becoming more aware (and concerned) that their personal communications are being intercepted, collected, recorded, or exploited for gain by technology companies they have come to depend on," it said in the filing.  One option is for visitors to install Google Analytics browser opt-out extension to disable measurement by Google Analytics, it says.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window After a police officer shot and killed Greg Crockett's best friend, he left Minnesota for good. Then in the aftermath of George Floyd's killing, he decided he couldn't stay away. How everything and nothing changed after the death of Philando Castile. Greg Crockett was sitting in the passenger seat of his grandfather's van when he saw that - in the midst of rapidly escalating protests over the death of an unarmed black man named George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer - an auto parts store near his old neighbourhood was on fire.  Although he moved away from Minnesota almost two years ago, Crockett told his grandfather he needed to go. In response, his grandfather, a retired Marine, quoted Che Guevara. "The revolution is not an apple that falls when it is ripe. You have to make it fall." As Crockett's flight descended over the Minneapolis-St Paul International Airport, an older white woman peered out the window, wondering if she'd be able to see the fires from the plane. That night, from nearly the moment his feet hit the pavement, Crockett - a thin, acerbic 37-year-old who works at the Phoenix international airport - witnessed a rolling carnival of chaos. For over two hours, until his phone died, he captured scene after scene of casual destruction, at turns horrifying and darkly comedic.  A boy who looked no older than 15 or 16 lobbed a Molotov cocktail into a grocery store, only to have the lit rag fall out and singe his legs. A group of 30 people worked furiously to break open a drive-through ATM, until an older man sauntered up at a theatrically slow pace with an enormous sledgehammer over one shoulder. A young woman wilted in the street. Her friends tried to carry her into a car that offered a ride to the hospital, but then drove off at the last second without them. There was not a police officer in sight. The red and blue lights of squad cars glinted blocks away.  "It's a beautiful day in the neighbourhood," Crockett sang through his medical mask. He ducked through a looted bank, a liquor store, a probation office, and a Mexican restaurant, where he found five masked men making themselves burritos, like college kids at the end of long night of partying. He helped himself to some beers, knocked over a beverage dispenser that stained his jeans. Occasionally he took a swig from a fifth of Courvoisier that a looter handed him on the street.  "We out here, Minnesota. The revolution is starting right here," he said into the camera. "We shoulda did this four years ago when they killed Philando. We shoulda been out here." In 2016, back when Crockett still lived in Minnesota, a police officer named Jeronimo Yanez shot and killed Crockett's best friend, Philando Castile.  When Crockett met Castile, he was a quiet, braces-wearing video game fanatic. The teeth braces came off but by all accounts little else about Castile changed. He became a well-regarded employee of St Paul Public School's food services division, known to students as "Mr Phil". To friends, he was "Chedda" because he always had a job and always made money. Yanez pulled Castile over in a neighbourhood roughly 15 minutes away from the street where George Floyd would die in 2020. After Castile informed Yanez he had a firearm, for which he was properly licensed, Yanez seemingly panicked, firing into the car and hitting Castile seven times. Castile's girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, turned on her Facebook Live seconds later, and captured her dying boyfriend's final moments while her four-year-old daughter watched from the backseat.  What happened next has become a routine in the US. The broadcast went viral. Castile's name became a hashtag. Protesters hit the streets all over the country. Crockett and the rest of the pallbearers donned white suits that matched the one Castile wore inside his casket at a funeral that was carried on national television and attended by the governor of Minnesota. Crockett remembers wanting to be angry, to be angry the way George Floyd protesters are angry now. But Castile's mother, whom Crockett calls his "auntie", told them to be peaceful. To let the criminal justice system do its work.  "She asked us to be cool," said Crockett. "We held it in. We held in our anger. We held in our emotions. We asked politely." Manslaughter charges were brought against the officer, in which the prosecutor called Castile "compliant" and "respectful". But less than a year after the killing, a jury acquitted Yanez.  The day of the acquittal was at the forefront of Crockett's mind as he moved down Lake Street, past decapitated coin-operated parking metres and storefronts curtained with flames. If there had been an uprising in Minneapolis after #PhilandoCastile, would there have been a #GeorgeFloyd? "RIP George - none of us knew you," Crockett said into the camera. "We shoulda did this four years ago. You shouldn't even be dead. "They won't stop killing us. We want you to stop killing us." Two days later, Crockett sat in a friend's backyard smoking a cigarette and drinking a beer. Brian McIntosh, the home's owner, wheeled an old, black office chair to the door of the garage and pointed at it. This is where Castile sat, he said, two weeks before he died. They'd played a game of chess. "Minding his own business," McIntosh said. Response to Crockett's Facebook Live was mixed. Some cheered him on. Some scolded him for being a part of a night that left an iconic corridor of South Minneapolis gutted by fire, water damage and looting.  Challenged about his behaviour, Crockett was unfazed.  "A lot of people are really quiet folks. Everything that happens to them, they hold it in [until] they get drunk. That's when they let it out," he said. "This is the result. This is what y'all get. You can't keep pushing a person and thinking they're gonna keep letting you push them. No, one day they're going to push back. Now we pushing back. Now we're drunk." A string of bad luck convinced Crockett to leave Minnesota two years ago. He got mugged at gunpoint. He got fired. He lost his apartment. His car got towed with all his belongings. Not long after that, he got on a flight to Arizona and vowed not to come back.  The Midwest, Crockett said, is not the same place that his great-grandfather moved to in 1947, in the second wave of the Great Migration. Their family left West Helena, Arkansas, to escape Jim Crow laws, to seek better jobs, a better education for their children, to achieve homeownership.  The same type of reasons that the Castile family came to Minnesota from Missouri. The same reasons George Floyd moved up from Houston, Texas.  But the Midwest changed. The factories shut and the schools got more segregated and the quality of life gap between black and white Midwesterners got wider and wider. Crockett's parents fled Gary, Indiana, a troubled town that cratered when the steel industry left. They bounced around from Indiana to Wisconsin to Minnesota. He attended nine elementary schools and four middle schools before they settled in St Paul. Castile wasn't even the first person Crockett knew who was killed by police - his uncle Darryl Burns was killed by an Indianapolis police officer in 1992 at a traffic stop. Crockett was 10.  He has flashes of it in his memory. The phone call his mother took in the kitchen. A trip to Indianapolis to find out what happened. His uncle's Monte Carlo strafed with bullet holes.  At this point, Crockett's views have grown bleak. He no longer believes that a life sentence for his friend's killer would have prevented another death like George Floyd's. He's no longer sure he believes that peaceful integration is even possible. He feels that black people in America are essentially stateless. "People talk about, 'We gonna fight back.' We can't fight back when we're on enemy land," he said. Talking about it is overwhelming. "I'm tired," he said, his eyes welling up. "I'm so [expletive] tired." After Philando died, Crockett said all he did was work. He made good money but stopped paying his credit card bills. He coped by drinking. He moved through life as if in a metaphorical "blackout".  But now, for the first time in four years, at the intersection of Lake Street and Chicago with flames leaping from the buildings on all sides, Crockett felt something different. Something he knows others will find offensive. "I feel great," he said. "I feel alive." With his airport job on an indefinite hiatus due to the coronavirus pandemic, Crockett is buying up super-cheap plane tickets. From Minneapolis he flies to Nashville, Tennessee. From there he'll go to Atlanta, Georgia. Then it's on to Cleveland, Ohio, and the nation's capitol, Washington, DC.  "I'm gonna talk everywhere I go," he said. "I'm going to represent Philando everywhere I go." He said he wants to see the revolution first-hand. "All it takes is one little spark to light everything the [expletive] up and that's what happened. Minneapolis - this little bitty ass place," he said.  "It's so beautiful. It's so beautiful. It's absolutely beautiful."

The inquiry will examine tax schemes in 10 jurisdictions including the UK, European Union and India. It is the first step in a process that could lead to the introduction of tariffs, or other trade retaliation. The Treasury defended the UK levy, saying it did not violate "international obligations". "Our Digital Services Tax ensures that digital businesses pay tax in the UK that reflects the value they derive from UK users, and is compatible with the UK's international obligations," a spokesperson said. The probe comes as a rising number of countries consider new taxes on online services, arguing that firms pay too little under current law and should be taxed based on where sales or activity takes place, rather than where they are headquartered. The US, home to many big tech companies such as Google and Amazon, has said the issue should be addressed in a multilateral agreement via the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.  But those discussions have been slow-going, prompting many countries to forge ahead on their own.  In the UK, a 2% tax on digital sales came into force in April. Lawmakers in Spain are expected to take up the matter this week. "President Trump is concerned that many of our trading partners are adopting tax schemes designed to unfairly target our companies," US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement.  "We are prepared to take all appropriate action to defend our businesses and workers against any such discrimination." Officials have said in the past that the administration would consider taxes on foreign cars as retaliation. Last year, after France moved forward with a 3% tax on sales, the US threatened tariffs on $2.4bn (£1.9bn) worth of French goods, including cheese and champagne, after a similar investigation declared the new levy "discriminatory". The US dropped the threat this winter after France agreed to delay collection until the end of 2020.  The Treasury added that the UK has said it would remove its services tax in the event of a broader deal.  "We have always been clear that our preference is for a global solution to the tax challenges posed by digitalisation and we'll continue to work with the US and other international partners to achieve that objective," a spokesperson said in a statement. The probe announced on Tuesday concerns taxes that have gone into effect, or are being planned, in Austria, Brazil, the Czech Republic, European Union, Indonesia, India, Italy, Turkey, Spain, and the UK. The US has requested comments on the matter, which must be submitted by 15 July.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Mark Zuckerberg is setting a "dangerous precedent" by allowing a post by Donald Trump to remain on Facebook, a group of civil rights leaders has warned. Their statement followed a video call with the social media giant's founder. The US president's post, about the widespread protests following the death of George Floyd, was hidden by Twitter last week for "glorifying violence". Facebook staff also voiced their anger at their employer, with some staging a "virtual walkout". In the post, the president wrote he would "send in the National Guard", and warned that "when the looting starts, the shooting starts".  Mr Trump shared the same message on Twitter, where it was hidden behind a warning label, prompting an escalating row between Twitter and the White House. Mr Zuckerberg had previously defended his decision to leave the same post up on Facebook, saying he disagreed with Mr Trump's words but that people "should be able to see this for themselves". After meeting Mr Zuckerberg, three civil rights leaders responded that he was wrong. "We are disappointed and stunned by Mark's incomprehensible explanations for allowing the Trump posts to remain up," they said in a joint statement. "He did not demonstrate understanding of historic or modern-day voter suppression and he refuses to acknowledge how Facebook is facilitating Trump's call for violence against protesters.  "Mark is setting a very dangerous precedent for other voices who would say similar harmful things on Facebook." Mr Zuckerberg defended his judgement to Facebook staff in a virtual question-and-answer session on Tuesday, according to the New York Times. It reported the chief executive had said he had made a "tough decision" but the social network's free speech principles meant that "the right action" was to leave President Trump's post up. The newspaper added, however, that some employees had claimed he was acting out of fear of what Republicans might do if Facebook acted otherwise. The joint statement, released on Monday night, was signed by Vanita Gupta, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights; Sherrilyn Ifill, director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund; and Rashad Robinson, president of Color of Change. It has been published online by Axios. A Facebook spokesman said: "We're grateful that leaders in the civil rights community took the time to share candid, honest feedback with Mark and Sheryl [Sandberg, Facebook's COO]. "It is an important moment to listen, and we look forward to continuing these conversations." Online therapy firm TalkSpace has pulled out of talks about a partnership deal with the social media giant over its decision to leave the post up. "We will not support a platform that incites violence, racism, and lies," chief executive Oren Frank tweeted. The deal would have been worth "hundreds of thousands of dollars" to TalkSpace, Mr Frank told CNBC. Former Facebook executive Barry Schnitt wrote an open letter to current staff saying he believed he had been wrong to defend the firm's approach to freedom of speech in the past. "Promoting free speech shouldn't be used as a get-out-of-tough-choices card," said Mr Schnitt, who was director of corporate communications and public policy for four years. In leaked audio, Mr Zuckerberg said his initial reaction to the Trump post was "disgust", reports The Verge. "This is not how I think we want our leaders to show up during this time," he is heard to say.BBC News app users should go here to see this story in full Athletes and teams around the world have taken a blackout on social media in response to George Floyd's death. Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American man, died on 25 May after a white police officer knelt on his neck for several minutes. Minneapolis policeman Derek Chauvin has been sacked and charged with third-degree murder.  In the meantime, protests have swept across the US and the UK - and sports stars have added their voices in various ways too. On Tuesday, across the world, people and organisations have been sharing a simple, but striking message of protest, with a social media 'blackout'. 'Blackout Tuesday' began as an initiative in the music industry, with record labels promising, "a day to disconnect from work and reconnect with our community".  The message has spread beyond music and Instagram, in particular, has been flooded with blacked-out images in a show of solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. In the US, major NBA stars have shared the same message. Major footballers across the world have also shown solidarity. As have some football teams across Europe. Last April, professional footballers in England and Wales took part in a similar, 24-hour social media boycott, to protest against the way social networks and football authorities respond to racism. A number of major cricket and rugby stars and teams have also joined the blackout. It's a simple, but powerful message, although there has been some criticism that the amount of posts using the #blacklivesmatter hashtag are making it difficult for people to find information about activism and donations. The blackout is also just one of many ways that athletes, among others, have joined what has become a truly international discussion about race, police brutality and equality.

                         On Monday, Liverpool players paused during training to take a knee, while the Newcastle squad did the same on Tuesday. That act has been a widely recognised gesture of protest against racism and police brutality ever since then San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick kneeled during the US national anthem in August 2016.   In a post on his Instagram, Manchester United and France midfielder Paul Pogba said that he felt, "anger, pity, hatred, indignation, pain, sadness". In Germany, Jadon Sancho and Marcus Thuram joined protests. England forward Sancho was booked for unveiling a 'Justice for George Floyd' t-shirt after scoring for Borussia Dortmund on Sunday, but German FA president Fritz Keller said he felt "respect and understanding" for players protesting. In boxing, Floyd Mayweather has offered to pay the funeral costs for Floyd.  Sports always reflects culture, to a degree. These are not new forms of protest and it's not the first time that the like has been seen, but the sheer breadth and scale of sportspeople and organisations getting involved is impressive.

BBC Radio 1Xtra is hosting a series of discussions and debates in support of the black community, with song choices that reflect black pride and identity. Many record labels and music stars have stopped work to observe the initiative. MTV went silent for eight minutes - the length of time a white police officer knelt on Mr Floyd's neck. The gesture has been replicated on other channels including VH1 and Comedy Central, while 4 Music will pause its output once an hour throughout the day. There have also been moments of reflection on BBC Radio 1 and Radio 2, while commercial radio stations including Kiss, Magic and Absolute Radio are observing a social media blackout "to show that racism of any kind cannot be tolerated".

It's everybody's."@gregjames spoke about George Floyd's death, racism, and what you can do. pic.twitter.com/7FSwwkXwAW End of Twitter post  by @BBCR1 ITV daytime show This Morning briefly went dark, showing a black screen with the words "Black Lives Matter".  Presenter Alison Hammond later said Mr Floyd's death "hurt me to the pit of my stomach". "Firstly, I am a mother of a 15-year-old black boy," she said. "When I saw that image of George Floyd, I saw my brothers, I saw my father and I saw my son, I saw everybody's son and I was disgusted to my core. "If black lives mattered, we wouldn't be in this situation." Big love to Alison Hammond for also sharing her pain with us today  pic.twitter.com/VRI35RT46z End of Twitter post  by @MikeJ_C Apple Music's Zane Lowe tweeted that he would skip Tuesday's edition of his radio show, saying he stood "united with his black and brown friends and colleagues". "I will not be on radio. I will be taking part in Blackout Tuesday, listening, learning and looking for solutions to fight racial inequality," the DJ added. On Radio 1, Clara Amfo gave a powerful speech about the effects of racism and the recent events on her mental health. The broadcaster said Mr Floyd's death reinforced a feeling among black people "that people want our culture, but they do not want us". Music companies and musicians around the world adopted Tuesday as a day of reflection and protest in the wake of Mr Floyd's death last week in Minneapolis. Katy Perry posted a plain black square to her Instagram account with the caption: "I hope that #BlackoutTuesday gives us all (especially in the music industry) an opportunity to take what we're learning and put it into action on Wednesday, and every day going forward." Rihanna said her Fenty beauty label would not conduct any business on Tuesday. Apple's iTunes store and its streaming service Apple Music replaced their usual carousels of new music and playlists with a slide stating: "This moment calls upon us all to speak and act against racism and injustice of all kinds." Listeners were then directed to a livestream of the Beats 1 radio station, where the music is focusing on themes of black empowerment and civil rights. (All of the service's usual tracks were still available through the search function, however.) Spotify, meanwhile, blacked out the artwork for several of its most prominent playlists, including Today's Hits and Rap Caviar. The company also inserted a silence of eight minutes and 46 seconds into selected podcasts and playlists "as a solemn acknowledgement for the length of time that George Floyd was suffocated". The movement began last Friday, when a number of companies and artists shared a statement posted under the hashtag #TheShowMustBePaused, calling for "a day to disconnect from work and reconnect with our community" and "an urgent step of action to provoke accountability and change". The initiative was started by Atlantic Records marketing executives Brianna Agyemang and Jamila Thomas, and spread by hundreds of artists including Billie Eilish, Britney Spears, the Rolling Stones, Radiohead, producer Quincy Jones and Eminem. "Tuesday, June 2nd is meant to intentionally disrupt the work week," wrote Agyemang and Thomas.  "The music industry is a multi-billion dollar industry. An industry that has profited predominantly from Black art. Our mission is to hold the industry at large, including major corporations + their partners who benefit from the efforts, struggles and successes of black people accountable." They have subsequently posted several calls to action, including a reading list called Anti-Racism Resources and links to community action groups. #TheShowMustBePaused pic.twitter.com/JHTUG34Ibj End of Twitter post  by @pausetheshow All three major record labels - Universal, Sony and Warner Music, whose combined annual revenues exceed $16bn (£12.75bn) - signed up to the initiative, as did many independent labels, the Glastonbury Festival and event organisers Live Nation. Interscope Records also vowed to stop releasing new music for a week, while many others donated money to the George Floyd Memorial Fund. But some people in the music industry criticised the initiative's lack of clarity and direction, dismissing it as "virtue signalling". "I love you all, but this music industry shutdown thing feels tone deaf to me," wrote indie musician Bon Iver on Twitter, although he later apologised for "calling out people when they are on the same side as you". Indie labels Father/Daughter Records and Don Giovanni also said they did not plan to observe the blackout. "If BLM [Blacks Lives Matter] calls for the music industry to take action, we will," wrote the latter on its Twitter page. "But I have no interest in supporting major label record executive white guilt day."  However, Agyemang and Thomas have stressed the blackout is just the beginning of a larger campaign. "This is not just a 24-hour initiative," they wrote. "We are and will be in this fight for the long haul. A plan of action will be announced." Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

The Republican politician was giving evidence to an inquiry by the House of Commons' Defence Select Committee into the security of 5G. Mr Cotton added that the US, UK and other allies could team up to develop superior 5G technologies of their own. Huawei said the claims lacked evidence. "Today's committee concentrated on America's desire for a home-grown 5G company that can 'match' or 'beat' Huawei," said its UK chief Victor Zhang. "It's clear that market position, rather than security concerns, is what underpins America's attack on Huawei.  "The committee was given no evidence to substantiate security allegations." Mr Cotton is among a group of US lawmakers pressing the UK to ban Huawei.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced in January that the firm would be allowed to supply radio masts and other equipment for use in the periphery of the UK's 5G networks, so long as its market share did not exceed 35% by 2023. Senator Cotton has previously suggested that Britain could lose its foreign investment "white list" status - which exempts its companies from increased US scrutiny of their foreign investments - if Downing Street does not reverse course. The senator is also proposing legislation to delay US F-35 combat aircraft being stationed within any country that uses Huawei in its 5G networks. Speaking to the defence committee, Mr Cotton noted that he was not speaking on behalf of the US government. But he claimed that using Huawei in the UK infrastructure could "give PLA [China's People's Liberation Army] hackers a window into our military logistics operations", which could put US forces and American weapons systems based in England "at dangerous risk".  He added that as the US continued to build up forces in the Pacific, the case for keeping some US Air Force assets in the UK was already contested in Washington, and if Huawei was used in the UK infrastructure there would be an operational risk that would not be faced in other places. Mr Cotton said the "scales had fallen from a lot of eyes" in the last six months when it came to China. And he suggested that members of the G7 could work with South Korea, India and other European nations to create new telecom equipment companies of their own. "I have no doubt that we have the talent, the productive capability, the innovative and entrepreneurial spirit to develop 5G technologies with software and hardware that will far surpass in quality, performance and price, anything that China produces," he said. The committee also took evidence from 5G Action Now, a lobby group that advocates for the development of American technologies, and the Washington-based Hudson Institute think tank. While Huawei said that Senator Cotton's claims were unfounded, it added that it welcomed "open and fair competition as it fosters innovation and drives down costs". "For 20 years, we have worked hard with our customers and partners to build Britain's robust and secure 3G and 4G networks and we are now focused on delivering the 5G network to the same high standards," said Mr Zhang. "This is fundamental to achieving the government's Gigabit broadband target by 2025."  The hearing coincided with a review of Huawei's role in the UK, which is being carried out by GCHQ's National Cyber Security Centre.  It will determine whether new US sanctions against the firm - which ban Huawei from using computer chips made or designed with US equipment - pose an unmanageable risk to British network providers' use of the firm's kit.

The Oscar-winner said the reasons for the current unrest included the deaths of black people like George Floyd but also wider injustices and inequalities. "It's not like you're just born angry," he told BBC arts editor Will Gompertz. Lee also said President Trump's response showed that "he's a gangster, he's trying to be a dictator". Mr Trump has threatened to send in the military to quell growing civil unrest across the US. On Monday, the president walked from the White House to a nearby fire-damaged church to pose with a Bible, after demonstrators were cleared from his path. Lee, whose new Netflix film Da 5 Bloods follows a group of African-American war veterans, said: "I was watching this last night with my family and we were all screaming in disbelief that this thing was staged. "This show of force - gassing, beating innocent, peaceful bystanders so you could clear the street so you could take a walk to the church. It was ridiculous." He added: "The Bible did not look comfortable in his hand, and he didn't look comfortable holding the Bible either. I have never seen something like that before in my life, particularly with a world leader." In his speech before walking to the church, Mr Trump said: "I am your president of law and order and an ally of all peaceful protesters." Many US cities have seen demonstrations and unrest since the death of 46-year-old Mr Floyd in Minneapolis on 25 May, when a white police officer knelt on his neck for almost nine minutes. On Sunday, Lee released a short film combining footage of Mr Floyd and Eric Garner, who was killed while being arrested in 2014, with a scene from his 1989 film Do the Right Thing in which the character Radio Raheem is murdered.  A state grand jury declined to press criminal charges against the officer involved in Mr Garner's death. "Why are people angry?" Lee said on Tuesday. "People are angry because black people are being killed left and right, cops walked away free. "Black and brown people are angry at the disparity between the haves and have-nots - education, drinking dirty water, racism. "People are angry for a reason. It's not like you're just born angry. You're angry because you live every day in this world where the system is not set up for you to win.  "The life expectancy… There are just so many things that one could make a list of [them] forever - that's where the anger's from. "It's a stupid analogy, but if you leave the pot on the stove, the water boils." Social inequalities have been particularly evident during the coronavirus pandemic, he said, with people from minorities more likely to die after contracting the disease. "It's the black and brown people who had to go to work, front-liners of all aspects, they kept this [country] going," he said. And racism is far from being unique to the US, he added.  "Racism is all over the world. This was a global pandemic before corona. "I'm a very spiritual person and I don't think that's a coincidence that these two things are happening at the same time." He traced the inequalities in the US back to the country's foundation. "The land was stolen from native people, genocide was committed against the native people, and ancestors were stolen from Africa and brought here to work," he said. "So the foundation of the United States of America is genocide, stealing land and slavery. "Any architect will tell you that if you don't have a strong foundation, the building's going to be shaky, and shaky from day one... This original sin has not been dealt with since the birth of this country." Da 5 Bloods is on Netflix from 12 June. Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

He said if cities and states failed to control the protests and "defend their residents" he would deploy the army and "quickly solve the problem for them". Protests over the death of George Floyd have escalated over the past week. Presidential candidate Joe Biden criticised Mr Trump on Tuesday for "serving the passions of his base". "We're not going to allow any president to quiet our voice," the Democrat said, referencing the US constitution which guarantees protestors' freedom to assemble. On Tuesday the Las Vegas sheriff said an officer died in a shooting after police attempted to disperse a crowd. Dozens of people have been injured as authorities used tear gas and force to disperse protests which have swept more than 75 cities. Four officers meanwhile were shot and injured on Monday night during unrest in St Louis, Missouri. Dozens of major cities have imposed overnight curfews. The protests began after a video showed Mr Floyd, 46, being arrested in Minneapolis on 25 May and a white police officer continuing to kneel on his neck even after he pleaded that he could not breathe. The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with third-degree murder and will appear in court next week. Three other police officers have been fired. The Floyd case has reignited deep-seated anger over police killings of black Americans and racism. It follows the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri; Eric Garner in New York; and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement. For many, the outrage also reflects years of frustration over socio-economic inequality and discrimination, not least in Minneapolis itself. The president delivered a brief address from the White House Rose Garden, amid the sound of a nearby protest being dispersed. Mr Trump said "all Americans were rightly sickened and revolted by the brutal death of George Floyd" but said his memory must not be "drowned out by an angry mob". He described the scenes of looting and violence in the capital on Sunday as "a total disgrace" before pledging to bolster the city's defences. "I'm dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property," he said. He called on cities and states to deploy the National Guard, the reserve military force that can be called on to intervene in domestic emergencies, "in sufficient numbers that we dominate the streets". About 16,000 troops have been deployed so far. Mr Trump added: "If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary... then I'll deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them." In order to take that step, the president would have to invoke the Insurrection Act, which in some circumstances first requires a request from state governors for him to do so. This law was last invoked in 1992 during riots in Los Angeles following the acquittal of four police officers charged with assaulting black motorist Rodney King. Mr Trump's warning was met with swift criticism from senior Democrats. Joe Biden, the party's presumptive presidential candidate, said Mr Trump "[was] using the American military against the American people". Following his address, Mr Trump walked to a nearby church which had been damaged by protesters on Sunday night. He and a number of aides stood at the steps of the building as Mr Trump held up a Bible in front of the gathered press. His actions were condemned by Washington's Episcopalian bishop, Mariann Budde. "He took the symbols sacred to our tradition and stood in front of a house of prayer in full expectation that would be a celebratory moment," she said. "There was nothing I could do but speak out against that." Throughout Monday, pressure grew on Donald Trump to take action to address the rising unrest in major cities across the US. As the sun set in Washington DC, in a hastily arranged Rose Garden address, the president outlined what that action would be. Governors were warned that if they did not effectively secure property and safety on the streets, the president would cite a centuries-old law to dispatch the US Army on American soil. And in the District of Columbia, which is under federal authority, the president had already ordered the military to deploy in force. Moments before the president spoke, promising he was on the side of peaceful protesters, those armed soldiers cleared out peaceful protesters from Lafayette Square, across the street from the White House. It set the stage for the president to walk with his senior staff across the park to St John's Church, which was lightly damaged in a fire set by rioters the previous evening - an important symbolic gesture or an unnecessary photo opportunity, depending on one's perspective. Posing in front of the building with a Bible, he promised that America was "coming back strong" and "it won't take long". There was no talk of police reforms or the root causes of the protests that began last week at any point in the evening's proceedings. Instead, he said he was the "president of law and order" - a sign, it seems, that his solution to the ongoing crisis will be an escalation of force. How has the unrest affected you?

Bristol Dry Gin's advert said rioters would like its "high flammability" amid widespread protests in the US about the death of George Floyd. A retailer and a cafe said they had removed the gin from sale. The firm apologised and said it was "way out of line." The Bristol Pantry has removed the company as a supplier while vegan deli Flip said it had "no intention of continuing stock". The phrase "when the looting starts, the shooting starts" was coined by Miami Police Chief Walter Headley in 1967, in reference to his aggressive policing policies in black neighbourhoods. President Trump's tweet using the phrase was recently hidden by Twitter for "glorifying violence." This is not the first time the company has courted controversy, with an apology over a 'Novichok' vodka range in 2018, posted around the time of the Salisbury Novichok poisonings. Twitter users criticised the gin company's adverts, which have since been deleted.  Bristol Dry Gin said it was "way out of line with a recent post which made light of the very serious situation, and follow up messages". "We're really sorry, we clearly caused major offence," it added. "It doesn't change anything but we've today made a donation to Black Lives Matter, who have been very helpful. "We have been in contact with SARI (Stand Against Racism and Inequality) in Bristol to support their work with profits from the gin."Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Last night he held a Bible in front of St John's Episcopal Church, just across the road from the White House. Today, he'll visit the Shrine to St John Paul II, also in Washington DC. But US President Donald Trump's signalling of religious affiliation has not been welcomed by a range of clerics as the nation struggles to manage the twin challenges of a pandemic and widespread political protest. The Episcopal Bishop of Washington, the Right Reverend Mariann Budde, said: "The president just used a Bible, the most sacred text of the Judeo-Christian tradition, and one of the churches of my diocese, without permission, as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus." James Martin, a Jesuit priest and consultant to the Vatican's communications department, tweeted: "Let me be clear. This is revolting. The Bible is not a prop. A church is not a photo op. Religion is not a political tool. God is not your plaything." Rabbi Jack Moline, President of the Interfaith Alliance, said: "Seeing President Trump standing in front of St John's Episcopal Church while holding a Bible in response to calls for racial justice - right after using military force to clear peaceful protesters - is one of the most flagrant misuses of religion that I have ever seen." President Trump does not belong to a particular congregation, only occasionally attends a service and has said many times that he does not like to ask God for forgiveness. But while he may not consider church essential to his personal life, it may yet hold the keys to his political future. In 2016, Mr Trump won 81% of white evangelical votes and exit polls found that white Catholics supported him over Hillary Clinton by 60% to 37%. Mr Trump's status, as the champion of evangelical and conservative voters, can seem peculiar given his use of divisive rhetoric, his three marriages, accusations of sexual assault by dozens of women, the hush-money paid to a pornographic film actress, and the record of false statements made during his presidency - more than 18,000 according to the Poynter Institute's Politifact website. But he has sealed a powerful bond with religious voters by embracing their political priorities and appointing two Supreme Court justices - Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch - and federal judges with their support. This may explain why - though an irregular congregant himself - the president has repeatedly demanded the reopening of churches, saying, on 22 May, "If they don't do it, I will override the governors." Religious conservatives appear to be the most solid core of Mr Trump's voter base, despite political unrest and the vast number of deaths from Covid-19.  According to the latest Pew Research Poll, 75% of white evangelical Protestants say he's doing a good job in handling the pandemic - down 6 percentage points from six weeks before. But while one voting bloc remains faithful, the country at large is deeply divided. According to analysis by the website FiveThirtyEight, which collates all polling data, 43% of Americans agree with the president's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, while 53.4% disapprove. Several religious leaders are hoping that Trump's visit to the shrine may encourage him to reflect on the words of then Pope John Paul II, delivered to the United Nations in 1995. "The answer to the fear which darkens human existence at the end of the 20th Century," he said, "is the common effort to build the civilization of love."Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Dozens of journalists covering anti-racism protests that have rocked the US have reported being targeted by security forces using tear gas, rubber bullets and pepper spray. In many cases, they said it was despite showing clear press credentials. Such attacks "are an unacceptable attempt to intimidate [reporters]", said the Committee to Protect Journalists, a New York-based group. Attacks on journalists carried out by protesters have also been reported. The arrest of a CNN news crew live on air on Friday in Minneapolis, where unarmed black man George Floyd died at the hands of police, first drew global attention to how law enforcement authorities in the city were treating reporters covering protests that have descended into riots.  On Tuesday, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison asked his embassy in Washington to investigate the use of force by police against an Australian news crew as officers dispersed protesters there the previous day. SHOCKING: to see members of the media also taking direct, *intentional* punches and swings from police as they cleared the streets of protesters outside the White House. #protest #Washington #WashingtonDCProtest   #PictureOfTheDay pic.twitter.com/7zR154O6Jg End of Twitter post  by @ScottThuman It comes after dozens of attacks on journalists and media crews across the country over the weekend were reported on social media. In total the US Press Freedom Tracker, a non-profit project, says it is investigating more than 100 "press freedom violations" at protests. About 90 cases involve attacks.  On Saturday night, two members of a TV crew from Reuters news agency were shot at with rubber bullets while police dispersed protesters in Minneapolis defying an 20:00 curfew. "A police officer that I'm filming turns around points his rubber-bullet rifle straight at me," cameraman Julio-Cesar Chavez said. Reuters said the Minneapolis Police Department had not commented despite being provided with video footage.  In Washington DC, near the White House, a riot police officer charged his shield at a BBC cameraman on Sunday evening.  The cameraman was "clearly identifiable as a member of the media", said the BBC's Americas bureau chief Paul Danahar. "The team had been following all directions from the police as they covered the protests in front of the White House. The assault took place even before the curfew had been imposed and happened without warning or provocation". On the same day, on the other side of the country in Long Beach, California, radio reporter Adolfo Guzman-Lopez said he had been shot in the throat with a rubber bullet by a police officer. The city's police chief told reporters on Monday that he wanted to investigate what happened, adding: "I do not want anyone from the media to get hurt." I just got hit by a rubber bullet near the bottom of my throat. I had just interviewed a man with my phone at 3rd and Pine and a police officer aimed and shot me in the throat, I saw the bullet bounce onto the street  @LAist @kpcc OK, that’s one way to stop me, for a while pic.twitter.com/9C2u5KmscG End of Twitter post  by @AGuzmanLopez Overnight on Friday, a Fox News crew were chased and hit by a mob of masked protesters near the White House. "It's the most scared I've been since being caught in a mob that turned on us in Tahrir Square [in the Egyptian capital Cairo]," veteran Fox correspondent Leland Vittert said.  To put some perspective on the unprecedented nature of the weekend's attacks on journalists: At @USPressTracker, we've documented 100-150 press freedom violations in the US per year, for the last 3 years. We are currently investigating *over 100* FROM JUST THE LAST 3 DAYS. End of Twitter post  by @uspresstracker On Saturday, Vice News journalist Michael Anthony Adams said he was pepper-sprayed in the face at a petrol station by Minneapolis police despite holding his press card in the air and yelling "Press!"

She has been permanently blinded in that eye.  That same night a reporter from local news station Wave 3 in Louisville, Kentucky was hit by pepper balls fired by a police officer aiming directly at her as she reported live on television. "I'm getting shot! I'm getting shot!" she said. A spokeswoman for the Louisville police said on Saturday that they were trying to identify which officer was involved. "Targeting the media is not our intention," the spokeswoman said. A reporter from Germany's international news broadcaster Deutsche Welle was also shot with projectiles by police in Minneapolis this weekend while preparing to go live on air. He was wearing a vest emblazoned with the word "PRESS" and was also threatened with arrest, a video showed. "Those policemen are under a lot of stress doing their job but of course they should have let us work and do our job," Stefan Simons, the reporter, said.  A DW reporter and his camera operator have been shot at with projectiles by Minneapolis police and threatened with arrest while covering the protests sparked by the death of George Floyd. pic.twitter.com/SFKMv5SFW6 End of Twitter post  by @dwnews On Sunday, Minnesota's governor apologised to those who had been detained in his state. "I want to once again extend my deepest apologies, to the journalists who were once again in the middle of this situation who were inadvertently, but nevertheless, detained - to them personally and to the news organisations and to journalists everywhere," Tim Walz said. The incidents come as President Donald Trump continues to attack the media. On Sunday he tweeted: "The Lamestream Media is doing everything within their power to foment hatred and anarchy." He said journalists were "truly bad people with a sick agenda". Several press freedom organisation have condemned the attacks. "The numerous, targeted attacks that journalists reporting on protests across the country have faced from law enforcement over the last two nights are both reprehensible and clear violations of the First Amendment," the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press said. Courtney Radsch, advocacy director at the Committee to Protect Journalists, told the BBC that the group was calling on authorities to "instruct police to cease targeting journalists and ensure that they are able to do their jobs safely and without fear of injury".Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window An Iranian scientist detained in the United States has left the country and is on his way back to Iran, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has said. Sirous Asgari, a materials science professor from Tehran, was charged in 2016 with trying to trade secrets research from an American university.  He was acquitted by a federal court in November. It was reported last month that Mr Asgari would be deported once he had recovered from a Covid-19 infection. The US and Iran have denied that he is part of a prisoner swap. In a post on Instagram on Tuesday morning, Mr Zarif welcomed what he described as the "good news" of Mr Asgari's return on a flight to Iran, but accused the US of holding "hostage" several other Iranian scientists. The 59-year-old professor at Sharif University of Technology was accused by US prosecutors of stealing trade secrets from a research project being carried out by Case Western Reserve University in Ohio for the US Navy. He denied the charge and a judge eventually threw out the prosecution's case. His return to Iran led to speculation that he could be part of another prisoner swap. At least six US citizens are currently imprisoned in Iran or out on bail. They include US Navy veteran Michael White, who was temporarily released from prison in March on medical grounds and is in the care of the Swiss embassy in Tehran. In response to Mr Zarif's Instagram post, Acting US Deputy Homeland Security Secretary Ken Cuccinelli tweeted that Mr Asgari and Mr White's cases had "never been related". "We have been trying to deport Asghari since last year, being stalled every step of the way by the Iranian government. We wish Iran was so enthusiastic to get its illegal nationals back as they would have us all believe..." He added: "... so how about the Iranians take the other 10 currently in custody with removal orders? You haven't heard much about that, have you? If #Zarif wasn't blowing smoke, they would've already made arrangements for these other 10. But instead, they stall." Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Abbas Mousavi also said talk of a swap was "groundless", noting that Mr Asgari was "released on the basis of being acquitted". In December, the US and Iran conducted a prisoner swap in a rare sign of co-operation. Chinese-American researcher Xiyue Wang and Iranian scientist Massoud Soleimani were freed. Relations between the US and Iran have become increasingly hostile since 2018, when President Donald Trump abandoned the Iran nuclear deal.  Earlier this year, the US assassinated top Iranian commander Gen Qasem Soleimani in a drone strike in Iraq. Iran retaliated by launching ballistic missiles at Iraqi military bases hosting US forces.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window The death of George Floyd, which triggered widespread protests across the US, has been declared a homicide in an official post-mortem examination. The 46-year-old suffered a cardiac arrest while being restrained by Minneapolis police, the report found. It listed Mr Floyd's cause of death as "cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression". Meanwhile, President Donald Trump vowed to use the military to end the unrest. A video showing a white police officer continuing to kneel on Mr Floyd's neck even after he pleaded he could not breathe has reignited deep-seated anger over police killings of black Americans. It has led to six consecutive days of protests around the United States and a level of civil unrest not seen in decades. The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter and will appear in court next week. Three other police officers have been fired. The official post-mortem examination of Mr Floyd by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's office also recorded evidence of heart disease and recent drug use. It said he suffered the cardiac arrest "while being restrained by a law enforcement officer" on 25 May. The findings were released shortly after those of a private examination that was carried out by medical examiners hired by the Floyd family. This report said Mr Floyd died from asphyxia (lack of oxygen) due to a compression on his neck and also on his back. It also found the death was a homicide, a statement from the family's legal team said. "The cause of death in my opinion is asphyxia, due to compression to the neck - which can interfere with oxygen going to the brain - and compression to the back, which interferes with breathing," Dr Michael Baden, a former New York City medical examiner, said at a news conference on Monday. Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for the Floyd family, said: "Beyond doubt he would be alive today if not for the pressure applied to his neck by officer Derek Chauvin and the strain on his body by two other officers." He added: "The ambulance was his hearse." Also on Monday, during a brief televised address from the White House's Rose Garden, President Trump threatened to send in the military to end the protests if cities and states failed to control them. Speaking as the sounds of a nearby protest could be heard in the background, Mr Trump said "we are ending the riots and lawlessness" which he blamed on "professional anarchists" and anti-fascist group "Antifa". "I have strongly recommended to every governor to deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers that we dominate the streets," Mr Trump said.   The National Guard is the reserve military force that can be called on to intervene in domestic emergencies. About 16,000 of its troops have been deployed to deal with the unrest so far. Mr Trump added: "If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary... then I'll deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them." "I want the organisers of this terror to be on notice that you'll face severe criminal penalties," he said. Earlier, President Trump told state governors they had been "weak" and had to get "much tougher" and utilise troops from the National Guard. "You've got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff again," Mr Trump said in a video conference call, according to US media. More than 75 cities have seen protests over what happened to George Floyd. Streets that only days ago were deserted because of the coronavirus pandemic have filled with demonstrators marching shoulder to shoulder. The case follows the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Eric Garner in New York and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement. Protests kicked off for another evening on Monday and more than 40 cities have imposed or extended their curfews. Thousands of people marched in New York, and video footage on social media showed looting at major shops in Manhattan. Smaller protests took place in other cities including Los Angeles and Oakland. Elsewhere, the chief of Louisville Police in Kentucky was fired after law enforcement shot into a crowd and killed the owner of a nearby business. Mayor Greg Fischer said officers and troops involved in the shooting failed to activate body cameras. "This type of institutional failure will not be tolerated," he said. On Sunday, mostly peaceful demonstrations once again gave way to violence in many cities, with clashes erupting between police and protesters. Many videos shared on social media from across the US appeared to show riot police responding disproportionately to demonstrators. Dozens of attacks targeting journalists have been reported.

Mr Trump said on Saturday he would postpone the G7 summit scheduled to take place this month until September. The president said the G7's "outdated group of countries" should be expanded to include others, including Russia. On Sunday, Mr Trump told Russian President Vladimir Putin of his plan to invite him to the summit. The White House said making "progress toward convening the G7" with Russia was among the topics the leaders discussed in a phone call. The G7 summit, which the US hosts this year, convenes the leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the UK to discuss matters of co-operation. But Mr Trump's invitation to Mr Putin has drawn the ire of the UK and Canada, whose leaders said on Sunday they would not support Russia's readmission to the group. Russia was expelled from the group - previously known as the G8 - in 2014 in response to its annexation of Crimea. "Russia was excluded from the G7 after it invaded Crimea a number of years ago, and its continued disrespect and flaunting of international rules and norms is why it remains outside of the G7, and it will continue to remain out," Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said at a news conference.  Earlier, a spokesman for the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would veto any proposal to allow Russia to rejoin the group. Unless Russia ceases its "aggressive and destabilising activity", the UK would not support the country's readmission to the group, Mr Johnson's spokesman said.  "Russia was removed from the G7 group of nations following its [2014] annexation of Crimea and we are yet to see evidence of changed behaviour which would justify its readmittance," the spokesman told reporters. Neither the UK or Canadian position rules out Mr Putin's attendance of the summit in the US. Though representatives of non-G7 members have attended the group's summits before, Mr Putin's presence could prove contentious. In recent years, the UK has had an acrimonious relationship with Russia, which it blamed for a nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy in Salisbury, England in 2018. Despite opposition from other G7 members, Mr Trump has repeatedly expressed his support for Russia's return to the group. At a G7 summit in 2018, Mr Trump said he thought it "would be an asset to have Russia back in". Announcing the delay of this year's G7 summit on Saturday, Mr Trump echoed that sentiment.  He said he did not feel the group "properly represents what's going on in the world", suggesting Russia, South Korea, Australia and India should be invited. The leaders of South Korea and Australia have expressed interest in attending the summit in the US. Last week, German Chancellor Angela Merkel rejected the president's invitation to attend a summit in person because of the coronavirus pandemic. The G7 (or Group of Seven) is an organisation made up of the world's seven largest so-called advanced economies. The leaders of these countries meet annually at summits to discuss issues of global governance, including climate change, security and the economy. The group regards itself as "a community of values", with freedom and human rights, democracy and the rule of law, and prosperity and sustainable development as its key principles.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Over the weekend thousands of people chanted "Black Lives Matter" across the UK - at protests in London, Manchester and Cardiff. They were marching in support of protesters in America angered by the death of George Floyd on 25 May. He died nearly 4,000 miles away from the UK in Minnesota, but his death was felt here in our black community too. That's why people like Shayne defied UK government coronavirus guidance and went out to protest on the weekend. "We didn't expect that many people to turn up at the protests, it was mad," the 20-year-old tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. "The general vibe was electric because you could literally see that everybody was hurt." Shayne says she and her friends wore military boots to the London protest and were impressed to see lots of other women dressed like members of the Black Panther movement. "There were a lot of black women with their natural hair out," she says. "We wanted to show we're proud of who we are and that we shouldn't have to hide our blackness to stay alive." Shayne says although George Floyd was killed in the US, "we know that it happens here too", citing the case of Mark Duggan. He was a 29-year-old who was shot and killed in 2011 while police in London were trying to arrest him under suspicion of planning an attack and being in possession of a gun. His death sparked riots in London, where police officers are four times more likely to use force against black people than white people, and later across the UK. An inquest jury in 2014 found that Mark Duggan was lawfully killed. In 2016, ex-Aston Villa footballer Dalian Atkinson died when he was restrained by police and Tasered in Telford, Shropshire. Rasharn Charles died in hospital due to a cardiac arrest and obstructed airway during restraint from police officers in 2017. Last week a public inquiry was announced into the death of Sheku Bayoh in police custody in Scotland in 2015.  Protesters in London held signs bearing their names, and the names of other black people who have died after encounters with British police, at the weekend. "It's just very frustrating, I'm very angry and very tired. To constantly be hearing about black people being aimlessly killed for no reason is draining," Shayne says. "We have our issues within the black community but we are still very united.  "The prejudice that black people in America face is the same prejudice we face here. When one is hurt, we're all hurt, because it could have been us." In America, protests have led to violent clashes between protesters and police. The police officer who was seen with his knee on George Floyd's neck for nine minutes during his arrest for using a fake $20 note has been charged with murder. Eyram Kiakia, who's 20 and has a YouTube channel speaking about the UK Black Lives Matter movement, says she became more upset about the death of George Floyd the more she learned about his life. "I watched a few seconds of when they were kneeling on his neck but I wasn't able to finish watching it, I was really upset," she tells Newsbeat. "What upset me more was watching the videos of him as an activist and him being vocal about certain things in his community, they upset me more than the video of the police killing him." Eyram says people think the UK is more progressive on race than America, "when actually it isn't". The UK Home Office was accused of racism following the Windrush scandal - when black people who came to Britain as children were wrongly told they were here illegally and deported or threatened with deportation.  "Race clearly played a part in what occurred," the long-awaited review into what happened said earlier this year. The Grenfell Tower fire in 2017 and the Windrush scandal were mentioned by rapper Dave when he called Prime Minister Boris Johnson racist during a performance at the Brit Awards after winning album of the year - causing Home Secretary Priti Patel to defend the PM.  Eyram says racism in the UK is institutionalised and also evident in schools - where Black Caribbean pupils are more likely to be excluded than White British pupils - and the workplace.  "There's a lot of more covert things that have happened to us and still happen to us, like when we were in school they policed black people's hair, we weren't allowed certain hairstyles or colours even though our white counterparts were able to dye their hair any colour," she says. "In the workplace, there's always micro-aggressions. Everyone I know has experienced some sort of ignorant comment at the hands of a fellow employee or even an employer. "Just because it's so subtle and it's not overt, it doesn't mean it's not racist." Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

He died due to compression on his neck and back by Minneapolis police officers, medical examiners hired by the Floyd family said.  The findings differ from an official preliminary examination carried out by the county medical examiner. It did not find evidence of "traumatic asphyxia or strangulation". The official examination also said underlying health conditions played a role in Mr Floyd's death.  But the two doctors hired by the Floyd family found the death was a homicide, a statement from its legal team said.  "The cause of death in my opinion is asphyxia, due to compression to the neck - which can interfere with oxygen going to the brain - and compression to the back, which interferes with breathing," Dr Michael Baden, a former New York City medical examiner and one of the pair, said at a news conference. A video showing a white police officer continuing to kneel on George Floyd's neck even after he pleaded he could not breathe sparked outrage when it emerged a week ago. It has led to six consecutive days of protests around the United States and a level of civil unrest not seen this widely across the country in decades.  Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for the Floyd family, told Monday's news conference: "Beyond doubt he would be alive today if not for the pressure applied to his neck by officer Derek Chauvin and the strain on his body by two other officers." He added: "The ambulance was his hearse." Dr Baden said there was "no other health issue that could cause or contribute to the death". The findings contradict those of a preliminary post-mortem examination that was included in the criminal complaint against Mr Chauvin, who has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter.  The medical examiner noted in that report that Mr Floyd had underlying heart conditions and said the combination of these, "potential intoxicants in his system" and being restrained by the officers "likely contributed to his death". The full official death examination is yet to be released by the office of the Hennepin County Medical Examiner. It says it is awaiting more results from laboratory studies.  The Floyd family and their lawyers say the charge against Mr Chauvin should be increased to first-degree murder. They say the private post-mortem examination proves two other officers filmed kneeling on his back also contributed to his death. More than 75 cities have seen protests over what happened to George Floyd, with streets only days ago deserted because of coronavirus full of demonstrators marching shoulder to shoulder. The case has reignited deep-seated anger over police killings of black Americans and racism. It follows the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Eric Garner in New York and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement. On Sunday, mostly peaceful demonstrations once again gave way to violence in many cities, with clashes erupting between police and protesters. Police cars were burned, buildings were torched and shops looted in several places. Dozens of cities imposed curfews but they were defied.  On Monday, President Trump told state governors they had been "weak" and had to get "much tougher", and utilise troops from the National Guard, thousands of whom have already been activated in two dozen states. "You've got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff again," Mr Trump said in a video conference call, according to US media.  There have been scenes of violence in Washington DC in recent nights, including near the White House. Demonstrators lit fire to buildings including a historic church known as the church of the presidents overnight on Sunday. Many videos shared on social media from across the US appeared to show riot police responding disproportionately to demonstrators. Dozens of attacks targeting journalists have been reported.  The curfew in Washington DC has been extended for another two nights and will start at 19:00 on Monday. A curfew starting at 23:00 had been in effect on Sunday. New York City is also imposing a citywide curfew on Monday from 23:00 until 05:00 on Tuesday. "The violence and the looting has been bad for the city, the state and this entire national movement, undermining and distracting from this righteous cause," said New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Violence has erupted in cities across the US over the death of African-American George Floyd, after he was physically restrained by police in Minneapolis. We've looked at some of the data around crime and justice in the US, and what it shows about the experience of African-Americans when it comes to law and order. The figures that are available for incidents in which the police shoot and kill people show that for African-Americans, there's a much higher chance of being fatally shot relative to their overall numbers in the US population. In fact, in 2019, although African-Americans made up less than 14% of the population (according to official census figures), they accounted for more than 23% of the just over 1,000 fatal shootings by the police.  And that figure has been relatively consistent since 2017, whereas the number of white victims has come down since then. African-Americans are arrested for drug abuse at a much higher rate than white Americans, although surveys show drug use at similar levels. In 2018, around 750 out of every 100,000 African-Americans were arrested for drug abuse, compared to around 350 out of every 100,000 white Americans.  Previous national surveys on drug use show that white people use drugs at similar rates, but African-Americans continue to get arrested at a higher rate. For example, a study by the American Civil Liberties Union found that African-Americans were 3.7 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than whites, even though their rate of marijuana usage was comparable. African-Americans are imprisoned at five times the rate of white Americans and at almost twice the rate of Hispanic-Americans, according to the latest data. In 2018, African-Americans made up around 13% of the US population, but represented almost a third of the country's prison population.  White Americans made up around 30% of the prison population - despite representing more than 60% of the total US population. That's more than 1,000 African-American prisoners for every 100,000 African-Americans, compared to around 200 white inmates for every 100,000 white Americans. The US prison population is defined as inmates sentenced to more than a year in a federal or state prison.  Imprisonment rates have dropped for African-Americans over the last decade, but they still make up more of the prison population than any other race.

                                 A memorial service for George Floyd is held in Minneapolis.  Those gathered in tribute stand in silence for eight minutes, 46 seconds, the amount of time Mr Floyd is alleged to have been on the ground under arrest. Hundreds attended the service, which heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton.

Dozens of cities imposed curfews, but many people ignored them, leading to stand-offs and clashes. Riot police faced off with protesters in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and LA, firing tear gas and pepper bullets to try to disperse crowds. Police vehicles were set on fire and shops were looted in several cities.  The country is experiencing the most widespread racial turbulence and civil unrest since the backlash to the assassination of Martin Luther King in 1968.  The outpouring of anger began last Tuesday, after a video showed Mr Floyd being arrested in Minneapolis and a white police officer continuing to kneel on his neck even after he pleaded he could not breathe and fell unconscious. More than 75 cities have seen protests, with streets only days ago deserted because of coronavirus full of demonstrators marching shoulder to shoulder. Some US officials have warned of protest-connected virus outbreaks.  The Floyd case has reignited deep-seated anger over police killings of black Americans and racism. It follows the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Eric Garner in New York and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement. For many, the outrage also reflects years of frustration over socio-economic inequality and discrimination, not least in Minneapolis itself, where George Floyd died. About 16,000 troops from the National Guard - the US reserve military force for domestic emergencies - have been deployed to deal with the unrest across 24 states and Washington, DC, where crowds once again gathered near the White House on Sunday night. Demonstrators lit fire to buildings there, including a historic church known as the church of the presidents, and threw stones at riot officers. Police used tear gas in response. In Louisville, Kentucky, a man was shot dead in a confrontation between protesters, police and the National Guard after midnight. Shots were fired at police officers and guard troops as they moved to disperse a crowd in a car park and they "returned fire", leaving one man dead, Louisville Metro Police said. As on Friday and Saturday, demonstrations that had been peaceful during the day again descended into violence as night fell. Police vehicles were vandalised and set alight in several cities, while riot officers continued to respond with tear gas and flash grenades.  At least 4,400 people have been arrested in several days of protests, according to the Associated Press news agency, for offences including blocking motorways, looting and breaking curfew. On Monday, President Trump told state governors  in a videoconference that they looked "weak", according to leaked audio obtained by CBS. "You have to dominate, if you don't dominate you're wasting your time," the president reportedly said. A 19:00 curfew has now been imposed in Washington DC for Monday and Tuesday nights.  In Minneapolis, a lorry driver was arrested after reportedly breaching a road barrier before speeding towards a crowd of protesters marching along a major motorway. The driver was taken to hospital with minor injuries and later to the county jail.  There were no immediate reports of other casualties.  Minnesota's Governor Tim Walz said the motive of the driver was unclear, adding: "To not have tragedy and many deaths is simply an amazing thing." Many videos shared on social media appeared to show riot police responding disproportionately to demonstrators. In Atlanta, Georgia, two officers were sacked on Sunday for using excessive force - including using a taser on two young college students.  Dozens of journalists have also spoken out about being targeted by police despite making clear they are with the media. A BBC cameraman was charged at by a shield-carrying officer near the White House. There have also been protests in European cities, including London, Dublin, Berlin, Zurich and Brussels. For three years, Donald Trump presided over a nation of relative peace and prosperity. The crises he faced were largely of his own making, and he confronted them by rallying his supporters and condemning his opponents. Now Trump faces a situation ill-suited to a playbook of division. The US economy has been hobbled by a deadly pandemic. George Floyd's death at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer has spread racial unrest across the nation. The public is uncertain and afraid - and increasingly angry. These are circumstances that would test the abilities of even the most skilful leaders. This president, however, risks becoming lost at sea. His public calls for unity and healing have been undermined by a penchant for Twitter name-calling and bellicosity. Message discipline, a valuable attribute at this moment, is not his forte. There may be no easy way to guide the nation through its current peril. Barack Obama's measured coolness did nothing to stop the fires of Ferguson any more than Richard Nixon's law-and-order edicts quelled Vietnam-era unrest. The economic and social devastation of the pandemic has created a political landscape of dry brush ignited by the lightning strike of Floyd's death. The president may not be able to contain the wildfire, even if he isn't feeding the flames. Terrence Floyd, George's younger brother, told ABC News he condemned the violent protests, saying his brother stood for peace. "I'm outraged too," he said. "Sometimes I get angry... I want to go crazy. My brother wasn't about that. My brother was about peace. You'll hear a lot of people saying: 'He was a gentle giant.' "I just had to come down here to speak to people, and let people know, just channel your anger elsewhere. Don't tear up your town." On the evening of 25 May, police were called to a grocery store where George Floyd had allegedly paid for cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 note. They found him in his car outside and tried to put him in a police vehicle, but Mr Floyd dropped to the ground, telling officers he was claustrophobic.  According to police, he physically resisted and was handcuffed. Video of the incident does not clearly show what happened at that point. Bystander footage shows three police officers kneeling on the unarmed Mr Floyd, with officer Derek Chauvin's knee on his neck. Mr Floyd can be heard saying "please, I can't breathe" several times and "don't kill me" but Mr Chauvin does not remove his knee despite pleas from bystanders. According to a preliminary autopsy, the police officer had his knee on Mr Floyd's neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds - almost three minutes of which was after Mr Floyd became non-responsive. Nearly two minutes before Mr Chauvin removed his knee the other officers checked Mr Floyd's right wrist for a pulse and were unable to find one. He was taken to hospital and pronounced dead around an hour later. Mr Chauvin, 44, has been charged with murder. Do you have any information about the protests?

RAF veteran Garry Bowhill-Mann, 74, travelled to California to meet Mike Nolan, also a former serviceman in his 70s, before the coronavirus lockdown. "I looked at him and I thought 'I like you, mate' and we really kicked it off from the start," said Mr Bowhill-Mann His story is told in a film made by his granddaughter and released on 2 June. Mr Bowhill-Mann is a full-time carer for his wife Anita, who has multiple sclerosis. He said action role-playing games such as The Division 2 and Ghost Recon were "a bit of escapism". "I think, now most of all with this lockdown, having the ability to talk to other people, although they're in other parts of the world, has helped a lot," he added. His granddaughter, Tullalah Self, 21, said he had "been into gaming for as long as I can remember". She said: "When I found out he had made a friend in California I thought it would be really cool if I could get them to meet up in person." Ms Self worked with friend and fellow filmmaker Leanne Rogers to raise the money to make a documentary about her grandfather's transatlantic friendship. She said when the two veterans met "it was like they already knew each other". The film called Game of Life, released by Red Bull, followed Mr Bowhill-Mann to California to meet Mr Nolan, 71, and climaxes with them taking to the sky in a biplane.

He has accused the body of mismanaging the coronavirus pandemic when it emerged in China, and of failing to make "greatly needed reforms". We've been looking at some of the charges President Trump has levelled against the WHO and the health body's responses. "The WHO failed to adequately obtain, vet and share information in a timely and transparent fashion." This has become a regular theme of Mr Trump's criticism of the WHO, and in his letter to its head Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on 18 May, he renewed this attack saying the WHO "consistently ignored credible reports of the virus spreading in Wuhan in early December 2019 or even earlier, including reports from the Lancet medical journal". The editor of the Lancet, Richard Horton, has written a letter in response, saying: "The Lancet did not publish any report in early December 2019 about a virus spreading in Wuhan. The first reports we published were from Chinese scientists on Jan 24, 2020." In response to the criticisms levelled at it, the WHO says it acted properly in accordance with the information it was given by China, sharing it with medical and scientific experts around the world, including from the US. The WHO says it was told by China of "a pneumonia of an unknown cause" on 31 December 2019. And this was flagged on WHO social-media accounts on 4 January. Then, on 5 January, the WHO put out an official statement saying it had asked for more information about the illness from the Chinese authorities. On 12 January, China publicly shared the genetic sequence for the new coronavirus. On 20 and 21 January, a regional WHO team visited Wuhan. A public statement was issued by the WHO on 22 January setting out what they had discovered. On 28 January, Dr Tedros went to Beijing to discuss the outbreak with China's leaders. By the end of January, the WHO had declared the outbreak a public-health emergency of global concern. It has also been reported that WHO experts (drawn from 15 countries including China) met a week earlier to discuss whether to issue a global alert but could not agree among themselves.  "Through the middle of January, it parroted... the idea that there was no human-to-human transmission happening despite... clear evidence to the contrary." President Trump identifies a critical few days here when the messaging from the WHO was evolving rapidly. On 14 January, the WHO tweeted: "Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission." But the same day, the head of the WHO's emerging diseases unit, Maria van Kerkhove, appeared to contradict this, suggesting to journalists that "limited" human-to-human transmission had been observed in Wuhan. She did however stress that there was no clear evidence of "sustained" transmission between people. It wasn't until 22 January that the WHO confirmed there was clear evidence of human-to-human transmission in Wuhan. The WHO has denied media reports that it delayed making this evidence public at China's request. The WHO has "an alarming lack of independence" from China.   In his recent letter to the head of the WHO, Mr Trump, accuses the organisation of being too close to China, failing to remain objective in its handling of the outbreak. It's certainly the case that the WHO has publicly praised China's response to the coronavirus outbreak and its "commitment to transparency", something that has clearly angered the US president in recent weeks. However, many other experts and political leaders, including Mr Trump, have also praised China's initial response to the outbreak. On 24 January, Mr Trump was effusive in his support for China's efforts. Dr Michael Ryan, of the WHO, says the organisation wanted to keep the lines of communication open with China as it battled to contain the virus. The WHO has also been accused of being unduly influenced by Beijing over the status of Taiwan. The issue here is that Taiwan is not a member of the WHO, as the island is not recognised by the UN. The WHO, however, says it does engage with Taiwan and share information with it. Taiwan says it raised the alarm about the possible human-to-human spread of the virus at the end of December after some of its scientists had visited Wuhan. Taiwan says its warnings were ignored or not taken seriously. But the evidence published so far shows Taiwan's exchanges with the WHO did not specifically mention human-to-human transmission. "One of the most dangerous decisions... from the WHO was... to oppose travel restrictions. They actually fought us."  The US restricted travel from China and other countries from 2 February. But there is no record of the WHO publicly criticising this move. And it would have been highly unusual for it to do so. But it had, on 10 January, put out advice recommending no international travel restrictions in response to the virus. And this was reconfirmed in a statement at the end of February, saying travel bans were not usually that effective and could have an adverse social and economic impact, although they might be justified for a short period of time at the start of an outbreak.

Mr Trump took to Facebook to repeat a tweet about the widespread protests in Minneapolis, following the death of George Floyd in police custody. Twitter had placed a warning over the content, which it said "glorified violence", but Facebook said it did not violate its company policy. Some staff said they were ‘ashamed’. The president said he would "send in the National Guard", and warned that "when the looting starts, the shooting starts."    The post remains untouched on Facebook after founder Mark Zuckerberg said it did not violate the company’s policy around incitement of violence.  A "virtual walkout" is taking place today, with some employees leaving an out-of-office message explaining that they are protesting. “People can agree or disagree on where we should draw the line, but I hope they understand our overall philosophy is that it is better to have this discussion out in the open, especially when the stakes are so high,” Mr Zuckerberg wrote in a post on the platform.  “I disagree strongly with how the President spoke about this, but I believe people should be able to see this for themselves because ultimately accountability for those in positions of power can only happen when their speech is scrutinized out in the open.”  Several employees expressed their frustration at the decision, on social media.  “Facebook's inaction in taking down Trump's post inciting violence makes me ashamed to work here,” Lauren Tan, a software engineer wrote.  “I absolutely disagree with it... Silence is complicity.”  I work at Facebook and I am not proud of how we’re showing up. The majority of coworkers I’ve spoken to feel the same way. We are making our voice heard. End of Twitter post  by @jasontoff Others suggested that Facebook should have made an exception to the policy, given its context. “We need to strive harder as a company, and industry, to have our Black colleagues’ and fellow citizens’ backs so that they are not having to face down institutionalised societal violence and systemic oppression alone,” added David Gillis, a director in product design at Facebook.  Other employees used the company’s internal messaging system to try to raise their concerns, The Verge reports.  Facebook said it "recognised the pain" many staff were feeling. "We encourage employees to speak openly when they disagree with leadership. As we face additional difficult decisions around content ahead, we'll continue seeking their honest feedback," a spokesperson said. Joseph Evans, head of tech at Enders Analysis said that staff at tech firms do speak out against their employers' decisions on occasion; in 2018 Google staff walked out in protest against the firm's treatment of women."Part of the appeal of working for these companies is that the employees feel they're changing the world, and hopefully for the better," he said. "So the tech giants have to balance avoiding regulatory crackdowns, keeping profits high, and attracting and retaining their highly-skilled workforce." Donald Trump and Mark Zuckerberg spoke on the phone on Friday.  It’s unknown what was discussed, but both sides called the conversation productive, according to Axios news website.  Today, Facebook announced that it will donate $10m (£8m) to “efforts committed to ending racial injustice.”   “We hear you, we see you and we are with you,” the company said on social media.  "We stand against racism. We stand with our Black community - and all those working toward justice in honour of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and far too many others whose names will not be forgotten.⁣” It is unclear where the $10m will go, or how it will be distributed.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window YouTuber Jake Paul has denied looting during a protest against racial inequality in Arizona. The 23-year-old says he was only there to film content for his 20.1 million YouTube followers. Photos and videos seen on social media claim to show Jake, whose estimated wealth is over $11 million, involved in looting an Arizona shopping mall. "Neither I nor anyone in our group was involved in any looting or vandalism," he wrote on Twitter and Instagram. 12 people were arrested at Scottsdale Fashion Square after "millions of dollars of damages and theft" took place at shops in the mall.  "We filmed everything we saw in an effort to share our experience and bring more attention to the anger felt in every neighbourhood we travelled through," Jake wrote. Here's Jake Paul's post in full. The looting and vandalism in Arizona were part of widespread protests that have been taking place across America for six days. They started after the death of George Floyd while in police custody. Several videos and photos posted online appeared to show Jake Paul in areas where looting and vandalism were taking place, including showing him standing with people setting fireworks off.  During the protests over the past week, it has been suggested that in some places white people have been responsible for violent acts that have reflected badly on other protesters. At least 4,100 people have been arrested over several days of protests, according to a tally compiled by the Associated Press news agency. Arrests have been made over a range of offences, from looting and blocking motorways to breaking curfew. Radio 1 Newsbeat has contacted Jake Paul for comment.

Their Dragon capsule - supplied and operated by the private SpaceX company - attached to the bow section of the orbiting lab 422km above China. After a wait for leak, pressure and temperature checks, the pair disembarked to join the Russian and American crew already on the ISS. Hurley and Behnken launched from Florida on Saturday. Theirs is the first crew outing launched from American soil to orbit since the retirement of the US space agency (Nasa) shuttles nine years ago.  This is the first time in human history @NASA_Astronauts have entered the @Space_Station from a commercially-made spacecraft. @AstroBehnken and @Astro_Doug have finally arrived to the orbiting laboratory in @SpaceX's Dragon Endeavour spacecraft. pic.twitter.com/3t9Ogtpik4 End of Twitter post  by @NASA The mission marks the beginning of a new era in which Nasa will be purchasing transport services from the commercial sector. No more will it own and operate the American vehicles that run to and from the station. This will be done exclusively by firms such as SpaceX of Hawthorne, California, which is led by tech billionaire Elon Musk. Confirmation of the Dragon's attachment at the ISS came at 14:16 GMT (15:16 BST) on Sunday, 19 hours after leaving the Kennedy Space Center atop a Falcon rocket also provided by SpaceX. The docking was a fully automated process; Hurley and Behnken had no need to get involved - although they had practised some manual flying on approach.  The doors between Dragon and the ISS were opened at 17:02 GMT (18:02 BST). When Hurley and Behnken floated through, they were met by ISS Commander and fellow Nasa astronaut Chris Cassidy and Russian cosmonauts Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner. "We're just happy to be here and Chris is going to put us work. And hopefully we will fit in and not mess too many things up," said Doug Hurley as he nursed a bruise picked up on his forehead.  Bob Behnken said the pair were well rested and ready for the tasks ahead. "We did get probably a good seven hours or so (of sleep)," he said in a radio link with mission control in Houston, Texas. "The first night is always a little bit of a challenge, but the Dragon was a slick vehicle, and we had good air flow and so we had an excellent evening. (We're) just excited to be back in low-Earth orbit again." Nasa Administrator Jim Bridenstine congratulated the duo on a job well done: "The whole world saw this mission and we are so, so proud of everything you've done for our country and, in fact, to inspire the world." SpaceX flew a first demonstration of its new crew vehicle last year, but that had only a dummy aboard. This sortie is the first to carry humans. Hurley's and Behnken's job on the mission is to test all onboard systems and to give their feedback to engineers. SpaceX and Nasa need a clean crewed demonstration so they can move swiftly to the next phase of the company's $2.6bn (£2.1bn) contract, which will encompass six astronaut "taxi" flights, with the first of these likely to occur at the end of August.  Hurley's and Behnken's arrival at the ISS means they get to claim a Stars and Stripes flag placed on the platform by the members of the very last space shuttle mission in 2011. The Atlantis orbiter's crew left this flag as an incentive to all those that came after them. The flag, which also flew on the very first shuttle flight in 1981, will now be returned to Earth to be given to the mission that next goes beyond Earth orbit.   Earlier, Hurley and Behnken named their Dragon ship in the time-honoured tradition of US spacefarers. They called it "Endeavour", in part to celebrate the new course being set by Nasa and its commercial partners, but also to acknowledge the past contribution to American space efforts by Shuttle Endeavour, on which both Hurley and Behnken served in the late 2000s. It's somewhat uncertain how long Hurley and Behnken will stay at the ISS, but perhaps as much as four months. In that time, they will become members of the current ISS Expedition 63 crew, taking part in the platform's everyday science and maintenance activities. Chris Cassidy joked that because his new crewmates arrived on a Sunday, they had missed the cleaning chores that normally take place on a Saturday. "We'll catch up next weekend," the commander said.

A curious phenomenon has emerged on the micro-blogging site Tumblr. It's perhaps been best summed up by one user called brinnanza: "Oh, giant company, you want your advertisement to go viral? Well this week the kids are obsessed with a short story written in 1846."  The short story in question is Edgar Allan Poe's "The Cask of Amontillado", and unlikely as it may sound it's inspired a series memes that thread together images and quotes from this macabre tale with more modern concerns. The story is about a narrator, whose name is revealed as Montresor at the end, who tells us about a man named Fortunato, who has insulted him. The narrator decides to get revenge and meets Fortunato, who is dressed up as a jester for a carnival celebration.  *Spoiler Alert* Montresor tempts Fortunato to come and try a sherry called Amontillado. The booze is stored in a catacomb, which should perhaps have been an ominous sign, but Fortunato's judgement is impaired by alcohol. And the story ends with Fortunato being walled up alive in the cellar. So what is it about this 170-year-old unhappy ending that resonates with today's Tumblr users (who according to the Pew Research Center are mostly 18-29 year olds)? Let's start with the wall. One of the most controversial news stories of this year has been US presidential candidate Donald Trump's promise  that, if elected, he will build an "impenetrable, physical, tall, powerful, beautiful, southern border wall" between the US and Mexico. Tumblr users took these seemingly unconnected structures and went to work. And then there's the hideous revenge on somebody wearing a jester's costume. What's the 2016 parallel? "The Cask of Amontillado is the new meme in reaction to the clown epidemic," wrote Tumblr user memeufacturing. "We all became aware of the clown epidemic a week or two ago and now the new meme is luring and subsequently cementing a clown into your ancient cellar ...". We should say that memeufacturing message is tongue-in-cheek (we hope). And so is user mymelement: And that was just the start of the memestorm as Poe's creepy classic was given all sorts of popular culture twists. Even 50 Shades of Grey was dragged into it. So who was it who first spotted that Poe's creepy classic had potential as meme fodder? It all seemed to start when one user with the handle popularlesbian posted: "I'm not petty and I don't see the point in holding a grudge. Anyway would you like to come into my cellar and taste a fine vintage..." The note was reblogged by user hamburgertrousers, who replied "Me in a silly hat, completely wasted: 'boy would I!'"It was hamburgertrousers reblogging that was the tinder to the Tumblr fire. The phenomenon, according to Vox, may have a logical explanation. Tumblr is known to actively embrace the Halloween season. Edgar Allan Poe's works of Gothic fiction are tinged with the unknown and the eerie. They invariably become memes in October. So, as we move on to hunt the next trend, let's leave the last word on this one, with one Tumblr user: "I can't believe Cask of Amontillado is a meme my English teacher would be so proud of all of you".

This week we speak to Carly Fiorina, US business leader, political figure and philanthropist. It should give hope to any young person striving to reach the top, knowing that Carly Fiorina started her business career as a humble secretary. "I spent my time greeting visitors, answering phones, typing memos," she says. "But I was really committed to the job, arriving early, and leaving late." Mrs Fiorina, 65, is looking back on her 21-year-old self, who in 1976 got her first full-time job at a small property company in Palo Alto, California. From that modest start she went on to become the first female chief executive of a Fortune 50 company (the 50 largest firms in the US). This happened in 1999 when, aged 44, she was appointed to the top job at computer group Hewlett-Packard. Fortune magazine subsequently named her the most powerful woman in US business five years in a row, with the publication declaring that "Carly Fiorina didn't just break the glass ceiling, she obliterated it". However, her time at HP was not universally regarded as a success, with much criticism of her decision to merge the business with rival Compaq in 2001. And in 2005 she resigned after a disagreement with her fellow board members. Mrs Fiorina subsequently entered the political arena, first as an adviser to the late John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign. McCain went on to lose the election to Barack Obama. Eight years later, she herself ran to become the Republican Party candidate for the 2016 presidential election. She dropped out after nine months, due to low polling numbers, with Donald Trump going on to win both the candidacy and, of course, the presidency. She said at the time that she was "horrified" by Trump. Born in 1954 in Austin, Texas, her family moved around a lot, due to her father's job. Her dad, Joseph Sneed, was a law professor who went on to become US deputy attorney general. Her mother was a painter. She got a degree in philosophy and medieval history from Stanford University in California, before gaining a Master of Business Administration from the University of Maryland. In 1980 she entered the technology sector when she joined US giant AT&T as a management trainee. Her rise at the company was meteoric. By 1990 she was the firm's first female vice president, and by 1995 she was a senior director at AT&T spinoff Lucent Technologies.  It was also while at AT&T that she met her husband Frank, and they were married in 1985. Mrs Fiorina's success at the telecoms giant caught the attention of HP, who were looking for a fresh start after missing nine quarterly profit targets in a row. She was appointed to the top job at the company in July 1999. "When I arrived at HP I purposely brought no-one new in at the beginning," she says. "I did that for a very explicit reason, which was to send a very clear message to the organisation that we could, and we would, figure out what the problem was, and we would fix it. "[However], I was brought in by the board to transform the company. Those were the words they used." Under Mrs Fiorina's leadership, costs were reduced, and eventually 30,000 jobs were removed from the combined 145,000 HP and Compaq workforce. A further 80,000 employees took pay cuts at a business which at its peak was worth $87bn (£71bn).  "Of course it is incredibly difficult to have to fire people, to have to lay people off," she says. "In that very difficult circumstance, the best I could do was to fully explain why. "Why are we having to lay people off? Because if we don't, we will go out of business like many of our peers." When the merger between HP and Compaq went ahead in 2002, it was the biggest ever in the technology sector at the time, and created the world's largest seller of personal computers. Whether the merger was a success, however, is still hotly contested. Tech website ZDNet said in 2016 that HP and Compaq's coming together was "the worst merger ever". By contrast, the Huffington Post called it "the merger that worked". What is certain is that the HP board were unhappy with the profits and share price of the combined business, and Mrs Fiorina was asked to resign in 2005. Her severance package was reportedly worth $21m. "We did, in fact, restore a great company," she says. "[But] we had a dysfunctional board. It was dysfunctional when I arrived. It was dysfunctional when I left." If leading HP wasn't enough of a battle, Mrs Fiorina jumped into politics for a decade from 2006. After working for John McCain, she went on to stand as the Republican candidate in the 2010 US Senate election in California, but lost out to the Democratic Party incumbent. Mrs Fiorina then worked for the American Conservative Union, a right-wing lobbying organisation, before running to be the 2016 Republican presidential candidate. Looking back on this campaign, she says that "the process itself is insane". She adds: "Meaning, when you think about the process the  candidates go through, does it really help someone to be a better leader? Does it help us to decide a better leader? I don't think so. "It is a really crazy process that goes on for far too long. It is far too driven by a media spectacle." But with another US presidential election due to be held this autumn, what does she think of President Trump after his four years in office? She declines to comment.

There were highs, as when he, as a teenager in Houston, played American football for the 1992 Texas state champion runners-up Yates High School Lions. There were lows, as when he was arrested for robbery in 2007 and served five years in prison. But mostly, it would seem that Floyd, who was 46 when he died in Minneapolis on 25 May, 2020, was simply trying to live life as any other American, in search of betterment in the face of both personal and societal challenges. His death amid a public health crisis and economic calamity that has killed more than 100,000 Americans and left over 40 million unemployed has become the latest totem of the ills that plague the country in 2020. A native of Houston, Texas, Floyd grew up in the neighbourhood at the heart of the city's black community, the Third Ward, just to the south of the city centre. Beyoncé grew up there, as did Bayou City's blues music scene. Drake, a Canadian rapper, paid homage to its musical vibrancy, and Floyd himself is thought to have 'spit bars' as part of the hip-hop group in the 1990s in Houston.  But poverty, racial division and economic inequalities mark its history, too, as with any American city. Marred by segregation in the 20th Century, the Third Ward Floyd left in recent years has seen gang violence and tensions over housing.  "Anytime I take somebody who's not from there, people actually are like 'man, oh my God, I've never seen poverty like this. "It looks like a bomb went off, what happened?'" Ronnie Lillard, a friend from the neighbourhood tells the BBC.  "People are still living in shot-gun shacks that were erected in the 1920s. The poverty is thorough... and being from that area, it's hard to escape," says Mr Lillard, a rapper who performs under the name Reconcile. Floyd was well known in the council estate housing project, Cuney Homes, he adds. "Cuney Homes is known as 'The Bricks' and if you're from there they call you 'a brickboy'. He was a brickboy." Growing up a gifted athlete standing at six feet six inches, friends who knew Floyd as a teenager described him as a "gentle giant" who shone on the field in two sports, basketball as well as American football. "I was blown away, cause at 12 years old he was six-foot-two," Jonathan Veal, a childhood friend and former teammate, told local media. "I had never seen anyone that tall before". At John Yates High School, he wore number 88 in the tight end position for the football team, and was later recruited to play basketball at South Florida State College in Avon Park, Florida, where he was a student from 1993 to 1995, according to CNN. He returned to Texas for a school year at Texas A&M University, Kingsville, but did not complete his degree. His life then took a different turn, with a string of arrests for theft and drug possession culminating in an armed robbery charge in 2007, for which he was sentenced to five years in prison. He became involved in his local ministry, Resurrection Houston, after his release and was intent on making changes in himself and his neighbourhood, says Mr Lillard. "While he was embracing his own life change, he was looking around at his community."  A video of Floyd decrying gun violence, believed to be filmed in 2017, has circulated on social media, in which he implored young people to "come home". His family told the Houston Chronicle he moved to Minnesota in 2018 after being encouraged by friends through a Christian work programme. Christopher Harris, a friend and former classmate, told US media Mr Floyd "was looking to start over fresh, a new beginning". "He was happy with the change he was making," he added. The former athlete found work as a security guard at a local Salvation Army charity, and then took on jobs as a lorry driver and dance club bouncer at Conga Latin Bistro, where he was known as "Big Floyd." Like many Americans, however, he found himself laid off amid mass business closures resulting from the Covid-19 crisis.  On the day of his arrest, he was said to have been attempting to buy cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 bill. Anger over Mr Floyd's death has spurred protests across the US, with some descending into chaos and violence. Over 1,600 people have been arrested in nearly two dozen cities, and the National Guard deployed in 15 states.  Mr Lillard, who described his friend as a "person of peace", would have supported people's rights to be heard and for change, but would not have condoned the looting or the violence.  "He had a heart bent towards forgiveness, but he also was a man of the people, too," he said. "Even before his death, he was aware that people were hurting." "I think this thing has grown into something more than George Floyd," he added, speaking of the protests. "I think you're watching frustration that America has with America [itself]."

                                 George Floyd dies after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage shows a white officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floyd’s neck for several minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Mr Floyd is heard repeatedly saying "I can’t breathe". He is pronounced dead later in hospital.

                                 Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places, like Portland, Oregon, protesters lie in the road, chanting "I can’t breathe". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floyd’s arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat.

                                 A CNN reporter, Omar Jimenez, is arrested while covering the Minneapolis protest. Mr Jimenez was reporting live when police officers handcuffed him. A few minutes later several of his colleagues are also arrested. They are all later released once they are confirmed to be members of the media. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with murder and manslaughter. The charges carry a combined maximum 35-year sentence.

                                 A memorial service for George Floyd is held in Minneapolis.  Those gathered in tribute stand in silence for eight minutes, 46 seconds, the amount of time Mr Floyd is alleged to have been on the ground under arrest. Hundreds attended the service, which heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window A lawyer for the family of George Floyd, whose death sparked unrest across the US, has accused a police officer of "premeditated murder". Minneapolis policeman Derek Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder, but lawyer Benjamin Crump told CBS news it was a case of first-degree murder. "We think that he had intent... almost nine minutes he kept his knee in a man's neck that was begging and pleading for breath," he said. Looting is reported in Philadelphia. Video from two Philadelphia TV stations on Sunday shows youths smashing several police cars and looting at least one store. Reporting on the violence in West Philadelphia, the Philadelphia Inquirer says police cars were also set ablaze.  Several US cities have imposed curfews. President Donald Trump tweeted: "Law & Order in Philadelphia, NOW! They are looting stores. Call in our great National Guard". The Floyd case in Minneapolis has reignited US anger over police killings of black Americans.  It follows the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Eric Garner in New York and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement. In video footage, Mr Chauvin, 44, can be seen kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck for several minutes on Monday. Mr Floyd, 46,  repeatedly says that he is unable to breathe.  "The fact that officer Chauvin kept his knee on his neck for almost three minutes after he was unconscious. We don't understand how that was not first degree murder. We don't understand how all these officers haven't been arrested," lawyer Crump said. Three other officers present at the time have also since been sacked. For many the outrage over George Floyd's death also reflects years of frustration over socio-economic inequality and segregation, not least in Minneapolis itself. There have been five nights of arson and looting in Minneapolis and the adjacent city of St Paul. Minnesota's Governor Tim Walz said on Saturday he was deploying the full Minnesota National Guard for the first time since World War Two. Governor Walz said racism in his state had created the conditions for Mr Floyd's death. The National Guard - the US reserve military force for domestic emergencies - said on Sunday that 5,000 of its personnel had been activated in 15 states and Washington DC. It added that "state and local law enforcement agencies remain responsible for security". In the CBS interview, lawyer Benjamin Crump also said "we now have the audio from the police bodycam and we hear where one officer says 'he doesn't have a pulse, maybe we should turn him on his side', but yet officer Chauvin says 'no, we're going to keep him in this position'. That's intent. "Also, the fact that officer Chauvin kept his knee on his neck for almost three minutes after he was unconscious." The lawyer also said Mr Chauvin and Mr Floyd already knew each other before Mr Floyd's death in custody. He said the Floyd family was "notified by the owner of a club that Derek Chauvin was an off-duty police officer where George Floyd was a security guard, and so they had to overlap". For three years, Donald Trump presided over a nation of relative peace and prosperity. The crises he faced were largely of his own making, and he confronted them by rallying his supporters and condemning his opponents. Now Trump faces a situation ill-suited to a playbook of division. The US economy has been hobbled by a deadly pandemic. George Floyd's death at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer has spread racial unrest across the nation. The public is uncertain and afraid - and increasingly angry. These are circumstances that would test the abilities of even the most skilful leaders. This president, however, risks becoming lost at sea. His public calls for unity and healing have been undermined by a penchant for Twitter name-calling and bellicosity. Message discipline, a valuable attribute at this moment, is not his forte. There may be no easy way to guide the nation through its current peril. Barack Obama's measured coolness did nothing to stop the fires of Ferguson any more than Richard Nixon's law-and-order edicts quelled Vietnam-era unrest. The economic and social devastation of the pandemic has created a political landscape of dry brush ignited by the lightning strike of Floyd's death. The president may not be able to contain the wildfire, even if he isn't feeding the flames. Huge demonstrations have taken place in at least 30 cities across the US. They were largely peaceful on Saturday, but violence flared later in the day. Besides Minneapolis and Los Angeles, the cities under night curfew include Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Louisville, Richmond, San Francisco and Seattle.  One of the cities worst affected by unrest is Los Angeles. California Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in the city and activated the National Guard. The entire city is under curfew. Numerous shops have been looted, including on the famous retail avenues, Melrose and Fairfax, while overhead footage showed fires burning. Earlier police fired rubber bullets and hit protesters with batons. Hundreds of arrests have been made.  In New York City, police arrested about 350 people overnight and dozens of police suffered light injuries. In Salt Lake City, a man aimed a bow and arrow at protesters and was attacked by the crowd, Reuters reported.  President Trump's national security adviser told CNN "I don't think there's systemic racism" in the police. Robert O'Brien said "there are some racist police, I think they're the minority, I think they're the few bad apples and we need to root them out". On Saturday evening, President Trump said Mr Floyd's death had "filled Americans with horror, anger and grief". He also denounced the actions of "looters and anarchists", accusing them of dishonouring the memory of Mr Floyd. What was needed, he said, was "healing not hatred, justice not chaos". "I will not allow angry mobs to dominate - won't happen," he added. Thousands took part in an anti-racism protest march in central London on Sunday, defying social distancing rules imposed because of coronavirus. They gathered in Trafalgar Square, then the crowd moved on to the US embassy.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Curfews have been imposed in multiple cities in the US, after unrest and protests have spread across the country over the death of an unarmed black man, George Floyd, in police custody. Most of the protests began peacefully - and several stayed peaceful. But in a large number of cases, demonstrators clashed with police, set police cars on fire, vandalised property or looted shops. The National Guard has activated 5,000 of its personnel across 15 states and Washington DC. Experts have also drawn parallels with the 2011 England riots - when a peaceful protest over a man who was shot dead by police turned into four days of unrest, with widespread looting and buildings set alight.   How do protests spread so quickly - and why do some become violent? Incidents like Mr Floyd's death can "become a trigger moment because it symbolises a broader experience, amongst much larger numbers of people, about the relationship between police and the black community," says Prof Clifford Stott, an expert in crowd behaviour and public order policing at Keele University. Confrontations are particularly likely when there are structural inequalities, he adds. Prof Stott studied the 2011 England riots extensively, and found that the riots there spread because protesters in different cities identified with each other - either because of their ethnicity, or because they shared a dislike of the police. This meant that, when the police appeared to be overwhelmed, rioters in different districts felt empowered to mobilise. Violent protests are less likely when police have a good relationship with the local community - but how they react to demonstrations on the day also matters, experts say. "Riots are a product of interactions - largely to do with the nature of the way police treats crowds," says Prof Stott. For example, he says, in a large crowd of protesters, tensions may begin with just a few people confronting the police.  However, "police often react towards the crowd as a whole" - and if people feel that the police use of force against them is unjustified, this increases their "us versus them" mentality. This "can change the way people feel about violence and confrontation - for example, they may start feeling that violence is legitimate given the circumstances." Darnell Hunt, dean of social sciences at UCLA, believes police in the US "ramped up their aggressiveness" over the weekend. "Deploying the National Guard, using rubber bullets, tear gas, and pepper spray - these are a range of police tactics that can exacerbate an already-tense situation." It's a pattern that has been seen in other protests around the world too. For example, in 2019, Hong Kong saw seven months of anti-government protests, that began as mostly peaceful and ended up increasingly violent. Experts highlight a series of police tactics that were seen as heavy-handed - including the firing of large amounts of tear gas at young protesters - as moves that galvanised protesters and made them more confrontational. Prof Stott argues that police forces that have invested in de-escalation training are more likely to avoid violence at protests. He points to protests that were able to stay peaceful in the US over the weekend - such as in Camden, New Jersey, where officers joined the residents in a march against racism. Chief Wysocki on the march today, standing together with the residents we serve to remember and honor George Floyd. #StrongerTogether #CamdenStrong pic.twitter.com/UJAjxXkxrx End of Twitter post  by @CamdenCountyPD Moral psychology can help explain why some protests turn violent, says Marloon Moojiman, an assistant professor in organisational behaviour at Rice University. A person's sense of morality is central to how they see themselves, so "when we see something as immoral, it creates strong feelings, because we feel our understanding of morality has to be protected". "This can override other concerns people have about keeping peace", because "if you think the system is broken, you're going to want to really do something drastic to show that that's not acceptable."  This can apply to a wide range of beliefs - for example, in an extreme case, someone who thinks abortion is a moral outrage may be more likely to say it's OK to bomb an abortion clinic, he says. Research suggests that social media echo chambers could also make people more susceptible to endorsing violence, if they believe that their peers have the same moral views as them, he adds.   In the US, hundreds of businesses have been damaged, and there has been widespread looting in LA and Minneapolis over the weekend. However, Prof Stott warns that while it's easy to assume that riots and crowds are "irrational and chaotic, none of that is true - it's highly structured and meaningful for the people taking part". "To some extent, looting is an expression of power - black citizens may have felt disempowered in relation to the police - but in the context of a riot, the rioters momentarily become more powerful than the police." Studies of previous riots show that places that get looted are often related to big businesses, and that looting "often relates to the sense of inequality related to living in capitalistic economies", he says. Prof Hunt has studied the 1992 Los Angeles riots, which were sparked after four white police officers were acquitted over the videotaped beating of black motorist Rodney King. He says there is "a long history of targeting, or selectivity", in vandalism and looting. "In the LA uprisings, you'd often see 'minority owned' spray painted on minority businesses, so that people would bypass those." However, both Prof Stott and Prof Hunt caution that looting is complicated - especially as lots of people with different motivations take part, including people in poverty, or organised criminals. The idea that violent protests are targeted and meaningful events to those taking part can also explain why looting occurs in some protests, but not others. In Hong Kong, for example, protesters smashed shop windows, threw petrol bombs at police, and defaced the national emblem - but there was no looting. Lawrence Ho, a specialist in policing and public order management at the Education University of Hong Kong, believes this is because those protests were triggered by political developments and anger at the police, rather than discrimination and social inequality. "Vandalism was targeted at stores seen to have a strong connection to mainland China," says Dr Ho. "It was a deliberate attempt to convey a message." Public order experts say that for the police, being seen as legitimate and able to engage protesters in dialogue is key. "Good policing tries to avoid an 'us' and 'them' mentality, and also tries to avoid the sense that police can act in ways that people see as illegitimate," says Prof Stott. Dr Ho also believes that negotiation is the best way - but points out that "one of the hardest things today is that a lot of protests are leaderless. If you can't find the leader, you can't negotiate with them." More generally, he adds, politicians can make matters better - or worse - based on their approach to dialogue, and whether they use emergency legislation. Ultimately, however, riots can be a symptom of deep-seated tensions and complicated issues that don't have an easy solution. Prof Hunt says this week's US riots are the most serious ones since 1968 - after Martin Luther King was assassinated. "You can't think about police brutality, and the profiling of certain communities, without thinking about the inequalities that exist in society and fuel those concerns," he says. "The George Floyd case was not the cause - it's more like the straw that broke the camel's back. You could argue even the police killings are symptoms - the underlying cause is white supremacy, racism, and things the US has not fundamentally dealt with."Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window The US will designate the anti-fascist group Antifa a terrorist organisation, President Donald Trump says.  The president accused Antifa of starting riots at street protests over George Floyd's death. Mr Floyd, a black man, died in police custody earlier this week, reigniting anger at police treatment of African-Americans.  Protests over his death have turned violent, prompting major cities to impose curfews. The National Guard - the US reserve military force for domestic emergencies - had been deployed in 15 states to help police forces deal with the unrest.  In Minneapolis, where Mr Floyd died on Monday after a white police officer put his knee on his neck for more than eight minutes, there have been five nights of arson and looting. US officials have given contrasting explanations for who is responsible for the riots, with some suggesting outside groups and individuals were involved. On Saturday, Minnesota's Democratic Governor Tim Walz suggested that foreign influences, white supremacists and drug cartels were behind the violence, giving few other details.  On Twitter Mr Trump blamed "Antifa-led anarchists" and "Radical Left Anarchists" for the unrest, again without providing more specifics.  The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization. End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrump The president did not specify how or when he intends to designate Antifa as a terrorist organisation.  There are ways the Trump administration can designate individuals or groups as foreign terrorists, including legislation and an executive order. But legal experts have questioned whether Mr Trump has the authority to label Antifa a "domestic terrorist organisation". Mary McCord, a former senior Justice Department official, said "no current legal authority exists for designating domestic organisations as terrorist organisations".  "Any attempt at such a designation would raise significant First Amendment concerns," Ms McCord added, referring to the constitutional right to freedom of speech, religion and assembly.  In 2019, Republican senators introduced a non-binding resolution designed to declare Antifa organisations as "domestic terrorists". At first, the protests were peaceful as people, outraged by Mr Floyd's death and other recent examples of police brutality against African-Americans, took to the streets. As anger grew, it is not clear what caused those protests to spiral into riots. Yet in recent days, federal and state officials have made firm allegations, without providing any evidence. "It's ANTIFA and the Radical Left. Don't lay the blame on others!" Mr Trump tweeted on Saturday. US Attorney General William Barr has echoed the president, accusing Antifa and other "agitators" of hijacking the protests sweeping across the US. "The violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly," Mr Barr said on Sunday. Earlier, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo struck a more cautious tone. Appearing on Fox News, he described the rioters as "Antifa-like", but stressed it "remains to be seen exactly how" the peaceful protests took a sinister turn. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said he had evidence that people from outside Minneapolis were involved in acts of violence in the state. He did not explain if these people were aligned with any groups or political beliefs in particular. Others, including Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, have pointed the finger at outsiders on the right wing of politics.  "We are now confronting white supremacists, members of organised crime, out of state instigators, and possibly even foreign actors to destroy and destabilise our city and our region," Frey tweeted on Saturday. However on Sunday, authorities in Minnesota said people from out of the state represented about 20% of Saturday's arrests. Antifa - short for anti-fascist action - is a protest movement that strongly opposes neo-Nazis, fascism, white supremacists and racism. It is considered to be a loosely organised group of activists with no leaders. Most members oppose all forms of racism and sexism, and strongly oppose what they see as the nationalist, anti-immigration and anti-Muslim policies that Mr Trump has enacted. Anti-government and anti-capitalist, Antifa's members are often perceived as more closely aligned with anarchists than the mainstream left. The movement gained new prominence in the US for its role in confronting white supremacists at a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017.  President Trump drew widespread criticism when he said there was violence on "many sides" in Charlottesville and initially neglected to explicitly censure the white supremacists who organised the rally.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Hundreds of people demonstrated in support of the Black Lives Matter movement following the death of George Floyd in police custody in the US. The action at Cardiff Castle was organised following the death of unarmed Mr Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on 25 May. There has been serious civil unrest across the USA sparked by the 46-year-old's death. Ex-policeman Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with murdering Mr Floyd. Mr Chauvin, who is white, was shown in footage kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck. He and three other police officers have been sacked. He is due to appear in court on Monday. In Cardiff, the protesters sat peacefully in the city centre displaying 'Black Lives Matter' and 'Say their names' placards. Speeches on standing up to injustice and racism were given. One protestor, Donna Ali, said: "If you're silent, you're not going to change anything "It's something we've experienced for many years, whether it's in the US or the UK. "It's really heart-breaking that people can't see past the colour of skin." And Garyn Young added: "It's important we show the unity and strength we have here. "It's important for Welsh people to demonstrate - there's a BAME (Black, Asian, and minority ethnic) community here willing to show solidarity with the rest of the country. "It makes me feel emotional, it's great to see so much passion and so much anger at what's happened." South Wales Police reminded protestors of coronavirus legislation.

Here, BBC News profiles the crew members. Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken have broken a nine-year hiatus for Nasa, becoming the first astronauts to launch from US soil since the retirement of the space shuttle in 2011.  In the intervening years, Nasa bought seats for its astronauts - at a cost of tens of millions of dollars per flight - on the Russian Soyuz. But officials have also worked with Elon Musk's company SpaceX and aerospace giant Boeing to develop new, American spacecraft capable of ferrying humans to and from the ISS - under the space agency's Commercial Crew Program. Musk's vehicle was first to fly; Hurley and Behnken travelled to the ISS in the sleek Crew Dragon spacecraft. "It's well past time to be launching an American rocket from the Florida coast to the International Space Station and I am certainly honoured to be a part of it," Hurley, 53, said at the beginning of May, before the flight. Behnken, 49, added: "On my first flight... I didn't have a son, so I'm really excited to share the mission with him." Nasa chose two of its most experienced astronauts to help California-based SpaceX ready the Crew Dragon for launch. The two are also longstanding friends. "Being lucky enough to fly with your best friend... I think there's a lot of people who wish they could do that," says Hurley. When they launched atop a Falcon 9 rocket, their spouses knew exactly what they were going through. That's because they're astronauts too. Marine Colonel Hurley's wife Karen Nyberg flew into space twice - aboard the shuttle and the Soyuz - retiring from Nasa this year. They have a 10-year-old son, Jack, whose formative years were shaped by space travel. Nyberg began training for a six-month space station mission just a few months after Jack's birth. In the meantime, Hurley was preparing for his own flight - piloting the last ever shuttle mission. Sometimes, Nyberg took Jack to Russia, at other times he stayed at home in Texas. "Literally from the time Jack was old enough to comprehend things, he was either going to Russia or Skyping with mommy. That's just the way it was," Hurley told the Houston Chronicle in 2013. Air Force Colonel Behnken is married to Megan McArthur, who flew on the last mission to service the Hubble Space Telescope in 2009.  As an active member of the astronaut corps, she is a potential candidate to be the first woman on the Moon when Nasa returns in 2024. Their son, Theo, is six. Hurley, Behnken, Nyberg and McArthur all graduated from the same astronaut class (2000) and attended each other's weddings. The men are so used to each other's company, they now have a spooky rapport. They "can predict - almost by body language - what the person's opinion is or what their next action is going to be," Behnken told CNN before the launch. "We've just been doing this so long that it's kind of like having a second set of hands." Hurley says of Behnken: "I know instantaneously when I've not done something correctly - just put it that way. He doesn't have a good poker face."  But Behnken admits Hurley is the more organised of the two. The older of the two men was raised in the hamlet of Apalachin, in upstate New York. "It was just a great small town existence... we didn't get a stoplight until I was, I think, in college," Hurley said in 2009. Behnken hails from  St Ann, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri. In 2010, he described it as "a blue collar kind of a neighbourhood", adding: "I guess, in my bag of tricks... I'm more of a working class sort of a person." He took jobs in construction before deciding that working outdoors in the summer heat wasn't for him.  Both men went to college on military scholarships and gained undergraduate degrees in engineering. While Behnken went on to complete a PhD at Caltech - the elite institute featured in the Big Bang Theory television show - Hurley became an officer in the Marines. They both subsequently trained as military test pilots - at different training schools. It's been the archetypal background for Nasa's astronauts since the days of its first intake - the Mercury Seven. "When I showed up [at Nasa] it was like: 'Well, I have a PhD and an MD,' and I'm sitting there going, 'Mmm, wow! Maybe I was a bit of a slacker'," said Hurley.  "But you know, your professional development as a pilot and the thousands of hours you get as a pilot... brings something to the table." Hurley and Behnken were selected as astronaut candidates three years before the shuttle Columbia broke up on re-entry, killing seven crew members. After the disaster, Nasa decided it would retire the shuttle, handing over space station transport to private firms. Thus, when the two men were finally assigned their flights, the shuttle programme was in its final phase. Their missions focused on fulfilling Nasa's prior commitments to complete construction of the ISS, including the delivery of crew compartments designed to fit in the shuttle's payload bay. When the spaceplane was retired, the pair were assigned to the Commercial Crew Program. In August 2018, Hurley and Behnken were announced as the prime crew for Demo-2, the first flight of SpaceX's vehicle with humans onboard. "Bob and I, the last two years, have essentially been living in California, working hand-in-hand with the folks at SpaceX to get us to this point," Hurley said this month. They've had to get used to the Crew Dragon's touchscreen controls after previously working with the chunky buttons on shuttle instrument panels. Hurley says a background in evaluating military aircraft as test pilots proved crucial in their work with SpaceX. "That, in and of itself, helped both of us tremendously, because all along the process that you see in the military, there are delays, there are technical challenges, there are things that you don't expect and you have to work through them," he explained. Setbacks - including two spectacular explosions that destroyed a rocket and one of the Crew Dragon capsules - have seen the mission slip by nearly four years from its original date of October 2016.  "We were well-prepared for that part of it, when I think it caused some frustration within Nasa as launch dates weren't made," explained Hurley. Despite bumps in the road, Behnken's enthusiasm remained undimmed: "It's probably the dream of every test pilot school student to have the opportunity to fly on a brand new spaceship." Hurley told CNN: "From a first flight standpoint, certainly, there might be some greater quantifiable risk to some degree. "But probably no different to any other spaceflight we've flown humans on before."

But they have been defied in many areas, with shops looted, cars burned and buildings attacked. Riot police have used tear gas and rubber bullets. President Donald Trump urged "healing" over the death of George Floyd but said he could not allow mobs to dominate. A white ex-policeman is charged with murdering Mr Floyd, 46, in Minneapolis. Derek Chauvin, 44, is due to appear in court on Monday. In video footage, Mr Chauvin can be seen kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck for several minutes on Monday. Mr Floyd repeatedly says that he is unable to breathe.  Three other officers present at the time have also since been sacked. The Floyd case has reignited US anger over police killings of black Americans. It follows the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Eric Garner in New York and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement. But for many it also reflects years of frustration over socioeconomic inequality and segregation, not least in Minneapolis itself. A big anti-racism protest march also took place in London on Sunday, first in Trafalgar Square, then the crowd moved on to the US embassy. Huge demonstrations have taken place in at least 30 cities across the US. They were largely peaceful on Saturday, but violence flared later in the day. One of the cities worst affected by unrest is Los Angeles. California Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in the city and activated the National Guard - the reserve military force that can be called on   to intervene in domestic emergencies. The entire city is under a 20:00 to 05:30 curfew. Numerous shops have been looted, including on the famous retail avenues, Melrose and Fairfax, while overhead footage showed fires burning. Earlier police fired rubber bullets and hit protesters with batons. Hundreds of arrests have been made. Mayor Eric Garcetti said this was "the heaviest moment I've experienced" since the riots in 1992 that were sparked by the acquittal of police over the beating of Rodney King. In New York, some 20 police cars were burned and dozens of arrests made. Video also showed a police car driving into a crowd of protesters. Mayor Bill de Blasio said the situation was not started by the officers, but Congress Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said his comments were unacceptable and he should not be making excuses for the officers. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot imposed a 21:00 to 06:00 curfew until further notice, saying she was "disgusted" by the violence. "I've seen protesters hurl projectiles at our police department... bottles of water, urine and Lord knows what else," she said. Although in most places curfews were observed by the majority, also in most places there was evidence of defiance. In Atlanta, protesters remained on the streets after the curfew began, damaging property and vehicles. Dozens of arrests were made. Minneapolis,  where George Floyd died, has seen less violence overnight. Some 700 National Guard officers are aiding police and they acted quickly to enforce the curfew imposed there. The Star Tribune said the action had so far headed off the unrest of the previous night. For the second day running, a large crowd of protesters taunted National Guard officers outside the White House in Washington, DC.  Indianapolis was one of the cities that had seen peaceful protests during the day turn violent later. At least one shooting death has occurred, but police said no officers had discharged weapons. In under-curfew Philadelphia, 13 police officers were hurt and at least 35 arrests made as stores were looted, police cars torched and buildings defaced. Overnight curfews have also been declared in Miami, Portland and Louisville, among other cities. San Francisco is the latest to impose a curfew, announced by Mayor London Breed for 20:00 local time on Sunday, after looting and violence. But amid the violence there were also moments of solidarity. In Flint, Michigan, Sheriff Chris Swanson took off the riot helmets of his men, laid down batons and asked protesters what they wanted. After hugs and high fives, they chanted "walk with us" and the sheriff did. On Saturday evening, Mr Trump said that Mr Floyd's death had "filled Americans with horror, anger and grief". "I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking peace," he said in a televised address from Cape Canaveral in Florida, following the launch into orbit of two Nasa astronauts by billionaire Elon Musk's SpaceX company. The president denounced the actions of "looters and anarchists", accusing them of dishonouring the memory of Mr Floyd. What was needed, he said, was "healing not hatred, justice not chaos". "I will not allow angry mobs to dominate - won't happen," he added. Mr Trump has blamed the mayor of Minneapolis - a Democrat - for failing to control the protests, which are the worst since the president took office.  The president's Democratic Party rival, Joe Biden, has accused him of giving oxygen to bigotry and said those responsible for Mr Floyd's death must be held accountable. But he also condemned rioting, saying: "Protesting such brutality is right and necessary. But burning down communities and needless destruction is not." Many mayors and local officials have been trying to separate the genuine protests over Mr Floyd's death from the violent unrest, often blaming "outsiders" for the looting and arson. There have been many reports of residents trying to stop acts of violence. On Monday night, police received a phone call from a neighbourhood grocery store alleging that George Floyd had paid with a counterfeit $20 note. Officers  were attempting to put him in a police vehicle when he dropped to the ground, telling them he was claustrophobic. According to police, he physically resisted officers and was handcuffed. Video of the incident does not show how the confrontation started.  With Mr Chauvin's knee on his neck, Mr Floyd can be heard saying "please, I can't breathe" and "don't kill me". According to a preliminary autopsy by the county medical examiner, the police officer had his knee on Mr Floyd's neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds - almost three minutes of which was after Mr Floyd became non-responsive. Nearly two minutes before Mr Chauvin removed his knee the other officers checked Mr Floyd's right wrist for a pulse and were unable to find one. He was taken to hospital and pronounced dead around an hour later. The preliminary autopsy, included in the criminal complaint against Mr Chauvin, did not find evidence of "traumatic asphyxia or strangulation". The medical examiner noted Mr Floyd had underlying heart conditions and the combination of these, "potential intoxicants in his system" and being restrained by the officers "likely contributed to his death". Mr Chauvin was charged on Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter over his role in Mr Floyd's death. Mr Floyd's family said they wanted a more serious, first-degree murder charge as well as the arrest of the three other officers involved.  Hennepin County Prosecutor Mike Freeman said he "anticipates charges" for the other officers but would not offer more details.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window US President Donald Trump has said he will postpone this year's G7 summit and invite leaders of other countries to participate in the talks. "I don't feel that... it properly represents what's going on in the world. It's a very outdated group of countries," Mr Trump said on Saturday. The G7 group, which the US hosts this year, includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the UK.  The president said Russia, South Korea, Australia and India should be invited. Speaking to reporters on board the presidential plane Air Force One, Mr Trump said that he was delaying the summit - which was scheduled to take place later in June  - until September.  Last week, Mr Trump said it might be possible to hold a gathering at the White House and potentially parts of Camp David, the US presidential country retreat, despite concerns over the coronavirus pandemic. German Chancellor Angela Merkel later rejected the president's invitation to attend a summit in person because of the outbreak.  Her spokesman thanked Mr Trump, but said the German leader "cannot agree to her personal participation, to a journey to Washington". On Friday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson "agreed on the importance of convening the G7 in person in the near future" following a conversation with the US president, the White House said in a statement.  The G7 - or Group of Seven - leaders were scheduled to meet by videoconference in June in response to Covid-19. The group is made up of the seven of the world's largest economies. It regards itself as "a community of values", with freedom and human rights, democracy and the rule of law, and prosperity and sustainable development as its key principles.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Violence has broken out again in the US as protests continue across the country over the killing of an unarmed black man by police in the state on Minnesota on Monday.

They've traded accusations about access to China for US health experts, and restrictions on flights from China following the outbreak. We've been looking at some of these claims and counter-claims. President Trump failed to get US health officials into China to inspect the outbreak Mr Biden has said there was "no effort" by the president to get US officials into China to inspect the initial outbreak, and also claimed that "Trump never got a CDC team on the ground in China."  But the Trump administration says it did try. Health Secretary Alex Azar told journalists in late January that the US had offered on 6 January to send a team from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) - an offer that was repeated later that month and in February. The CDC is the top government body responsible for protecting public health. Two US experts did get into China as part of a multinational delegation from the World Health Organization, which went in mid-February. These were Weigong Zhou from the US CDC, and Clifford Lane from the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.  It's also worth adding that the CDC itself has had an office in China for decades (more on this further down). Trump allowed 40,000 people to travel to US from China after the travel ban President Trump and Mr Biden have also clashed over how airtight the restrictions introduced on travel from China are. Mr Trump issued an order on 31 January which stopped foreign nationals who had been in China in the previous two weeks from entering the US. This came into effect on 2 February.  An advert by the Biden campaign claims the president let 40,000 travellers into the US from China after he signed the order. President Trump has hit back, saying these were US citizens coming home.  The order does have exemptions for US citizens, legal residents, and non-citizen relatives with close ties. Flight data analysed by the New York Times shows 40,000 people arrived in the US directly from China in the two months after President Trump's restrictions. We don't know how many of these were US citizens, but it is unlikely they all were  - as President Trump claims - with other exemptions also applying. President Trump cut the numbers of US disease experts in China before the outbreak This claim by Mr Biden refers to the presence of a CDC office inside China, which it's maintained for decades. Joe Biden said: "We had over 44, if I'm not mistaken, people from the CDC in China, to observe what was going on. The president brought home the vast majority of them and I think left only four in place." Mr Biden is right that overall numbers of CDC staff in China have come down significantly, but he's not correct about the numbers.  The CDC website says that as of March this year there were 14 staff in total working in China - three from the US and 11 employed locally. That's down from 47 CDC staff a year earlier, eight of whom were US employees and 39 of whom were locally recruited. Mr Biden further alleges that a key US expert role inside China has not been filled. He said: "We had an American official stationed inside the Chinese disease control agency serving as our eyes and ears. President Trump left the position vacant as the outbreak hit." It's true that the last American - a CDC employee -  left her role in China's disease control agency in 2019 before the coronavirus emerged, and was not replaced. When President Trump was asked about this on 22 March, he said that media reports about the CDC were "100 percent wrong" and then referred the question to Robert Redfield, the CDC director, who was with him.  Mr Redfield said the CDC "China office is actually being augmented, as we speak," but didn't explain why this particular role had ceased. Biden called Trump xenophobic for the China travel ban President Trump claims Mr Biden "went crazy" and called him "xenophobic" for introducing restrictions on people entering the US from China. When the order was announced, Mr Biden did say it wasn't the time for "Donald Trump's record of hysterical xenophobia", and the next day tweeted a similar message. The Biden campaign says this wasn't a reference to the travel restrictions, but to the president's overall record in office. Mr Biden has never specifically said he opposed travel restrictions per se, but he did say in March that "travel restrictions based on favouritism and politics, rather than risk, will be counter-productive". He publicly supported the travel ban in early April, with his campaign saying: "Science supported this ban, therefore he did too." President Trump has also said Mr Biden wrote him a letter of apology regarding his comments about the China travel restrictions, but this isn't true, according to the Biden campaign.

Here Alyssa Hulme from Heber City in Utah, US, takes us through a week in her life during the coronavirus pandemic. Alyssa, 31, is a freelance writer and educational consultant. She and her husband Randy have four children: Ellie, eight, Max, seven, Amethyst, four and Josie, one. She has been homeschooling her children for a year, months before the pandemic started.  She says her week started out mundane but ended up awesome! She had no idea on Monday where she would be by Sunday.  Over to Alyssa.... I started the day nursing my one-year-old, passed her off to her dad for breakfast and settled down for a solid 45 minutes of private time before spending the rest of the day homeschooling three kids and caring for a baby. After prayer, meditation, and setting my To-Dos for the day, I purchased a course, the 30-day Money Cure with Carol Tuttle for $297 (£242). The course is on gaining financial affluence by clearing out limiting belief systems that don't serve me and replacing them with healthy practices. I have been looking forward to this course for months and have set aside money for this specific purpose.  After that I moved on to begin my day with my family and set everyone to their beginning tasks of piano, chores, and math. We've been homeschooling for a year now, so it's been a pretty typical day. But at lunchtime instead of transitioning to a play date, my husband took our eldest out for one-on-one time to help supplement the loss of activities and outings that has come with Covid-19 lockdowns.  We've been isolating since the end of February and the loss of friends is wearing on us all. During our midday quiet time I taught two online vocal training lessons virtually to students who live in town. Typically they'd come to my home, but we are all still isolating. After that we settled into our evening routine: I made dinner, we ate together and then held our weekly "family night" - an evening of talent shows, games, treats and fun. Total spend: $297 (£242) I continued with the money course. I am starting up a homeschool consulting business and really want to get on the correct and mentally healthy track for the sake of my business. The course has helped me identify several limiting beliefs I can clear up to allow space for more growth. Then, as every weekday for months, we did homeschool, lunch and quiet time in the afternoon.  During quiet time I had a virtual occupational therapy appointment for my one-year-old in order to evaluate her for possible gross motor delays. This is free through our state. Next I had a virtual appointment with my therapist. This costs $110 after insurance and is withdrawn from my Health Saving Account, an account we pay into monthly through my husband's pay check and is tax free. Therapy always really takes it out of me and today it was compounded by some new business issues I'm working through, so my husband picked up dinner from a fastfood Chinese restaurant for $40. It ended up being a lot of food and will last a good two and a half meals for the six of us.  I took the evening to work more on my business and work on my personal goals. Normally I'd go out with friends or go to the gym, but everything is closed, so I get to save more money and get to know my bed a little better. Total spend: $150 (£122) Our big outing today was a trip up the canyon near our home. We spent two hours hiking in the woods, building fairy houses and crossing streams.  Later in the evening I started making plans for next year's homeschool and bought some notebooks and stationery through Target.com. I really dislike online shopping, especially for something as personal as a notebook. As a writer, the size, weight and binding of a notebook really matters to me, so buying from an online shop is very disorienting.  I also bought a summer dress through Target.com, something I can easily nurse in and hope to be able to wear out and about someday here soon when the quarantine is lifted. Our county just moved to a low-risk status, so hopefully my husband and I can start up our weekly date nights soon.  Total spend: $110.52 (£90) Late last night my husband discovered that he will not be returning to work in his office until the end of 2020. We discussed buying a motorhome, living in it for the next six months, renting out our home, and working and doing homeschool on the go. This has been a dream of ours for 10 years, but it never worked out with our careers. Now is the time.  Today we decided to rent an RV (recreational vehicle) - $1,160 for four nights - and start testing out different configurations and living quarters. We decided to head for Yellowstone National Park. Two of the four entrances are now open! I found an RV site and started packing up.  I normally would have gone grocery shopping last night but our travel plans halted that. As a result we were out of food today, so I grabbed lunch from a local shop for $33.50 and dinner from a restaurant for $45. This is not a normal thing for us to just pick up and drop a ton of money on travel, but we have now been in isolation since the end of February and we are all so ready to have a new experience.  This money is coming from the allotment my husband and I had set aside to celebrate our 10 year anniversary tomorrow, but all our kid-free-for-the-first-time-in-five-years international travel plans were squashed by the virus. This will be an interesting substitute.  We parked the RV along our path to Yellowstone at a Walmart. Anyone can park there overnight for free, so it's a great backup to have in mind when travelling.  Total spend: $1,238.50 (£1,005) Happy 10 year anniversary to my husband and me! We celebrate the day by first getting groceries from Walmart and starting the trek to Yellowstone. I bought groceries for the week for $233. Not too bad for a family of six with limited fridge and cupboard space. We stopped to fill up the RV with gas for $213. After several hours of driving, we arrived at the spot I had reserved online yesterday for two nights, a total of $180, including water and electricity plug-ins. It's a little high for an RV site, but it's the closest I could find to the park entrance online and we decided to value time in the park over the cost of the campsite. (All the sites inside the park are closed due to Covid-19.) Total spend: $626 (£510) More blogs from the BBC's My Money Series: We woke early and headed to the park today, but it was closed due to a snowstorm. The road ended up getting 12 inches of snow in some places! Instead of exploring the park we explored the National Forest just outside. Total spend: $0 We got up early again and were able to enter the park! We used our National Parks Pass to get in, so no cost today. We did everything that was open in the park, the big attractions for us being the Upper and Lower falls outlooks, the Grand Prismatic Spring, and Old Faithful.  We saw so much wildlife on this trip, far more than my husband or I even saw here as children. We drove by and hiked next to elk, bison, deer, egrets, and even several bears including a baby and mama bear. We attribute this expanse of wildlife to conservation efforts in the park as well as the closure of the park over the last several months.  The snow also allowed us to see all the animal tracks throughout the park which our kids loved! Old Faithful had the largest crowd, but still very small even for this time of year. We watched with a small, social distancing crowd for the big event, and then headed out. We were tempted to get take-out from the lodge near Old Faithful, but decided to continue eating the food we'd already purchased knowing the lodge food prices are really marked up.  We packed up and exited the park through the South Entrance and drove through Grand Tetons National Park and got gas in Jackson Hole for $176. Wyoming has lots of open land for free parking, but with a new vehicle and dark terrain, we decided to stay overnight in a National Forest campsite a half hour away for $15 for the night. We pulled in about 23:00, paid via cash in a drop box, and enjoyed sleeping next to a river and under a blanket of stars. Total spend: $191 (£156) Thanks for coming with me on my 10 year wedding anniversary trip! This is not the trip we'd planned, but it's been wonderful for our family. We've seen two more National Parks, taken a break from quarantine in a way that feels safe for us, and enjoyed our beautiful nation.  This is an unusually high week for us because we went on our trip. But considering $2,000 of that was spent on our trip and only $613.02 spent on our normal life, I feel good about that. We had $2,000+ saved for months now to go to Barbados later this summer, but we have given up all international travel until the virus settles down. All in, I feel like this was a successful trip. We would not be moving forward with purchasing an RV had we not had the real life experience of travelling in one for an extended period of time.  The remaining $613.02 also reflects an unusual cost in the money course I am taking. I haven't purchased class tuition in probably five years, but being home all the time has me under-stimulated and needing a project.  I think like many families these days, our spending in many areas has decreased (no extracurriculars, less shopping and self-care purchases, almost no gas purchases), but in other ways expanded. I don't bring my kids into any grocery stores anymore, so when my husband is too busy at work to be with them and we run out of food, I get take-out meals. When our mental health is being run down by monotony, we rent RVs, buy our kids bikes, and online shop for anything to help the kids make it through the day. This is survival for us.  I feel very privileged to be financially secure and have a very stable income. While the world is in chaos we will continue to use money as a tool to support our mental wellbeing and try to take advantage of the new opportunities opening up to us.  We're looking for more people to share what they spend their money on.

Tim Walz spoke after a night of unrest in several US cities over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. He said that as a result he was taking the unprecedented step of mobilising the state's entire National Guard. There are also reports that military police units could deploy. An ex-Minneapolis policeman has been charged with murder over the death of Mr Floyd, 46, in police custody on Monday. Derek Chauvin, 44 and white, was shown in footage kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck for several minutes, even after he said he couldn't breathe. He and three other officers have since been sacked. The video went viral online, reigniting US anger over police killings of black Americans, and reopening deep wounds over racial inequality across the nation. On Friday night protesters clashed with police in cities including New York, Atlanta and Portland. In Washington DC, the White House was briefly locked down. In Houston, where George Floyd grew up, a 19-year-old protester told the Associated Press: "My question is how many more, how many more? I just want to live in a future where we all live in harmony and we're not oppressed." In Minnesota, "our great cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul are under assault," Governor Walz said. "The situation in Minneapolis is now about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great city." He said violence on Friday night had made "a mockery of pretending this is about George Floyd's death, or inequities or historical traumas to our communities of colour".  He and other officials have suggested that many violent protesters came from outside the state to cause trouble, but did not give details.  On Saturday, President Donald Trump said Mr Floyd's death had "filled Americans with horror, anger and grief".  "I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking peace," he said in a televised address from Cape Canaveral in Florida, following the launch into orbit of two Nasa astronauts by billionaire Elon Musk's SpaceX company.  The president denounced the actions of "looters and anarchists", saying that what was needed was "healing not hatred, justice not chaos".   "I will not allow angry mobs to dominate - won't happen," he added. Mr Trump earlier praised the US Secret Service for securing the White House but said if protesters breached the perimeter they "would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen". He blamed violence on "organised groups".  Minnesota remains the most volatile region, with curfews ordered for the Twin Cities of Minneapolis-Saint Paul from 20:00 to 06:00 on Friday and Saturday evening. Protesters defied the curfew on Friday. Fires, many from burning cars, were visible in a number of areas and television pictures showed widespread looting.  Hundreds of troops from the National Guard, a reserve military force that can be called on by the US president or state governors to intervene in domestic emergencies, moved in late at night. Minnesota officials said tens of thousands of people turned out on Friday and they are expecting more unrest on Saturday night.  As a result, Gov Walz said he was activating all National Guard troops available in the state  - reportedly up to 13,000 - for the first time in history to respond to rioters. The Pentagon said some US military units were on alert to support Minnesota if asked. There are long-standing tensions between the black community and police in Minneapolis. Another black man, Philando Castile, was shot and killed in 2016 during a traffic stop close to the epicentre of these protests in a case that gained international attention. African-Americans also suffer significant socio-economic inequalities, entrenched segregation and a higher level of unemployment than the white community.  In Atlanta, Georgia, where buildings were vandalised, a state of emergency was declared for some areas to protect people and property.  Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms issued an impassioned plea, saying: "This is not a protest. This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr. You are disgracing our city. You are disgracing the life of George Floyd." In New York's Brooklyn district, protesters clashed with police, throwing projectiles, starting fires and destroying police vehicles. A number of officers were injured and many arrests made. The mayor of Portland, Oregon, has declared a state of emergency amid looting, fires and an attack on a police precinct. An immediate curfew until 06:00 local time (13:00 GMT) was imposed and it will restart at 20:00. On Monday night, police received a phone call from a neighbourhood grocery store alleging that George Floyd had paid with a counterfeit $20 note. Officers responded and were attempting to put him in a police vehicle when he dropped to the ground, telling them he was claustrophobic. According to police, he physically resisted officers and was handcuffed. Video of the incident does not show how the confrontation started.  With Mr Chauvin's knee on his neck, Mr Floyd can be heard saying "please, I can't breathe" and "don't kill me". According to a preliminary autopsy by the county medical examiner, the police officer had his knee on Mr Floyd's neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds - almost three minutes of which was after Mr Floyd became non-responsive. Nearly two minutes before Mr Chauvin removed his knee the other officers checked Mr Floyd's right wrist for a pulse and were unable to find one. He was taken to hospital and pronounced dead around an hour later. The preliminary autopsy, included in the criminal complaint against Mr Chauvin, did not find evidence of "traumatic asphyxia or strangulation". The medical examiner noted Mr Floyd had underlying heart conditions and the combination of these, "potential intoxicants in his system" and being restrained by the officers "likely contributed to his death". Mr Chauvin was charged on Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter over his role in Mr Floyd's death. Mr Floyd's family and their lawyer, Benjamin Crump, said that this was "welcome but overdue". The family said they wanted a more serious, first-degree murder charge as well as the arrest of the three other officers involved.  Hennepin County Prosecutor Mike Freeman said he "anticipates charges" for the other officers but would not offer more details.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window The private rocket company SpaceX has sent two Nasa astronauts into orbit. It's the first time since the retirement of the shuttles nine years ago that an American crew has made the journey from US territory. Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken are not only trialling a new capsule system, they are also initiating a new business model for Nasa. The agency will no longer own the vehicles it uses but merely purchase the "taxi" service offered by SpaceX. It's hoped companies other than tech billionaire Elon Musk's SpaceX outfit will come in to expand the market. The aerospace giant Boeing already has a contract with Nasa to do so.  Mr Musk himself said he was overcome with emotion watching his hardware take the astronauts to orbit.  "I think this is something that should get people right in the heart, of anyone that has the spirit of exploration. And the US is the distillation of the spirit of exploration," he told reporters. The new capability the CEO is offering will end the reliance of Nasa on Russian rockets and capsules to get its people to the International Space Station (ISS). It was a point picked up on by President Donald Trump, who came to Florida to watch the launch. "Past leaders put the US at the mercy of foreign nations to send our astronauts into orbit. Not anymore," he said. "Today we once again proudly launched American astronauts on American rockets - the best in the world - from right here on American soil." Hurley's and Behnken's Dragon ship left Earth atop its Falcon-9 rocket precisely on time - at 15:22 EDT (19:22 GMT / 20:22 BST). Meteorologists had forecast only a 50:50 chance of favourable conditions around Florida's Kennedy Space Center at lift-off, but, as luck would have it, the weather window stayed open and the SpaceX controllers grabbed their opportunity. The Falcon soared off the spaceport's famous 39A pad to head northeast out over the Atlantic. After two-and-a-half minutes, the lower-stage of the vehicle had separated to return to a drone ship at sea. And after a further six minutes, the crew were safely inserted into orbit.  Hurley and Behnken are set to arrive at the ISS on Sunday. They'll use some of the intervening hours to test equipment and procedures in their capsule, including doing some manual flying.  Although the Dragon capsule is a fully automated vehicle capable of finding its own way to the ISS, the crew needs to prepare for all eventualities and that means knowing exactly how the ship will behave in their hands. Uniquely, the Dragon has no control stick; all flight commands must be entered via a touchscreen panel. One of their first tasks in orbit was simply to name their ship - in the tradition of past US spacefarers, all the way back to the Mercury programme. Radioing down to Earth, they announced it would be called Endeavour.  Doug Hurley said: "We chose Endeavour for a few reasons: One, because of this incredible endeavour that Nasa, SpaceX and the US have been on since the end of the shuttle programme back in 2011. The other reason is a little more personal to Bob and I. We both had our first flights on shuttle Endeavour and it just meant so much to us to carry on that name." Endeavour was the ship commanded by British explorer James Cook on his voyage to Australia in the late 18th Century. The length of Hurley's and Behnken's stay at the ISS is uncertain, but is likely to be somewhere between one and four months.  Assuming their return to a splashdown in the Atlantic is as smooth as the launch, Nasa and SpaceX will move directly into the full terms of their new relationship. The company has a $2.6bn (£2.1bn) contract with the agency to fly six operational crew missions to the ISS.  The first of these should occur at the end August, or very soon after; and will see four astronauts climb aboard a Dragon rather than just the two we saw on this occasion. Saturday's launch went ahead against the background of the coronavirus crisis.  Crowds were encouraged not to assemble near the Kennedy complex, and Nasa itself severely limited the number of guests invited on to the spaceport. As for the astronauts, they would ordinarily observe a quarantine before flight. But again Nasa reduced the number of people the men could come into contact with in the weeks running up to launch, and those that had to get close were instructed to wear masks. For SpaceX, Saturday marked another significant milestone for the company which was founded just 18 years ago. The firm has upended the launcher industry with its reusable vehicles and is now pioneering a new market-driven approach to human spaceflight. It hasn't all been plain sailing - as evidenced by a spectacular explosion at the  firm's prototyping facility in Boca Chica, Texas, on Friday. But the company has routinely proved naysayers wrong, and Nasa believes its relationship with Elon Musk will save billion of dollars that can be diverted to the more complex task of getting people back to the Moon and then to Mars.     "We want to establish a commercial environment in low-Earth orbit so that we can focus on the hard job of exploring beyond our home planet, to establish a sustained presence on the Moon and get to Mars to establish a presence there," said Bob Cabana, the director at Kennedy.  "We can't do that if we're locked here in low-Earth orbit, and commercial crew - that's the beginning of a whole new era of spaceflight."

George Floyd, 46, died after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage of the arrest on 25 May shows a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck while he was pinned to the floor. Mr Chauvin, 44, has since been charged with murder. The key events that led to Mr Floyd's death happened within just 30 minutes. Based on accounts from witnesses, video footage and official statements, here's what we know so far.  It began with a report of a fake $20 (£16.20) bill. A report was made on the evening of 25 May, when Mr Floyd bought a pack of cigarettes from Cup Foods, a grocery store. Believing the $20 bill he used to be counterfeit, a store employee reported it to police.  Mr Floyd had been living in Minneapolis for several years after moving there from his native Houston, Texas. He had recently been working as a bouncer in the city but, like millions of other Americans, was left jobless by the coronavirus pandemic.  Mr Floyd was a regular at Cup Foods. He was a friendly face, a pleasant customer who never caused any trouble, the store owner Mike Abumayyaleh told NBC.  But Mr Abumayyaleh was not at work on the day of the incident. In reporting the suspicious bill, his teenage employee was just following protocol. In a call to 911, made at 20:01, the employee told the operator he had demanded the cigarettes back but "he [Floyd] doesn't want to do that", according to a transcript released by authorities. The employee said the man appeared "drunk" and "not in control of himself", the transcript says.   Shortly after the call, at around 20:08, two police officers arrived. Mr Floyd was sitting with two other people in a car parked around the corner. After approaching the car, one of the officers, Thomas Lane, pulled out his gun and ordered Mr Floyd to show his hands. In an account of the incident, prosecutors do not explain why Mr Lane thought it necessary to draw his gun. Mr Lane, prosecutors said, "put his hands on Mr Floyd, and pulled him out of the car". Then Mr Floyd "actively resisted being handcuffed". Once handcuffed, though, Mr Floyd became compliant while Mr Lane explained he was being arrested for "passing counterfeit currency".  It was when officers tried to put Mr Floyd in their squad car that a struggle ensued.  At about 20:14, Mr Floyd "stiffened up, fell to the ground, and told the officers he was claustrophobic", according to the report.  Mr Chauvin arrived at the scene. He and other officers were involved in a further attempt to put Mr Floyd in the police car. During this attempt, at 20:19, Mr Chauvin pulled Mr Floyd away from the passenger side, causing him to fall to the ground, the report said.  He lay there, face down, still in handcuffs. That's when witnesses started to film Mr Floyd, who appeared to be in a distressed state. These moments, captured on multiple mobile phones and shared widely on social media, would prove to be Mr Floyd's last. Mr Floyd was restrained by officers, while Mr Chauvin placed his left knee between his head and neck. "I can't breathe," Mr Floyd said repeatedly, pleading for his mother and begging "please, please, please". For eight minutes and 46 seconds, Mr Chauvin kept his knee on Mr Floyd's neck, the prosecutors' report says. About six minutes into that period, Mr Floyd became non-responsive. In videos of the incident, this was when Mr Floyd fell silent, as bystanders urged the officers to check his pulse. One of the other officers, JA Kueng, did just that, checking Mr Floyd's right wrist, but "couldn't find one". Yet the other officers did not move.  At 20:27, Mr Chauvin removed his knee from Mr Floyd's neck. Motionless, Mr Floyd was rolled on to a gurney and taken to the Hennepin County Medical Center in an ambulance.  He was pronounced dead about an hour later. On the night before his death, Mr Floyd had spoken to one of his closest friends, Christopher Harris. He had advised Mr Floyd to contact a temporary jobs agency. Forgery, he said, was out of character for Mr Floyd. "The way he died was senseless," Harris said. "He begged for his life. He pleaded for his life. When you try so hard to put faith in this system, a system that you know isn't designed for you, when you constantly seek justice by lawful means and you can't get it, you begin to take the law into your own hands."

                                 Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places, like Portland, Oregon, protesters lie in the road, chanting "I can’t breathe". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floyd’s arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat.

                                 President Trump blames the violence on a lack of leadership in Minneapolis and threatens to send in the National Guard in a tweet.  He follows it up in a second tweet with a warning "when the looting starts, the shooting starts". The second tweet is hidden by Twitter for "glorifying violence".

                                 A CNN reporter, Omar Jimenez, is arrested while covering the Minneapolis protest. Mr Jimenez was reporting live when police officers handcuffed him. A few minutes later several of his colleagues are also arrested. They are all later released once they are confirmed to be members of the media. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with murder and manslaughter. The charges carry a combined maximum 35-year sentence.

                                 President Trump threatens to send in the military to quell growing civil unrest. He says if cities and states fail to control the protests and "defend their residents" he will deploy the army and "quickly solve the problem for them". Mr Trump poses in front of a damaged church shortly after police used tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters nearby.

The EU urged him to reconsider the decision, while Germany's health minister called it a "disappointing setback for international health". The head of the US Senate's health committee, a Republican like Mr Trump, said now was not the time to leave. Mr Trump said the WHO had failed to hold China to account over coronavirus. The WHO, a UN agency that helps countries promote healthcare and tackle outbreaks of disease, has faced regular criticism from the US president over its handling of the outbreak. He suspended US funding to the WHO last month and on Friday permanently halted the payment, which last year stood at more than $400m (£324m; €360m), the largest single contribution at around 15% of its total budget. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and top EU diplomat, Josep Borrell, said in a statement: "In the face of this global threat, now is the time for enhanced co-operation and common solutions. Actions that weaken international results must be avoided. "We urge the US to reconsider its announced decision." German Health Minister Jens Spahn described the setback as "disappointing" although he accepted the WHO "needs reform". "The EU must take a leading role and engage more financially," he said. A spokesperson for the UK said: "Coronavirus is a global challenge and the World Health Organization has an important role to play in leading the international health response. We have no plans to withdraw our funding." The chair of the US Senate Health Committee, Lamar Alexander, said the move could hamper the discovery of a vaccine against Covid-19 and urged a reversal of the decision in the "strongest terms possible". "Certainly there needs to be a good, hard look at mistakes the World Health Organization might have made in connection with coronavirus, but the time to do that is after the crisis has been dealt with, not in the middle of it," he said. Ex-presidential candidate and US Senator Elizabeth Warren tweeted: "President Trump's decision to leave the @WHO during a global pandemic alienates our allies, undermines our global leadership, and threatens the health of the American people." Anders Nordstrom, a former WHO acting director general, said he was "deeply concerned" the move would increase political tension at a time when "we need to have global solidarity". South African Health Minister Zweli Mkhize called the decision "unfortunate".  WHO member states agreed on 19 May to set up an independent inquiry into the global response to the pandemic. Speaking  at the White House, Mr Trump said: "Because they have failed to make the requested and greatly needed reforms, we will be today terminating our relationship with the World Health Organization and redirecting those funds to other worldwide and deserving urgent global public health needs."  It is not clear when any US withdrawal might take place. A 1948 agreement between the US and WHO allows for one year's notice before pulling out.  Mr Trump has accused China of trying to cover up the outbreak of coronavirus, which occurred in the city of Wuhan late last year. He also says that "China has total control over the World Health Organization". The president accused China of pressurising the WHO to "mislead the world" about the virus, without elaborating. "The world is now suffering as a result of the malfeasance of the Chinese government," he said. The US will redirect its funds for the WHO  to other health groups. More than 102,000 people in the US have lost their lives to Covid-19 - by far the biggest death toll in the world.  Opponents say Mr Trump is trying to deflect criticism of his handling of the pandemic ahead of his re-election bid this year. Meanwhile, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian has said that Mr Trump is trying to mislead the public, smear China and "shift the blame for [the US's] own incompetent response".Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window President Donald Trump has announced that he will start to end preferential treatment for Hong Kong in trade and travel, in response to a new security law pushed by Beijing. He described the Chinese government's moves to introduce the measure in Hong Kong as a "tragedy".  Mr Trump also said he was "terminating" the US relationship with the World Health Organization over Covid-19. China has told the West to "stop interfering" in Hong Kong. The territory, a former British colony, enjoys unique freedoms not seen in mainland China. But many people there see the looming security law as bringing an end to Hong Kong's special status, agreed under a 1984 agreement between China and the UK. There are fears the proposed measure - which has sparked a wave of anti-mainland protests - could quash freedoms by making it a crime to undermine Beijing's authority in the territory. This week, Britain said that if China went forward with the law, it could offer British National (Overseas) passport holders in Hong Kong a path to UK citizenship. On Friday, the UK Home Office confirmed that up to three million people with BNO status could acquire citizenship in this way - as long as they applied for and were granted a passport. Mr Trump said that he no longer considered Hong Kong to be separate from China, and accused Beijing of violating its obligations under the 1984 agreement "China has replaced One Country, Two Systems with One Country, One System", Mr Trump told reporters in the White House's Rose Garden, in a prepared statement that attacked China on several fronts.  "This is a tragedy for Hong Kong... China has smothered Hong Kong's freedom." Currently, Hong Kong - a major global financial centre - enjoys a special status with the US compared to mainland China. It is treated as a separate customs and travel territory and so is not, for example, subject to trade tariffs applied by the US on the mainland. Mr Trump also said sanctions would be imposed on Chinese and Hong Kong officials who were believed by Washington to be involved in eroding the territory's autonomy. He did not outline what form these sanctions would take.  The State Department, he added, would revise its travel advisory for Hong Kong in light of "increased danger of surveillance" from China.  The president also said the US would suspend the entry of foreign nationals from China identified by the US as potential security risks. There are fears that this could affect thousands of graduate students.  No further details were given regarding the "termination" of the US relationship with the WHO. In April, the US president said he would halt funding to the UN agency because it has "failed in its basic duty" in its response to the coronavirus outbreak. He accused it of mismanaging and covering up the spread of the virus after it emerged in China. The Global Times newspaper - run by China's ruling communist party - called the move towards revoking Hong Kong's special status with the US "recklessly arbitrary".  Hong Kong's Justice Secretary Teresa Cheng told the BBC's Chinese Service earlier on Friday that any threat of sanctions was unacceptable.  "Are the sanctions being imposed with a view to coerce another state to change their policy...? Any such sanctions are not going to benefit anyone," she said.   Analysis by Zhaoyin Feng, BBC Chinese  The US removing Hong Kong's special privileges sends a strong warning signal to China, which activists and protesters in the territory will welcome.  The announced measures cover not only Hong Kong, but also intellectual property theft and Chinese firms listed in the US.  According to media reports, Washington is expected to revoke more than 3,000 Chinese graduate students' visas. While this accounts for only 1% of the total number of Chinese students in America, Washington's move will open yet another front in bilateral tensions. But the separate punishments announced for China may not be as harsh as what had been expected, as indicated by a rise in the stock markets after Donald Trump's speech.  Beijing will probably match some of Washington's sanctions and restrictions in a tit-for-tat manner. After a short-lived honeymoon since the trade deal, China and the US appear to be heading towards an abyss at an accelerating speed. China has proposed security legislation which would make it a crime to undermine Beijing's authority in Hong Kong, and could also see China installing its own security agencies in the region for the first time. China's parliament has backed the resolution - which now passes to the country's senior leadership.  Full details about exactly what behaviour will be outlawed under the new security law are not yet clear. It is due to be enacted before September. However, it is expected to criminalise:  Experts say they fear the law could see people punished for criticising Beijing - as happens in mainland China. For example, Nobel Laureate Liu Xiaobo was jailed for 11 years for subversion after he co-authored a document calling for political reform. China's foreign ministry in Hong Kong described US criticism of the new draft law as "utterly imperious, unreasonable and shameless".Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window US President Donald Trump has announced that he is terminating the country's relationship with the World Health Organization (WHO). The president has accused the WHO of failing to hold Beijing to account over the coronavirus pandemic. "China has total control over the World Health Organization," the president said while announcing measures aimed at punishing Beijing. Washington will redirect funds to other bodies, he said. The WHO, a UN agency that helps countries promote healthcare and tackle outbreaks of disease, is yet to comment on Mr Trump's decision.  But on Saturday, the European Union led calls for the Trump administration to reconsider its decision, warning it could hamper global efforts to tackle the coronavirus pandemic.  Mr Trump announced last month that he was going to halt US funding for the WHO unless it undertook "substantive improvements" within 30 days. The WHO's Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has promised a review of its response to the pandemic and defended its independence. The US is the global health agency's largest single contributor, providing more than $400m (£324m; €360m) in 2019, around 15% of its total budget. Other countries, including Germany and the UK, have said they have no intention of withdrawing funding from the WHO, which is co-ordinating a global initiative to develop a vaccine against Covid-19. Mr Trump, who is campaigning for re-election this year and has been criticised for his own handling of the pandemic, has blamed China for trying to cover up the coronavirus outbreak. More than 102,000 people in the US have lost their lives to Covid-19 - by far the biggest death toll in the world.  "We will be today terminating our relationship with the World Health Organization and directing those funds" to other global public health charities, Mr Trump said in the White House Rose Garden. "The world is now suffering as a result of the malfeasance of the Chinese government," he said. He added that China had "instigated a global pandemic that has cost over 100,000 American lives". The president accused China of pressurising the WHO to "mislead the world" about the virus, without giving evidence for his allegations. Mr Trump's criticism of the WHO's handling of the pandemic began last month when he threatened to permanently withdraw US funding, suggesting the UN health agency had "failed in its basic duty" in its response. "It is clear the repeated missteps by you and your organisation in responding to the pandemic have been extremely costly for the world," he wrote in a letter to the WHO's chief on 18 May. He later labelled the WHO a "puppet of China". China has accused the US of being responsible for the spread of the virus on its own soil, attributing the outbreak to American "politicians who lie". Earlier this month, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Mr Trump was trying to mislead the public, smear China and "shift the blame for [the US's] own incompetent response". WHO member states have since agreed to set up an independent inquiry into the global response to the pandemic. There has been much concern among health experts and politicians, many of whom fear Mr Trump's decision will impede global efforts to bring the pandemic under control. On Saturday, the EU issued a joint statement from its Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell, who urged the US to think again. It said for the WHO to fight pandemics effectively, "the participation and support of all is required and very much needed".  "We urge the US to reconsider its announced decision," the statement added. German's Health Minister Jens Spahn also criticised the move, saying it amounted to a "disappointing backlash for international health". In the US, there has been criticism from across the political spectrum. Republican Senator Lamar Alexander said he disagreed with the president's decision because, without US funding, clinical trials to develop a coronavirus vaccine could be disrupted. "Certainly there needs to be a good, hard look at mistakes the World Health Organization might have made in connection with coronavirus, but the time to do that is after the crisis has been dealt with, not in the middle of it," the chair of the US Senate Health Committee said.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Protesters have clashed with police in cities across the US over the killing of an unarmed African-American man at the hands of officers in Minneapolis. Minnesota's governor said the tragedy of the death of George Floyd in police custody had morphed into "something much different - wanton destruction". New York, Atlanta, Portland and other cities have seen violence, while the White House was briefly locked down. An ex-Minneapolis policeman has been charged with murder over the death. Derek Chauvin, who is white, was shown in footage kneeling on 46-year-old Mr Floyd's neck on Monday. He and three other officers have since been sacked. Mr Chauvin, 44, is due to appear in court in Minneapolis for the first time on Monday. President Donald Trump has described the incident as "a terrible, terrible thing" and said he had spoken with Mr Floyd's family, whom he described as "terrific people". The Floyd case has reignited US anger over police killings of black Americans, and reopened deep wounds over racial inequality across the nation. It follows the deaths of Michael Brown, Eric Garner and others, which have all occurred since the Black Lives Matter movement was sparked by the acquittal of neighbourhood watchman George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin in 2012. Minnesota remains the most volatile region, with curfews ordered for the Twin Cities of Minneapolis-Saint Paul from 20:00 to 06:00 on Friday and Saturday evening. Protesters defied the curfew on Friday. Fires, many from burning cars, were visible in a number of areas with fire officials unable to reach some sites. Television pictures also showed looting in Minneapolis, with police officers thin on the ground. Only at about midnight (05:00 GMT) did police and National Guard troops move in in any numbers, the Star Tribune reports. State Governor Tim Walz, in an early morning press briefing, described the situation as "chaotic, dangerous and unprecedented". He said he took responsibility for "underestimating the wanton destruction and the sheer size of this crowd" when questioned about the lack of police on the streets. He said the Guard deployment was the largest in state history but admitted "there's simply more of them than us". He said those on the streets "don't give one damn" about the stay-at-home order. The Pentagon has put the military on alert for possible deployment in Minneapolis. On Friday evening, crowds gathered near the White House in Washington waving photographs of Mr Floyd and chanting "I can't breathe" - invoking his last words and those of Eric Garner, a black man who died after being held in a police chokehold in New York in 2014. The White House was then temporarily placed on lockdown, with the US Secret Service closing entrances and exits. In Atlanta, a state of emergency was declared for some areas to protect people and property. Buildings were vandalised and a police vehicle was set alight as protesters gathered near the offices of news broadcaster CNN. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms issued a passionate plea, saying: "This is not a protest. This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr. You are disgracing our city. You are disgracing the life of George Floyd." In New York's Brooklyn district, protesters clashed with police, throwing projectiles, starting fires and destroying police vehicles. A number of officers were injured and many arrests made. Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted: "We don't ever want to see another night like this." The mayor of Portland, Oregon, has declared a state of emergency amid looting, fires and an attack on a police precinct. An immediate curfew until 06:00 local time (13:00 GMT) was imposed and it will restart at 20:00. In Detroit, police are investigating after a 19-year-old man was killed when a vehicle pulled up to protesters and shots were fired into the crowd. In Dallas, officers launched tear gas canisters after they were pelted with stones, with tear gas also fired in Phoenix, Indianapolis and Denver. Protesters blocked roads in Los Angeles and also in Oakland, where windows were smashed and "Kill Cops" graffiti sprayed. Mr Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter over his role in Mr Floyd's death. Mr Floyd's family and their lawyer, Benjamin Crump, said that this was "welcome but overdue". The family said they wanted a more serious, first-degree murder charge as well as the arrest of the three other officers involved.  Hennepin County Prosecutor Mike Freeman said he "anticipates charges" for the other officers but would not offer more details. Mr Freeman said his office "charged this case as quickly as evidence has been presented to us". "This is by far the fastest that we've ever charged a police officer," he noted. According to the criminal complaint, Mr Chauvin acted with "a depraved mind, without regard for human life".  Meanwhile, Mr Chauvin's wife has filed for divorce, her lawyers say. The full report by the county medical examiner has not been released, but the complaint states that the post-mortem examination did not find evidence of "traumatic asphyxia or strangulation". The medical examiner noted Mr Floyd had underlying heart conditions and the combination of these, "potential intoxicants in his system" and being restrained by the officers "likely contributed to his death". The report says Mr Chauvin had his knee on Mr Floyd's neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds - almost three minutes of which was after Mr Floyd became non-responsive. Nearly two minutes before he removed his knee the other officers checked Mr Floyd's right wrist for a pulse and were unable to find one. He was taken to the Hennepin County Medical Center in an ambulance and pronounced dead around an hour later. The Minnesota police handbook states that officers trained on how to compress a detainee's neck without applying direct pressure to the airway can use a knee under its use-of-force policy. This is regarded as a non-deadly-force option. At the White House on Friday, Mr Trump said he had asked the justice department to expedite an investigation it announced on Friday into whether any civil rights laws were violated in Mr Floyd's death. The president also said "looters should not be allowed to drown out the voices of so many peaceful protesters". Earlier, he described the rioters as "thugs" who were dishonouring Mr Floyd's memory. Social media network Twitter accused Mr Trump of glorifying violence in a post that said: "When the looting starts, the shooting starts." Officers suspected Mr Floyd had used a counterfeit $20 note and were attempting to put him in a police vehicle when he dropped to the ground, telling them he was claustrophobic. According to police, he physically resisted officers and was handcuffed.

Violence erupted again in the city where George Floyd died, but was also seen in New York, Atlanta, Oakland, Dallas and many other cities across the country. The greatest anger among protesters remains in Minneapolis, where people defied a city curfew. The city has been accused of not deploying enough  police and National Guard on the streets. State Governor Tim Walz accepted responsibility but said simply "there's more of them than us". A number of fires were started in Minneapolis, and fire officials said it was too dangerous to reach all of them. Mr Walz said the protests had morphed into chaos and "wanton destruction". Several areas saw looting of shops. But the protests were far wider than previous nights since Mr Floyd's death on Monday. Police in Washington were out in force outside the White House, which was briefly locked down. Police fired pepper spray to keep protesters from the building. Tear gas was used to disperse crowds protesting in Oakland in California.... ... while fireworks were thrown onto Freeway 110 North, in Los Angeles, as protesters tried to block roads. There were also chaotic scenes in Brooklyn, New York, where Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted: "We don't ever want to see another night like this." Tear gas was fired to disperse protesters both in Detroit... ... and in Phoenix, Arizona. Atlanta also saw some ugly scenes, including this burning of a police car, prompting a passionate plea from Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms.

Derek Chauvin, who is white, was shown in footage kneeling on 46-year-old George Floyd's neck on Monday. He and three other officers have been sacked. Days of looting and arson in the Minnesota city have boiled over into nationwide protests. The case has reignited US anger over police killings of black Americans. Hennepin County Prosecutor Mike Freeman said Mr Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. He said he "anticipates charges" for the three other officers but would not offer more details. Mr Freeman said his office "charged this case as quickly as evidence has been presented to us". "This is by far the fastest that we've ever charged a police officer," he noted. According to the criminal complaint, Mr Chauvin acted with "a depraved mind, without regard for human life".  On Friday evening, the White House was placed on lockdown after a protest was held outside. "I can't breathe," demonstrators could be heard chanting, invoking the last words of Mr Floyd and Eric Garner, a black man who died after being held in a police chokehold in New York in 2014. The lockdown ended at about 20:30 EDT (00:30 GMT Saturday), with the US Secret Service reopening the building's entrances and exits to staff.  Meanwhile, curfews have been ordered for the Twin Cities of Minneapolis-Saint Paul, from 20:00 to 06:00 on both Friday and Saturday night.  On Thursday, during the third night of protests over Mr Floyd's death, a police station was set alight. A number of buildings have been burned, looted and vandalised in recent days, prompting the activation of the state's National Guard troops. In Atlanta on Friday, a police vehicle was set alight as protesters gathered near the offices of news broadcaster CNN. There have also been demonstrations elsewhere, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Louisville, Phoenix, Columbus and Memphis. Frustration was already simmering over the recent deaths of two other black Americans, Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia and Breonna Taylor. The full report by the county medical examiner has not been released, but the complaint states that the post-mortem examination did not find evidence of "traumatic asphyxia or strangulation". The medical examiner noted Mr Floyd had underlying heart conditions and the combination of these, "potential intoxicants in his system" and being restrained by the officers "likely contributed to his death". The report says Mr Chauvin had his knee on Mr Floyd's neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds - almost three minutes of which was after Mr Floyd became non-responsive. Nearly two minutes before he removed his knee the other officers checked Mr Floyd's right wrist for a pulse and were unable to find one. He was taken to the Hennepin County Medical Center in an ambulance and pronounced dead around an hour later. The Minnesota police handbook states that officers trained on how to compress a detainee's neck without applying direct pressure to the airway can use a knee under its use-of-force policy. This is regarded as a non-deadly-force option. At the White House on Friday, President Donald Trump called the incident "a terrible, terrible thing" and said he had spoken with Mr Floyd's family, whom he described as "terrific people". He said he had asked the justice department to expedite an investigation it announced on Friday into whether any civil rights laws were violated in Mr Floyd's death. The president also said "looters should not be allowed to drown out the voices of so many peaceful protesters". Earlier, he described the rioters as "thugs" who were dishonouring Mr Floyd's memory. Social media network Twitter accused Mr Trump of glorifying violence in a post that said: "When the looting starts, the shooting starts." Mr Floyd's family and their lawyer, Benjamin Crump, said that the arrest was "welcome but overdue". The family said they wanted a more serious, first-degree murder charge as well as the arrest of the other officers involved.  The statement called for the city to change its policing, saying: "Today, George Floyd's family is having to explain to his children why their father was executed by police on video." Former US President Barack Obama also weighed in, saying: "This shouldn't be 'normal' in 2020 America." His statement added: "If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better." Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said the arrest was "a good first step toward justice". Officers suspected Mr Floyd had used a counterfeit $20 (£16) note and were attempting to put him in a police vehicle when he dropped to the ground, telling them he was claustrophobic. According to police, he physically resisted officers and was handcuffed. Video of the incident does not show how the confrontation started, but a white officer can be seen with his knee on Mr Floyd's neck, pinning him down.

By Barrett Holmes Pitner  In saying "when the looting starts, the shooting starts", President Donald Trump echoed a December 1967 quote from Miami Police Chief Walter Headley. It was used as a threat towards African Americans in Miami and as part of his brutal "get tough policy" where he advocated the use of guns and dogs to stop civil rights protests. In August of 1968, as Richard Nixon addressed the Republican National Convention in Miami, the police there killed three protesters, injured 18, and arrested over 200 people.   Similar violent police attacks defined America during the 1960s, as African Americans fought for civil rights and voting rights.  It is not a widely known phrase, but Headley's sentiments have long been part of the American status quo - US law enforcement and political figures have made many statements invoking Headley and they still do today.  It's frightening to now hear Headley's words emanate from the highest reaches of our government.

Akinwumi Adesina is a sharp dresser known for his expensive tailored suits, immaculate white shirts and an endless supply of colourful bow ties.  But the clean public persona of the 60-year-old president of the African Development Bank (AfDB) is now being questioned after a string of corruption and abuse of office allegations from his own staff spilled into the open.  Mr Adesina has denied all the allegations. The board of governors of the 55-year-old institution met on Tuesday to discuss whether to bring in an outside investigator into the allegations concerning the Nigerian's conduct just days after the US rejected an initial inquiry that cleared him. The prospects of an independent probe comes only three months before he was expected to be re-elected unopposed at its annual general meeting in August.  The 20-point allegations of "impunity and bad governance" from unnamed employees have exposed a rift between Mr Adesina and ordinary staff.  The "Group of Concerned Staff Members of the AfDB" claimed that Mr Adesina has used the bank's resources for self-promotion and personal gain while also paying out huge but undeserved severance packages to staff who resigned mysteriously, and favouring his fellow Nigerians.  US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin personally signed a letter to the board rejecting an internal investigation that cleared Mr Adesina. "Mnuchin's move is significant because it has now cast a limelight on governance issues and on [the] importance of an independent investigation to uphold the integrity of the AfDB," said Barbara Barungi, the bank's former lead economist on Nigeria. "There are very few people that were willing to stick their necks out." Besides the core 54 African countries, the US is one of the 27 non-regional members of the AfDB and its second largest shareholder.  "I think AfDB is Africa's most valuable institution," said one insider who spoke on condition of anonymity.  "But what you have now is the biggest paymaster, the US, in a stand-off against the Africans. If you read Mnuchin's letter carefully, it has put the bank on notice." The BBC has obtained the original whistleblowers' email from January 2020, sent to two executive directors of the bank, Yano Takuji (Japanese) and Steven Dowd (American), and the British director for its Integrity and Anti-Corruption Department Alan Bacarese.  In an April update circulated to a wider pool of senior managers, the whistleblowers said the Ethics Committee headed by Mr Takuji failed to examine their concerns. The committee later carried out an investigation and declared that Mr Adesina was "totally exonerated of all allegations made against him" and recommended that the board of governors adopt its conclusions. In early May, the board's chair - Ivorian Planning Minister Nialé Kaba - wrote to shareholders that the African finance ministers who supervise the bank's management intended to clear Mr Adesina. "We fear that the wholesale dismissal of all allegations without appropriate investigation will tarnish the reputation of this institution as one that does not uphold high standards of ethics and governance," Mr Mnuchin wrote back. "Therefore, the United States cannot support dismissing the allegations at this stage," he added. Ms Kaba said in a statement that a decision had not been made about Mr Adesina and he remained in office.  "The bureau, which I chair, wishes to reassure the public that it is seized with the matter and it is treating it with the utmost seriousness that it deserves," she said. The whistleblowers have accused Mr Adesina of major conflicts of interest in his dealings with current and former employees, unethical conduct and preferential treatment. Sources: AfDB; Forbes magazine Mr Adesina, who holds a PhD in agricultural economics from Purdue University in the US, did not respond to BBC requests for comment but released a statement. "In spite of unprecedented attempts by some to tarnish my reputation and prejudice the bank's governance procedures, I maintain my innocence with regard to trumped up allegations that unjustly seek to impugn my honour and integrity," he wrote.  "I am confident that fair, transparent and just processes that respect the rules, procedures and governance systems of the Bank, and rule of law, will ultimately prove that I have not violated the Code of Ethics of this extraordinary institution." The AfDB board meeting is said to have agreed to an independent investigation into the allegations concerning Mr Adesina's conduct after Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland supported the US position, Bloomberg news agency first reported.  "Should it surprise the world that we're getting a second investigation backed by no African country? What does that say about the other countries that have lined up behind the US?" wonders Debisi Araba, a friend of Mr Adesina's.  "He's due to run unopposed but you want to muddy the waters with this stain of corruption. I believe he will be vindicated."   Cape Verde:$33m loan approved to tackle Covid-19 Zimbabwe:$13.7m grant approved to improve health sector Cameroon and Chad:$45m allocated for bridge to link the two states Eswatini:$1.67m given for study on  building dams Mr Araba worked for Mr Adesina in the Nigerian government and was also an intern at the bank while doing his PhD in 2009.  He says the bank has always had a culture of salacious rumour and gossip but faults the US for formalizing the "crass, bargain basement reasoning" into a complaint. This was denied by a US Treasury spokesperson, who told the BBC: "The United States continues to value the AfDB and its efforts to promote development, reduce poverty, and address the current health and economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic on the African continent." Some policy analysts at think-tanks in Washington, DC,  worry about the timing of the American pushback and its longer-term consequences in Africa. "A prolonged battle will be a distraction for the AfDB when its resources are more desperately needed than ever for its borrowers," Nancy Birdsall, a Senior Fellow at the Center for Global Development told the BBC.  She said it was not good for the AfDB if Mr Mnuchin was unhappy and suggested that "the US Treasury should look for some form of quiet compromise in which no-one loses face". Ms Birdsall also reiterated a recommendation she made in a 2018 paper for the leadership of the AfDB to open up its shareholding, including to China and oil-rich economies.  But Daniel F Runde, senior vice-president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, disagreed.  He said the Abidjan-based bank that lends exclusively to African governments represented one of the few non-China-led and western-funded approaches to development on the continent. "If Adesina is cleared, the US may need to mend fences with the management because China will probably go on a shopping spree in Africa after Covid-19, and we will need every non-Chinese tool to respond," he said.  Mr Runde saw Mr Mnuchin's letter as "disruption" and called it a good tactic but a poor strategy. "Now that the Trump administration has caused disruption and perhaps made a point, they have to decide when this plays out," he said.  Last October, the 81 shareholders of the bank pledged extra funds to more than double its capital to $208bn (£170bn).  Missouri Congressman Emmanuel Cleaver, who sponsored a bill backing the capital increase in the US House of Representatives, came out in support of the new inquiry. "Independent accountability measures strengthen institutions and reinforce their legitimacy - both domestically and internationally. I am pleased the African Development Bank's Board agreed to take this important step," the Democrat told the BBC in a statement.  Mr Adesina is an eloquent advocate for Africa and the bank and a good fundraiser, but his detractors say he promises more than he delivers.  "His administration hasn't always been fantastic and perhaps he has run roughshod over some people. Maybe the practices haven't always been what they should be, and the feeling is that the board just whitewashed the investigation," the insider said. The whistleblowers also accused Mr Adesina of preferential treatment for Nigeria and Nigerians.  "I don't think we should trivialise the issues and reduce them to anti-Nigerian sentiment," said Ms Barungi, the Ugandan-born, Lagos-based former bank employee.  "It's really more about governance concerns that require attention and the investigation to help clear the air," she added. Mr Araba, a Nigerian, said talk of the "Nigerianisation of the bank" was false as the country was under-represented in employee numbers despite being the largest shareholder.  As the crisis at the bank escalates, employees, consultants and government officials in African capitals, as well as American foreign policy nerds, wonder how this impasse will end.  But at the Treasury building right next to the White House, Mr Mnuchin and his advisors are doubling down. "Undertaking an independent evaluation of facts is not at odds with a presumption of innocence, and by promoting transparency and good governance, it can only strengthen the AfDB's capacity to deliver results to people across Africa," the spokesman told the BBC. Mr Adesina's carefully curated career could crumble if a new investigation criticises his reign at the AfDB. His style is solid, but the substance is now under scrutiny. Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Twitter has hidden a tweet by President Donald Trump from his profile, saying it violates rules about glorifying violence. It did the same hours later when the official White House account tweeted a copy of the president's words. Instead of being deleted, both tweets can be viewed by clicking on a prominent warning. It says that "Twitter has determined that it may be in the public's interest for the Tweet to remain accessible." This is the latest twist in an escalating row between Twitter and the White House. The US president finds himself in unexpected company alongside other world leaders whose tweets have been censored. In February 2019, Twitter had a tweet by Iranian Leader Supreme Ayatollah Ali Khamenei removed after it appeared to threaten author Salman Rushdie. Also last year, several accounts associated with Cuban President Raul Castro and members of his government were suspended, citing policy violations. Mr Trump was tweeting about the US city of Minneapolis, which has seen consecutive nights of protests following the death of a black man in police custody. The president said he would "send in the National Guard", and followed that up with a warning that "when the looting starts, the shooting starts." That second tweet was hidden by Twitter for "glorifying violence". Twitter's policy of adding a warning to, rather than deleting, tweets that break its rules when it comes to major public figures was announced in mid-2019. But the social network has never used it on Mr Trump - nor deleted any of his tweets before. "This is the bravest and riskiest thing I've ever seen Twitter - or any social media giant - do," said Carl Miller, from the Centre for the Analysis of Social Media at UK-based think-tank Demos. "This pours rocket fuel over the online-harm-versus-free-speech debate. Online content policy doesn't get more incendiary than this." The same post remains unaltered on Facebook, without any warning attached. On Friday, the president sought to clear up the tweets by saying he was misunderstood.  "Looting leads to shooting, and that's why a man was shot and killed in Minneapolis on Wednesday night - or look at what just happened in Louisville with 7 people shot," he tweeted. Seven people were shot in Louisville, Kentucky, at a protest over the death of Breonna Taylor, who was shot by three white police officers in March. "I don't want this to happen, and that's what the expression put out last night means," he wrote. For years Twitter resisted calls to treat Donald Trump like any other user and make him follow its rules.  Then, on Wednesday, it made a first small move, not removing a tweet but adding a fact-checking link.  The company then had two choices - hunker down and weather the storm or continue to take action in accordance with its stated rules. It has now chosen the latter course of action, calling the president out for glorifying violence.  Any other user would have had their tweet removed, and might have seen their account suspended.  It now looks as though there is no easy way out for either of the two adversaries - a huge battle over the limits of free speech and the rights of social media firms to moderate content is looming. It is difficult to see either side now backing down. The White House is busy scouring Twitter to find examples of other world leaders who have glorified violence without any comeback. Meanwhile others are finding all sorts of old Trump tweets that appear to have broken the rules by, for instance, spreading misinformation about treatments for coronavirus. Twitter boss Jack Dorsey, who had appeared very reluctant to apply anything but the most light-touch regulation, now finds himself faced with the unappealing prospect of cracking down on world leaders far and wide. The move means that other users will not be able to like, reply to, or simply retweet Mr Trump's post, Twitter said. However, they would still be able to retweet it with a comment attached. In a Twitter thread, the social network said: "This tweet violates our policies regarding the glorification of violence based on the historical context of the last line, its connection to violence, and the risk it could inspire similar actions today." The "historical context" is a reference to the phrase "when the looting starts, the shooting starts", coined by Miami Police Chief Walter Headley in 1967, in reference to his aggressive policing policies in black neighbourhoods. A later report submitted to the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence found that his "get tough" policy, involving "the frequent display of shotguns and dogs by Miami police in black neighbourhoods" contributed to a state of agitation in the black community until the eruption of the 1968 Miami riot some eight months later. Twitter said: "We've taken action in the interest of preventing others from being inspired to commit violent acts, but have kept the tweet on Twitter because it is important that the public still be able to see the tweet given its relevance to ongoing matters of public importance." Hours after the warning was added, President Trump tweeted: "Twitter is doing nothing about all of the lies & propaganda being put out by China or the Radical Left Democrat Party" and alleged that the social network was targeting Republicans. Twitter is doing nothing about all of the lies & propaganda being put out by China or the Radical Left Democrat Party. They have targeted Republicans, Conservatives & the President of the United States. Section 230 should be revoked by Congress. Until then, it will be regulated! End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrump He directly referenced the executive order he signed the previous evening, aimed at removing some of the legal protections given to social media platforms. Earlier this week, Twitter used its fact-checking function to attach warnings to the president's tweets for the first time. That led the president to threaten to "shut down" social networks over allegedly stifling free speech. The executive order signed by Mr Trump has no immediate effect on the social networks, however - instead, it begins a lengthy process that may result in changes down the line.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Tensions between Minneapolis' black community and the police did not start with the death of George Floyd. They have been years in the making. On a hot Thursday morning in the Longfellow neighbourhood of Minneapolis, a 28-year-old father named Nuwman stood outside the Minneapolis Police Department's Third Precinct drinking a large coffee as smoke wafted past from the smouldering ruins of nearby buildings.  It was day three of protests over the death of 46-year-old George Floyd, after a white police officer named Derek Chauvin kneeled on his neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds. Floyd begged for his life before falling unconscious and dying in the street, in full view of witnesses and a rolling mobile phone camera. Four officers, including Chauvin, were fired from the department for their involvement. The previous night, tensions ignited, and for the first time the city saw looting, arson and violence. At least one man died in a shooting at a pawn shop. "This is everyday. Everyday that these police officers have enforced their protocol has led up to this," said Nuwman, his voice rising with emotion over the din of protesters and sirens. "This is not just a singular moment. This is a cataclysm. A combination of all the things that happened before." That night, protesters stormed the precinct as police cruisers flew out of the rear parking lot, abandoning it to demonstrators who quickly moved from room to room lighting blazes.  The following afternoon, a Friday, saw the arrest of Chauvin by Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. Chauvin has been charged with murder. This is not the first instance of a controversial, police-involved killing in the region. In 2016, Philando Castile was shot and killed by a police officer in a neighbourhood just 15 minutes away from the current epicentre of protest.  In 2017, a Minneapolis officer was charged with the shooting death of Justine Damond after she called to report a possible sexual assault. In 2015, protests erupted over the shooting death of Jamar Clark, a 24-year-old man who was being pursued by Minneapolis officers. All three deaths sparked protest movements and yielded mixed results in terms of prosecution. Yanez was tried and acquitted. Mohamed Noor, Damond's shooter, was sentenced to 12.5 years. No charges were brought in Clark's case.  For some, Floyd's death was the continuation of those stories. "WE SHOULD HAVE BURNT THE CITY DOWN FOR PHILANDO CASTILE," one person posted on social media.  But in some ways, the pictures beamed around the world this week tell a story that's unique.  Demonstrations are occurring in the midst of a historic, global pandemic. The sheer amount of property damage and arson has been staggering. The swiftness with which officers were fired, and the speed in which Chauvin was arrested and charged surprised many. But Minneapolis - while a prosperous city that celebrates liberal policies and politicians - has struggled for years with socioeconomic inequality and segregation. It's a phenomenon that's been dubbed the "Minnesota paradox".  The Twin Cities, as Minneapolis and St Paul are known, are still overwhelmingly white - about one-quarter of the population is non-white - and its neighbourhoods are still highly segregated. Most people of colour live on the cities' north sides.  They were shaped by racist red-lining policies dating to the early 20th Century, when black families were not allowed to buy homes in certain neighbourhoods. In the 1960s, the state built a major highway that cut through and destroyed a thriving black community known as Rondo in St Paul.  According to a 2018 study, the rate of black homeownership in the Twin Cities is among the lowest in the nation. Even before the pandemic caused massive layoffs, 10% of black residents were unemployed compared to 4% of whites. That disparity ranks as one of the nation's worst.  In 2016, the average white household in the Twin Cities made about $76,000 a year, while the average black household earned just $32,000. Thirty-two percent of black Twin Citians fell below the poverty line, while only 6.5% of whites did.  Racial disparities persist in the way the community is policed.  After Philando Castile was killed, data released about police traffic stops in the area showed that 44% of stops were black drivers, though the population was only 7% black.  According to the Minneapolis police department's own data, in 2018 55% of drivers stopped for "equipment violations" were black.  As Covid-19 ravages the area, these disparities are sure to worsen, as thousands lose their jobs, and their homes to evictions and foreclosures.  On Friday afternoon, residents of both St Paul and Minneapolis headed into the streets carrying brooms and pails, and slowly began to literally pick up the pieces of the town.  Following the announcement that former officer Chauvin had been jailed and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter, protesters at Minneapolis City Hall let up a cheer.  But it was quickly replaced by a new demand: "One down, three to go."

Court documents filed in New York on Thursday allege several sexual offences dating from 1984 to 2013. One of the four anonymous women was 17 at the time of an alleged attack. Weinstein's legal representative told BBC News: "Mr Weinstein intends to defend against the claims filed anonymously against him yesterday." The lawyer, Imran H Ansari of Aidala, Bertuna & Kamins PC, added: "Some of these claims, including those alleged to have occurred in the 1980s and 1990s, may be barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and not subject to any exceptions under the law, as these plaintiffs do not appear to be complainants in Mr Weinstein's criminal case."  The latest legal cases allege multiple sexual offences against four women, who currently reside in Tennessee, New York, Ecuador and Hungary. Some of the attacks allegedly took place after meetings with Weinstein at the Cannes and Venice Film Festivals. The new allegations include: Allegations against Weinstein began to emerge in October 2017, when The New York Times first reported incidents dating back decades. At least 80 women have since accused him of sexual misconduct, including actresses Gwyneth Paltrow, Uma Thurman and Salma Hayek. The allegations were at the centre of the #MeToo movement that inspired women to go public with misconduct allegations against powerful men. Weinstein issued an apology acknowledging he had "caused a lot of pain", but denied any allegations of non-consensual sex. In February, Weinstein was convicted in New York City of third-degree rape and first-degree criminal sexual act, and later sentenced to 23 years in jail.

Then this week, everything changed. On Tech Tent, we examine the conflict between the president and his favourite social media platform. It began on Wednesday. Twitter had been under fire for allowing tweets in which the president shared a far-fetched conspiracy theory about an alleged crime involving a TV presenter and former Republican congressman.  But instead of taking action on those tweets, it fact-checked two others - about postal voting under a new policy which seeks to deter content which might suppress voting. Social media expert Chris Stokel-Walker tells Tech Tent that if Twitter thought limiting action to the area of elections was a cautious first step, it was wrong. "As soon as you start engaging in any sort of moderation or comment on politics, you run the risk of potentially alienating 50% of your audience - and given our very politically fractious times, that is more of a risk than ever," he said. Having taken that first step, and seeing President Trump immediately go nuclear and threatening to go so far as to shut the social media platform down, Twitter might have been tempted to go quiet for a bit. Instead, it chose escalation.  In the early hours of Friday morning, in a tweet about the protests in Minneapolis over the death of a black man, Mr Trump warned: "when the looting starts, the shooting starts".  Twitter's moderation team swung into action - after consulting CEO Jack Dorsey - and obscured the tweet with a message saying that rules on glorifying violence had been broken. Users could still see the tweet by clicking through that message, but sharing it was made harder.  A few hours later, as the president woke up, the official White House account simply repeated the offending tweet. We watched with bated breath to see what would happen and, sure enough, Twitter's moderators slapped the same warning on the tweet. It is difficult to see either side backing down now.  The White House is busy scouring Twitter to find examples of other world leaders who have glorified violence without any comeback. Others are finding all sorts of old Trump tweets that appear to have broken the rules by, for instance, spreading misinformation about treatments for coronavirus. Jack Dorsey, who had appeared very reluctant to apply anything but the most light-touch regulation, now finds himself faced with the unappealing prospect of cracking down on world leaders far and wide. Meanwhile, there is not exactly much solidarity being shown by Facebook. In general, it has been a more tightly-moderated platform than Twitter, but Mark Zuckerberg has made it clear he has no intention of following Jack Dorsey's lead when it comes to fact checking politicians. Donald Trump's Facebook page has simply replicated the posts which fell foul of Twitter - with no sign of fact-checking or finger-wagging. "This is the kind of thing that Donald Trump revels in," says Chris Stokel-Walker, "an ex-reality TV star who likes to stir the pot. He's now managed to set Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey against each other." For all the rage about freedom of speech from the president - and remember Twitter as a private company can do what it likes in that area - he seems unlikely to kill what has become his main platform for getting his message out.  Like the fighting couple in some dodgy romcom, Trump and Twitter need each other - though one suspects Jack Dorsey might be tempted to throw the President out and change the locks.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window A police station in Minneapolis has been set alight during a third night of protests over the death of an unarmed black man in custody on Monday.  A police officer was filmed kneeling on the neck of George Floyd, 46, despite him saying he could not breathe.   President Donald Trump said "thugs" were dishonouring his memory and called on the National Guard to restore order.  The incident has added to anger over police killings of black Americans, including Breonna Taylor in Kentucky. Mr Floyd's family have demanded that the four police officers implicated in his death face murder charges. Prosecutors have said they are still gathering evidence. A CNN journalist, Omar Jimenez, and his camera crew were arrested live on air by Minnesota state police officers on Friday morning, apparently because they did not move on when instructed.  The team was released an hour later, after the governor apologised for the arrest. There have also been demonstrations in other US cities, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Denver, Phoenix and Memphis. Twitter accused Mr Trump of glorifying violence in a post that said: "When the looting starts, the shooting starts." On Thursday, protesters gathered outside the police department's 3rd Precinct, the epicentre of the unrest.  Officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets in an attempt to disperse the crowd. But the cordon around the police station, which is near where Mr Floyd died, was breached by protesters, who set fire to it and two other nearby buildings as the officers withdrew. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said there had been no choice but to evacuate the police station, adding: "The symbolism of a building cannot outweigh the importance of life, of our officers or the public." He called the unrest "unacceptable", but recognised there was "a lot of pain and anger". He spoke after a tweet from Mr Trump blamed Thursday's violence on a "lack of leadership" in Minneapolis and warned that he would send in the National Guard and "get the job done right" if Mr Frey failed to restore order. National Guard personnel are normally under state control, although they can be put under federal control in emergencies. Mr Trump also tweeted: "Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts." On Friday, the White House Twitter account quoted the president's tweet on looting and shooting. Twitter placed a "public interest notice" on the messages, saying they "violate our policies regarding the glorification of violence based on the historical context of the last line, its connection to violence, and the risk it could inspire similar actions". The historical context arises from riots in Miami in 1968. A federal task force found that the use of the phrase about looting by the Miami police chief at the time was a prime factor in the discontent that triggered the unrest.  Analysis by Jessica Lussenhop, BBC senior staff writer, Minneapolis The "twin cities" of Minneapolis and St Paul, Minnesota heaved with unrest and destruction overnight. Several areas that have no geographical significance to Floyd's death are now seeing damage, and shops all over the region closed and barricaded their doors. Protesters in the streets want one thing: the arrest and prosecution of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, whose knee was pressed into Floyd's neck for several minutes before he died.  But at a press conference on Thursday, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman was noncommittal, promising only a "robust and meticulous" investigation. Both the FBI and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension are investigating.  It's unclear whether charges would actually bring the violence to a halt.  Developments here are swift and chaotic. Friday morning broke with news that several fires had been set before dawn in Minneapolis and that state police arrested a CNN news crew on live television.  The air in this relatively quiet Midwestern metropolis is filled with sirens and smoke, and it seems there is no end in sight.  Earlier on Thursday, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz had activated the state's National Guard troops at the request of the mayors of Minneapolis and the neighbouring city of St Paul, declaring the situation a "peacetime emergency". Calling for peaceful protests, "not more death and destruction", Mr Walz said the looting, vandalism and arson of Wednesday night had damaged many businesses, including ones owned by minorities. The four policemen involved have been fired, and the mayor has called for criminal charges against the officer seen pinning Mr Floyd. Speaking through tears, Mr Floyd's brother, Philonise, told CNN on Thursday the officers who "executed my brother in broad daylight" must be arrested and that he was "tired of seeing black men die". Mr Trump "was very upset" when he saw the footage of Mr Floyd's death, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters on Thursday.  A number of celebrities, including John Boyega and Beyonce, have also expressed outrage over the incident. The incident echoes the case of Eric Garner, who was placed in a police chokehold in New York in 2014. His death became a rallying cry against police brutality and a catalyst in the Black Lives Matter movement. There were also chaotic scenes during rallies in Denver, Colorado and in Columbus, Ohio. The statehouse in Denver was put under lockdown after gunfire was heard, while in Columbus demonstrators reportedly broke some of the statehouse's windows before being dispersed by police. Seven people were also shot in Louisville, Kentucky, at a protest over the death of Breonna Taylor, who was shot by three white police officers in March. Officers responding to reports of the use of counterfeit money approached Mr Floyd in his vehicle on Monday. According to police, he was told to step away from the car, physically resisted officers and was handcuffed. Video of the incident does not show how the confrontation started, but a white officer can be seen with his knee on Mr Floyd's neck, pinning him down.  Mr Floyd can be heard saying "please, I can't breathe" and "don't kill me". The city has identified the four officers involved as Derek Chauvin, Tou Thao, Thomas Lane and J Alexander Kueng. The Minneapolis Police Officers' Federation said the officers were co-operating with the investigation. The Minnesota police handbook states that officers trained on how to compress the neck without applying direct pressure to the airway can use a knee under its use-of-force policy. This is regarded as a non-deadly-force option. Are you in the area? If you have any information you are willing to share with the BBC you can get in touch by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.

Tear gas was fired by police, while protesters threw rocks and sprayed graffiti. Businesses were also looted. George Floyd, 46, died on Monday and video showed him gasping for breath as a white policeman knelt on his neck. There have also been protests in Chicago, Illinois, Los Angeles, California, and Memphis, Tennessee. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz activated the state's national guard troops on Thursday, declaring the situation a "peacetime emergency". He said the looting, vandalism and arson of a night earlier had resulted in damage to many businesses, including ones owned by minorities. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called on Wednesday for criminal charges against the policeman who was filmed pinning down Mr Floyd. Four police officers involved in the arrest have already been fired. The incident echoes the case of Eric Garner, who was placed in a police chokehold in New York in 2014. His death became a rallying cry against police brutality and a catalyst in the Black Lives Matter movement. They began in the afternoon on Tuesday, when hundreds of people came to the intersection where the incident had taken place. Organisers tried to keep the protest peaceful and maintain coronavirus social distancing, with demonstrators chanting "I can't breathe" and "it could've been me". During the second night of demonstrations on Wednesday, the crowd grew into the thousands, with protesters pelting rocks and some throwing tear-gas canisters back at police. There was a standoff outside the police station where officers formed a human barricade to prevent protesters gaining entry. Analysis by Jessica Lussenhop, BBC senior staff writer, Minneapolis The morning after a violent and destructive night across this city, the air was thick with acrid smoke as buildings continued to smoulder.  Fresh graffiti covers nearly every wall, sign and surface. Bus stop shelters are skeletal with their glass walls completely shattered.  This thriving commercial corner of the city has taken on the look of a war zone.  Much of the worst damage was concentrated around the Minneapolis Police Department's 3rd Precinct, where the officers involved in the killing of George Floyd are believed to have worked. At least 100 demonstrators gathered once again this morning, shouting at a line of silent, helmeted police officers blocking the entrance to the precinct's parking lot. Armed officers watched from the roof. The car park of a looted Target was strewn with debris from inside the store, and people were still freely going in and out of smashed windows and doors, though it appeared to be more out of curiosity than anything. Everyone seemed agog at the extent of the damage.  And it was indiscriminate.  Banks, cheque cashing shops and liquor stores were hit, but the windows of a public library branch were also smashed in, the bookshelves and reading desks scattered with glittering fragments. The classrooms of a charter school in the same strip mall complex as the Target were under several inches of water, as a security alarm droned on from somewhere.  Anger in the streets was palpable. Periodically there were shouts and wails. It seems a foregone conclusion that demonstrations will continue for days if not weeks, and further violence could follow. As one protester told me: "It's sad. But this is how they're going to listen." Mr Floyd's brother, Philonise Floyd, told CNN on Thursday he hoped the officers involved got the death penalty. "I'm never gonna get my brother back," he said. "We need justice." Speaking through tears, he said the officers who "executed my brother in broad daylight" must be arrested and that he was "tired of seeing black men die". He added that he understood why protesters were lashing out. "I can't stop people right now because they have pain - they have the same pain that I feel." Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo apologised for the "pain, devastation and trauma" caused by Mr Floyd's death and said his department had contributed to "a deficit of hope" in the city. United Nations human rights chief Michelle Bachelet has also condemned Mr Floyd's death, saying the role of "entrenched and pervasive racial discrimination" must be recognised and dealt with.  She called for protesters to act peacefully, and for police to "take utmost care not to inflame the current situation even more". President Donald Trump "was very upset" when he saw the footage of Mr Floyd's death, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters on Thursday. "He wants justice to be served." A number of celebrities and athletes, including John Boyega, LeBron James, Beyonce, and Justin Bieber, have also expressed outrage over the incident. Officers responding to reports of the use of counterfeit money approached Mr Floyd in his vehicle on Monday. According to police, he was told to step away from the car, physically resisted officers and was handcuffed. The police statement noted his apparent "medical distress". Video of the incident does not show how the confrontation started. A white officer can be seen using his knee to pin Mr Floyd to the ground by the neck as Mr Floyd groans "please, I can't breathe" and "don't kill me". The city has identified the four officers involved as Derek Chauvin, Tou Thao, Thomas Lane and J Alexander Kueng. Local media have named Mr Chauvin as the officer seen with his knee on Mr Floyd's neck. The Minneapolis Police Officers Federation said the officers were co-operating with the investigation. In a statement to local media, the union said "now is not the time to rush to judgment". "We must review all video. We must wait for the medical examiner's report."Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window The US city of Minneapolis has endured a third night of clashes between police and protesters.

All pictures copyrightedShare this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at removing some of the legal protections given to social media platforms. He said the firms had "unchecked power" to censure and edit the views of users. President Trump has regularly accused platforms such as Twitter and Facebook of stifling conservative voices. The order, which is expected to face legal challenges, comes after Twitter decided to append fact-check labels to two of his tweets this week. On Wednesday Mr Trump accused the company of election interference after it added a warning label to the tweets about claims of widespread fraud in mail-in voting - also known as postal votes. Twitter and other social media platforms strongly condemned the executive order. And early on Friday, Twitter hid one of President Trump's tweets from his profile, saying it violates rules about glorifying violence. Under a 1996 law, website operators, unlike traditional publishers, cannot generally be held responsible for content posted by users. The sites are also protected from lawsuits if they block posts deemed obscene, violent "or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected". The executive order argues that this immunity should no longer apply if a social network edits posts, such as by adding a warning or a label.  It also says "deceptive" blocking, including removing a post for reasons other than those described in a website's terms of service, should not be protected. Republican Senator Marco Rubio is among those arguing that the platforms take on the role of a "publisher" when they add fact-check labels to posts. "The law still protects social media companies like Twitter because they are considered forums not publishers," Mr Rubio said. "But if they have now decided to exercise an editorial role like a publisher, then they should no longer be shielded from liability."  The executive order also calls for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to spell out what type of content blocking will be considered deceptive or inconsistent with a service provider's terms and conditions. Donald Trump promised "big action" in response to Twitter's decision to append a fact-check message to two of his posts. While his announcement of an executive order was heavy on rhetoric - accusing social media companies of being monopolies that threaten free speech - it will be a long process before the talk turns into real action, big or otherwise. Independent government agencies will have to review federal law, promulgate new regulations, vote on them and then - in all likelihood - defend them in court. By the time it's all over, the November presidential election could have come and gone. That explains why Trump is also pushing for new congressional legislation - a more straightforward way of changing US policy toward social media companies.  The real purpose of the president's order, however, may be symbolic. At the very least, the move will cause Twitter to think twice about attempting to moderate or fact-check his posts on their service.  The president relies on Twitter to get his message out without filtering from the mainstream media. If Twitter itself start blunting one of his favourite communication tools, he is sending a message that he will push back - and make things, at a minimum, uncomfortable for the company. Twitter called the order "a reactionary and politicized approach to a landmark law," adding that Section 230 "protects American innovation and freedom of expression, and it's underpinned by democratic values". Google, which owns YouTube, said changing Section 230 would "hurt America's economy and its global leadership on internet freedom." "Our platforms have empowered a wide range of people and organizations from across the political spectrum, giving them a voice and new ways to reach their audiences," the firm said in a statement to the BBC. In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said censoring a social media platform would not be the "right reflex" for a government concerned about censorship.  "I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online," said Mr Zuckerberg.  The long-running dispute between Mr Trump and social media companies flared up again on Tuesday, when two of his posts were given a fact-check label by Twitter for the first time. He had tweeted, without providing evidence: "There is no way (zero) that mail-in ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent." Twitter added a warning label to the post and linked to a page describing the claims as "unsubstantiated". Then on Wednesday, Mr Trump threatened to "strongly regulate" social-media platforms. He tweeted to his more than 80 million followers that Republicans felt the platforms "totally silence conservatives", and that he would not allow this to happen.  In an earlier tweet, he said Twitter was "completely stifling free speech". Twitter's chief executive, Jack Dorsey, responded to criticism of the platform's fact-checking policies in a series of posts, saying: "We'll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally." Twitter has tightened its policies in recent years, as it faced criticism that its hands-off approach allowed fake accounts and misinformation to thrive.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Strip the format of RuPaul's Drag Race back to its most basic and you might think it's a TV show about people competing to see who's the best at dancing around while pretending to sing a song. But the 12th season has urged its US viewers to register to vote every week and made no secret of its political agenda. This weekend, finalists Gigi Goode, Jaida Essence Hall and Crystal Methyd will compete (on a Zoom call) to be crowned the next drag superstar of the world. Season 12 has been a bumpy ride for viewers though and negative press about the behaviour of contestants - as well as host RuPaul - threaten to overshadow its message. In one episode, contestants Jackie Cox and Widow Von Du performed a lip-sync to Katy Perry's Firework - Jackie in a hijab based on the American flag, Widow in a gown inspired by the Black Panther Party. When Democratic politician Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez appeared on the show as a guest judge, Jackie spoke about her Iranian mum's experiences in the US as an immigrant. "People would tell her to go back to where she came from," explained a tearful Jackie. "When I was young, I hid this part of my heritage for so long. She's an American citizen now. Seeing you standing up for people like my mum gives me so much hope."  I'm here and I deserve to be in America just as much as anyone else. 💙🇺🇸❤️ @rupaulsdragrace #DragRace UPDATE:  I am truly overwhelmed by the amount of love I’ve been shown the last 24 hours regarding my runway interpretation of the “Stars and Stripes” Runway.  I’ve also seen a lot of debate about this look and whether I should or should not have worn this, or said what I said on the runway. To clarify my intentions, this look was meant to honor my Muslim family and friends and also stand up against the Islamophobia they have faced.  As for my personal relationship with Islam: I am agnostic, and my immediate family has their own, somewhat secular, interpretation of the Islamic faith. Growing up, my mother spoke to me a lot about her thoughts on Islam and her belief that it was something I shouldn’t be afraid of. It was her opinion that both the western media interpretation, and the hardline mullahs who took over Iran were the ones who were misinterpreting the faith.  She instead, chose to focus her beliefs on love and charity and made a pilgrimage to Mecca in her youth. She, and her sisters, wear headscarves while in public in Iran as that is the law. In their personal lives, as seen depicted in the photographs of my aunt and mom in the US on the show, they do not wear headscarves.  However; I support their freedom and choice to wear or NOT wear a headscarf, a right that I am grateful is granted here in the United States... but brings Islamophobia. I think it’s important to clarify the importance of freedom of religion versus the religious law imposed in Iran and many other countries.  But freedom of religion only works when people can live without fear of losing their job, hearing racial slurs, or worse. I am proud that this runway is opening up conversations around that issue. Though I have sometimes lost faith in the US, this moment has given me hope. ❤️ ❤️ Swipe through to see the sketches from my amazing designer and friend, @travis_oestreich . And also my original inspiration for this look, which was the “We The People” series by @obeygiant ❤️💙 My photo is once again by the incredible @prestonburford ! A post shared by  Jackie Cox (@jackiecoxnyc) on Apr 25, 2020 at 10:02am PDT End of Instagram post  by jackiecoxnyc One episode included a challenge where contestants took part in a fake rally to become the first-ever drag President of the United States - a format that hasn't been seen on Drag Race since 2012. And every episode has ended with contestants dancing on stage carrying signs reading "register to vote". There's political bias on Drag Race, no doubt. It's a left-wing show with a strong anti-Trump message, one that's been ramped up ahead of the US election in November 2020. Since coming to power in 2016, President Donald Trump has introduced, or tried to introduce, a number of measures which have stripped rights from LGBT people in America. "Drag Race is a show that appeals to queer people, to women, to the groups that need to get out and vote," says Kevin O'Keefe, a US journalist who covers Drag Race for LGBT publication Xtra Magazine and considers himself a Drag Race "herstorian". "It's mentioning politics more and more." In the 2016 US election, only 50% of the population turned out to vote. "Young people don't vote. That's a generalisation but the exit polls bear it out. A simple weekly reminder is useful," Kevin adds. "Seeing those placards at the end of every episode, people may think it's showmanship, but that kind of repeated messaging actually does work." Season 12 isn't the first season where politics has played an obvious part. Democrat Nancy Pelosi (the Speaker of the House of Representatives) made a brief appearance in the 2018 series of All Stars.  Contestants in 2016 had to produce smear campaigns against each other in season eight and in 2011 there were messages of support for US troops in season three. But some Drag Race experts say the very nature of the show is political, even when it's not directly referencing what's going on in Washington. "Drag Race has always shown that people come for the drag, but you stay because you fall in love with these queer people," says Mikelle Street, digital director of Out magazine.  "They always talk about issues that this community is dealing with." In previous series', contestant Dusty Ray Bottoms spoke about their experience of conversion therapy, Nina West revealed they were threatened with murder by a far-right hate group while at college, Latrice Royale talked about spending time in prison. "I don't know if season 12 is a return to politics, because I'm not sure the show ever left that," Mikelle adds. Kevin says that just because politics has been mentioned more doesn't make it the most political season. "There's part of me that just wants to say that season one was the most political because it presented drag in this very rough around the edges way, something the show has shied away from since," he says. "To me, letting drag queens be their messiest selves and presenting Cameroonian drag in BeBe Zahara Benet and pageant drag in Shannel - that to me will always seem more political than holding up a 'register to vote' sign." Despite grand political ambitions for the 12th season of Drag Race, it's also been the most troubled. A contestant was disqualified before the series started when sexual misconduct allegations were made against them, leading to a hasty re-edit of every episode to remove them from the show. Comments made by Jeff Goldblum about Islam's stance on homosexuality were widely criticised and even RuPaul faced their own controversy when it was revealed they lease part of their 60,000 acre Wyoming ranch to oil companies for fracking. "The reality is that people like Ru were progressive when they were coming up," says Mikelle.  "But what happens with some of them - like Ru, like Ellen - is that they were progressive for their time when they were first coming in, and the movement continued to progress and they didn't necessarily move with it." But even if this is at odds with the left-wing stance the show has, the negative press didn't seem do any damage to viewing figures. Drag Race was the most-watched show for 18 to 34-year-olds in the US on Friday nights. The show has also been affected by coronavirus, with its finale and reunion shows being filmed online due to social distancing measures. Season 12's big political storyline ended just before the final when Jackie was eliminated in the last of the episodes filmed in 2019. Kevin believes her time on the show will resonate with many LGBT viewers on a personal level. "All of the stuff about her mum's experience as an immigrant, about her challenges with her former faith being Muslim, that all is a genuine weight on Jackie," he says.  "I think a small push opens the floodgates, a lot of queer people wear that stuff on their sleeve and it doesn't take much for that to come out." Going into the final, both Kevin and Mikelle are backing the same contestant to win: Jaida Essence Hall. "Jaida represents something we haven't seen since Tyra Sanchez won season two," says Kevin.  "She is a polished, gorgeous pageant girl. We've seen Asia O'Hara falter, we've seen Akeria Chanel Davenport falter - and I would be really bummed if it happened to Jaida." But with the political agenda of season 12, RuPaul and the producers of Drag Race seem to want viewers to think about more than just who should become the world's next drag superstar when they watch the show. "We're thinking about this administration, we're thinking about the election that's coming up," says Mikelle.  "Those are the things that we're all thinking about and the ways in which the policies or lack of policies from the administration are affecting our daily lives."

They say the international community has a "significant and long-standing stake" in its prosperity and stability. China's move to impose the new law during a global pandemic risked undermining trust in governments and international co-operation, they said. China has rejected foreign criticism. The law - approved by China's parliament on Thursday - has already sparked a new wave of anti-mainland protest in Hong Kong. On Wednesday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said developments in Hong Kong meant it could no longer be considered to have "a high degree of autonomy" from mainland China. This could lead to Hong Kong being treated the same as mainland China under US law, which would have major implications for its trade hub status. The UK on Thursday said visa rights for 300,000 British National (Overseas) passport holders in Hong Kong would be extended into a "pathway to future [UK] citizenship" if China did not suspend its security law plans. Direct imposition of the security law by Beijing rather than through Hong Kong's own institutions would "curtail the Hong Kong people's liberties" and "dramatically erode Hong Kong's autonomy and the system that made it so prosperous", the statement says. It would also conflict with China's international obligations within the Sino-British declaration, under which Hong Kong was returned to China, and would both undermine the "one country, two systems" principle and "raise the prospect of prosecution in Hong Kong for political crimes". The allies also say they are "deeply concerned" that the new law will deepen divisions in Hong Kong, which has seen repeated waves of protests and clashes over the territory's relationship with the mainland. "Rebuilding trust across Hong Kong society by allowing the people of Hong Kong to enjoy the rights and freedoms they were promised can be the only way back from the tensions and unrest that the territory has seen over the last year," the statement says. The US and its allies urge China to work with Hong Kong's government and people to find a "mutually acceptable accommodation". In other reaction, Japan said Hong Kong was an "extremely important partner" and that democracy and stability there must be maintained. China's parliament has backed the security legislation, which would make it a crime to undermine Beijing's authority in Hong Kong. The resolution - which now passes to China's senior leadership - could also see China installing its own security agencies in the region for the first time. Full details about exactly what behaviour will be outlawed under the new security law are not yet clear. It is due to be enacted before September. However it is expected to criminalise:  Experts say they fear the law could see people punished for criticising Beijing - as happens in mainland China. For example, Nobel Laureate Liu Xiaobo was jailed for 11 years for subversion after he co-authored a document calling for political reform. China's foreign ministry in Hong Kong said it "firmly opposed and refuted" Mr Pompeo's assertion that Hong Kong had lost its autonomy and urged the US to "immediately stop meddling" in China's internal affairs. It described US criticism of the new draft law as "utterly imperious, unreasonable and shameless". Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam has denied that the law would curtail the rights of Hong Kongers and said it was a "responsible" move to protect the law-abiding majority. Clashes broke out on Wednesday as Hong Kong's parliament debated a different proposed law, which would make it a crime to disrespect the Chinese national anthem. Hundreds of people were arrested in protests over that and the security law. Security remained high on Thursday, as a tense debate in the Legislative Council continued.  At least two pro-democracy legislators were ejected from the council on Thursday. One lawmaker, Ted Hui, threw rotten plants on to the floor of the chamber, saying it symbolised the decay of Hong Kong's political system.  "I want the speaker to feel what is meant by rotten," he said. The speaker deemed the package to be an "unknown dangerous object", and called police and fire crews. Hong Kong was handed back to China from British control in 1997, but under a unique agreement - a mini-constitution called the Basic Law and a so-called "one country, two systems" principle. They are supposed to protect certain freedoms for Hong Kong: freedom of assembly and speech, an independent judiciary and some democratic rights - freedoms that no other part of mainland China has. Under the same agreement, Hong Kong had to enact its own national security law - this was set out in Article 23 of the Basic Law. But its unpopularity meant it has never been done - the government tried in 2003 but had to back down after protests. Then, last year, protests over an extradition law turned violent and evolved into a broader anti-China and pro-democracy movement. China is keen to avoid a repeat of that unrest.

It means platforms such as Facebook and Twitter could be sued if they are judged to "deceptively" block posts. The draft of the executive order says social networks are engaged in "selective censorship". Mr Trump has regularly accused social-media platforms of stifling or censoring conservative voices. On Wednesday, Mr Trump accused Twitter of election interference, after it added fact-check links to two of his tweets. "Big action to follow," he tweeted. The order sets out to clarify the Communications Decency Act, a US law that offers online platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube legal protection in certain situations. Under Section 230 of the law, social networks are not generally held responsible for content posted by their users but can engage in "good-Samaritan blocking", such as removing content that is obscene, harassing or violent. And the draft of the executive order points out this legal immunity does not apply if a social network edits content posted by its users. It also says "deceptive" blocking of posts, including removing a post for reasons other than those described in a website's terms of service, should not be offered immunity. Republican senator Marco Rubio is among those arguing the platforms take on the role of a  "publisher" when they add fact-check labels to specific posts. "The law still protects social media companies like Twitter because they are considered forums not publishers," Mr Rubio said. "But if they have now decided to exercise an editorial role like a publisher, then they should no longer be shielded from liability and treated as publishers under the law."  The draft of the executive order also calls for: Twitter, which is repeatedly named in the draft of the executive order, declined to comment. YouTube, owned by Google, has not yet responded. In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said censoring a social media platform would not be the "right reflex" for a government concerned about censorship.  Fox said it would play its full interview with Mr Zuckerberg on Thursday. One think tank warned the executive order could have unintended consequences. "In the long run, this conservative campaign against social media companies could have a devastating effect on the freedom of speech," Matthew Feeney, of the Cato Institute, said.  And changing the Communications Decency Act to "impose political neutrality on social media companies" could see the platforms filled with "legal content they'd otherwise like to remove" such as pornography, violent imagery and racism. "Or they would screen content to a degree that would kill the free flow of information on social media that we're used to today," he said. Mr Feeney said the draft of the executive order was a "mess" but could prove politically popular in the run-up to a presidential election. The long-running dispute between Mr Trump and social-media companies flared up again on Tuesday, when two of his posts were given a fact-check label by Twitter for the first time. He had tweeted, without providing evidence: "There is no way (zero) that mail-in ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent." Twitter added a warning label to the post and linked to a page describing the claims as "unsubstantiated". Then, on Wednesday, Mr Trump threatened to "strongly regulate" social-media platforms. He tweeted to his more than 80 million followers Republicans felt the platforms "totally silence conservatives". And he would not allow this to happen.  In an earlier tweet, he said Twitter was "completely stifling free speech". Twitter's chief executive, Jack Dorsey, responded to criticism of the platform's fact-checking policies in a series of posts, saying: "We'll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally." Mr Trump wrote a similar post about mail-in ballots on Facebook, on Tuesday, and no such warnings were applied. Twitter has tightened its policies in recent years, as it faced criticism its hands-off approach allowed fake accounts and misinformation to thrive. Analysis by Christopher Giles, BBC Reality Check Twitter says it enforces its rules "impartially for all users, regardless of their background or political affiliation". But there is no publicly available list of which accounts have had fact-check labels or been suspended. Twitter told BBC News it had previously added fact-check labels to two tweets by Chinese government spokesman Zhao Lijian, who had speculated back in March coronavirus may have originated in the US.   The company said the tweets had contained "potentially misleading content about Covid-19 and have been labelled to provide additional context to the public". But these labels were added retrospectively, after Twitter had been scrutinised for placing them on President Trump's posts. Twitter says common reasons for suspending accounts are abusive tweets and spam - not the censoring of political opinions. But critics say Twitter's decision-making process is opaque. And these criticisms don't just come from conservatives.  Human rights groups have previously claimed Twitter has censured dissident voices and activists. In 2018, Mr Dorsey said its staff were "more left-leaning". But he added: "We do not look at content with regards to political viewpoint or ideology."Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window A white woman who called the police after a black man asked her to put her dog on a leash in New York City's Central Park has been fired from her job with an investment firm. Franklin Templeton announced on Twitter on Tuesday it had sacked an employee, "effective immediately". "We do not tolerate racism of any kind at Franklin Templeton," the tweet said. Christian Cooper, a bird watcher, asked the woman to leash her dog because he feared it could endanger wildlife. Mr Cooper and the woman, identified as Amy Cooper (no relation) were in a part of Central Park called the Ramble, a popular area for bird watchers where dogs must be leashed at all times, according to the rules. Mr Cooper said their exchange began when he noticed Ms Cooper's dog "tearing through the plantings" in the area. "Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times. The sign is right there," Mr Cooper said he told her, but she refused to restrain her dog.  When he began filming, Ms Cooper told him she would phone police and tell them "there's an African-American man threatening my life".  She then called the emergency operator and repeated, "He's African-American", before pleading for them to send an officer. A video filmed by Mr Cooper and posted on social media went viral on Monday, drawing tens of millions of views and prompting discussions about the high number of killings of black men by police in the US. Oh, when Karens take a walk with their dogs off leash in the famous Bramble in NY’s Central Park, where it is clearly posted on signs that dogs MUST be leashed at all times, and someone like my brother (an avid birder) politely asks her to put her dog on the leash. pic.twitter.com/3YnzuATsDm End of Twitter post  by @melodyMcooper Ms Cooper later apologised, saying she had "overreacted". "I sincerely and humbly apologise to everyone, especially to that man, his family," she told NBC News. Ms Cooper also faced accusations of animal cruelty, after she appeared to choke the animal with its leash while restraining it to call the police. After the video went viral she returned the dog to a shelter. "The dog is now in our rescue's care and he is safe and in good health," the organisation wrote on Facebook. Her now-deleted LinkedIn and Instagram profiles suggested she might be Canadian. Franklin Templeton initially suspended Ms Cooper while it investigated the incident, before announcing her sacking. Speaking to NBC News, Mr Cooper raised the recent high-profile shooting of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old black man who was out jogging when he was killed by two white men in February.  "We live in an age of Ahmaud Arbery, where black men are gunned down because of assumptions people make about black men, black people, and I'm just not going to participate in that," he said.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Twitter, under intense scrutiny for its use of fact-checking warnings, has added them to tweets from China's foreign ministry spokesperson. The warning has been added to tweets from spokesman Lijian Zhao, in which he warned: "It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan." Twitter added the warning more than two months after the tweets were posted. It comes amid a row with the White House, after similar warnings were added to tweets from President Trump. Mr Trump is now poised to sign an executive order targeting social-media firms, the White House said, in a significant escalation of the dispute.  Earlier this week, after Twitter added its fact-checking links to President Trump's tweets, he threatened to "shut down" social networks for alleged anti-conservative bias. The warnings on Lijian Zhao's tweets were added after the US developments. One tweet, from 12 March, criticised the US Centers for Disease Control for a lack of clarity before alleging that it "might be" that the US army was somehow involved in the Wuhan outbreak. In another tweet the following day, he linked to an article claiming to have evidence that the virus originated in the United States, encouraging people to read and retweet it - which thousands did. Both tweets now contains a bright blue exclamation mark urging readers to "Get the facts about Covid-19".  Clicking it directs the user to a page of tweets about the World Health Organization's research that suggests the virus originated in animals, and downplays theories about deliberate human involvement in its spread. The New York Post, which broke the story, said Twitter had added the warning only after its reporters put pressure on the company over alleged "double standards" between the Chinese official and Mr Trump. A Twitter spokesperson would not confirm whether that was the case, saying only that Mr Zhao's tweets "contain potentially misleading content about Covid-19" and were labelled to "provide additional context". Twitter founder Jack Dorsey meanwhile, appealed to users to "please leave our employees out of this" as the row with the White House erupted. Yoel Roth, Twitter's head of site integrity, has been blamed by many Conservatives as the man behind the effort to fact-check the president. Many prominent Republican voices on Twitter pointed to old tweets by Mr Roth which refer to "Nazis in the White House" and other insults about the president and his allies. Kellyanne Conway, a senior White House aide with the job title of counsellor to the president, appeared to encourage supporters to contact Mr Roth online, saying on Fox News that someone should "go wake him up and tell him he's about to get more followers".  Twitter, however, insists that no one person is responsible for its fact-checking decisions. "There is someone ultimately accountable for our actions as a company, and that's me," Mr Dorsey tweeted, promising to continue to "point out incorrect or disputed information". "Our intention is to connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute so people can judge for themselves. More transparency from us is critical so folks can clearly see the why behind our actions," he said. The approach differs from that of Facebook. Sir Nick Clegg, a prominent former UK politician turned Facebook's vice-president of communications, said the company doesn't believe "a private tech company like ours should be in the business of vetting what politicians say about each other", the Telegraph reports. "We think people should be allowed to hear what politicians say so they can make up their own mind and hold the politician to account," he said.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window There have been clashes between police and protesters in Minneapolis after the death on Monday of an unarmed black man in police custody in the US city.  Police fired tear gas and protesters threw rocks and sprayed graffiti on police cars. Video of the death shows George Floyd, 46, groaning "I can't breathe" as a white policeman kneels on his neck. Four police officers have been fired, with the mayor saying that being black "should not be a death sentence". Mayor Jacob Frey also called on prosecutors to file criminal charges against the policeman who was filmed holding Mr Floyd. The incident echoes the case of Eric Garner, who was placed in a police chokehold in New York in 2014. His death became a rallying call against police brutality and was a driving force in the Black Lives Matter movement. They began in the afternoon on Tuesday, when hundreds of people came to the intersection where the incident had taken place on Monday evening. Organisers tried to keep the protest peaceful and maintain coronavirus social distancing, with demonstrators chanting "I can't breathe," and "It could've been me". Protester Anita Murray told the Washington Post: "It's scary to come down here in the middle of the pandemic, but how could I stay away?" A crowd of hundreds later marched to the 3rd Precinct, where the officers involved in the death are thought to have worked. Squad cars were sprayed with graffiti and protesters threw stones at the police building. Police fired tear gas, flash grenades and foam projectiles. One protester told CBS: "It's real ugly. The police have to understand that this is the climate they have created." Another said: "I got on my knees and I put up a peace sign and they tear-gassed me." Police said one person had suffered non-life-threatening injuries after being shot away from the protest area but gave no further details. Officers responding to reports of the use of counterfeit money had approached Mr Floyd in his vehicle. According to police he was told to step away from the vehicle and physically resisted officers. A police statement said: "Officers were able to get the suspect into handcuffs and noted he appeared to be suffering medical distress." The video taken at the scene does not show how the confrontation started. It shows a white officer using his knee to pin Mr Floyd to the ground by the neck. Mr Floyd groans "please, I can't breathe" and "don't kill me" as bystanders urge officers to let him go.   He ceases to move and an ambulance arrives to take him to hospital where he later died. Mayor Frey said it was the "right call" to fire the officers. He said: "Being black in America should not be a death sentence. For five minutes we watched as a white police officer pressed his knee into the neck of a black man. For five minutes. When you hear someone calling for help, you are supposed to help." The FBI is investigating the incident and will present its findings to the Minnesota state's attorney for possible federal charges. Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar urged a thorough outside investigation, saying: "Justice must be served for this man and his family, justice must be served for our community, justice must be served for our country." There have been calls from some for the officers to be charged with murder. The Minnesota police handbook states that officers trained on how to compress the neck without applying direct pressure to the airway can use a knee under its use-of-force policy. This is regarded as a non-deadly-force option. By Jessica Lussenhop in Minneapolis The most surprising thing about the response to the in-custody death of George Floyd was the swiftness with which the four police officers involved were sacked. This is almost always the first demand made by protesters - a demand that is often never met.  While Minneapolis is a very liberal city, it is also very segregated and the region has seen several controversial police killings.  In 2017, Justine Damond was killed after she called to report a possible sexual assault in her alley. The officer was tried for murder and sentenced to 12.5 years in prison. During a 2016 traffic stop, Philando Castile was shot and killed by a police officer who was tried and acquitted of manslaughter. Jamar Clark was killed by Minneapolis officers in 2015, and charges were never brought.  All three incidents sparked large protest movements. It seems plausible that city officials hoped their decisive action would prevent mass protests in the middle of the pandemic, but thousands took to the streets. Demonstrators later smashed a police precinct door, and police used tear gas and non-lethal rounds, making it all but certain that these demonstrations will continue. Allegations of police brutality have been constantly highlighted since the start of the Black Lives Matter movement. It began after the acquittal of neighbourhood watchman George Zimmerman in the shooting death of African-American Trayvon Martin in February 2012. The deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson and Eric Garner in New York in 2014 sparked huge protests. "I can't breathe" became a national rallying cry as Garner, an unarmed black man, uttered the phrase 11 times after being detained by police in a chokehold on suspicion of illegally selling loose cigarettes. The New York City police officer involved in Garner's arrest was fired five years later, but no officer was charged. Recent allegations of police wrongdoing include the shooting of a black woman in her home in Louisville by three white Kentucky policemen and the shooting of a man by an officer in Maryland. Police in Georgia are also accused of trying to cover up the killing of black jogger, Ahmaud Arbery, allegedly by the son of a retired law official. Paige Fernandez of the American Civil Liberties Union, said of the latest case in Minnesota: "This tragic video shows how little meaningful change has emerged to prevent police from taking the lives of black people."Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window US President Donald Trump will sign an executive order targeting social media firms, the White House has said. It comes after he threatened to shut down social media platforms he accused of stifling conservative voices. The latest dispute emerged after Twitter added fact-check links to his tweets for the first time. The order's details have not been shared and it is unclear what regulatory steps the president can take without new laws passed by Congress. White House officials gave no further information on what is expected in the executive order which is set to be signed on Thursday. Before leaving Washington for Florida to watch a space launch that was postponed due to bad weather, Mr Trump again accused Twitter and other social media of bias, without offering evidence. Mr Trump also continued his criticism of social media platforms on Twitter, ending a tweet with: "Now they are going absolutely CRAZY. Stay Tuned!!!" The long-running dispute between Mr Trump and social media companies flared up again on Tuesday when one of his posts was given a fact-check label by Twitter for the first time. He had tweeted, without providing evidence: "There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent." Twitter added a warning label to the post and linked to a page that described the claims as "unsubstantiated". On Wednesday Mr Trump threatened to "strongly regulate" or even "close down" social media platforms. He tweeted to his more than 80 million followers that Republicans felt the platforms "totally silence conservatives" and that he would not allow this to happen. In an earlier tweet, he said that Twitter was "completely stifling free speech". Twitter's chief executive Jack Dorsey responded to criticism of the platform's fact-checking policies in a series of posts, saying: "We'll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally." Mr Trump wrote a similar post on Facebook about mail-in ballots on Tuesday, and no such warnings were applied. In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, Facebook's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said censoring a social media platform would not be the "right reflex" for a government concerned about censorship. Fox said it would play its full interview with Mr Zuckerberg on Thursday. Twitter has tightened its policies in recent years as it faced criticism that its hands-off approach was helping fake accounts and misinformation to thrive. Some of America's biggest technology companies have also been accused of anti-competitive practices and violating their users' privacy. Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon face antitrust probes by federal and state authorities and a US congressional panel. Shares in both Twitter and Facebook fell in Wednesday's trading session in New York. Facebook, Twitter and Google did not immediately reply to requests from the BBC for comment.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Hundreds of fake or hijacked social media accounts have been pushing pro-Chinese government messages about the coronavirus pandemic on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, a BBC investigation has found. The network of more than 1,200 accounts has been amplifying negative messages about those critical of China's handling of the outbreak, while praising Beijing's response. Although there is no definitive evidence that this network is linked to the Chinese government, it does display features similar to a state-backed information operation originating in China that Facebook and Twitter removed last year.  The accounts uncovered by the BBC also share similarities with a resurgent pro-Chinese network spotted by the social media analytics firm Graphika earlier this year. Dubbed "Spamouflage Dragon", that network both pumped out political messages and targeted Chinese authorities' critics with spam.  China and the US have been involved in a war of words over the origin of Covid-19 and their response to it.  Government officials, senior politicians and media outlets in both countries have used traditional and social media to exchange accusations and unverified claims.  Having increased its activity over the past few months, the network uncovered by the BBC continues to grow and add new accounts. But despite posting content prolifically, it has relatively low impact. Many of the accounts failed to gain a significant following.  After BBC News reported its findings to all three social networks, the majority of the accounts, pages and channels were removed. At first look, "Joker1999" might look like any other account on Twitter - it has a profile photo, a short biography and it retweets messages about politics.  But upon closer inspection, it's clear the account is fake. Its profile image has been taken from a TikTok celebrity and, while it claims to be a blogger from Russia, the account tweets about politics mainly in Chinese. "Joker 1999" is one of hundreds of fake accounts amplifying Chinese government messages across Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. The majority were created between January and May this year.   The accounts criticise the US handling of the coronavirus outbreak, post negative messages about the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement and specifically target Guo Wengui, an exiled Chinese property tycoon in the US who has been an outspoken critic of the Chinese government, including for its handling of Covid-19.  Some accounts focus on only one topic while others post on a range of themes or go dormant and then switch topics. Chinese authorities have previously accused Mr Guo of financial crimes and rape, which he denies. He has business ties to Steve Bannon - President Donald Trump's former chief strategist - and he's behind a website that published unproven claims about the origin of the virus.  The BBC identified more than 1,000 Twitter accounts, 53 Facebook pages - with just under 100,000 combined followers - 61 Facebook accounts, and 187 YouTube channels with a total of around 10,000 subscribers. While not insignificant, the follower counts were nowhere near levels that would be considered highly influential.  On Twitter the network of automated accounts - otherwise known as "bots" - largely focused on criticising Mr Guo. They would retweet, like and comment on posts to attempt to make them trend, using tags such as #GuoWengui and his name in Chinese. Similar to "Joker1999", the accounts often used stolen or hijacked profiles of Russian speakers and featured fake profile pictures. Many of them were also created on the same day, a further clue indicating they are part of an automated network. On Facebook, the network focused strongly on the coronavirus pandemic and in particular on spreading criticism of the US handling of the outbreak, although some accounts also promoted negative messages about Mr Guo and the Hong Kong independence movement.  Although the network largely sprung up in early 2020, a few accounts also had a longer history, and posted criticism of anti-Chinese government protests in Hong Kong last summer.  The BBC found evidence that at least some of the Facebook pages and accounts originally belonged to users from Bangladesh before they were either hijacked or sold and repurposed to post in Chinese. These accounts had multiple personal pictures on their timelines, listed users predominantly from Bangladesh among their Facebook friends and sometimes even exchanged comments in Bengali on their timelines, before abruptly changing their language and identity overnight. A few accounts also used Russian or English names, although at times they confused genders, for instance using a male name alongside a female profile picture.  On YouTube, the network focused on videos about coronavirus fatalities in the US, and Mr Guo. Channels uploaded the exact same videos over a short period of time, liked and commented on each other's videos, and created playlists of their content. The network had a core of uploaders with dozens of videos, while some channels only uploaded one or two and mostly focused on boosting the videos of channels with more subscribers.  The operation was closely coordinated, with dozens of accounts posting the same memes and videos in Chinese and English multiple times, often within minutes of each other.  Some of the pages and accounts mixed highly political messages with softer content: animal videos, clips of video games, shots of Asian models, and pictures of nature and food. This mix was most likely an attempt to build large followings while hiding the coordinated and political nature of the main content. Even before most of its accounts were taken down, the network struggled to gain much traction outside of its bubble. Most engagements - shares, likes, retweets, comments, views and mentions - come from inside the network, rather than from genuine users. "In this case, it looks like the network is trying to generate a high volume of pro-Chinese government content, and then to hide it by surrounding it with spammy content," says Ben Nimmo, the director of investigations at Graphika.  The intention is to attract the attention of genuine users to the messaging, Mr Nimmo says, "but it's being done in an unsophisticated and relatively amateurish way".  He says the purpose of networks like this is to create the impression that a lot of social media users support a particular narrative or group; in this case, the Chinese government. "The problem is that this sort of large-scale frontal assault is too crude to convince many people. It is art imitating reality, but badly."  The set of accounts uncovered by the BBC appears to be a larger part of the "Spamouflage Dragon" network exposed by Graphika, Mr Nimmo said. "If it is the same network, it went through a batch of takedowns in autumn 2019, and there was another batch of takedowns this spring," he told BBC News. The network scaled down its activity late last year and mostly posted spam content in November, December and January. "It kicked into higher gear once the coronavirus outbreak became a major public relations problem for China," Mr Nimmo said. Despite the repeated takedowns, the network continued to create, buy or rent fake or hijacked accounts and repurpose them to post Chinese content, albeit at a lower rate than earlier in the year.  "This is a pattern we see with the more persistent threat actors: they keep trying to come back, but the repetitive effect of being exposed and taken down squeezes the space they have to operate in, and forces them to try to hide instead of trying to build an audience," Mr Nimmo said. A Twitter spokesperson told BBC News: "Platform manipulation is a violation of our policies and we will take strong enforcement action on any account engaging in these behaviours, regardless of the content they Tweet. If and when we can reliably attribute these permanently suspended accounts to a coordinated state-backed operation, we disclose all content to our public archive - the only such example in the industry." A Facebook spokesperson said: "We are grateful to the BBC for reporting these accounts and pages, the majority of which we had already removed under our inauthentic behaviour policies. We are investigating the remaining accounts."  A spokesperson for YouTube said: "As part of our ongoing efforts to combat coordinated influence operations, over the past several weeks we removed more than a thousand channels that violated our spam policies. Channels in these clusters behaved in a coordinated manner while primarily uploading spammy non-political content, although a small subset posted primarily Chinese-language political content, similar to those described in a recent Graphika report."

Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window It's an uncanny and almost tragically perfect piece of symmetry. The number of US servicemen and women killed in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan - over an aggregate 44 years of fighting - is almost exactly the same as the number of Americans who've now lost their lives to coronavirus in just three months of America's war against the hidden enemy, as Donald Trump likes to refer to Covid-19.  He also calls it the Chinese virus, but we'll come to that. Now I know you could replace the Covid-19 deaths with US cancer deaths or road crash victims and come up with similarly stark or perhaps even more dramatic statistics. But sadly, fatal car accidents and terminal tumours have always been with us. A global pandemic has not. And out of nowhere 100,000 American families are this spring mourning loved ones, whose lives have been cut short by this virus. 1.5m Americans have been infected. Many millions more have lost their jobs. One of Donald Trump's first acts when he moved into the Oval Office in 2017, was to restore to a central position the bust of Winston Churchill that Barack Obama had moved out in favour of a bronze of Martin Luther King Jr.  And in this fight against coronavirus, Donald Trump does see himself as a war leader; the property tycoon who could work a shovel on a Manhattan building site was also going to be shown to be a man of destiny -  the untried field-marshal, with a baton in his knapsack ready to command the troops to get the job done. But also keeping the home fires burning, and lifting the morale of a frightened nation. It has all been far more jagged than that.  Donald Trump is not imbued with the gift of soaring Churchillian rhetoric; there have been no "we shall fight them on the beaches" moments. Nor has he conjured the Rooseveltian calm when delivering one of his fireside chats. There have been days of infamy, but they have been invariably generated by things that the president has said, rather than what has been done to the United States.  And anyway, for a self-styled war leader he must at least face the charge of ignoring the warnings about the enemy he was confronting in the early stages, appearing more Neville Chamberlain than Winston Churchill. Korean War (1950-1953): 36,500 Vietnam War (1961-1975): 58,000 Iraq War (2003-2011): 4,500 Afghanistan (2001-today): 2,000 Covid-19 (Feb 2020- today): 100,000 The initial period of the US effort against the virus was marked by one significant action in late January, when the president stopped non-American visitors from China entering the United States. That was smart and decisive (although some have argued, to my mind unfairly, that Trump should have stopped anyone and everyone coming from China). But any tactical advantage that had given the administration was squandered in February where there was a month of inaction and incompetence.  Attempts to roll out testing were woeful (the president was badly let down by the Centers for Disease Control). Procurement of PPE was weak. The federal emergency stockpile of vital equipment was like Old Mother Hubbard's cupboard: bare. The president had also disbanded the entire global-health-security unit of the National Security Council. He also eliminated the US government's $30m (£23m) Complex Crises Fund. These were decisions that badly undermined the American ability to counter the disease.  All while he was on a determined mission to tell America that this thing from China was no biggie, and certainly was not going to upend the economy - the centrepiece of his strategy for re-election in November.  It is worth just going through the president's quotes from these critical few weeks.  Jan 22: "It's one person coming in from China and we have it under control. It's going to be just fine." Feb 2: "We pretty much shut it down coming in from China." Feb 10: "Looks like by April, you know, in theory, when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away. I hope that's true. But we're doing great in our country. China, I spoke with President Xi, and they're working very, very hard. And I think it's going to all work out fine." Feb 11: "In our country, we only have, basically, 12 cases and most of those people are recovering and some cases fully recovered. So it's actually less." Feb 24: "The coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC and World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock market starting to look very good to me!" Feb 26: "When you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that's a pretty good job we've done." Crisis? What crisis?  But in March the contours became clearer, and it was not pretty. The news was all grim. Because of a lack of testing, there had been extensive community transmission - people were coming down with coronavirus, but it wasn't clear where they'd contracted it, who they'd caught it from, how they'd got it. The "track and trace" (the language of coronavirus that we've all now become so familiar with) was now impossible.  Although the first reported outbreak was out on the West Coast in Washington state, Covid-19 was playing a mean sleight of hand on us all. This pesky virus got us to look in one direction, when we really should have been focused on the other. Where Covid-19 was really letting rip was on the East Coast, especially in the biggest, richest and most densely populated city in the US, New York, with devastating consequences.  If the city was quickly to become the most worrying centre of the outbreak, the borough of Queens became the epicentre of the epicentre - the district where Donald Trump had grown up. And the visuals from there drove home to Americans - and to the president - the scale of the unfolding disaster. At Elmhurst Hospital, refrigerated container lorries were parked to store bodies that the morgue had no way of dealing with. I interviewed a young doctor from there at the height of the pandemic who painted a harrowing picture of daily life and death.  In the richest city of the wealthiest country on the planet, we saw nurses heading into intensive care units to treat Covid patients wearing bin liners as PPE, because that is all they had. We saw the ER consultant putting on his ski goggles to examine a patient, because the hospital didn't have the right face masks. We saw mass graves being dug on a small island in the Bronx to accommodate all those who'd died with no next of kin, or with no money for a funeral. Like the inscription on the tomb of the unknown soldiers in the Commonwealth war graves: "known unto God".  America, this all-mighty superpower, with enough weaponry to blow the planet to smithereens many times over, was looking ragged and not in control of events in its own backyard. It's hard to see this chapter of America's story going down as another moment of this nation's greatness. If Queens is where Donald Trump grew up, Manhattan is where he made his money - and nothing says money like Wall Street, the pulse and oxygen monitor of the US economy. And the president likes to stand over its bed to take its vitals hourly. But as it became clear that the US economy was going to have to shut down, so the Dow Jones index went diving downwards - vertiginous drops, causing circuit-breakers to kick in, and causing the president and his advisers to fret that his whole re-election strategy had gone up in flames.  But then the precipitous falls would be followed by dizzying rises as word came from Capitol Hill that lawmakers might be close to some agreement to inject gazillions into the cryogenically frozen economy.  More than 25,000 of the deaths have come from New York state, and Governor Andrew Cuomo became coronavirus's first political superstar. His daily factual and highly detailed presentation of what was happening, where it was happening, what was being done to mitigate, and what still needed to be done, became appointment-to-view television across the US. Cometh the hour and all that. This lifelong Democrat - who also grew up in Queens - was drawing admiring glances from a lot of Republicans, and with many Democrats quietly thinking: "I wish he was our candidate for president in November, and not Joe Biden." Like an old-fashioned newspaper, he delineated clearly what was fact and what was opinion. In the space of 45 highly polished minutes he would deliver the news stories of New York's descent into the abyss, and then give you his op-ed column. He admitted his response wasn't perfect, acknowledging he could have acted earlier. And he also gave praise to Donald Trump where he thought it was due; he tweaked the tail of the administration when he thought it needed a bit of a kicking. At around the same time as Cuomo was capturing the nation's attention, Donald Trump decided he would go daily with a White House briefing too. It is hard to overstate how much Donald Trump loves - and needs - the roar of the crowd. Governing is dull. Campaigning - and the adoration from his rallies - is what gives him energy. It's what gets his heart pumping and the blood circulating. And because of the lockdown, here was a president who was deprived of the two things he yearns for most - a day out playing golf, and an evening rally addressing raucous, loving crowds. There were also no heads of states visiting him, where the cameras would record his thoughts on whatever was the subject du jour. He was being starved of the oxygen of publicity, and so daily to the briefing room he would come, with us reporters playing the most unlikely role as his ventilator. Being intubated to a bunch of journalists he's never trusted was never going to end well.   Vice President Mike Pence had been given the task of heading the coronavirus taskforce. A poisoned chalice it may have been, but it's a task he's performed with aplomb. He is across the detail of everything, and was the perfect link person between the different branches of government and the White House; between the different branches of government and the governors of the 50 states. And two other things he did with considerable deftness. He never forgot to praise the president to the hilt, saluting him for his leadership. Woe betide you if you don't. And he never forgets to display empathy - talking about the suffering of the American people, expressing condolences to those who'd lost loved ones. That is something that came easily to Mr Pence and is something Donald Trump hardly ever does.  Though there would be a revolving cast of characters in the briefing room - the two other stalwarts were Dr Anthony Fauci, the independent-minded head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr Deborah Birx, who used to head the fight against Aids for the Obama administration, and was made the coronavirus response co-ordinator. These were the scientists who wanted to ensure that the judgements the president made were evidence based. They had limited success.   No sooner had the US economy gone into shutdown than other, more business-minded voices were in Donald Trump's other ear telling him that the remedy his doctors were prescribing was worse than the disease. Let people go back to work. Reopen the economy. The loss of jobs, the recession, depression, the devastation of the US economy will be worse than the death toll. And you could see where the president's sympathies lay. First he advocated that the US should reopen by Easter, with churches packed. Only to have that kyboshed by doctors Birx and Fauci. When asked about this Dr Fauci gave an object lesson in disagreeing with the president without disagreeing: "You don't set the timeline, the virus does," he told reporters. Masterful. But the impetus to reopen became overwhelming. The jobless totals were soaring, and Donald Trump saw his "strong economy" election strategy disappearing down the plug-hole.  And all the while the death toll was mounting, ever, ever higher. What started as a trickle at the end of February became a gradual flow. The gradual flow then became a steady stream. And by late April the stream became a torrent.  Coronavirus was indiscriminating about who it infected, but selective with who it killed. The statistics were striking - if you were black or Latino you were much more likely to die. Longstanding health inequalities came to the fore. If you'd grown up in an impoverished background, you were more likely to have the pre-existing conditions - the co-morbidities, as they say in the US - that would prove so deadly with coronavirus: hypertension, diabetes, obesity, heart disease. And if you live in densely packed, multi-generational households, and work in factories or meat-packing plants where social distancing is impossible, then - surprise, surprise - you're more likely to contract the disease.  The US Surgeon General, Admiral Jerome Adams - himself African American - addressed this directly, and spoke powerfully about it. But he seemed to pay a price for doing so - he was not seen again at another White House news conference. Someone must have taken exception to what he said. The president's own erratic performances at these briefings were coming to be seen as counterproductive by Republican strategists. The president's poll numbers were going down. I was at a couple of the most extraordinary briefings. There was the one where the president made it all about himself. His staff had produced a lengthy campaign style video detailing how brilliantly he'd handled the outbreak - for the first 45 minutes of this over two-hour-long news conference, Donald Trump spoke about himself. He spoke about how unfair the media was to him. It was "poor me". Not once in those first 45 minutes did he talk about those who'd died, nor about those who'd been infected. Nor about the millions who were fretting about how they were going to pay the bills having lost their jobs. I was also at the briefing where the president spoke about injecting disinfectant to treat coronavirus. Dr Birx, who was sitting at the side of the briefing room, looked like she was in some kind of gastric agony as she listened to the president, but never felt she had the space to stand up and say: "This is dangerous nonsense." His performance was lampooned and ridiculed.  But as the criticism piled up against the president, so Donald Trump bristled.  And there were two culprits who'd be forced onto the perp walk of shame. The first was China. Despite his early praise for President Xi, China was now in Donald Trump's cross-hairs. China had lied and covered up. This was the Wuhan flu, the city where the outbreak originated. The Chinese had taken actions to protect themselves, but not anyone else. Worse still in Donald Trump's eyes, China had intimidated the World Health Organization, and its weak, pusillanimous leadership had allowed itself to be cowed by Beijing, and therefore had failed to warn the world sufficiently of the dangers that this new strain of virus presented. In this, sure, there was blame shifting - but President Trump had a point, both about shortcomings of the WHO, and the candour of the Chinese leadership.  All of this fired up the Trump base, but it was as nothing compared with the president shifting firmly in favour of reopening the US economy. Wild demonstrations sprang up - particularly in Democrat-run states, which the president did nothing to tamp down. In California, surfer dudes, backed by libertarian Republicans and small business owners, protested at beachside locations in a bizarre Baywatch meets the Tea Party moment. In Michigan, heavily armed men carrying assault rifles and dressed as though they were auditioning as extras for a movie about mercenaries laid siege to the State House.  A public health emergency, with a virus that is no respecter of whether you are a Democrat or Republican, Trump lover or Trump hater, had divided and bitterly polarised the country. Like everything else.  If you want the country to reopen you're with Trump (broadly); if you're wary about reopening too soon you're a Dem (broadly). If you love the fact that the president has ignored the advice of the Food and Drug Administration over the dangers of hydroxychloroquine, and decided to take it anyway, then you are firmly in his camp.  And although the president has publicly stated that everyone ought to wear a mask, the fact that he chooses not to is taken as a clear dog-whistle to his supporters that you really don't have to. In the face - so to speak - of all medical advice, the mask is being seen by some as an act of provocation, a symbol of the nanny state.  Shopkeepers who insist that customers wear a mask are being intimidated by thuggish gangs patrolling outside their premises. It is grotesque. They are being ripped up and destroyed as though a symbol of oppression by the "Deep State", rather than a small effort to halt the spread of the disease. Our film crews have been jostled and abused for wearing face masks while filming these protesters. Needless to say, these people are no respecters of social distancing.  And now that America has reached this grim milestone of 100,000 dead, what of the future?  In public opinion there does seem to be a battle going on between head versus heart. Science pitted against gut instinct. The role of the state against the rights of the individual.  If a phone app that can track and trace your movements is the vital tool to prevent a second wave of the virus, it relies on a sizeable majority of the population handing over their personal data for it to be effective. Will that happen? In a country whose founding fathers fretted about the dangers of the state becoming too mighty, I just cannot see it (and this goes far wider than pro- and anti-Trump). And what if, please God, an effective vaccine is found? You can be sure that the anti-vaxx brigade (and remember Donald Trump was once one of its advocates) will be out in force, stirring up doubts about the science, the medicine, the state, Big Brother, you name it.  Donald Trump has boasted repeatedly in the past couple of months that no country has done more coronavirus testing that then USA. "It's not even close," he says. No country has built more ventilators or supplied so much PPE to its front-line workers, he says. The president has claimed that other world leaders are jealous of what the US has managed to achieve. Really? Germany, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, Greece: envious?  Hard to believe somehow.  No country has had more deaths, more infections. Anywhere else, so far, is not even close.Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Two days after the US recorded its first case of coronavirus, Donald Trump said the situation was "totally under control" and assured the public it was "going to be just fine".  Fast forward four months and the virus has spread across all 50 states, leaving a death toll of 100,000 from more than 1.6 million confirmed cases.  We've taken a look at how those figures compare to other countries around the world and how the situation could develop over the next few months.  The death toll in the US became the highest in the world in early April and has risen dramatically since then.  President Donald Trump initially said "50 to 60,000" people could die during the outbreak but in May he said he was hopeful the toll would be lower than 100,000. That benchmark has now been hit though and there are still about 1,000 deaths a day on average.  Rather than focus on deaths, Mr Trump has preferred to cite the mortality rate - that is the number of people that have died relative to the country's population - as evidence that the US has dealt with the virus more effectively than some other nations. The chart below shows the countries with the highest death tolls and, to the right, their mortality rate. You can see that by that measure there are several countries where a greater proportion of the population has died during the coronavirus outbreak.  Belgium, with a population of 11.5 million, has seen 82 people in every 100,000 die during its coronavirus outbreak while the US, with a population of around 330 million, has seen nearly 30 people in every 100,000 die.  But if you look at New York - the worst-hit state in the US - the mortality rate there is close to 150 people in every 100,000, which shows that there is a lot of variation across the US.  One of the problems with comparing countries is that many of them report deaths in different ways. Belgium, for instance, includes deaths where coronavirus was suspected of being present but was never confirmed with a test. Some US states record deaths this way, but not all.  There have also been questions over whether official data from some countries can be trusted. Critics of China in particular have accused it of under-reporting the scale of its outbreak.  Another issue is that countries could be at different stages of an outbreak. In many European countries it's clear that daily cases numbers are coming down significantly and they are past the peak. But you can't say the same for the US at the moment.  Several countries in Europe had outbreaks around the same time as the US and all of them have seen the number of deaths grow quickly, peak and then fall away. The US has not.  One of the reasons the number of daily deaths in the US has plateaued rather than fallen is the sheer size of the country - rather than one large outbreak, there have been multiple centres of infection that developed at different times and spread at different rates.  In New York, the virus struck early, spread quickly and peaked in early April. In the rest of the US, however, the number of daily deaths has been slow to fall. Some other states that were badly affected early on, like Louisiana and Michigan, have also seen a substantial drop in the number of daily deaths like that in New York. But as the situation in those states has improved, others have worsened. About a third of all states saw more deaths last week compared to the week before, with Rhode Island, Mississippi and Ohio seeing some of the largest percentage increases.  In recent weeks, President Trump has been keen to talk about the number of tests being done in the US. The most recent data says the US has carried out about 15 million so far.  That figure puts the US way ahead of other countries, but when it comes to using testing to try to control the virus, there is more to it than the total number you've conducted. Countries that did a lot of testing early in the pandemic, and followed it up by tracing the contacts of anyone who was infected, have been most successful in slowing the spread.  In South Korea, for example, they ramped up testing early on in the outbreak and managed to contain the virus. Less than 300 people have died with coronavirus in the country, which has a population of about 50 million.  But as the chart above shows, it wasn't until several weeks after the first death in the US that officials really stepped up testing.  The top US health official for infectious diseases, Anthony Fauci, admitted in early March that the testing system was "currently failing" and that the US was not able to supply tests "easily, the way people in other countries are doing it". The number of daily tests shows the US is well past those initial problems, but progress can still be made. If the 15m figure is accurate, that would still only be 4.5% of the population.  The death toll is still rising, albeit at a slower rate, and one model that has been cited by the White House predicts it could be at nearly 150,000 by August - although its projections have come in low in the past.  One of the issues with making projections is that no one is quite sure what effect the gradual reopening of the US economy will have on the spread of the virus. At one point, more than 90% of the US population was under mandatory lockdown orders, but the majority of states have now begun to loosen their stay-at-home restrictions. The White House has outlined a set of criteria for states to meet before they begin reopening, including seeing a downward trajectory of case numbers for two weeks. But a group of public health experts say only a couple of states are hitting the targets.  Dr Fauci has warned states that they will see "little spikes that might turn into outbreaks" if they reopen before getting the virus under control.  But his advice has contradicted that of President Trump, who is keen to get the US economy restarted ahead of his re-election campaign. The latest figures show that nearly a quarter of the American workforce have lost their jobs since the outbreak began.  Asked earlier this month whether lives would be lost to reopen the country, Mr Trump said: "Will some people be affected badly? Yes. But we have to get our country opened and we have to get it open soon." Even if states continue to ease restrictions, it's unclear whether the American public will be eager to return to shops and restaurants just yet. A recent poll by the Pew Research Center found that 70% of Americans were concerned that states would reopen too quickly.
